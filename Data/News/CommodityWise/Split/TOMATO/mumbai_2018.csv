But meet Naina Siwach from Mumbai, who by her own confession, is a digital nomad. Planning, she says, is the key to making your travel dreams come true. In her 30s now, this former VP of a national PR company in Mumbai who is now 'location independent' and has chosen to become a consultant digital strategist and moved to Bali, Indonesia, in December 2017 as she feels the new job will help her travel yet work for a living. While many of us got inspired to spend at least two days at the La Tomatina Festival after watching Laila and Arjun fall in love with each other amidst the squishy tomatoes in Spain in the epic 2011 Bollywood movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, this girl actually managed to ring in her 30th birthday in Spain at the fest. ""Ever since I turned 21, I've managed to visit more than 30 countries and I hope to have 50 stampings in my passport before I turn 40."" she says. Naina was at The Philippines for her birthday in 2017 and she says she loves to do it the local style. Her holidays are dotted with archery, height ziplining, surfing, snorkeling, deep sea diving and more. She loves to hang out with the locals, eat like them and even rent a little studio apartment for herself when she travels. We ask her how she manages to do all of this and how to plan to explore the world. Excerpts from a conversation with this true blue nomadWhen did you start travelling solo?I ventured on my first solo travel at the rebellious age of 18, as a birthday gift to myself. I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and explore unchartered territories. The first trip was to Europe where I travelled for 30 days and it felt like the best 30 days of my life. Every day, I learnt the value of being true to myself and appreciating my moments of solitude. It changed me as a person and restored a newfound sense of independence within me. I understood how to adapt to different cultures, cuisines, languages and of course, money conversions most importantly. Every solo trip has enhanced the quality of my peace and happiness.What is it in solo travel that keeps you going again and again?Every solo trip has helped me grow and evolve as a person. It is an ideal stress buster and enables me to truly appreciate the value of my freedom and Independence and to be a better human being. It fills my soul with tranquillity. It is what I do to recover from life's many unpredictable blows, so I may refresh and rejuvenate myself and go back to face anything that comes my way with renewed energy. In a land where you meet new people, you realise you a mere speck in this vast diverse world. Taking yearly solo trips has been essential in teaching me to expand my boundaries and help me take a step back in my own life to appreciate the things I have been blessed with.How does one realise their dream of travelling the world while still holding a fulltime (often demanding) job?First earn well and save well ( a few lakhs in Indian Rupee to take care of emergencies). Then choose a job which allows you to work remotely. With the advent of mobile technology and superfast broadband and many companies also giving the remote work options, it is easier to find jobs in the new age economy. For instance, I was previously based in Mumbai and used to work fulltime as the Vice President of the luxury segment of a PR company. But now, thanks to my quest for travel, I travel wherever I want but to using my high end laptop and a super fast internet connection (luckily Bali has a good one), I work as a digital strategist for global brands. My work involves planning digital campaigns and promotions. So if your travel quest gets the better of you, this is the best way to go about life and your dreams.What are the three tips for Indian solo travellers to stay safe?During one of my solo trips to Amsterdam a few years ago, I recall feeling completely vulnerable and alone. Nonetheless, I decided to step outside my hostel and check out their famous Dutch apple pie cafe. My recommendation would be to step out of your fear zone and explore the city and trust me, this will redefine your definition of freedom. You can thank me later. The hacks that keep me safe or sorted are:- To blend in and dress like one of the locals.- Carry a dummy wallet. I keep my money and cards in my inner garments. So in case, anyone attempts to rob you, only the dummy wallet is lost.- Pepper spray is not allowed in air travel. So you can carry a mosquito spray or miniature hair spray if possible. That works too, in case of emergency to at least stump the intruder.- Pick Airbnb and hostels that have maximum reviews and are centrally located.- It is preferable to leave the DND sign on your door before leaving the hotel room.- Do not trust people easily. Stay alert and vigilant.Is there any process you follow on how you decide your next destination?Birthdays are special days and I want the best stuff those days. So for the last five years, I have made a pact to myself - to break boundaries and travel far and wide. As an avid traveller who uses almost every long weekend for some sort of travel (I started 2018 with the Thrissur Snake Boat Race festival), I have several exotic and unexplored destinations to discover. I am a thalassophile - a sea lover. The ebb and tide of the waves lull me into a new world whenever I play on the beach. So naturally, my travel is research-oriented and usually around beaches. I am an adventure freak so activities such surfing, diving and snorkelling with intriguing culture blends interest me. I celebrated my birthday in Balinese tradition in 2017.Share three travel hacks.Ans: Always make sure to inform your bank about the country you intend to visit along with the duration. Make sure you are familiar with the conversions and costs. Keep the emergency number of the bank in handy in case you lose your cards without fail.What are the destinations in your bucket list?There are three destinations and experiences I wish to complete before 2020 which are as follows:- I want to attempt the Lava Surf in Hawaii. It is said to be extremely dangerous, however, I wish to experience the thrill to ride waves on fire!- I want to walk through the magnificent Amazon rainforest. The starting point would be from Bolivia. This is an experience of a lifetime and I would recommend the same to all the solo travellers across the world.- I would like to travel across Japan for about four months during the Cherry blossom season. It begins to bloom in Okinawa, passes through the middle of Japan and finishes with a late bloom in northern Hokkaido.Ideally how much budget should a single Indian set aside for a week's travel abroad.. not too much luxury but not too much of a shoestring.. economy.It would depend on the destination. I wouldnt recommend Europe or USA for a week. The tickets are expensive and to justify that cost, you need to spend at least two to three weeks. If you want to go abroad for a week, I would recommend The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand Islands, Cambodia and Vietnam. You can work within Rs 1.5 lakh including tickets, visa, stay, meal and intercity travel. If you are a shopaholic, then I recommend you downsize your credit limit to 50K so you dont splurge. However, avoid malls. Always visit flea markets and vintage storesWhat websites/ apps to plan your travel do you recommend?- TripIt - saves my travel itinerary, while the alerts are like my best travel buddies.- Airbnb for homestay.- Hostel World for any hostel bookings.- CityMapper - for any help in understanding local transport.- Google translate are my Go to apps as required.Any tips on snagging the best foreign travel dealsPlan in advance. Think glocal, spend on local (stuff).5 things I learnt living as digital nomad1. You get to meet the most incredible human beings on similar journeys.2. Bittersweet farewells become a happy part of your nomadic life.3. You find an abundance of love, hope, gratitude and comfort even from the most unexpected lands and cultures.4.

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App","exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies.

He says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein April and then quit farming. Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver.

Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said.","sudam khandbahale, a 46-year-old farmer from mahirawani village in maharashtras nasik district, 167 km from mumbai, hacked down his one-acre grape vineyard this month, frustrated that the plantation hadnt borne fruit for the second year in a row.khandbahales vineyard was hit by cyclone ockhi last year, turning his rs 3 lakh investment to dust. he says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein april and then quit farming. year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. farming is all that i know but it is no longer viable. i will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but i wont farm anymore, said khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.in june last year, khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. one of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.as supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister devendra fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. in nasik and ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.bowing to pressure the maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last june. farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in june 2017 rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. this includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to june 2016 the scheme had three components  besides the rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in june 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. this includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to june 2016had three components  besides the rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were the loan waiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameter the system was hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with aadhaar accounts more than rs 1.5 lakh and a cash incentive of rs 25,000 for those who repaid loans on timewaiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameterwas hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with aadhaar accounts so far, the government has disbursed rs 13,580 crore to 3.532 million farmers accounts; 7.7 million farmers applied for the loan waiver and around 4.652 million were found eligible for the various components. out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. another rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.khandbahale owes rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in nasik. he can benefit from the rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. i dont have rs 7 lakh in hand, why would i keep incurring more debt if i had the money?

Prices that week dipped to Rs 200 a quintal in Nashik.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Narayangaon-based Vegetable Growers Association of India, said vegetable prices will remain depressed through the coming summer owing to increased farm area under vegetables. The rains were good, and the water table has improved, so many farmers go in for vegetables expecting good prices in the summer season, he said.Until four or five years back, the pockets around Narayangaon and Nashik used to supply a large percentage of the states tomatoes, he said. But now production is coming in from all corners of the state. Whether its Aurangabad or Beed or elsewhere, local tomatoes are now available in plenty.The promise of better access to processing industries has not borne fruit for vegetable farmers  the capacity of processing industries is barely 2 to 3 per cent of the crop, according to Gadhave.

So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project and five more will be operational by next month. Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. Last years budget announced a Rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, Hussain added.","a nursery at the horticulture centre of excellence in karnal, haryana. so far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the indo-israeli agriculture project and five more will be operational by next month. photo: israel embassynew delhi: india and israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old indo-israeli agriculture project (iiap) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in maharashtra and demonstrating to indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.for a country like israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for india, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.so, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. the implementing partners for the project are the national horticulture mission (nhm) under the agriculture ministry, mashav, israels agency for international development cooperation, and indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.our goal is to help the indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said dan alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at mashav, delhi.there is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, alluf said, adding, each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. a unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.so far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. notable among these are centres for vegetables in karnal, haryana, for mangoes in dapoli and for citrus fruits in nagpur, both in maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in bassi, rajasthan.among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.following prime minister narendra modis visit to israel in july last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.according to a mashav document, vegetable intervention in haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said alluf.one of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a niti aayog concept paper released in october last year.however, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in india, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.in states which are water-stressed such as maharashtra, karnataka, telangana and gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said siraj hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the delhi-based indian council for research on international economic relations.the centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. last years budget announced a rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, hussain added."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood.

With the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the Centre included in the Union Budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged Rs 500 crore to Operation Greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.Data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers. Data from the 70th round of Land and Livestock Holdings Survey of the NSSO indicates that 58.4% of rural Dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. Landlessness is particularly severe among Dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where more than 85% of Dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. More than 60% of Dalit households are landless in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. The Socio Economic and Caste Census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.Apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the Gandhian Bhoodan movement pioneered by Vinoba Bhave in Telangana in the 1950s and by Left governments in West Bengal and Kerala, and to some extent the National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.Of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless Dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. It is not in agricultural alone that the Dalits have been short-changed. They are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. The States role in fighting this inequality is crucial. But with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in India are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty.","seven decades after independence, while a majority of farmers cultivate their own land (however small their holdings may be), most dalit farmers in much of india are daily wagers, according to data released recently by the census of india. with the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the centre included in the union budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged rs 500 crore to operation greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.data shows that 71% of scheduled caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. that figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for scheduled tribe farmers and 41% for non-sc/st farmers. data from the 70th round of land and livestock holdings survey of the nsso indicates that 58.4% of rural dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. landlessness is particularly severe among dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as haryana, punjab and bihar, where more than 85% of dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. more than 60% of dalit households are landless in tamil nadu, gujarat, kerala, west bengal, maharashtra, andhra pradesh, and odisha. the socio economic and caste census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the gandhian bhoodan movement pioneered by vinoba bhave in telangana in the 1950s and by left governments in west bengal and kerala, and to some extent the national conference government in jammu and kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. it is not in agricultural alone that the dalits have been short-changed. they are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. the states role in fighting this inequality is crucial. but with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in india are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty."

A misal-pav stall run by the Tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. From selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the Tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. Elar Tellis, popularly known as Michael, came to Mumbai from his native Mangalore 45 years ago. Starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at Sarvodaya Nagar in Mulund West unfolds at night. The joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.I had a tea stall in Mangalore, but as I didnt earn enough for my family, I came to Mumbai when I was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. I initially started working at stalls at the Andheri railway station and later, worked at Bandra. But I always wanted to have my own business, Michael said. He then started selling tea in Mulund along with his two younger brothers.After working with others for five years, I learnt how to run a business in Mumbai, so I started my own and got my two brothers Marshal and Xavier on board, said Michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of Mulund from a forest area to a residential one.I would start selling tea at 4 am as I was told that in Mumbai, I would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. However, I didnt earn much by selling tea. We then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. He drove during night hours and I would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.With a loan to repay, Michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. In the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled Michael. However, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.Michaels son Santosh Tellis said: My father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. Then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. During the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. But, after Ganesh Chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. People would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across Mulund. Since then, the Tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.Michael and Santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. I have to sleep early at night so that I can wake up early, following which I have to report to my job at 10 am. As my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said Santosh.The midnight misal is served at Rs 40 per plate with two pavs. The stall also sells taripav at Rs 10 per piece. They attract customers from Ghatkopar, Powai, Thane, Bhandup and Airoli. In taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said Santosh. Between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.A resident of Mulund, Varun Ghatani, said: My personal favourite is taripav, and whenever I go out with my friends for night-outs, I see to it that I visit Michael and eat taripav.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App","residents of mulund know what to do about hunger pangs in the dead of the night. a misal-pav stall run by the tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. from selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. elar tellis, popularly known as michael, came to mumbai from his native mangalore 45 years ago. starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at sarvodaya nagar in mulund west unfolds at night. the joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.i had a tea stall in mangalore, but as i didnt earn enough for my family, i came to mumbai when i was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. i initially started working at stalls at the andheri railway station and later, worked at bandra. but i always wanted to have my own business, michael said. he then started selling tea in mulund along with his two younger brothers.after working with others for five years, i learnt how to run a business in mumbai, so i started my own and got my two brothers marshal and xavier on board, said michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of mulund from a forest area to a residential one.i would start selling tea at 4 am as i was told that in mumbai, i would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. however, i didnt earn much by selling tea. we then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. he drove during night hours and i would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.with a loan to repay, michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. in the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled michael. however, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.michaels son santosh tellis said: my father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. during the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. but, after ganesh chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. people would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across mulund. since then, the tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.michael and santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. i have to sleep early at night so that i can wake up early, following which i have to report to my job at 10 am. as my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said santosh.the midnight misal is served at rs 40 per plate with two pavs. the stall also sells taripav at rs 10 per piece. they attract customers from ghatkopar, powai, thane, bhandup and airoli. in taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said santosh. between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.a resident of mulund, varun ghatani, said: my personal favourite is taripav, and whenever i go out with my friends for night-outs, i see to it that i visit michael and eat taripav.for all the latest mumbai news, download indian express app"
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,,Hindustan Times,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said.","kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister arun jaitley on thursday said the national democratic alliance (nda) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.in his budget speech, jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (msps) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.this has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as maharashtra and madhya pradesh.jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. he said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. the government has decided to keep msp for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.the finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below msps, as was widely anticipated. such a scheme is already being implemented in madhya pradesh. he, instead, said that niti ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.the budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. the announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called c2 or a2 + fl  the government would adopt. jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.c2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. these are not part of the a2+fl, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.the crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionthe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said kiran vissa of the rythu swarajya vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. he said when pm narendra modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, msps were already giving higher returns than under modis tenure.in 2007, the ms swaminathan committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the bjps 2014 poll manifesto adopted. in the para containing the specific recommendation, the swaminathan report said msp should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. but in its annexure, the report used c2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.economist ashok gulati told ht that for rabi crops, the msp was closer towards 50% of costs. in wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. the real challenge is for kharif crops. in paddy, msps and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. if the government actually sets msps at 1.5 times the c2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.the budget announced a new scheme called operation greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. this would be similar to operation flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, jaitley said. two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted rs10,000.the budget also set a target of rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. various ministries will have rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.with a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from rs715 crore in 2017-18 to rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, jaitley said."

As Sawhney writes in the catalogue, she uses the conformity and mundaneness of her material to create a double illusion. Stacked together, individual staples create a formidable sculpture or structure. But should one staple fall out or move out of place, the whole edifice may come apart. This mirrors the tentativeness and the instability of existence, adds Allana.Sumedh Rajendrans mixed media collage on grey, robotic workers marching to office as if they were soldiers, add another strand  that of precarity of urban existence  to the exhibition.

5aeb09f19855b73f522c632c,Bengaluru: Veggies get pocket-friendly,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/19/bengaluru-veggies-get-pocket-friendly-1758226.html,2018-01-19,,The New Indian Express,"Ashwini M Sripad ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: With the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time.","ashwini m sripad byexpress news servicebengaluru: with the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. in karnataka, vegetable growers are more in kolar, bengaluru rural, chikballapur, chitradurga, ramanagara, mysuru, mandya, chamarajanagar, hassan and other places. with good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. the price of many vegetables has come around rs 20 per kilo which was more than rs 70 a few months back. while the tomato has declined to rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is rs 13 per kg, raddish is rs 18, snake gourd is rs 18, while beetroot and potato are rs 22 per kg, according to the horticultural producers cooperative marketing and processing society (hopcoms) price list.former additional director (fruits), dr s v hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. the lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.with this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. if there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. this is what has happened now, he said.citing an example, hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. but this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. if the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. in winter season, tomatoes normally grow. this year, growers in tamil nadu, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. this means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.people, vendors happyaruna, a resident of rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. even after buying so much, my bill was hardly d100. i was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. she said just a couple of months back, she used to spend d250 for the same quantity of vegetables. the vendors too are happy. carrot was d90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to d45. similarly, potato was d80 per kg and it has fallen to d22. people do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, rudresh, a vegetable vendor at vijayanagar said. another vendor, mahesh at shivajinagar, said customers are happy. we too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.from less supply to tomato glutaccording to deputy director of horticulture department chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. the price of tomatoes had reached d90 per kg. it was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. tomatoes need three months to grow. there was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. there is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. in summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

That waste has instead been used to produce 800kg of manure.Considering we are not a very large society and we do not fall under the specifications of the waste management rules to treat waste at source, we have still ended up doing it, as our vision is to be a green society and ensure we give something back to nature, said Satish Kini, managing committee member and resident in-charge of various green efforts at the society. In a city like Mumbai, which is facing both air and water pollution, we want to make our society a green haven for our children and senior citizens.Additionally, the society has diverted 2,200 kg of their dry waste since October from going to the landfills by segregating it and recycling. Only biomedical and non-recyclable waste is being collected by the civic body.In August last year, the residents reached out to Are you Reducing, Reusing, Recycling- RUR Greenlife, a social environment organisation, responsible for many similar projects across the city. After a series of workshops by the organisation, the residents began their decentralized and sustainable waste management within two months.Matroshree Pearl is an inspiring model green society, which has active enthusiastic participation by all residents towards care for the environment. It gives us hope for a greener future, said Monisha Narke, founder and CEO, RUR Greenlife.The society adopted a three-bin approach to segregation of biodegradable; dry recyclable and non-recyclable waste by using colour-coded bins and garbage bags to ensure higher level of segregation. The dry waste is further segregated through a seven bin approach into - cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, electronic waste, metal, glass, and tetrapak cartons. Residents sell some of the reusable dry waste to rag pickers and other recyclers for a nominal fee. The revenue generated from dry waste recycling is used to support the kitchen waste management project which making the activity a self-sufficient project, said Kini.November onward, the 4,000sqft terrace of the building was made home to an organic garden where residents grow spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, chili, ladyfinger, fenugreek, lemon grass and many other vegetables. Children from the society have been given a vegetable patch each and they are responsible for nurturing them.We have set up a drip irrigation system which uniformly provides water to each of these plantations, said Shireesh Kedare, resident and professor, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B).This is one society which has made best use of the circular economy model and benefitted the most out of it.

And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece. Available at Sapna Book House, RS Puram in Coimbatore, Nilgiris supermarket in Puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.Deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi","did you know over 2,500 wooden pencils can be created from a single tree? and to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer divya shetty, along with friend, vishnu vardhan, launched plantcil in october 2017.their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. we make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. we have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says shetty.if you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. at their manufacturing plant at avinashi (40 kms from coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. we make 6,000 pencils a day. there is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says vardhan.all things organichailing from an agricultural family in karnataka, shetty explains why she quit a career in it to helm two social enterprises. when i was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. i was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with vardhan at an it firm in bengaluru two years ago.it was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched indian superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with vardhan.for the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. we brought in 12 ngos and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says vardhan. in 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.fruity flavoursduring her interactions with farmers, shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. they kick-started plantcil in a rather innovative way. rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. we realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says vardhan.as the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent indian and chinese brands, shetty and vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.the classic pencils have indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. we procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. students can plant the pencil and water it. in a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says shetty. the rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. an attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. we source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. they are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.up nextthey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. costing rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. they are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.plans are also in place to launch an app, farm zeal, next month. it is aimed at educating people about organic farming. we will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. there will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in maharashtra, bengaluru and chennai.the pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at rs. 6 a piece. available at sapna book house, rs puram in coimbatore, nilgiris supermarket in puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi"
5b13ce969855b762ecebf9b3,In Odisha  schools are the dropouts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-odisha-schools-are-the-dropouts/article22476577.ece,2018-01-20,,The Hindu,"Doors closed:In contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of the residential schools are overcrowded. Shadin Menaka (sitting), a physically challenged tribal student, dropped out after the Sana Raisingh primary school closed down.Biswaranjan RoutBiswaranjan RoutIts a little past four in the afternoon, the time when schools ring their closing bells in the Hatsesikhal cluster of Odishas tribal-dominated Rayagada district. Just before Sekhal Primary School comes into view, a couple of students in blue uniforms cycle past on the concrete road that cuts through palm tree cultivations and paddy fields.Along the highway that connects the area to the district headquarters 15 km away are rows and rows of eucalyptus trees that feed JK Paper Mills manufacturing unit in the district.This particular school has been running since 1926. In 1987, it became a 40-seat residential school. As we enter the premises, students are busy sweeping the yard and classrooms. Some are watering the grounds with mugs filled from a large drum placed near a row of dysfunctional toilets.Hobsons choiceAt 81, the number of enrolled children is double the sanctioned strength. All the students in its hostel belong to the villages located in the four or five Gram Panchayats in the area. The schools apparent popularity is not due to its exceptional facilities. For most students, the fact that there are three teachers in this school, and they get three meals a day, makes up for the visible lack of infrastructure: three overcrowded classrooms for five classes, no dining hall or toilets, and a small row of damaged and abandoned rooms gaping at them dismally. But how could they possibly complain? The alternative  to stay on in their village schools  is far worse, and in any case about to disappear.Hostel superintendent Rabindra Kumar Majhi allows two Class 4 students, Santha Mandagi and Siddhanta Melaka, to accompany us to Ranaguda village, which is just a few kilometres away but not easy to access because of the Nagavali, one of southern Odishas major rivers that originates in Kalahandi district and flows into neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.As we wade gingerly across to the other bank, we realise we would be lost without the boys. Ranaguda is a 35-household Kondh tribe hamlet a couple of kilometres from the river. It has a primary school, but one with just two students. The teachers recently informed the villagers that the school will be closed down due to poor enrolment.RTE betrayedIn 2016-17, as many as 828 government primary and upper primary schools were shut down in Odisha for having less than 10 students each. Its less than a decade since the Indian government displayed some political will to achieve the goal of universal and equitable education by passing the Right to Education Act. But the failure, in practically all the States, of hundreds of government-run neighbourhood schools to even stay open betrays a lack of seriousness in implementing the RTE.In Odisha, the Ranaguda case is hardly the first instance of the State governments inability, and all too often, lack of will, to retain primary students in its neighbourhood schools. In 2014, 195 schools in the State with less than five students were served show-cause notices.In tribal areas like Rayagada and Kandhamal, which also have pockets subject to Maoist influence, the government seems to wilfully favour young children studying in residential schools, cut off from their families. Ostensibly, this is being done to make educational facilities available to those living in remote and conflict-ridden areas. The government even has special programmes to help children who missed out on early education, so that they can be mainstreamed into regular schools. But the fact remains that Ranaguda is 15-20 km away from the district headquarters, and the only reason the children here end up going to residential schools is that the local one doesnt function.This past year, the highest number of free government schools struck off the list, 124, is in the economically backward, though mineral-rich Rayagada district, followed by Kandhamal, which has lost 101 schools.The idea was to merge these erstwhile schools with a primary school located within a kilometres distance or an upper primary school within 3 km. The state would provide transport facilities or an escort if the distance is above the prescribed limit or the terrain difficult. According to Binodini Panda, district project coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, another 268 such schools have already been identified for closure in Rayagada, and are awaiting formal approval.Earlier this month, a circular issued by the OPEPA (Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority) to all district project coordinators appeared to provide some relief, as it stated that geographical barriers are valid grounds to consider re-opening schools. But Panda clarifies that so far as re-opening goes, there are no schools under consideration in Rayagada.The Ranaguda villagers, for their part, have appealed to the CRCC (Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator) to reverse the decision. About ten students will be ready to join primary school from the Anganwadi centre next year, they say. But even if the administration agrees, the reason for the low student strength is likely to continue.Gathered together outside one of the pucca houses built under the Indira Awaas Yojana scheme, the parents say that the two teachers hardly ever make the trek here and had last come two days before this reporters visit. Even the Anganwadi worker has been refusing to come here, they say. Complaints to the CRCC have proved futile. In frustration, the residents have been pulling the children out of the village school and sending them away to the nearest hostel schools for adivasi children.The majority of these kids are first generation students. Most of the Kui-speaking women in the village are also non-conversant in Odia, the medium of instruction in the schools. But the will to ensure at least elementary education to their children is high. The basic requirement, which they rightly demand, is the regular presence of teachers.Biju Kolaka is a student of Class 10. He is one of the few older students who continue to live in this village of small farmers, who grow vegetables like tomato, brinjal and chilli. He crosses the river on foot every day to reach school in Jemadeipentho. During the monsoon, when the river swells, it takes Kolaka an hour on bicycle to cross the bridge 10 km away and get to his school. Kolakas elder brother, though, has been sent to study at a residential high school in Rayagada city.The distrust of the education department is palpable. Even though staff strength is low, not in a single government school that we visited were all the appointed teachers present. The teachers in school had their attention divided between students of two or three classes, all sitting together in the same room. Sending students to residential schools is not uncommon here.Increasing cultural alienationThe preference for hostel schools is not from the parents side alone; it is a strategic decision on the part of the State in this fully Scheduled area with a low literacy rate. According to the 2011 Census, the rate of literacy among the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Odisha was 52.24% against the overall literacy rate of 72.87%.Among the communities living here, dependent mainly on agriculture for their livelihood, the SC & ST Development Department of Odisha states that improving educational facilities through residential institutions has been an identified thrust area.There are different categories of free schools it runs, from high schools to ashram schools for elementary education, sevashrams for primary education, and educational complexes for particularly vulnerable tribal groups. Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, a central government initiative, focusses on girl students from the SC, ST and OBC groups. Then there are institutions such as the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a private residential school in Bhubaneswar, which claims to provide free education to 27,000 ST children within its 80-acre campus, and has plans to open more such schools in 20 districts of Odisha.Social activists have expressed concerns that this strategy has been increasing a sense of cultural alienation among the students. They are forgetting their family culture and imbibing alien values. A child from a residential school is unable to cope with her village circumstances; he or she looks at it with disdain, has a sense of inferiority, and is always looking for a way out, says Vidhya Das, from the NGO Agragamee that works in 10 districts of Odisha.The current policy is similar to the setting up of residential schools for aboriginal children in Australia and Canada that started in the late 19th century, with assimilation the stated reason. The physical and emotional abuse faced by children removed from their homes, the denial of their cultural heritage and history, their subsequent demands for reparation, as well as the Canadian governments apology for the hardships they faced, are well documented.With the aim of ensuring that tribal children get their education in local schools, Agragamee has provided additional teachers conversant with the Kui language in 18 government primary schools in Rayagada district. They say that this has increased attendance. The education department also runs a similar programme of multilingual education. And yet, the emphasis on residential schools has gained momentum. Anasthesia Kerketa, assistant district education officer, points out that aside from 40 and 100-seat schools, there are now 500-seat ones too.Flourishing private schoolsIn contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of these residential schools are overcrowded. Gorakhpur High School, an ashram school in Kashipur block of Rayagada, has 1,050 students, of which 220 girls and 473 boys are in residence. The 15 teachers in residence here are well below the mandated student-pupil ratio. We end up admitting so many students due to political pressure, says the headmaster Pitambar Bhoi.Even as the government promotes residential schools, it has been unable to address the main issues that are driving students out of the government schools in their own locality: teacher shortage and teacher motivation.The primary school in Sana Raisingh village in Rayagada block closed a year ago. It used to have a single teacher who would come for just an hour a day, say the villagers. They have already petitioned the collector to reopen the school.When this school closed, the existing students dispersed, some to the closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. But three physically challenged ST children were left behind. Unable to walk properly, Shadin Menaka, Nimak Raja and Diksha Kolaka dropped out.Opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan programme. The hamlet includes both Kondh tribals as well as Telugu families belonging to the general category. Some of the latter started sending their children to a private, English-medium convent school in nearby Jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from Rs. 3,000. Unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. Theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to Vishakapatnam. So we dont want our children to walk to school. But if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says Virata Jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.Similar trendsThis is by no means an Odisha story alone. State governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. According to several media reports, Maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. Andhra Pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first States to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. Rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. With the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says Ambarish Rai, national convenor, RTE Forum.This is clearly the case in the Humma Gram Panchayat area of Odishas Ganjam district, which is also Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks home turf.In 2013, Ganjam was badly affected by Cyclone Phailin. The cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. The district, which has the highest proportion of SCs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. District education officer Sanatan Panda says that the migration of skilled workers to Surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. The proliferation of private schools is another reason.In Baunsiapada, a village of Dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. The village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. But the school had a short life. Since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in Gada Humma. According to the in-charge of the school, Lingaraj Mahankuda, only two of the nine students from Baunsiapada made it to Gada Humma.In 2013, when Mahankuda joined the Gada Humma school, it had 75 students. The number has since shrunk to 42. Educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. Prafulla Kumar Nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct Baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby Sri Sai Saraswati Vidhya Mandir. He considers it a better option for his son.Started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the Gada Humma government school. P. Ravindra Reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and Suresh Chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying Rs. 1,200-Rs. 1,800 annually.Run under the aegis of the RSS-backed Bharat Shiksha Vikash Sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. Aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.The State government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. Of the 11 blocks of Rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom Kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. Teachers, too, claim to be overworked.Battle to keep school openMahankuda of the Gada Humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. Shiksha Sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.Simanchak Pani, a Shiksha Sahayak at Gabudi primary school in Subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. In the meantime, he must make do with Rs. 6,000 per month. How is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.About six months ago, the villagers of Gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. They decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. Kailash Jena, a farmer, brought his son, Biswajit, back from Saraswati Shishu Mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. The school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.Several residents of the village (all of them non-SC/ST) have migrated to work in the Alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of Gujarat. As his neighbours laugh, Jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. An SC-ST village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. Clearly, Gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.Ambarish Rai,National convenor, RTE ForumA child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it

closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. but three physically challenged st children were left behind. unable to walk properly, shadin menaka, nimak raja and diksha kolaka dropped out.opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the swachh bharat abhiyan programme. the hamlet includes both kondh tribals as well as telugu families belonging to the general category. some of the latter started sending their children to a private, english-medium convent school in nearby jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from rs. 3,000. unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to vishakapatnam. so we dont want our children to walk to school. but if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says virata jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.similar trendsthis is by no means an odisha story alone. state governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. according to several media reports, maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. andhra pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first states to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.minimum rte norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. with the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says ambarish rai, national convenor, rte forum.this is clearly the case in the humma gram panchayat area of odishas ganjam district, which is also chief minister naveen patnaiks home turf.in 2013, ganjam was badly affected by cyclone phailin. the cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. the district, which has the highest proportion of scs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. district education officer sanatan panda says that the migration of skilled workers to surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. the proliferation of private schools is another reason.in baunsiapada, a village of dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. the village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. but the school had a short life. since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in gada humma. according to the in-charge of the school, lingaraj mahankuda, only two of the nine students from baunsiapada made it to gada humma.in 2013, when mahankuda joined the gada humma school, it had 75 students. the number has since shrunk to 42. educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. prafulla kumar nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby sri sai saraswati vidhya mandir. he considers it a better option for his son.started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the gada humma government school. p. ravindra reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and suresh chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying rs. 1,200-rs. 1,800 annually.run under the aegis of the rss-backed bharat shiksha vikash sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.the state government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. of the 11 blocks of rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. teachers, too, claim to be overworked.battle to keep school openmahankuda of the gada humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. shiksha sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.simanchak pani, a shiksha sahayak at gabudi primary school in subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. in the meantime, he must make do with rs. 6,000 per month. how is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.about six months ago, the villagers of gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. they decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. kailash jena, a farmer, brought his son, biswajit, back from saraswati shishu mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. the school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.several residents of the village (all of them non-sc/st) have migrated to work in the alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of gujarat. as his neighbours laugh, jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. an sc-st village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. clearly, gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.minimum rte norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.ambarish rai,national convenor, rte foruma child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it with disdain, have a sense of inferiority, and are always looking for a way out.vidhya das,ngo agragamee"

5b1423e49855b7624637d5b8,It’s time to reimagine South Asia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-time-to-reimagine-south-asia/article22938048.ece,2018-03-06,,The Hindu,"A few months ago, Anjum Altaf, former dean of the prestigious Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), wrote an article in the Dawn newspaper, making a strong case for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between Pakistan and India. He also gave a revealing example of how this has become impossible because of blind nationalism in Pakistan.At the time, he wrote, when tomatoes were selling for Rs300 a kilo in Lahore, they were available at Indian Rs40 a kilo in Amritsar a mere 30 miles away. But a visceral Indo-phobia, shared by many of our influentials, stood in the way of consumers benefiting from the lower priced supply. Many Pakistani politicians want nothing to be imported from India, the enemy nation.This kind of blind nationalism is by no means Pakistans monopoly. Those who watch Indian TV channels debating India-Pakistan relations routinely hear similar Pak-phobia. Result: despite being neighbours, India and Pakistan are among the least integrated nations in the world. Because of their unending mutual hostility, South Asia too has become the least integrated region in the world. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in a coma. Sadly, the most populous region in the world has also remained home to the largest number of poor people in the world.So near, so farA few striking examples will show how our two countries, which were part of a single seamless socio-economic and cultural entity before 1947, have now completely drifted apart. There are no direct flights between their capitals  New Delhi and Islamabad. The frequency of Delhi-Lahore and Mumbai-Karachi flights have become minimal. The Mumbai-Karachi ferry service (the two port cities, once part of a single province, are closer to each other than either Mumbai and Delhi or Karachi and Islamabad) was stopped after the 1965 war.In this age of information revolution, the number of phone calls between Indian and Pakistani citizens (including calls between close relatives of divided families) is negligible, mostly out of fear of being questioned by their respective security agencies. At less than $3 billion annually, trade with Pakistan accounts for a meagre 0.4% of Indias growing global commerce.Those who are happy with this status quo have set responses. On the Indian side, it will be said that terror and trade cannot go together. The Narendra Modi government has raised the bar higher  terror and talks cannot go together. On the Pakistani side, resolution of the Kashmir issue has become a precondition for any substantial bilateral cooperation.But is the status quo benefiting either country? The answer is obvious, except to those arrogant ultra-nationalists who think India now has a seat on the global high table and hence need not care for Pakistan, and to those narrow-minded Pakistani patriots who think they need not care for India since they now have two protectors  China and the Muslim Ummah.China, of course, has become a new factor influencing Indias negative attitude towards Pakistan, both among policy-makers and the common people. Our Army chief, General Bipin Rawats egregious remark last year about India being ready for a simultaneous two-and-a-half front war with Pakistan and China (the half front being our own alienated people in Kashmir) has helped solidify an impression that our two large neighbours can never be friendly towards India. If Indias foreign and defence policies proceed on this belief, South Asia is surely heading towards a future of intensified hostilities and conflicts. Arms manufacturers and distant destabilisers will profit by this at the cost of common Indians and Pakistanis, who need employment, education, health care and food-and-environmental security. These needs can be met only through regional cooperation, not regional rivalry.China, part of the solutionIn other words, can China become a part of the solution, rather than being perceived as a part of the India-Pakistan problem? A three-way India-China-Pakistan cooperation is not only necessary but indeed possible, and Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides a practical framework for such partnership. Unfortunately, Mr. Modi has allowed himself to be misled by his advisers on the BRI. The governments opposition to the BRI is based, among other things, on the myopic argument that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under the BRI, violates Indias sovereignty since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Not only does this argument hold no water but it also undermines Indias long-term development and security interests. First, CPEC does not recognise PoK to be Pakistans sovereign territory. Article VI in the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement clearly states in that after the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the sovereign authority concerned will reopen negotiations with the Government of the Peoples Republic of China.... Second, there is little possibility of India ever getting PoK, or Pakistan ever getting the Indian side of Kashmir, through war or by any other means. Therefore, connectivity, cooperation and economic integration are the only realistic bases for any future India-Pakistan settlement of the Kashmir dispute.Third, and most important, both China and Pakistan have stated that they are open to India joining CPEC. China has also expressed its readiness to rename CPEC suitably to both address Indias concerns and to reflect the projects expanded regional scope. Already, Iran, Afghanistan and several Central Asian republics have agreed to join this ambitious regional connectivity project. Will it help or hurt India if it joins this renamed initiative as an equal partner? Will it not connect Lahore and Amritsar (also Delhi and the rest of India), the two sides of Kashmir (which all Kashmir-based political parties want), Sindh and southern Punjab with Gujarat and Rajasthan, and Karachi with Mumbai?Interdependence vitalA no less seminal benefit for India is that by joining the renamed CPEC, it would gain land access, through Pakistan, to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and western China. And if our leaders show vision, ambition and resolve, the CPEC-plus-India can be linked to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor, thus creating a grand garland of connectivity and integration for the whole of South Asia. If 1947 divided our subcontinent, here is an opportunity for India, Pakistan and all other countries in the region to come together and rise in shared progress and prosperity.Regrettably, the same short-sighted advisers who have misled Mr. Modi on the BRI and CPEC are selling India the pipe dream of an alternative connectivity project by the Quadrilateral of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. This is unlikely to take off. Even if it does, its developmental benefits to India will be limited since it will seek to keep China and Pakistan out. We are also told that India does not need the CPEC since it has already partnered with Iran in building the Chabahar port. Indias gains due to Chabahar are modest, and nowhere comparable to those that would accrue by India having a direct land access to Afghanistan through Pakistan, courtesy a renamed CPEC. The latter is also indispensable for the success of two other mega projects that are critical for Indias energy security and accelerated economic growth  the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipelines.Here is another huge potential gain for South Asia. The proposed connectivity initiative, which would create strong new bonds of regional cooperation and interdependence, could also help resolve three long-standing geopolitical problems in the region, in which countless people have been killed  terrorism, Kashmir and Afghanistan.To realise this vision of a resurgent South Asia, two obstacles will have to be removed blind nationalism and the unfriendly designs of extra-regional powers.

He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas.

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,,The Hindu,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy.

5b14a94a9855b744d638c97c,‘Pesticide-free’ poly-houses are catching on,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pesticide-free-poly-houses-are-catching-on/article23377459.ece,2018-03-29,,The Hindu,"Farmer Raju at his poly-house where broccoli is grown without pesticides in Doddaballapur taluk; (right) broccoli crop is selling like hot cakes.B.S. Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal.","farmer raju at his poly-house where broccoli is grown without pesticides in doddaballapur taluk; (right) broccoli crop is selling like hot cakes.b.s. satish kumarat a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.in fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.the indian institute of horticultural research (iihr) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.the main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said m.s. rao, head of iihrs division of entomology and nematology.this will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of rs. 900 crore.what has come as a shot in the arm for the iihr is that a 24-year-old farmer raju in doddaballapur taluk near bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.it is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. but, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.mr. raju, who migrated to karnataka from andhra pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.what has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. the farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of iihr, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. he was able to earn about rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.dr. rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the iihr.it has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.if a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur j. gavaskar, who has taken licences from the iihr to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. big farmers and some farmer producers organisations from pune, some cities in andhra pradesh, tamil nadu and kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.other successesdr. rao said icar-iihr has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, european cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in karnataka, tamil nadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra, and bengal."

But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states.

The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market.

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April. At the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering Madhya Pradesh and Telangana as well. The supplies will recede after April, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said.","nagpur: at a time when tall promises are being made by politicians to double the income of farmers by way of increased minimum support price (msp), and setting up food parks in every district of the country, ryots in vidarbha have been forced to throw away their produce due to low prices.forty-eight-year-old farmer balwant dadwal, who has a farm at mandwa village near hingna in nagpur district, is staring at the mounds of tomatoes he has produced. balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. a vehicle full of tomato crates sent to kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of rs50 a crate, which comes to just rs2 a kg. the recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.pandurang tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below rs50 per crate. he plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. he said the centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in vidarbha region.shriram ghadhave, president of vegetable growers association of india (vgai), said maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. previously, farmers from western maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from vidarbha and marathwada too have started growing vegetables. he also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. as against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. this takes care of their immediate needs. however, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within rs2-4 a kg. in some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.kishore tiwari of vasantrao naik shetkari swavalamban mission (vnssm)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in nagpur, in yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.the rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. there is no system of msp for vegetables, he said.farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. these days, vegetables are being preferred as well. this has led to a glut in wardha. farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said vijay jawandhia, a former shetkari sanghathana activist from wardha.vijay ingle from akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. the rates are down due to oversupply, he said.meanwhile, nandkishore gaur, president of vegetable traders at kalamna agriculture produce marketing committee (apmc) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. normally, the crop is grown in the month of october. however, these days large number of farmers in areas like ramtek and tumsar road in nagpur district have gone for the january crop, which will continue till april. at the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering madhya pradesh and telangana as well. the supplies will recede after april, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said."

But for the bulk orders, we have to make eight-ten packages at a time, which is very time consuming.

Customers will not purchase a bag worth Rs 10 to carry greens worth Rs 20. People must also be advised by the government to carry bags from home, said vendor Hyder Ali.While vegetable vendors are still managing to function, those who sell of pulses and grains are in bigger trouble. The government should have thought of an alternative for businesses like ours. We approached the CCP and they said to charge people for paper bags. Doing that will further decrease our customers, since they will prefer to go to the mall and buy readymade packets of rice instead of coming to the market.

The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100.

The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight.

Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste.

However, it lost steam after few days as the bid of farmer organisations to block transport of milk and other essential items to cities was thwarted by police.Bharatiya Kisan Union Madhya Pradesh general secretary Anil Yadav admitted the impact of the strike was not as expected in MP, and blamed the fear of the police for its failure. The farmers do not want to get into the wrong books of police.

5b24c5b79855b722ac49ae7a,Flight to safety,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/sugarcane-farmers-msp-sugar-mills-yogi-adityanath-agriculture-5129221/,2018-04-09,,Indian Express,"The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.sugarcane farmers in uttar pradesh are owed over rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (sap). maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of rs 2,213 crore as on march 31, that too, against the centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (frp). yet, cane area in maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from october is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of up farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. one reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. the fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from october to april further adds to the attractiveness.but the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. we are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. these are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (msp) through government procurement. sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the frp/sap, though the monies may come with a few months delay. theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. oilseeds and pulses have been trading below msps over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: tomatoes in kolar (karnataka), onions in lasalgaon (maharashtra) and potatoes in agra (up) are currently selling or were just sold at rs 6-7 per kg.given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in madhya pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in punjab. this is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. the policy prescription to address it is simple: the centre and state governments should desist from hiking msps/frps/saps of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. instead, farmers should be ensured of getting msps and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app"

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government.

This young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.What started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says Mansi, Due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. The love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press I decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.Along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., Mansi also made mud modaks during the Ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during Diwali , all infused with paper seeds. And that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. We were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when I came up with the idea last year in January just before Republic Day. I started thinking about making such a product when I saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. What upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. I realised that we as Indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post Republic or Independence Day. I realised I can initiate and make some change, so why not. We produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before Republic Day with the message Dont throw, grow me printed on the back. The idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. We made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the Indian Flag code.The flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. Talking about the seeds that go into the flag, Mansi says, We infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. With the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.Mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, They all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. I have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. On finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. Seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and I knew that Im on the right path.The interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when Mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. Says Mansi, We, are now happy that this Republic Day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. And we all must know and realise the fact that there is no Planet B.","if you feel bad seeing the indian flag tossed away after every republic or independence day celebrations, try the paper seed flag which mumbaikar mansi shah has developed. this young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.what started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says mansi, due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. the love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press i decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., mansi also made mud modaks during the ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during diwali , all infused with paper seeds. and that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. we were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when i came up with the idea last year in january just before republic day. i started thinking about making such a product when i saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. what upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. i realised that we as indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post republic or independence day. i realised i can initiate and make some change, so why not. we produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before republic day with the message dont throw, grow me printed on the back. the idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. we made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the indian flag code.the flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. talking about the seeds that go into the flag, mansi says, we infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. with the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, they all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. i have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. on finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and i knew that im on the right path.the interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. says mansi, we, are now happy that this republic day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. and we all must know and realise the fact that there is no planet b."

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)","one of the oldest civilisations, the indus valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. this is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. farm crisis in india is real, particularly in states like karnataka and tamil nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.this is one side of the coin but agriculture secretary s k pattanayak, a karnataka cadre ias officer, argues that all is not bad with indian agriculture. it has come a long way and this year india is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.but the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of india. a farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. also, if the indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. this is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.for the woes of karnataka and tamil nadu farmers, pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. it is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in maharashtra. sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of bihar and uttar pradesh and perhaps the northeast as it could also be flood protected.punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. the practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. india gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.even in the arid zones of rajasthan and karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of israel. all one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. the government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. this has to be done on a war footing.what is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in india despite the green revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of rs 20,000 annually. one way could be to provide income support as in the us instead of price support by way of minimum support price (msp). because of high msp for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take

It has also started making puree from juicy vegetables like tomatoes and other local fruits like guava, banana and sapota (chickoo).Starting from mango pulp to dried chickoo and all types of frozen vegetables, the South Gujarat region has it all. All types of vegetables and fruits, including their variants, could form a rich export market for gulf countries, the US and UK, earning more than Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years. On the other hand, shrimp farming in South Gujarat has gained prominence over the last decade with export potential of more than Rs 900 crore. Majority of the shrimp export is done from Mumbai and South India ports.Aquaculture expert Dr Manoj Sharma told TOI, For fresh shrimp supply to Gulf countries, an international air cargo in Surat will be a blessing. However, the biggest boon will be on domestic front as we get more than 400 crore shrimp babies from Pondicherry via Vizag and Chennai.

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist","a few farmers sit huddled near a statue of sardar patel at balaguda village in

crops such as rice and wheat being produced. an arid state such as rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.he explains the significance of these diverse realities: an occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in states of the first kind, such as m.p., maharashtra and gujarat. in states such as u.p. and bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. in rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. i have no problem with [prime minister] narendra modi. he says we should sell pakodas if we can and i have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. my problem is with vasundhara raje. rajputs will try to ensure a victory for manvendra singh at jhalrapatan. what is a rajput without self-respect?there has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. there has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.utsa patnaik,economist"
5ce6180fe8e3fc56af411a6e,Turning over a new leaf,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/turning-over-a-new-leaf/article25639490.ece,2018-12-01,,The Hindu,"Rishim Sachdeva wants to visit Copenhagen. He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)","rishim sachdeva wants to visit copenhagen. he is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.the head chef at mumbais olive bar & kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.backyard goodiesin november, the iconic mediterranean fine-dine in bandra, olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. on offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. it is here that bar manager john leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. the garden of eden (rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. the drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. tommys margherita (rs. 750) has agave nectar and el jimador blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.in-house creationsthe drinks are respectable but its olives food that makes the strongest impression. sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across india), and reduced wastage. everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says sachdeva. its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. it makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.take the tuna jerky (rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. the jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. a red velvet fried chicken 2.0 (rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. its finger lickin good. the no-waste sweet corn gnocchi (rs. 375) is a sachdeva favourite. it uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. all the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian xo sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.comfort foodthose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across india and some made in-house. homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a mushroom and truffle arancini (rs. 375). its crisp, gooey and earthy. the baked brie & truffle (rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (burrata and heirloom tomatoes, rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (figs and goat cheese, rs. 395).to round-off the meal is the vodka milk panna cotta (rs. 450). vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. this intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.the menu will see a few additions over the next few months. sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in december. a spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. expect many such experiments in the future, asserts sachdeva.olive, khar (w); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (monday to sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (saturday and sunday)"

5ce671d6e8e3fc56af41337f,It’s time for another green revolution,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/its-time-for-another-green-revolution/article25582864.ece,2018-11-24,,The Hindu,"The organic food movement has been gathering momentum in India over the past several years. Farmers markets emerged on the scene almost a decade ago with Kavita Mukhis weekly market in Bandra that attracts a posse of dedicated shoppers. Since then, markets have sprung up in several neighbourhoods from Nariman Point, Shivaji Park, and Juhu to Powai, Thane and Vashi. In September, Caf Zoe launched a one-of-its-kind farmers market right inside their sprawling, light-filled space.The restaurant partnered with Taru Naturals, which works with small-scale farmers across India to provide resources and clean tech to enable organic farming. We met Tarus founder/CEO Ruchi Jain, who holds a Masters in Environment Change & Management from Oxford University, and is a passionate advocate of natural, organic farming.To marketWhat we need is to have thousands of farmers markets. People need to see that organic can be affordable, said Jain. Affordability has long been a pain point for the organic movement but the fresh fruits and vegetables at Caf Zoes farmers market are surprisingly well priced and of high quality. We stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, both sweet and flavourful, while the pomegranates are the deepest red we have seen and positively bursting with juice. All vegetables and fruits sold at the market come from Anil Rayates farm in Niphad in Nashik district. While farmers around him concentrate on grapes (Nashiks main cash crop), Rayate instead decided to go the organic route in 2009 with a mixed farm where he grows everything from leafy greens to onions, garlic, and other vegetables. He proudly showed us his certification from Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) a government body that certifies organic farming practices across India.I use traditional farming techniques like natural mulching, using jivamrut fertiliser (a fermented mixture of dung and urine of Indian Gir cows, jaggery, soil, and water), and natural fungicide made of fermented sugarcane juice, cow dung, yoghurt etc., explained Rayate.What made Caf Zoe venture into this area? We are now six-and-a-half years old and it has always been our plan to support communities, not just be a restaurant. Luckily we have been blessed with a large space that enables us to do these things, said Tarini Mohindar, co-founder of Caf Zoe. Mohindar had been toying with the idea of a farmers market for a while and had even spoken to a few organisers. But I didnt want to do something that was massive, just create a space where you can go and stock up on your veggies for the week, and you dont pay through your nose for it. You have a certificate that tells you its organic and theres no middleman involved, she explained. Mohindar met Jain at a pottery workshop organised at Caf Zoe (conducted by Jains sister), and was impressed with the work that Taru Organics did at the grassroots level. The restaurant has held two farmers markets since mid-September and the response has been encouraging. The Sunday brunch crowd has been leaving with bags filled with fresh produce as well as organic staples such as millets, dals, indie rice varieties like Indrayani, khapli wheat (emmer, an ancient wheat variety) atta, jaggery, turmeric, and more. Apart from partnering for the market, Caf Zoe sources produce from Taru Naturals, which also supplies to a handful of Mumbai restaurants like Kala Ghoda Caf, The Pantry, The Bombay Canteen, Olive, SodaBottleOpenerWala etc.Growing trendAs restaurants increasingly make an effort to source organic, a growing tribe of entrepreneurs is stepping in to fulfil the demand. One such is Zama Organics founded by Shriya Naheta. She graduated three years ago and returned to Mumbai from Los Angeles only to find that high-quality, organic produce was hard to come by at reasonable prices. What really inspired me to start Zama were the travels I went on after I was back. I went on a few trips to Uttarakhand and happened to visit farms in Pune and Nashik as well said Naheta. She started working directly with farmers to source organic produce locally, and currently works with three collectives  one small-time farmer in Pune and a group of farmers each in Nashik and Uttarakhand. One of my main sources is in Uttarakhand in a remote and inaccessible location above Nainital; they are so particular about crop rotation, and the time they sow the seeds or harvest the produce. They have really great irrigation from spring waters from the Himalayas, amazing air quality, and they have always grown organically. Everything they need for farming is grown in the farm itself; whatever vegetables get spoiled are inevitably converted into compost to be used back in the farming process, explained Naheta. Zama Organics supplies to restaurants like Masque, Suzette, Sequel, Rolling Pin, Quattro etc.Naheta also launched value-added products like honeys, jams, chutneys, and pickles, which were recently showcased at a four-course dinner at Masque. We want to really educate people on the concept of sustainability and gradually but surely create a shift, where people look at the benefits of eating sustainably grown and wholesome food, she said.Jain agrees; Restaurants are the harbingers of food innovation in India. So if restaurants like Caf Zoe make a statement with such markets that support small-scale organic farmers, we can get the message across, she said. Rayate had the last word; Now, everyone knows the ill effects of chemicals used in farming. Natural farming is the only solution if we have to sustain this for our future generations he said.Fresh produce and staples from Taru Naturals (tarunaturals.com) and Zama Organics (zamaorganics.com) can be ordered online with delivery available across Mumbai.

""Unfortunately Dr Jichkar is no more, but I decided to take his research further,"" said Dixit. Since increase of insulin in blood, usually released after meals, triggers obesity, insulin-resistance and type-2 diabetes, Dixit advises restricting all eating during the day to just two meals.""We appointed Dixit as brand ambassador after we found that his diet plan to tackle obesity and diabetes is yielding results,"" said BJP leader Girish Mahajan, who heads the medical education department.Dr Jagannath Dixit, who has been teaching for 26 years and has won several national and state awards, explained that if insulin level rises in blood, it can trigger many health hazards.Once insulin level rises, the body uses glucose for energy; and if insulin level falls, the body uses fatty acids. As baseline insulin secretion cannot be controlled voluntarily, one option is to control the number of times insulin is secreted into the blood after every eating episode. As more or less the same amount of insulin is secreted every time, irrespective of the quantity of food consumed, reducing eating frequency can reduce the insulin level. So, Dixit's advice is to eat twice when one is hungry; in between two meals, one can drink water, diluted, home-made buttermilk, green or black tea (without sugar), coconut water and one tomato.Dixit claims the simple lifestyle modification is effective in losing weight as well as diabetes reversal. ""If one follows the two-meal practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will help in controlling diabetes. Reversal of diabetes is also possible,"" said Dixit.After naming Dixit the ambassador to spread awareness about fighting lifestyle diseases that are proving to be a huge burden for India as well as the state, Mahajan told TOI: ""We have launched a campaign to tackle obesity and diabetes. Dr Dixit has done his own research on the diet plan, obesity and diabetes. He has delivered lectures across the state and international platforms, too, and has come to certain conclusions. We felt it will be appropriate if we appoint him our brand ambassador, it will go a long way in promoting the message to fight obesity and diabetes.""Dixit has been a tireless campaigner for weight loss and reversal of diabetes for the last 10 years, spreading his message through 250 WhatsApp group and other social media platforms.

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Pune: In an eight-month low, the tomato prices in November have fallen to Rs3 to Rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20.","this story is from november 20, 2018in an eight-month low, the tomato prices in november have fallen to rs3 to rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale m... read moredownload the times of india news app for latest citymake sense of the 2019 lok sabha elections and results on may 23 with toi. follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with india's largest news network.pune: in an eight-month low, the tomato prices in november have fallen to rs3 to rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. the prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between rs12 and rs35 per kg in november 2017.the retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at rs20 per kg.in july this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between rs5 and rs 14. and the rates have been going south since then. they are now less than half of what they were in october and november 2017, the data available with the pune agriculture produce marketing committee (apmc) revealed.the tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. apmc officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.last year, the prices were high during this period. anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said vilas bhujbal, the president of the shri chhatrapati shivaji market yard traders and agents association. the farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. this led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, bhujbal added.the government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. the government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. if too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.sanjay pawar, a farmer from nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. apart from nashik in maharashtra, even places in rajasthan and gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. if production is high in rajasthan and gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. also, exports of vegetables to pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.shriram gadhave, the president of the vegetables growers association of india, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.while tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around rs20 per kg. yakub pathan, owner of the fresh vegetable market in wakad, said, wholesale tomato prices have come down to rs3 to rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. even if prices in the wholesale market increase to rs10-rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at rs20."

The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E.

Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan.

The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says. During winter months he sells nalen gurer sandesh and rasogolla.Sunirmal Bose, a 65-year old office peon working at a travel agents office, is one of Bablus oldest and most regular customers. I am a big fan of his malpua and labanga latika, he says. During Vijaya Dashami, I take a whole lot of these home.Every Saturday, Bablu leaves for his village.

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region.","this story is from october 26, 2018representative imagejanuary-like trenddownload the times of india news app for latest citypune: the prevailing drought-like situation in parts of the state may hit the production of most vegetables, sending their retail prices soaring early next year.the situation of water table in october this year is akin to what it usually is during january each year, which is why production of most vegetables, including tomatoes, may dip by around 20% after the next three months, causing a surge in their prices, sources from the all india vegetable growers association said.they said considering the prevailing situation, farmers may also steer clear of sowing vegetables in blocks that are reporting a shortage of water.shriram gadhave, president of the vegetable growers association of india, said the water table has already started dipping in parts of the state. this will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. the tomato prices may rise to rs 80/kg in april next year, he said.vilas shinde, managing director at sahyadri farmers producer company ltd, said, vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their october orders.he said the area from nashik to marathwada , including aurangabad and jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as december. a 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. some effect on vegetable production in eastern pune might also be seen, in locations like indapur, baramati and solapur , shinde added.gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in october, a phenomenon which usually occurs in january. farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.he said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. it is due to this reason that western maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. no impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before january 2019, he said.a state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. a bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. however, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in january and february, he said.another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as pune, satara, kolhapur , sangli, sangamner, nashik, west ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the western ghat region."

But meet Naina Siwach from Mumbai, who by her own confession, is a digital nomad. Planning, she says, is the key to making your travel dreams come true. In her 30s now, this former VP of a national PR company in Mumbai who is now 'location independent' and has chosen to become a consultant digital strategist and moved to Bali, Indonesia, in December 2017 as she feels the new job will help her travel yet work for a living. While many of us got inspired to spend at least two days at the La Tomatina Festival after watching Laila and Arjun fall in love with each other amidst the squishy tomatoes in Spain in the epic 2011 Bollywood movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, this girl actually managed to ring in her 30th birthday in Spain at the fest. ""Ever since I turned 21, I've managed to visit more than 30 countries and I hope to have 50 stampings in my passport before I turn 40."" she says. Naina was at The Philippines for her birthday in 2017 and she says she loves to do it the local style. Her holidays are dotted with archery, height ziplining, surfing, snorkeling, deep sea diving and more. She loves to hang out with the locals, eat like them and even rent a little studio apartment for herself when she travels. We ask her how she manages to do all of this and how to plan to explore the world. Excerpts from a conversation with this true blue nomadWhen did you start travelling solo?I ventured on my first solo travel at the rebellious age of 18, as a birthday gift to myself. I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and explore unchartered territories. The first trip was to Europe where I travelled for 30 days and it felt like the best 30 days of my life. Every day, I learnt the value of being true to myself and appreciating my moments of solitude. It changed me as a person and restored a newfound sense of independence within me. I understood how to adapt to different cultures, cuisines, languages and of course, money conversions most importantly. Every solo trip has enhanced the quality of my peace and happiness.What is it in solo travel that keeps you going again and again?Every solo trip has helped me grow and evolve as a person. It is an ideal stress buster and enables me to truly appreciate the value of my freedom and Independence and to be a better human being. It fills my soul with tranquillity. It is what I do to recover from life's many unpredictable blows, so I may refresh and rejuvenate myself and go back to face anything that comes my way with renewed energy. In a land where you meet new people, you realise you a mere speck in this vast diverse world. Taking yearly solo trips has been essential in teaching me to expand my boundaries and help me take a step back in my own life to appreciate the things I have been blessed with.How does one realise their dream of travelling the world while still holding a fulltime (often demanding) job?First earn well and save well ( a few lakhs in Indian Rupee to take care of emergencies). Then choose a job which allows you to work remotely. With the advent of mobile technology and superfast broadband and many companies also giving the remote work options, it is easier to find jobs in the new age economy. For instance, I was previously based in Mumbai and used to work fulltime as the Vice President of the luxury segment of a PR company. But now, thanks to my quest for travel, I travel wherever I want but to using my high end laptop and a super fast internet connection (luckily Bali has a good one), I work as a digital strategist for global brands. My work involves planning digital campaigns and promotions. So if your travel quest gets the better of you, this is the best way to go about life and your dreams.What are the three tips for Indian solo travellers to stay safe?During one of my solo trips to Amsterdam a few years ago, I recall feeling completely vulnerable and alone. Nonetheless, I decided to step outside my hostel and check out their famous Dutch apple pie cafe. My recommendation would be to step out of your fear zone and explore the city and trust me, this will redefine your definition of freedom. You can thank me later. The hacks that keep me safe or sorted are:- To blend in and dress like one of the locals.- Carry a dummy wallet. I keep my money and cards in my inner garments. So in case, anyone attempts to rob you, only the dummy wallet is lost.- Pepper spray is not allowed in air travel. So you can carry a mosquito spray or miniature hair spray if possible. That works too, in case of emergency to at least stump the intruder.- Pick Airbnb and hostels that have maximum reviews and are centrally located.- It is preferable to leave the DND sign on your door before leaving the hotel room.- Do not trust people easily. Stay alert and vigilant.Is there any process you follow on how you decide your next destination?Birthdays are special days and I want the best stuff those days. So for the last five years, I have made a pact to myself - to break boundaries and travel far and wide. As an avid traveller who uses almost every long weekend for some sort of travel (I started 2018 with the Thrissur Snake Boat Race festival), I have several exotic and unexplored destinations to discover. I am a thalassophile - a sea lover. The ebb and tide of the waves lull me into a new world whenever I play on the beach. So naturally, my travel is research-oriented and usually around beaches. I am an adventure freak so activities such surfing, diving and snorkelling with intriguing culture blends interest me. I celebrated my birthday in Balinese tradition in 2017.Share three travel hacks.Ans: Always make sure to inform your bank about the country you intend to visit along with the duration. Make sure you are familiar with the conversions and costs. Keep the emergency number of the bank in handy in case you lose your cards without fail.What are the destinations in your bucket list?There are three destinations and experiences I wish to complete before 2020 which are as follows:- I want to attempt the Lava Surf in Hawaii. It is said to be extremely dangerous, however, I wish to experience the thrill to ride waves on fire!- I want to walk through the magnificent Amazon rainforest. The starting point would be from Bolivia. This is an experience of a lifetime and I would recommend the same to all the solo travellers across the world.- I would like to travel across Japan for about four months during the Cherry blossom season. It begins to bloom in Okinawa, passes through the middle of Japan and finishes with a late bloom in northern Hokkaido.Ideally how much budget should a single Indian set aside for a week's travel abroad.. not too much luxury but not too much of a shoestring.. economy.It would depend on the destination. I wouldnt recommend Europe or USA for a week. The tickets are expensive and to justify that cost, you need to spend at least two to three weeks. If you want to go abroad for a week, I would recommend The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand Islands, Cambodia and Vietnam. You can work within Rs 1.5 lakh including tickets, visa, stay, meal and intercity travel. If you are a shopaholic, then I recommend you downsize your credit limit to 50K so you dont splurge. However, avoid malls. Always visit flea markets and vintage storesWhat websites/ apps to plan your travel do you recommend?- TripIt - saves my travel itinerary, while the alerts are like my best travel buddies.- Airbnb for homestay.- Hostel World for any hostel bookings.- CityMapper - for any help in understanding local transport.- Google translate are my Go to apps as required.Any tips on snagging the best foreign travel dealsPlan in advance.

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App","exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies.

right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.to submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. the government had announced that loans worth rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. till march 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of rs 13,782 crore.the delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. a number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.there has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. what is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.pricesthe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified minimum support price (msp). in the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of rs 10 a kg, is now trading at rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of narayangaon and junnar. onions, which till recently were fetching rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at rs 6 a kg. farmer leader and swabhimani paksha mp raju shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.also read | msp satyagrah: no mandi where farmers can sell their produce at msp, says yogendra yadavthe reasons for low prices are several. in case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. a crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over rs 1,200 per quintal below its msp as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. in fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below msp this season.government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.milk and sugarcanelast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from rs 24 to rs 27 per litre. dairies are, however, barely able to pay rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. there are over rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.the result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. with no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. so close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.for all the latest mumbai news, download indian express app"

He says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein April and then quit farming. Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were The loan waiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using Aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameter The system was hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with Aadhaar accounts more than Rs 1.5 lakh and a cash incentive of Rs 25,000 for those who repaid loans on timewaiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using Aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameterwas hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with Aadhaar accounts So far, the government has disbursed Rs 13,580 crore to 3.532 million farmers accounts; 7.7 million farmers applied for the loan waiver and around 4.652 million were found eligible for the various components. Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said.","sudam khandbahale, a 46-year-old farmer from mahirawani village in maharashtras nasik district, 167 km from mumbai, hacked down his one-acre grape vineyard this month, frustrated that the plantation hadnt borne fruit for the second year in a row.khandbahales vineyard was hit by cyclone ockhi last year, turning his rs 3 lakh investment to dust. he says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein april and then quit farming. year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. farming is all that i know but it is no longer viable. i will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but i wont farm anymore, said khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.in june last year, khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. one of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.as supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister devendra fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. in nasik and ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.bowing to pressure the maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last june. farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in june 2017 rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. this includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to june 2016 the scheme had three components  besides the rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in june 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. this includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to june 2016had three components  besides the rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were the loan waiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameter the system was hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with aadhaar accounts more than rs 1.5 lakh and a cash incentive of rs 25,000 for those who repaid loans on timewaiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameterwas hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with aadhaar accounts so far, the government has disbursed rs 13,580 crore to 3.532 million farmers accounts; 7.7 million farmers applied for the loan waiver and around 4.652 million were found eligible for the various components. out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. another rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.khandbahale owes rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in nasik. he can benefit from the rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. i dont have rs 7 lakh in hand, why would i keep incurring more debt if i had the money?

Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. Last years budget announced a Rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, Hussain added.","a nursery at the horticulture centre of excellence in karnal, haryana. so far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the indo-israeli agriculture project and five more will be operational by next month. photo: israel embassynew delhi: india and israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old indo-israeli agriculture project (iiap) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in maharashtra and demonstrating to indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.for a country like israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for india, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.so, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. the implementing partners for the project are the national horticulture mission (nhm) under the agriculture ministry, mashav, israels agency for international development cooperation, and indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.our goal is to help the indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said dan alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at mashav, delhi.there is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, alluf said, adding, each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. a unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.so far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. notable among these are centres for vegetables in karnal, haryana, for mangoes in dapoli and for citrus fruits in nagpur, both in maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in bassi, rajasthan.among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.following prime minister narendra modis visit to israel in july last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.according to a mashav document, vegetable intervention in haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said alluf.one of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a niti aayog concept paper released in october last year.however, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in india, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.in states which are water-stressed such as maharashtra, karnataka, telangana and gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said siraj hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the delhi-based indian council for research on international economic relations.the centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. last years budget announced a rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, hussain added."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood.

5aeac1499855b73f522c2e71,The State Should Come to the Rescue of the Landless Dalit Farmer in India,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-state-should-come-to-the-rescue-of-the-landless-dalit-farmer-in-india/story-GuvPIRYjZ7J2DG6E6Z02PK.html,2018-03-05,,Hindustan Times,"Seven decades after Independence, while a majority of farmers cultivate their own land (however small their holdings may be), most Dalit farmers in much of India are daily wagers, according to data released recently by the Census of India. With the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the Centre included in the Union Budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged Rs 500 crore to Operation Greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.Data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers. Data from the 70th round of Land and Livestock Holdings Survey of the NSSO indicates that 58.4% of rural Dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. Landlessness is particularly severe among Dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where more than 85% of Dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. More than 60% of Dalit households are landless in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. The Socio Economic and Caste Census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.Apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the Gandhian Bhoodan movement pioneered by Vinoba Bhave in Telangana in the 1950s and by Left governments in West Bengal and Kerala, and to some extent the National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.Of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless Dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. It is not in agricultural alone that the Dalits have been short-changed. They are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. The States role in fighting this inequality is crucial. But with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in India are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty.","seven decades after independence, while a majority of farmers cultivate their own land (however small their holdings may be), most dalit farmers in much of india are daily wagers, according to data released recently by the census of india. with the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the centre included in the union budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged rs 500 crore to operation greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.data shows that 71% of scheduled caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. that figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for scheduled tribe farmers and 41% for non-sc/st farmers. data from the 70th round of land and livestock holdings survey of the nsso indicates that 58.4% of rural dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. landlessness is particularly severe among dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as haryana, punjab and bihar, where more than 85% of dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. more than 60% of dalit households are landless in tamil nadu, gujarat, kerala, west bengal, maharashtra, andhra pradesh, and odisha. the socio economic and caste census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the gandhian bhoodan movement pioneered by vinoba bhave in telangana in the 1950s and by left governments in west bengal and kerala, and to some extent the national conference government in jammu and kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. it is not in agricultural alone that the dalits have been short-changed. they are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. the states role in fighting this inequality is crucial. but with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in india are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty."

A misal-pav stall run by the Tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. From selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the Tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. Elar Tellis, popularly known as Michael, came to Mumbai from his native Mangalore 45 years ago. Starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at Sarvodaya Nagar in Mulund West unfolds at night. The joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.I had a tea stall in Mangalore, but as I didnt earn enough for my family, I came to Mumbai when I was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. I initially started working at stalls at the Andheri railway station and later, worked at Bandra. But I always wanted to have my own business, Michael said. He then started selling tea in Mulund along with his two younger brothers.After working with others for five years, I learnt how to run a business in Mumbai, so I started my own and got my two brothers Marshal and Xavier on board, said Michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of Mulund from a forest area to a residential one.I would start selling tea at 4 am as I was told that in Mumbai, I would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. However, I didnt earn much by selling tea. We then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. He drove during night hours and I would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.With a loan to repay, Michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. In the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled Michael. However, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.Michaels son Santosh Tellis said: My father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. Then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. During the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. But, after Ganesh Chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. People would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across Mulund. Since then, the Tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.Michael and Santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. I have to sleep early at night so that I can wake up early, following which I have to report to my job at 10 am. As my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said Santosh.The midnight misal is served at Rs 40 per plate with two pavs. The stall also sells taripav at Rs 10 per piece. They attract customers from Ghatkopar, Powai, Thane, Bhandup and Airoli. In taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said Santosh. Between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.A resident of Mulund, Varun Ghatani, said: My personal favourite is taripav, and whenever I go out with my friends for night-outs, I see to it that I visit Michael and eat taripav.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App","residents of mulund know what to do about hunger pangs in the dead of the night. a misal-pav stall run by the tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. from selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. elar tellis, popularly known as michael, came to mumbai from his native mangalore 45 years ago. starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at sarvodaya nagar in mulund west unfolds at night. the joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.i had a tea stall in mangalore, but as i didnt earn enough for my family, i came to mumbai when i was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. i initially started working at stalls at the andheri railway station and later, worked at bandra. but i always wanted to have my own business, michael said. he then started selling tea in mulund along with his two younger brothers.after working with others for five years, i learnt how to run a business in mumbai, so i started my own and got my two brothers marshal and xavier on board, said michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of mulund from a forest area to a residential one.i would start selling tea at 4 am as i was told that in mumbai, i would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. however, i didnt earn much by selling tea. we then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. he drove during night hours and i would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.with a loan to repay, michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. in the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled michael. however, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.michaels son santosh tellis said: my father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. during the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. but, after ganesh chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. people would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across mulund. since then, the tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.michael and santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. i have to sleep early at night so that i can wake up early, following which i have to report to my job at 10 am. as my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said santosh.the midnight misal is served at rs 40 per plate with two pavs. the stall also sells taripav at rs 10 per piece. they attract customers from ghatkopar, powai, thane, bhandup and airoli. in taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said santosh. between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.a resident of mulund, varun ghatani, said: my personal favourite is taripav, and whenever i go out with my friends for night-outs, i see to it that i visit michael and eat taripav.for all the latest mumbai news, download indian express app"
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,,Hindustan Times,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said.","kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister arun jaitley on thursday said the national democratic alliance (nda) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.in his budget speech, jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (msps) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.this has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as maharashtra and madhya pradesh.jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. he said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. the government has decided to keep msp for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.the finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below msps, as was widely anticipated. such a scheme is already being implemented in madhya pradesh. he, instead, said that niti ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.the budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. the announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called c2 or a2 + fl  the government would adopt. jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.c2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. these are not part of the a2+fl, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.the crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionthe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said kiran vissa of the rythu swarajya vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. he said when pm narendra modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, msps were already giving higher returns than under modis tenure.in 2007, the ms swaminathan committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the bjps 2014 poll manifesto adopted. in the para containing the specific recommendation, the swaminathan report said msp should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. but in its annexure, the report used c2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.economist ashok gulati told ht that for rabi crops, the msp was closer towards 50% of costs. in wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. the real challenge is for kharif crops. in paddy, msps and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. if the government actually sets msps at 1.5 times the c2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.the budget announced a new scheme called operation greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. this would be similar to operation flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, jaitley said. two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted rs10,000.the budget also set a target of rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. various ministries will have rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.with a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from rs715 crore in 2017-18 to rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, jaitley said."

Veteran stage and costume designer and director, Art Heritage, Amal Allana has curated it for the Delhi edition.As in India today, Contested Space is about the different pulls that are dividing up the space or the ground we stand on, says Allana while pointing out to an artwork that illustrates this.

As Sawhney writes in the catalogue, she uses the conformity and mundaneness of her material to create a double illusion. Stacked together, individual staples create a formidable sculpture or structure. But should one staple fall out or move out of place, the whole edifice may come apart. This mirrors the tentativeness and the instability of existence, adds Allana.Sumedh Rajendrans mixed media collage on grey, robotic workers marching to office as if they were soldiers, add another strand  that of precarity of urban existence  to the exhibition.

5aeb09f19855b73f522c632c,Bengaluru: Veggies get pocket-friendly,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/19/bengaluru-veggies-get-pocket-friendly-1758226.html,2018-01-19,,The New Indian Express,"Ashwini M Sripad ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: With the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time.","ashwini m sripad byexpress news servicebengaluru: with the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. in karnataka, vegetable growers are more in kolar, bengaluru rural, chikballapur, chitradurga, ramanagara, mysuru, mandya, chamarajanagar, hassan and other places. with good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. the price of many vegetables has come around rs 20 per kilo which was more than rs 70 a few months back. while the tomato has declined to rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is rs 13 per kg, raddish is rs 18, snake gourd is rs 18, while beetroot and potato are rs 22 per kg, according to the horticultural producers cooperative marketing and processing society (hopcoms) price list.former additional director (fruits), dr s v hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. the lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.with this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. if there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. this is what has happened now, he said.citing an example, hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. but this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. if the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. in winter season, tomatoes normally grow. this year, growers in tamil nadu, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. this means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.people, vendors happyaruna, a resident of rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. even after buying so much, my bill was hardly d100. i was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. she said just a couple of months back, she used to spend d250 for the same quantity of vegetables. the vendors too are happy. carrot was d90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to d45. similarly, potato was d80 per kg and it has fallen to d22. people do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, rudresh, a vegetable vendor at vijayanagar said. another vendor, mahesh at shivajinagar, said customers are happy. we too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.from less supply to tomato glutaccording to deputy director of horticulture department chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. the price of tomatoes had reached d90 per kg. it was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. tomatoes need three months to grow. there was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. there is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. in summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

That waste has instead been used to produce 800kg of manure.Considering we are not a very large society and we do not fall under the specifications of the waste management rules to treat waste at source, we have still ended up doing it, as our vision is to be a green society and ensure we give something back to nature, said Satish Kini, managing committee member and resident in-charge of various green efforts at the society. In a city like Mumbai, which is facing both air and water pollution, we want to make our society a green haven for our children and senior citizens.Additionally, the society has diverted 2,200 kg of their dry waste since October from going to the landfills by segregating it and recycling. Only biomedical and non-recyclable waste is being collected by the civic body.In August last year, the residents reached out to Are you Reducing, Reusing, Recycling- RUR Greenlife, a social environment organisation, responsible for many similar projects across the city. After a series of workshops by the organisation, the residents began their decentralized and sustainable waste management within two months.Matroshree Pearl is an inspiring model green society, which has active enthusiastic participation by all residents towards care for the environment. It gives us hope for a greener future, said Monisha Narke, founder and CEO, RUR Greenlife.The society adopted a three-bin approach to segregation of biodegradable; dry recyclable and non-recyclable waste by using colour-coded bins and garbage bags to ensure higher level of segregation. The dry waste is further segregated through a seven bin approach into - cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, electronic waste, metal, glass, and tetrapak cartons. Residents sell some of the reusable dry waste to rag pickers and other recyclers for a nominal fee. The revenue generated from dry waste recycling is used to support the kitchen waste management project which making the activity a self-sufficient project, said Kini.November onward, the 4,000sqft terrace of the building was made home to an organic garden where residents grow spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, chili, ladyfinger, fenugreek, lemon grass and many other vegetables. Children from the society have been given a vegetable patch each and they are responsible for nurturing them.We have set up a drip irrigation system which uniformly provides water to each of these plantations, said Shireesh Kedare, resident and professor, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B).This is one society which has made best use of the circular economy model and benefitted the most out of it.

And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece. Available at Sapna Book House, RS Puram in Coimbatore, Nilgiris supermarket in Puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.Deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi","did you know over 2,500 wooden pencils can be created from a single tree? and to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer divya shetty, along with friend, vishnu vardhan, launched plantcil in october 2017.their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. we make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. we have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says shetty.if you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. at their manufacturing plant at avinashi (40 kms from coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. we make 6,000 pencils a day. there is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says vardhan.all things organichailing from an agricultural family in karnataka, shetty explains why she quit a career in it to helm two social enterprises. when i was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. i was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with vardhan at an it firm in bengaluru two years ago.it was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched indian superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with vardhan.for the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. we brought in 12 ngos and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says vardhan. in 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.fruity flavoursduring her interactions with farmers, shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. they kick-started plantcil in a rather innovative way. rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. we realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says vardhan.as the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent indian and chinese brands, shetty and vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.the classic pencils have indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. we procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. students can plant the pencil and water it. in a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says shetty. the rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. an attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. we source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. they are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.up nextthey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. costing rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. they are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.plans are also in place to launch an app, farm zeal, next month. it is aimed at educating people about organic farming. we will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. there will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in maharashtra, bengaluru and chennai.the pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at rs. 6 a piece. available at sapna book house, rs puram in coimbatore, nilgiris supermarket in puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi"
5b13ce969855b762ecebf9b3,In Odisha  schools are the dropouts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-odisha-schools-are-the-dropouts/article22476577.ece,2018-01-20,,The Hindu,"Doors closed:In contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of the residential schools are overcrowded. Shadin Menaka (sitting), a physically challenged tribal student, dropped out after the Sana Raisingh primary school closed down.Biswaranjan RoutBiswaranjan RoutIts a little past four in the afternoon, the time when schools ring their closing bells in the Hatsesikhal cluster of Odishas tribal-dominated Rayagada district. Just before Sekhal Primary School comes into view, a couple of students in blue uniforms cycle past on the concrete road that cuts through palm tree cultivations and paddy fields.Along the highway that connects the area to the district headquarters 15 km away are rows and rows of eucalyptus trees that feed JK Paper Mills manufacturing unit in the district.This particular school has been running since 1926. In 1987, it became a 40-seat residential school. As we enter the premises, students are busy sweeping the yard and classrooms. Some are watering the grounds with mugs filled from a large drum placed near a row of dysfunctional toilets.Hobsons choiceAt 81, the number of enrolled children is double the sanctioned strength. All the students in its hostel belong to the villages located in the four or five Gram Panchayats in the area. The schools apparent popularity is not due to its exceptional facilities. For most students, the fact that there are three teachers in this school, and they get three meals a day, makes up for the visible lack of infrastructure: three overcrowded classrooms for five classes, no dining hall or toilets, and a small row of damaged and abandoned rooms gaping at them dismally. But how could they possibly complain? The alternative  to stay on in their village schools  is far worse, and in any case about to disappear.Hostel superintendent Rabindra Kumar Majhi allows two Class 4 students, Santha Mandagi and Siddhanta Melaka, to accompany us to Ranaguda village, which is just a few kilometres away but not easy to access because of the Nagavali, one of southern Odishas major rivers that originates in Kalahandi district and flows into neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.As we wade gingerly across to the other bank, we realise we would be lost without the boys. Ranaguda is a 35-household Kondh tribe hamlet a couple of kilometres from the river. It has a primary school, but one with just two students. The teachers recently informed the villagers that the school will be closed down due to poor enrolment.RTE betrayedIn 2016-17, as many as 828 government primary and upper primary schools were shut down in Odisha for having less than 10 students each. Its less than a decade since the Indian government displayed some political will to achieve the goal of universal and equitable education by passing the Right to Education Act. But the failure, in practically all the States, of hundreds of government-run neighbourhood schools to even stay open betrays a lack of seriousness in implementing the RTE.In Odisha, the Ranaguda case is hardly the first instance of the State governments inability, and all too often, lack of will, to retain primary students in its neighbourhood schools. In 2014, 195 schools in the State with less than five students were served show-cause notices.In tribal areas like Rayagada and Kandhamal, which also have pockets subject to Maoist influence, the government seems to wilfully favour young children studying in residential schools, cut off from their families. Ostensibly, this is being done to make educational facilities available to those living in remote and conflict-ridden areas. The government even has special programmes to help children who missed out on early education, so that they can be mainstreamed into regular schools. But the fact remains that Ranaguda is 15-20 km away from the district headquarters, and the only reason the children here end up going to residential schools is that the local one doesnt function.This past year, the highest number of free government schools struck off the list, 124, is in the economically backward, though mineral-rich Rayagada district, followed by Kandhamal, which has lost 101 schools.The idea was to merge these erstwhile schools with a primary school located within a kilometres distance or an upper primary school within 3 km. The state would provide transport facilities or an escort if the distance is above the prescribed limit or the terrain difficult. According to Binodini Panda, district project coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, another 268 such schools have already been identified for closure in Rayagada, and are awaiting formal approval.Earlier this month, a circular issued by the OPEPA (Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority) to all district project coordinators appeared to provide some relief, as it stated that geographical barriers are valid grounds to consider re-opening schools. But Panda clarifies that so far as re-opening goes, there are no schools under consideration in Rayagada.The Ranaguda villagers, for their part, have appealed to the CRCC (Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator) to reverse the decision. About ten students will be ready to join primary school from the Anganwadi centre next year, they say. But even if the administration agrees, the reason for the low student strength is likely to continue.Gathered together outside one of the pucca houses built under the Indira Awaas Yojana scheme, the parents say that the two teachers hardly ever make the trek here and had last come two days before this reporters visit. Even the Anganwadi worker has been refusing to come here, they say. Complaints to the CRCC have proved futile. In frustration, the residents have been pulling the children out of the village school and sending them away to the nearest hostel schools for adivasi children.The majority of these kids are first generation students. Most of the Kui-speaking women in the village are also non-conversant in Odia, the medium of instruction in the schools. But the will to ensure at least elementary education to their children is high. The basic requirement, which they rightly demand, is the regular presence of teachers.Biju Kolaka is a student of Class 10. He is one of the few older students who continue to live in this village of small farmers, who grow vegetables like tomato, brinjal and chilli. He crosses the river on foot every day to reach school in Jemadeipentho. During the monsoon, when the river swells, it takes Kolaka an hour on bicycle to cross the bridge 10 km away and get to his school. Kolakas elder brother, though, has been sent to study at a residential high school in Rayagada city.The distrust of the education department is palpable. Even though staff strength is low, not in a single government school that we visited were all the appointed teachers present. The teachers in school had their attention divided between students of two or three classes, all sitting together in the same room. Sending students to residential schools is not uncommon here.Increasing cultural alienationThe preference for hostel schools is not from the parents side alone; it is a strategic decision on the part of the State in this fully Scheduled area with a low literacy rate. According to the 2011 Census, the rate of literacy among the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Odisha was 52.24% against the overall literacy rate of 72.87%.Among the communities living here, dependent mainly on agriculture for their livelihood, the SC & ST Development Department of Odisha states that improving educational facilities through residential institutions has been an identified thrust area.There are different categories of free schools it runs, from high schools to ashram schools for elementary education, sevashrams for primary education, and educational complexes for particularly vulnerable tribal groups. Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, a central government initiative, focusses on girl students from the SC, ST and OBC groups. Then there are institutions such as the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a private residential school in Bhubaneswar, which claims to provide free education to 27,000 ST children within its 80-acre campus, and has plans to open more such schools in 20 districts of Odisha.Social activists have expressed concerns that this strategy has been increasing a sense of cultural alienation among the students. They are forgetting their family culture and imbibing alien values. A child from a residential school is unable to cope with her village circumstances; he or she looks at it with disdain, has a sense of inferiority, and is always looking for a way out, says Vidhya Das, from the NGO Agragamee that works in 10 districts of Odisha.The current policy is similar to the setting up of residential schools for aboriginal children in Australia and Canada that started in the late 19th century, with assimilation the stated reason. The physical and emotional abuse faced by children removed from their homes, the denial of their cultural heritage and history, their subsequent demands for reparation, as well as the Canadian governments apology for the hardships they faced, are well documented.With the aim of ensuring that tribal children get their education in local schools, Agragamee has provided additional teachers conversant with the Kui language in 18 government primary schools in Rayagada district. They say that this has increased attendance. The education department also runs a similar programme of multilingual education. And yet, the emphasis on residential schools has gained momentum. Anasthesia Kerketa, assistant district education officer, points out that aside from 40 and 100-seat schools, there are now 500-seat ones too.Flourishing private schoolsIn contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of these residential schools are overcrowded. Gorakhpur High School, an ashram school in Kashipur block of Rayagada, has 1,050 students, of which 220 girls and 473 boys are in residence. The 15 teachers in residence here are well below the mandated student-pupil ratio. We end up admitting so many students due to political pressure, says the headmaster Pitambar Bhoi.Even as the government promotes residential schools, it has been unable to address the main issues that are driving students out of the government schools in their own locality: teacher shortage and teacher motivation.The primary school in Sana Raisingh village in Rayagada block closed a year ago. It used to have a single teacher who would come for just an hour a day, say the villagers. They have already petitioned the collector to reopen the school.When this school closed, the existing students dispersed, some to the closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. But three physically challenged ST children were left behind. Unable to walk properly, Shadin Menaka, Nimak Raja and Diksha Kolaka dropped out.Opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan programme. The hamlet includes both Kondh tribals as well as Telugu families belonging to the general category. Some of the latter started sending their children to a private, English-medium convent school in nearby Jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from Rs. 3,000. Unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. Theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to Vishakapatnam. So we dont want our children to walk to school. But if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says Virata Jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.Similar trendsThis is by no means an Odisha story alone. State governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. According to several media reports, Maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. Andhra Pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first States to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. Rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. With the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says Ambarish Rai, national convenor, RTE Forum.This is clearly the case in the Humma Gram Panchayat area of Odishas Ganjam district, which is also Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks home turf.In 2013, Ganjam was badly affected by Cyclone Phailin. The cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. The district, which has the highest proportion of SCs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. District education officer Sanatan Panda says that the migration of skilled workers to Surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. The proliferation of private schools is another reason.In Baunsiapada, a village of Dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. The village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. But the school had a short life. Since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in Gada Humma. According to the in-charge of the school, Lingaraj Mahankuda, only two of the nine students from Baunsiapada made it to Gada Humma.In 2013, when Mahankuda joined the Gada Humma school, it had 75 students. The number has since shrunk to 42. Educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. Prafulla Kumar Nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct Baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby Sri Sai Saraswati Vidhya Mandir. He considers it a better option for his son.Started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the Gada Humma government school. P. Ravindra Reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and Suresh Chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying Rs. 1,200-Rs. 1,800 annually.Run under the aegis of the RSS-backed Bharat Shiksha Vikash Sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. Aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.The State government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. Of the 11 blocks of Rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom Kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. Teachers, too, claim to be overworked.Battle to keep school openMahankuda of the Gada Humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. Shiksha Sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.Simanchak Pani, a Shiksha Sahayak at Gabudi primary school in Subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. In the meantime, he must make do with Rs. 6,000 per month. How is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.About six months ago, the villagers of Gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. They decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. Kailash Jena, a farmer, brought his son, Biswajit, back from Saraswati Shishu Mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. The school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.Several residents of the village (all of them non-SC/ST) have migrated to work in the Alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of Gujarat. As his neighbours laugh, Jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. An SC-ST village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. Clearly, Gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.Ambarish Rai,National convenor, RTE ForumA child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it

closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. but three physically challenged st children were left behind. unable to walk properly, shadin menaka, nimak raja and diksha kolaka dropped out.opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the swachh bharat abhiyan programme. the hamlet includes both kondh tribals as well as telugu families belonging to the general category. some of the latter started sending their children to a private, english-medium convent school in nearby jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from rs. 3,000. unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to vishakapatnam. so we dont want our children to walk to school. but if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says virata jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.similar trendsthis is by no means an odisha story alone. state governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. according to several media reports, maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. andhra pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first states to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.minimum rte norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. with the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says ambarish rai, national convenor, rte forum.this is clearly the case in the humma gram panchayat area of odishas ganjam district, which is also chief minister naveen patnaiks home turf.in 2013, ganjam was badly affected by cyclone phailin. the cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. the district, which has the highest proportion of scs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. district education officer sanatan panda says that the migration of skilled workers to surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. the proliferation of private schools is another reason.in baunsiapada, a village of dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. the village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. but the school had a short life. since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in gada humma. according to the in-charge of the school, lingaraj mahankuda, only two of the nine students from baunsiapada made it to gada humma.in 2013, when mahankuda joined the gada humma school, it had 75 students. the number has since shrunk to 42. educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. prafulla kumar nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby sri sai saraswati vidhya mandir. he considers it a better option for his son.started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the gada humma government school. p. ravindra reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and suresh chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying rs. 1,200-rs. 1,800 annually.run under the aegis of the rss-backed bharat shiksha vikash sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.the state government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. of the 11 blocks of rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. teachers, too, claim to be overworked.battle to keep school openmahankuda of the gada humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. shiksha sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.simanchak pani, a shiksha sahayak at gabudi primary school in subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. in the meantime, he must make do with rs. 6,000 per month. how is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.about six months ago, the villagers of gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. they decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. kailash jena, a farmer, brought his son, biswajit, back from saraswati shishu mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. the school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.several residents of the village (all of them non-sc/st) have migrated to work in the alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of gujarat. as his neighbours laugh, jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. an sc-st village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. clearly, gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.minimum rte norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.ambarish rai,national convenor, rte foruma child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it with disdain, have a sense of inferiority, and are always looking for a way out.vidhya das,ngo agragamee"

5b1423e49855b7624637d5b8,It’s time to reimagine South Asia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-time-to-reimagine-south-asia/article22938048.ece,2018-03-06,,The Hindu,"A few months ago, Anjum Altaf, former dean of the prestigious Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), wrote an article in the Dawn newspaper, making a strong case for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between Pakistan and India. He also gave a revealing example of how this has become impossible because of blind nationalism in Pakistan.At the time, he wrote, when tomatoes were selling for Rs300 a kilo in Lahore, they were available at Indian Rs40 a kilo in Amritsar a mere 30 miles away. But a visceral Indo-phobia, shared by many of our influentials, stood in the way of consumers benefiting from the lower priced supply. Many Pakistani politicians want nothing to be imported from India, the enemy nation.This kind of blind nationalism is by no means Pakistans monopoly. Those who watch Indian TV channels debating India-Pakistan relations routinely hear similar Pak-phobia. Result: despite being neighbours, India and Pakistan are among the least integrated nations in the world. Because of their unending mutual hostility, South Asia too has become the least integrated region in the world. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in a coma. Sadly, the most populous region in the world has also remained home to the largest number of poor people in the world.So near, so farA few striking examples will show how our two countries, which were part of a single seamless socio-economic and cultural entity before 1947, have now completely drifted apart. There are no direct flights between their capitals  New Delhi and Islamabad. The frequency of Delhi-Lahore and Mumbai-Karachi flights have become minimal. The Mumbai-Karachi ferry service (the two port cities, once part of a single province, are closer to each other than either Mumbai and Delhi or Karachi and Islamabad) was stopped after the 1965 war.In this age of information revolution, the number of phone calls between Indian and Pakistani citizens (including calls between close relatives of divided families) is negligible, mostly out of fear of being questioned by their respective security agencies. At less than $3 billion annually, trade with Pakistan accounts for a meagre 0.4% of Indias growing global commerce.Those who are happy with this status quo have set responses. On the Indian side, it will be said that terror and trade cannot go together. The Narendra Modi government has raised the bar higher  terror and talks cannot go together. On the Pakistani side, resolution of the Kashmir issue has become a precondition for any substantial bilateral cooperation.But is the status quo benefiting either country? The answer is obvious, except to those arrogant ultra-nationalists who think India now has a seat on the global high table and hence need not care for Pakistan, and to those narrow-minded Pakistani patriots who think they need not care for India since they now have two protectors  China and the Muslim Ummah.China, of course, has become a new factor influencing Indias negative attitude towards Pakistan, both among policy-makers and the common people. Our Army chief, General Bipin Rawats egregious remark last year about India being ready for a simultaneous two-and-a-half front war with Pakistan and China (the half front being our own alienated people in Kashmir) has helped solidify an impression that our two large neighbours can never be friendly towards India. If Indias foreign and defence policies proceed on this belief, South Asia is surely heading towards a future of intensified hostilities and conflicts. Arms manufacturers and distant destabilisers will profit by this at the cost of common Indians and Pakistanis, who need employment, education, health care and food-and-environmental security. These needs can be met only through regional cooperation, not regional rivalry.China, part of the solutionIn other words, can China become a part of the solution, rather than being perceived as a part of the India-Pakistan problem? A three-way India-China-Pakistan cooperation is not only necessary but indeed possible, and Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides a practical framework for such partnership. Unfortunately, Mr. Modi has allowed himself to be misled by his advisers on the BRI. The governments opposition to the BRI is based, among other things, on the myopic argument that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under the BRI, violates Indias sovereignty since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Not only does this argument hold no water but it also undermines Indias long-term development and security interests. First, CPEC does not recognise PoK to be Pakistans sovereign territory. Article VI in the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement clearly states in that after the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the sovereign authority concerned will reopen negotiations with the Government of the Peoples Republic of China.... Second, there is little possibility of India ever getting PoK, or Pakistan ever getting the Indian side of Kashmir, through war or by any other means. Therefore, connectivity, cooperation and economic integration are the only realistic bases for any future India-Pakistan settlement of the Kashmir dispute.Third, and most important, both China and Pakistan have stated that they are open to India joining CPEC. China has also expressed its readiness to rename CPEC suitably to both address Indias concerns and to reflect the projects expanded regional scope. Already, Iran, Afghanistan and several Central Asian republics have agreed to join this ambitious regional connectivity project. Will it help or hurt India if it joins this renamed initiative as an equal partner? Will it not connect Lahore and Amritsar (also Delhi and the rest of India), the two sides of Kashmir (which all Kashmir-based political parties want), Sindh and southern Punjab with Gujarat and Rajasthan, and Karachi with Mumbai?Interdependence vitalA no less seminal benefit for India is that by joining the renamed CPEC, it would gain land access, through Pakistan, to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and western China. And if our leaders show vision, ambition and resolve, the CPEC-plus-India can be linked to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor, thus creating a grand garland of connectivity and integration for the whole of South Asia. If 1947 divided our subcontinent, here is an opportunity for India, Pakistan and all other countries in the region to come together and rise in shared progress and prosperity.Regrettably, the same short-sighted advisers who have misled Mr. Modi on the BRI and CPEC are selling India the pipe dream of an alternative connectivity project by the Quadrilateral of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. This is unlikely to take off. Even if it does, its developmental benefits to India will be limited since it will seek to keep China and Pakistan out. We are also told that India does not need the CPEC since it has already partnered with Iran in building the Chabahar port. Indias gains due to Chabahar are modest, and nowhere comparable to those that would accrue by India having a direct land access to Afghanistan through Pakistan, courtesy a renamed CPEC. The latter is also indispensable for the success of two other mega projects that are critical for Indias energy security and accelerated economic growth  the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipelines.Here is another huge potential gain for South Asia. The proposed connectivity initiative, which would create strong new bonds of regional cooperation and interdependence, could also help resolve three long-standing geopolitical problems in the region, in which countless people have been killed  terrorism, Kashmir and Afghanistan.To realise this vision of a resurgent South Asia, two obstacles will have to be removed blind nationalism and the unfriendly designs of extra-regional powers.

He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas.

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,,The Hindu,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy.

5b14a94a9855b744d638c97c,‘Pesticide-free’ poly-houses are catching on,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pesticide-free-poly-houses-are-catching-on/article23377459.ece,2018-03-29,,The Hindu,"Farmer Raju at his poly-house where broccoli is grown without pesticides in Doddaballapur taluk; (right) broccoli crop is selling like hot cakes.B.S. Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal.","farmer raju at his poly-house where broccoli is grown without pesticides in doddaballapur taluk; (right) broccoli crop is selling like hot cakes.b.s. satish kumarat a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.in fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.the indian institute of horticultural research (iihr) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.the main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said m.s. rao, head of iihrs division of entomology and nematology.this will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of rs. 900 crore.what has come as a shot in the arm for the iihr is that a 24-year-old farmer raju in doddaballapur taluk near bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.it is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. but, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.mr. raju, who migrated to karnataka from andhra pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.what has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. the farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of iihr, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. he was able to earn about rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.dr. rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the iihr.it has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.if a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur j. gavaskar, who has taken licences from the iihr to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. big farmers and some farmer producers organisations from pune, some cities in andhra pradesh, tamil nadu and kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.other successesdr. rao said icar-iihr has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, european cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in karnataka, tamil nadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra, and bengal."

But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states.

The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market.

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April. At the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering Madhya Pradesh and Telangana as well. The supplies will recede after April, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said.","nagpur: at a time when tall promises are being made by politicians to double the income of farmers by way of increased minimum support price (msp), and setting up food parks in every district of the country, ryots in vidarbha have been forced to throw away their produce due to low prices.forty-eight-year-old farmer balwant dadwal, who has a farm at mandwa village near hingna in nagpur district, is staring at the mounds of tomatoes he has produced. balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. a vehicle full of tomato crates sent to kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of rs50 a crate, which comes to just rs2 a kg. the recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.pandurang tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below rs50 per crate. he plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. he said the centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in vidarbha region.shriram ghadhave, president of vegetable growers association of india (vgai), said maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. previously, farmers from western maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from vidarbha and marathwada too have started growing vegetables. he also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. as against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. this takes care of their immediate needs. however, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within rs2-4 a kg. in some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.kishore tiwari of vasantrao naik shetkari swavalamban mission (vnssm)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in nagpur, in yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.the rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. there is no system of msp for vegetables, he said.farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. these days, vegetables are being preferred as well. this has led to a glut in wardha. farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said vijay jawandhia, a former shetkari sanghathana activist from wardha.vijay ingle from akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. the rates are down due to oversupply, he said.meanwhile, nandkishore gaur, president of vegetable traders at kalamna agriculture produce marketing committee (apmc) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. normally, the crop is grown in the month of october. however, these days large number of farmers in areas like ramtek and tumsar road in nagpur district have gone for the january crop, which will continue till april. at the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering madhya pradesh and telangana as well. the supplies will recede after april, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said."

But for the bulk orders, we have to make eight-ten packages at a time, which is very time consuming.

Customers will not purchase a bag worth Rs 10 to carry greens worth Rs 20. People must also be advised by the government to carry bags from home, said vendor Hyder Ali.While vegetable vendors are still managing to function, those who sell of pulses and grains are in bigger trouble. The government should have thought of an alternative for businesses like ours. We approached the CCP and they said to charge people for paper bags. Doing that will further decrease our customers, since they will prefer to go to the mall and buy readymade packets of rice instead of coming to the market.

The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100.

The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight.

Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste.

However, it lost steam after few days as the bid of farmer organisations to block transport of milk and other essential items to cities was thwarted by police.Bharatiya Kisan Union Madhya Pradesh general secretary Anil Yadav admitted the impact of the strike was not as expected in MP, and blamed the fear of the police for its failure. The farmers do not want to get into the wrong books of police.

5b24c5b79855b722ac49ae7a,Flight to safety,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/sugarcane-farmers-msp-sugar-mills-yogi-adityanath-agriculture-5129221/,2018-04-09,,Indian Express,"The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.sugarcane farmers in uttar pradesh are owed over rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (sap). maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of rs 2,213 crore as on march 31, that too, against the centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (frp). yet, cane area in maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from october is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of up farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. one reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. the fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from october to april further adds to the attractiveness.but the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. we are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. these are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (msp) through government procurement. sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the frp/sap, though the monies may come with a few months delay. theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. oilseeds and pulses have been trading below msps over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: tomatoes in kolar (karnataka), onions in lasalgaon (maharashtra) and potatoes in agra (up) are currently selling or were just sold at rs 6-7 per kg.given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in madhya pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in punjab. this is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. the policy prescription to address it is simple: the centre and state governments should desist from hiking msps/frps/saps of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. instead, farmers should be ensured of getting msps and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app"

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government.

This young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.What started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says Mansi, Due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. The love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press I decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.Along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., Mansi also made mud modaks during the Ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during Diwali , all infused with paper seeds. And that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. We were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when I came up with the idea last year in January just before Republic Day. I started thinking about making such a product when I saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. What upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. I realised that we as Indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post Republic or Independence Day. I realised I can initiate and make some change, so why not. We produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before Republic Day with the message Dont throw, grow me printed on the back. The idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. We made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the Indian Flag code.The flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. Talking about the seeds that go into the flag, Mansi says, We infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. With the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.Mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, They all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. I have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. On finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. Seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and I knew that Im on the right path.The interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when Mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. Says Mansi, We, are now happy that this Republic Day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. And we all must know and realise the fact that there is no Planet B.","if you feel bad seeing the indian flag tossed away after every republic or independence day celebrations, try the paper seed flag which mumbaikar mansi shah has developed. this young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.what started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says mansi, due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. the love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press i decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., mansi also made mud modaks during the ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during diwali , all infused with paper seeds. and that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. we were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when i came up with the idea last year in january just before republic day. i started thinking about making such a product when i saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. what upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. i realised that we as indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post republic or independence day. i realised i can initiate and make some change, so why not. we produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before republic day with the message dont throw, grow me printed on the back. the idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. we made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the indian flag code.the flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. talking about the seeds that go into the flag, mansi says, we infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. with the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, they all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. i have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. on finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and i knew that im on the right path.the interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. says mansi, we, are now happy that this republic day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. and we all must know and realise the fact that there is no planet b."

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)","one of the oldest civilisations, the indus valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. this is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. farm crisis in india is real, particularly in states like karnataka and tamil nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.this is one side of the coin but agriculture secretary s k pattanayak, a karnataka cadre ias officer, argues that all is not bad with indian agriculture. it has come a long way and this year india is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.but the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of india. a farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. also, if the indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. this is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.for the woes of karnataka and tamil nadu farmers, pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. it is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in maharashtra. sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of bihar and uttar pradesh and perhaps the northeast as it could also be flood protected.punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. the practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. india gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.even in the arid zones of rajasthan and karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of israel. all one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. the government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. this has to be done on a war footing.what is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in india despite the green revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of rs 20,000 annually. one way could be to provide income support as in the us instead of price support by way of minimum support price (msp). because of high msp for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take

It has also started making puree from juicy vegetables like tomatoes and other local fruits like guava, banana and sapota (chickoo).Starting from mango pulp to dried chickoo and all types of frozen vegetables, the South Gujarat region has it all. All types of vegetables and fruits, including their variants, could form a rich export market for gulf countries, the US and UK, earning more than Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years. On the other hand, shrimp farming in South Gujarat has gained prominence over the last decade with export potential of more than Rs 900 crore. Majority of the shrimp export is done from Mumbai and South India ports.Aquaculture expert Dr Manoj Sharma told TOI, For fresh shrimp supply to Gulf countries, an international air cargo in Surat will be a blessing. However, the biggest boon will be on domestic front as we get more than 400 crore shrimp babies from Pondicherry via Vizag and Chennai.

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist","a few farmers sit huddled near a statue of sardar patel at balaguda village in

crops such as rice and wheat being produced. an arid state such as rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.he explains the significance of these diverse realities: an occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in states of the first kind, such as m.p., maharashtra and gujarat. in states such as u.p. and bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. in rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. i have no problem with [prime minister] narendra modi. he says we should sell pakodas if we can and i have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. my problem is with vasundhara raje. rajputs will try to ensure a victory for manvendra singh at jhalrapatan. what is a rajput without self-respect?there has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. there has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.utsa patnaik,economist"
5ce6180fe8e3fc56af411a6e,Turning over a new leaf,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/turning-over-a-new-leaf/article25639490.ece,2018-12-01,,The Hindu,"Rishim Sachdeva wants to visit Copenhagen. He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)","rishim sachdeva wants to visit copenhagen. he is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.the head chef at mumbais olive bar & kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.backyard goodiesin november, the iconic mediterranean fine-dine in bandra, olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. on offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. it is here that bar manager john leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. the garden of eden (rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. the drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. tommys margherita (rs. 750) has agave nectar and el jimador blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.in-house creationsthe drinks are respectable but its olives food that makes the strongest impression. sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across india), and reduced wastage. everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says sachdeva. its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. it makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.take the tuna jerky (rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. the jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. a red velvet fried chicken 2.0 (rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. its finger lickin good. the no-waste sweet corn gnocchi (rs. 375) is a sachdeva favourite. it uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. all the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian xo sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.comfort foodthose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across india and some made in-house. homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a mushroom and truffle arancini (rs. 375). its crisp, gooey and earthy. the baked brie & truffle (rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (burrata and heirloom tomatoes, rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (figs and goat cheese, rs. 395).to round-off the meal is the vodka milk panna cotta (rs. 450). vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. this intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.the menu will see a few additions over the next few months. sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in december. a spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. expect many such experiments in the future, asserts sachdeva.olive, khar (w); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (monday to sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (saturday and sunday)"

5ce671d6e8e3fc56af41337f,It’s time for another green revolution,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/its-time-for-another-green-revolution/article25582864.ece,2018-11-24,,The Hindu,"The organic food movement has been gathering momentum in India over the past several years. Farmers markets emerged on the scene almost a decade ago with Kavita Mukhis weekly market in Bandra that attracts a posse of dedicated shoppers. Since then, markets have sprung up in several neighbourhoods from Nariman Point, Shivaji Park, and Juhu to Powai, Thane and Vashi. In September, Caf Zoe launched a one-of-its-kind farmers market right inside their sprawling, light-filled space.The restaurant partnered with Taru Naturals, which works with small-scale farmers across India to provide resources and clean tech to enable organic farming. We met Tarus founder/CEO Ruchi Jain, who holds a Masters in Environment Change & Management from Oxford University, and is a passionate advocate of natural, organic farming.To marketWhat we need is to have thousands of farmers markets. People need to see that organic can be affordable, said Jain. Affordability has long been a pain point for the organic movement but the fresh fruits and vegetables at Caf Zoes farmers market are surprisingly well priced and of high quality. We stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, both sweet and flavourful, while the pomegranates are the deepest red we have seen and positively bursting with juice. All vegetables and fruits sold at the market come from Anil Rayates farm in Niphad in Nashik district. While farmers around him concentrate on grapes (Nashiks main cash crop), Rayate instead decided to go the organic route in 2009 with a mixed farm where he grows everything from leafy greens to onions, garlic, and other vegetables. He proudly showed us his certification from Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) a government body that certifies organic farming practices across India.I use traditional farming techniques like natural mulching, using jivamrut fertiliser (a fermented mixture of dung and urine of Indian Gir cows, jaggery, soil, and water), and natural fungicide made of fermented sugarcane juice, cow dung, yoghurt etc., explained Rayate.What made Caf Zoe venture into this area? We are now six-and-a-half years old and it has always been our plan to support communities, not just be a restaurant. Luckily we have been blessed with a large space that enables us to do these things, said Tarini Mohindar, co-founder of Caf Zoe. Mohindar had been toying with the idea of a farmers market for a while and had even spoken to a few organisers. But I didnt want to do something that was massive, just create a space where you can go and stock up on your veggies for the week, and you dont pay through your nose for it. You have a certificate that tells you its organic and theres no middleman involved, she explained. Mohindar met Jain at a pottery workshop organised at Caf Zoe (conducted by Jains sister), and was impressed with the work that Taru Organics did at the grassroots level. The restaurant has held two farmers markets since mid-September and the response has been encouraging. The Sunday brunch crowd has been leaving with bags filled with fresh produce as well as organic staples such as millets, dals, indie rice varieties like Indrayani, khapli wheat (emmer, an ancient wheat variety) atta, jaggery, turmeric, and more. Apart from partnering for the market, Caf Zoe sources produce from Taru Naturals, which also supplies to a handful of Mumbai restaurants like Kala Ghoda Caf, The Pantry, The Bombay Canteen, Olive, SodaBottleOpenerWala etc.Growing trendAs restaurants increasingly make an effort to source organic, a growing tribe of entrepreneurs is stepping in to fulfil the demand. One such is Zama Organics founded by Shriya Naheta. She graduated three years ago and returned to Mumbai from Los Angeles only to find that high-quality, organic produce was hard to come by at reasonable prices. What really inspired me to start Zama were the travels I went on after I was back. I went on a few trips to Uttarakhand and happened to visit farms in Pune and Nashik as well said Naheta. She started working directly with farmers to source organic produce locally, and currently works with three collectives  one small-time farmer in Pune and a group of farmers each in Nashik and Uttarakhand. One of my main sources is in Uttarakhand in a remote and inaccessible location above Nainital; they are so particular about crop rotation, and the time they sow the seeds or harvest the produce. They have really great irrigation from spring waters from the Himalayas, amazing air quality, and they have always grown organically. Everything they need for farming is grown in the farm itself; whatever vegetables get spoiled are inevitably converted into compost to be used back in the farming process, explained Naheta. Zama Organics supplies to restaurants like Masque, Suzette, Sequel, Rolling Pin, Quattro etc.Naheta also launched value-added products like honeys, jams, chutneys, and pickles, which were recently showcased at a four-course dinner at Masque. We want to really educate people on the concept of sustainability and gradually but surely create a shift, where people look at the benefits of eating sustainably grown and wholesome food, she said.Jain agrees; Restaurants are the harbingers of food innovation in India. So if restaurants like Caf Zoe make a statement with such markets that support small-scale organic farmers, we can get the message across, she said. Rayate had the last word; Now, everyone knows the ill effects of chemicals used in farming. Natural farming is the only solution if we have to sustain this for our future generations he said.Fresh produce and staples from Taru Naturals (tarunaturals.com) and Zama Organics (zamaorganics.com) can be ordered online with delivery available across Mumbai.

""Unfortunately Dr Jichkar is no more, but I decided to take his research further,"" said Dixit. Since increase of insulin in blood, usually released after meals, triggers obesity, insulin-resistance and type-2 diabetes, Dixit advises restricting all eating during the day to just two meals.""We appointed Dixit as brand ambassador after we found that his diet plan to tackle obesity and diabetes is yielding results,"" said BJP leader Girish Mahajan, who heads the medical education department.Dr Jagannath Dixit, who has been teaching for 26 years and has won several national and state awards, explained that if insulin level rises in blood, it can trigger many health hazards.Once insulin level rises, the body uses glucose for energy; and if insulin level falls, the body uses fatty acids. As baseline insulin secretion cannot be controlled voluntarily, one option is to control the number of times insulin is secreted into the blood after every eating episode. As more or less the same amount of insulin is secreted every time, irrespective of the quantity of food consumed, reducing eating frequency can reduce the insulin level. So, Dixit's advice is to eat twice when one is hungry; in between two meals, one can drink water, diluted, home-made buttermilk, green or black tea (without sugar), coconut water and one tomato.Dixit claims the simple lifestyle modification is effective in losing weight as well as diabetes reversal. ""If one follows the two-meal practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will help in controlling diabetes. Reversal of diabetes is also possible,"" said Dixit.After naming Dixit the ambassador to spread awareness about fighting lifestyle diseases that are proving to be a huge burden for India as well as the state, Mahajan told TOI: ""We have launched a campaign to tackle obesity and diabetes. Dr Dixit has done his own research on the diet plan, obesity and diabetes. He has delivered lectures across the state and international platforms, too, and has come to certain conclusions. We felt it will be appropriate if we appoint him our brand ambassador, it will go a long way in promoting the message to fight obesity and diabetes.""Dixit has been a tireless campaigner for weight loss and reversal of diabetes for the last 10 years, spreading his message through 250 WhatsApp group and other social media platforms.

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Pune: In an eight-month low, the tomato prices in November have fallen to Rs3 to Rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20.","this story is from november 20, 2018in an eight-month low, the tomato prices in november have fallen to rs3 to rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale m... read moredownload the times of india news app for latest citymake sense of the 2019 lok sabha elections and results on may 23 with toi. follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with india's largest news network.pune: in an eight-month low, the tomato prices in november have fallen to rs3 to rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. the prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between rs12 and rs35 per kg in november 2017.the retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at rs20 per kg.in july this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between rs5 and rs 14. and the rates have been going south since then. they are now less than half of what they were in october and november 2017, the data available with the pune agriculture produce marketing committee (apmc) revealed.the tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. apmc officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.last year, the prices were high during this period. anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said vilas bhujbal, the president of the shri chhatrapati shivaji market yard traders and agents association. the farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. this led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, bhujbal added.the government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. the government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. if too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.sanjay pawar, a farmer from nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. apart from nashik in maharashtra, even places in rajasthan and gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. if production is high in rajasthan and gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. also, exports of vegetables to pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.shriram gadhave, the president of the vegetables growers association of india, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.while tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around rs20 per kg. yakub pathan, owner of the fresh vegetable market in wakad, said, wholesale tomato prices have come down to rs3 to rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. even if prices in the wholesale market increase to rs10-rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at rs20."

The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E.

Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan.

The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says. During winter months he sells nalen gurer sandesh and rasogolla.Sunirmal Bose, a 65-year old office peon working at a travel agents office, is one of Bablus oldest and most regular customers. I am a big fan of his malpua and labanga latika, he says. During Vijaya Dashami, I take a whole lot of these home.Every Saturday, Bablu leaves for his village.

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region.","this story is from october 26, 2018representative imagejanuary-like trenddownload the times of india news app for latest citypune: the prevailing drought-like situation in parts of the state may hit the production of most vegetables, sending their retail prices soaring early next year.the situation of water table in october this year is akin to what it usually is during january each year, which is why production of most vegetables, including tomatoes, may dip by around 20% after the next three months, causing a surge in their prices, sources from the all india vegetable growers association said.they said considering the prevailing situation, farmers may also steer clear of sowing vegetables in blocks that are reporting a shortage of water.shriram gadhave, president of the vegetable growers association of india, said the water table has already started dipping in parts of the state. this will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. the tomato prices may rise to rs 80/kg in april next year, he said.vilas shinde, managing director at sahyadri farmers producer company ltd, said, vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their october orders.he said the area from nashik to marathwada , including aurangabad and jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as december. a 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. some effect on vegetable production in eastern pune might also be seen, in locations like indapur, baramati and solapur , shinde added.gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in october, a phenomenon which usually occurs in january. farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.he said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. it is due to this reason that western maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. no impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before january 2019, he said.a state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. a bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. however, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in january and february, he said.another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as pune, satara, kolhapur , sangli, sangamner, nashik, west ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the western ghat region."
