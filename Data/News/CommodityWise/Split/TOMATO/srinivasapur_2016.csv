58d6c963a3d24b1894a6b23c,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,,The Times Of India,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato.","new delhi: tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. but the national horticulture board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. this year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. while some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. the transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as karnataka. this state had a bumper tomato crop this year.though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the december, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.comparative wholesale price figures of november 9 and december 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. onion rates have actually risen in chennai, kolkata and nashik.""the fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. we have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. we have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said a k singh, managing director of the national horticulture board (nhb).

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained.

While Karnataka is the largest producer of arecanut and coffee in India, it stands third in coconut production. The market turmoil has hit arecanut and coconut right around harvest, when supplies are most abundant and grain prices are at seasonal lows.""For the last 15 years, farmers in western ghats and the coast have benefited from both increased production and higher price - leading to rising rural income and declining poverty rates.

Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar.","nagpur: after onions brought tears to consumers, tomatoes are making them see red. acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to rs80 a kg. although it is much less than the record high of over rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. there may be no respite till the winters. chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.as summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. for example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at rs120 a kg. traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. the cheapest are onions and potatoes at rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.in the normal course, markets in nagpur get their supplies of tomato from sangamner near nashik and parts of karnataka and andhra pradesh. the drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. traders have discovered a new supply source at chomu, 40km away from jaipur in rajasthan. representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at jaipur to get as much stock as possible.however, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. the chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. due to the interior quality, it is available at rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.abdul sattar of m/s a jabbar and co at cotton market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within rs25 a kg. this year, it has nearly doubled. though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from karnataka and sangamner. however, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. finally, local traders have discovered a source in rajasthan.suresh javade, also a dealer at cotton market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""the situation will continue until october when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. now, even traders in the south are depending on nagpur to route the chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said manubhai, a trader now camping at jaipur.it has been the same for chillies also. the wholesale rates have gone up to rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. finallym the commodity is now being sourced from jagdalpur in chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said sattar."

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%.

The drop in prices might be good news for consumers, but it is not so for shopkeepers.Selling tomatoes at such low rates is not profitable for traders.

A kg of beans will set you back by Rs. 130, which is a Rs. 44 jump over a one-month period; it was Rs. 86 in the first week of April. In some places, it is retailing at Rs 160 per kg.All-time highThe price of several vegetables has reached an all-time high since January 2016. One of the reasons is a shortfall in supplies, say retailers.Even root vegetables, like beetroot and radish, which usually sell at less than Rs. 20, have crossed the Rs. 40 mark while a kilo of garlic has gone from Rs. 80 per kilo to Rs. 140.A procurement official from a leading retail chain said that supply had dipped to a meagre 35 to 40 per cent of normal. The fall has been attributed to the unusually hot weather during the last two weeks of April and the first week of May when the temperature crossed the 39 degree Celsius mark in many parts of Karnataka. This resulted in crops failure.Vegetables from other StatesWhat has actually kept the prices in check is the supply of certain veggies from other States. Every day, around 150 tonnes of tomatoes are being pumped into the Bengaluru market from Nashik in Maharashtra. Significant quantities of carrot and beans are being supplied from Tamil Nadu.

Among other efforts, it plans to revive karunkanni, a cotton variety getting extinct. It will convert cotton into value-added products, including naturally-dyed yarn, and sell it to other khadi units for cloth production. It has roped in traditional farmers in Athoor and Reddiyarchathiram blocks in Dindigul district to raise this variety. Similar efforts are on to revive 23 traditional cotton varieties throughout the country.These points were highlighted at a workshop on Revival of desi cotton and contemporary khadi held at Gandhigram near here on Monday. Trust secretary K. Siva Kumar said that the proposed facility would procure the entire produce from farmers and add value to it. The main aim was to end farmers marketing problem. This short staple yarn was best suited for producing bandage cloth and bed sheets.The natural dying unit would use cotton to make naturally-dyed yarn to tap emerging markets. Seeds would be supplied to farmers and the unit would act as a full-fledged model centre for organic cotton and value addition. It would also facilitate formation of a federation of desi cotton producers in the State, he added.Ananthoo of TULA Organic Clothing said that 97 per cent of cotton produced in the country before Independence was of traditional variety. The British, who tried to kill native varieties, and introduce foreign varieties could convert just three per cent of farmers. But, after Independence, Indian scientists had successfully killed traditional varieties and converted 97 per cent per cent of farmers into hybrid cultivation.

Efforts were under way to revive these varieties. All Indian varieties had been grown as inter-crop to channa, coriander, chillies, pulses, tomato and onion, he said.Traditional cotton grower Visvasam of Vellode said that 500 acres of karunkanni variety had been raised in Reddiyarchatram and Athoor blocks.

This restaurant, a darshini, serves organic vegetarian. This is the brainchild of four friends  two who worked in a health-insurance office, and two in the software industry.Vivek Patil quit his well-paying job in the insurance company. I worked there for almost five years and observed the disease patterns. I found an unhealthy lifestyle to be the main culprit, in fact eating habits to be more precise. That got me and my friend Srinivas Hatti thinking... and we decided to open a restaurant with health as the main focus, says Patil, who has also enlisted the services of an in-house Ayurveda doctor for consultation. Dr Radhapriya convinced us to open an organic restaurant, he says. Shivanand Naik and Kiran DS, two software engineers, joined in.The most interesting section of their menu is The Health Special Organic Juices. It lists 15 to 20 juices combining fruits and veggies with names indicative of their effect on the body.So you have Flat Tummy (for burning fat), Red Cooler (for reducing cholesterol), Heart Beat (for a better heart), Acid Free (to fight acidity) and Body Builder (for muscle gain). All are prepared under the guidance of the in-house Ayurveda doctor, who is also available for consultation between 7 am and 10 am everyday.Health juices are famously tasteless, so the restaurant has cleverly altered their range to be palatable.Snacks such as Organic Idli, Masala Dosa, and Roti Khara Bhat dont taste like anything out of the ordinary, but it does leave you satisfied that you had something organic.Millets have been used in the dishes and the Millets Special Organic Lunch Menu features millet idlis, millet bhath, millet puliogre, millet sweet and pongal. All taste like they are homemade, bland and familiar.Davangere delicacies such as Davangere Benne Dosa, Girmit (a bhel puri like mixture made from onions and tomatoes, roasted gram powder and puffed rice) and Mandakki Oggarane (again a mixture of puffed rice, roasted gram dal and condiments), and some of the popular dishes from North Karnataka also find space on the menu.

Coffee too has Regular, Black and with jaggery options. In teas, you could have a masala tea made from organic milk.","bengaluru: namma adda, in jp nagar, is one of the newest eateries for the fitness conscious. this restaurant, a darshini, serves organic vegetarian. this is the brainchild of four friends  two who worked in a health-insurance office, and two in the software industry.vivek patil quit his well-paying job in the insurance company. i worked there for almost five years and observed the disease patterns. i found an unhealthy lifestyle to be the main culprit, in fact eating habits to be more precise. that got me and my friend srinivas hatti thinking... and we decided to open a restaurant with health as the main focus, says patil, who has also enlisted the services of an in-house ayurveda doctor for consultation. dr radhapriya convinced us to open an organic restaurant, he says. shivanand naik and kiran ds, two software engineers, joined in.the most interesting section of their menu is the health special organic juices. it lists 15 to 20 juices combining fruits and veggies with names indicative of their effect on the body.so you have flat tummy (for burning fat), red cooler (for reducing cholesterol), heart beat (for a better heart), acid free (to fight acidity) and body builder (for muscle gain). all are prepared under the guidance of the in-house ayurveda doctor, who is also available for consultation between 7 am and 10 am everyday.health juices are famously tasteless, so the restaurant has cleverly altered their range to be palatable.snacks such as organic idli, masala dosa, and roti khara bhat dont taste like anything out of the ordinary, but it does leave you satisfied that you had something organic.millets have been used in the dishes and the millets special organic lunch menu features millet idlis, millet bhath, millet puliogre, millet sweet and pongal. all taste like they are homemade, bland and familiar.davangere delicacies such as davangere benne dosa, girmit (a bhel puri like mixture made from onions and tomatoes, roasted gram powder and puffed rice) and mandakki oggarane (again a mixture of puffed rice, roasted gram dal and condiments), and some of the popular dishes from north karnataka also find space on the menu. be careful with the chilli fritter (bhajji), which is startlingly hot.there is also the special menu for the day with its 10-12 varieties of organic sandwiches. coffee too has regular, black and with jaggery options. in teas, you could have a masala tea made from organic milk."

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time.","more than two weeks after confiscatory demonetisation sucked cash out from the economy, the food market has remained by and large

retailers in kerala is being done through credit. the major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said p solomon of pushpa stores, ernakulam broadway.vijayawadasales down to 20 per cents guru srikanthmarkets in vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of rs 1,000 and rs 500 currency notes. merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. however, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. only volumes have come down. with no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. the situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said vakkalagadda bhaskar rao, president of vijayawada chambers of commerce and industry.in the first week after prime ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. on november 25, they were back to the same level as on november 8. normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. but with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.bhubaneswarrise in prices plus drop in saleshemant kumar routunlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. however, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.in consonance with other states, bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.the arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.sudhakar panda, general secretary of federation of all odisha traders associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.hyderabadconsumers tight-fistedj deepthi nandan reddybarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.this tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. for instance, tomatoes sold at rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for rs 10. prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. buyers have become scarce, said mohammed ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at mehdipatnam in hyderabad. further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched rs 60 immediately after november 8. however, the situation soon returned to normal.bengalurudip in prices of perishablesakram mohammedprices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to bangalore wholesale foodgrains and pulses merchant association. prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. there are three issues here. first, sales have come down. second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. third, small vendors have been hit really hard.a vegetable trader kamraj k said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. however, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. bharath shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the federation of karnataka chambers of commerce and industry, said, i fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.chennaismaller traders take the hitsushmitha ramakrishnanthe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in chennai. there is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. but there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.the shops in chennai that express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. but that has not had an impact on prices.even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.in this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. in that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

They now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.But, that is the least of Jayaramans worries. Ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said Jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.Consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said Jayaraman and his friend M Abdul Khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. This month, I had to send four of my 10 labourers to Bihar where they come from, since I couldnt afford them, Jayaraman added.Apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. For instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.Before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.As a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. Likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.In Koyambedu, Asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. Flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.While calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like Jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.If the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.Its not good for business.Produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apples from Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from Ganganagar in Punjab, seedless grapes from Solapur and sapotas from closer home in Tirupattur.The key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. Some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. We cannot do that, said Jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. If we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.So despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.Abdul Khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.In addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of Rs 1 per square feet a month.Hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, Rs 1,200 would have to be paid.However, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. The last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. So, were hopeful, Jayaraman said.On November 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere Rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at Rs 12.Last week, before Ammas death, it was Rs 7 per kg, said Abdul Khader.","chennai: when k jayaramans customers, mostly small-time vendors, visit his wholesale shop in the koyambedu market at 3 am, they would have already exchanged all the tens and twenties they had made the previous day to either rs 500 or rs 1,000 notes that could be carried in their surukku pai (small drawstring pouch) easily at that odd hour.things have changed since demonetisation. they now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.but, that is the least of jayaramans worries. ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said jayaraman and his friend m abdul khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. this month, i had to send four of my 10 labourers to bihar where they come from, since i couldnt afford them, jayaraman added.apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. for instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.as a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.in koyambedu, asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.while calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.if the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.its not good for business.produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from andhra pradesh and karnataka, apples from himachal pradesh and kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from ganganagar in punjab, seedless grapes from solapur and sapotas from closer home in tirupattur.the key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. we cannot do that, said jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. if we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.so despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.abdul khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.in addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of rs 1 per square feet a month.hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, rs 1,200 would have to be paid.however, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. the last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. so, were hopeful, jayaraman said.on november 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at rs 12.last week, before ammas death, it was rs 7 per kg, said abdul khader."

Shut out of banks and starved of cash for inputs like fertilizer, seeds and pesticides, farmers across the south have slashed their rabi sowing, at some places by more than half the normal acreage.In Ballari, farmers who had already sown crops when Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were withdrawn from the market on November 8 are not much better off and face the risk of losing the investment they had already made. One farmer, Lepakshi Naidu in Hosapete taluk, Karnataka, said he had sown 30 acres of chilli prior to November 8 and now with banks allowing him to withdraw no more than Rs 2000 per day, he was unable to pay workers. The loss of crop over 30 acres could cripple his hopes, he said.Pesticide dealers confirmed that rabi sowing is down by 80 per cent in Ballari and by at least 40 per cent in Telangana, where a fertilizer trader said he would normally do business of Rs 20-25 lakh per day, but had not sold a single bag of fertilizer all week. Farmers across the peninsula said they would trade their produce for a deep discount if only they would be paid in low-denomination bills. But with no one having small notes, that was a remote possibility.For tomato farmers in Odisha, prices have fallen so low (Rs 2 per kg in Bargarh) that it was not even worthwhile to transport it to the market. Traders have been absent from auctions in the vegetable markets, and the only consignments moving are those that had been paid for before November 8. Not that such farmers are happier.Most have put their money in the bank and are now effectively shut out of any access to it.

58fef5217be9e0420db2a12a,Caterpillar cloud on tomatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/nation/story_91510.jsp,2016-06-16,,Telegraph,"UNDER SCANNER New Delhi, June 15: Government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to South America that has slipped into at least four Indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year. ""The United States is taking it so seriously we haven't even given permits to do research (in laboratories) in order to prevent any possibility of the insect's escape (from the labs into farms).""","under scanner new delhi, june 15: government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to south america that has slipped into at least four indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. the scientists at the national bureau of agricultural insect resources (nbair), bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. the pest, tuta absoluta, emerging from peru's andean region, reached spain in 2006, then spread to france, italy, and greece, jumped across the mediterranean into northern africa, moved into eastern africa and the middle-east before it was spotted in maharashtra in 2014. since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across gujarat, karnataka and tamil nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides.

Evironmentalist in him spurred him to take up some green activity in his apartment. The result: he has more than 1,700 plants, including bamboo shoots and vegetable and medicinal plants. These give his house a garden look.Exnora founder Nirmal has nurtured thousands of plants in his 12th floor apartment. Garden can be created everywhere, including your home store room or even in the balcony, Nirmal says. Except his bedroom and a small portion of his kitchen, the entire space, including veranda and terrace, have plants. Since plant produces more oxygen, it is better to avoid that in your bedroom, he says.When I came to this apartment, neighbours initially challenged that plants will not grow as the place has high levels of pollution. However, I proved them that plants can be grown anywhere provided there is good sunlight, 74-year-old Nirmal, who started his house gardening a few years back, said.In his house, one can find plants in handmade jar carved out of thermocol, flowers in wooden bowls and freshly planted crotons in pots. Nirmal also uses bamboo poles for planting. Bamboo can be horizontally placed from a rod fixed to the wall. Now the poles can be filled with soil and with that we can grow small flowering plants in them, he said. His living room too has plenty of plants, including those with medicinal properties. My living room is an oxygen parlour for me, he said.Gardens help to cool the house, he claimed. Nirmal's garden venture could be classified into earthen pot garden, pipe garden, tray garden, bag garden, drum garden and tyre garden. Even canvas shoes could be seen filled with mud and saplings in them.According to him, sufficient sunlight and tailor-made space are necessary to start garden at home.

Handsome hosta will grow in shade areas, he said adding a few others need just little sunlight. Right plants have to be picked for the right spots, he said. For example shrubs or hedge plants should be planted on both sides of the entrance of the house, he added.Nirmal said if sufficient sunlight is not entering the house, most of the potted plants have to be kept outside (terrace).Highlighting the benefits of the terrace garden, Nirmal said it will keep the house cool. The electricity consumed for operating a fan and an air-conditioner will be reduced. It will also calm you down, he claimed. Whenever I see my terrace garden, my mind becomes calm, Nirmal said. Besides decorative plants, he has grown vegetables such as brinjal, ladys finger, tomatoes, chillies, greens and radish on his balcony.The environmentalist claimed that his flat is zero water waste flat. Even the water we use to wash our rice and vegetables go into the plants, because they are full of nutrients, he said. We also prepare our own organic fertiliser to feed the plants. For Nirmal, water is the most precious commodity and the second basic necessity after air. It should not be wasted and plants do not ask you for potable water, he said.Advising people to use sky space even if they live in a small apartment, he said that waste milk trays, which can he hanged, can be transformed into plant growing area. Disposable tyres can be stacked up to hold enough soil to grow plants, he said. Nirmal's 900 sq ft sky farm has over 50 medicinal plants, which he calls green pharmacy.We want people, especially youngsters to know that techniques like these exist and implement them in their houses, he said. More than 200 houses in the city have already taken up the activity.People from other states too have evinced interest in doing this, he claimed. On the advantages of sky gardening, he said people will tend to use the kitchen waste for compost and slowly sewage treatment will also be brought about for water supply.

58ff1f2b7be9e0420db2cfea,River of discontent where 'cusec' is a call for war,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160913/jsp/nation/story_107927.jsp,2016-09-13,,Telegraph,"A woman takes her child from a Karnataka Sangha school in Chennaion Monday. (PTI) Chennai, Sept. 12: Just say ""Cauvery"", and you could end up hitting a raw nerve in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The two states have been fighting for centuries for their share of water from the river, which feeds the rice bowls of both. While less water has been flowing down the river - for both climatic and man-made reasons - the size of the area it irrigates has been increasing in both states, particularly in Karnataka. A tribunal award in 2007 that instructed Karnataka to release 192 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year has aggravated the dispute (it's not yet settled how much the release should be in distress years). When Karnataka has a poor southwest monsoon, like this year, things turn especially tricky as the water stored in its reservoirs is just enough for drinking and not for irrigation. So when the Supreme Court on September 5 directed the state to release 15,000 cusec water every day till September 15 to Tamil Nadu (about 1.3tmcft per day), furious farmers and pro-Kannada outfits in Karnataka directed their anger against the rulers of both states. Today, the top court revised the award to 12,000 cusec a day till September 20. In Tamil Nadu, every small legal victory on the Cauvery (or Mullaperiyar, in the case of Kerala) is flaunted by the ruling AIADMK as yet another feather in Amma's cap. This further provokes the pro-Kannada groups in Karnataka, who see their government as the loser in the duel in spite of controlling all the dams that store the Cauvery's waters. So the easy targets of their anger are vehicles from Tamil Nadu, Tamil films, eateries with distinct Tamil names and the Tamils living in large numbers in Bangalore and Kolar district. As interstate road transport grinds to a halt, trade and the movement of people are hit. While the arrival of tomatoes and onions in Tamil Nadu dwindle, the farmers growing them in Karnataka stare at losses because of the consequent glut. Similarly, milk and eggs from Tamil Nadu stop moving to Karnataka, the tensions thus hitting both states economically. In Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery dispute feeds into the rivalry between the two Dravidian parties to prove which of them is the greater protector of Tamil interests. So the verbal duel between the DMK and the AIADMK grows to its shrillest, with each accusing the other of not doing enough to get Tamil Nadu its share of the water. The two parties often send separate delegations to Delhi to fight the state's case, in contrast to the unity displayed by Karnataka parties. It is in this context that fringe Tamil groups try to grab their brief moments of fame by attacking vehicles from Karnataka or businesses run by Kannadigas. Although they claim that their attacks are aimed at deterring violence against Tamilians, such incidents in these days of 24-hour television news have exactly the opposite effect. ""It was only after New Woodlands (a hotel owned by a family with Karnataka roots) was attacked in Chennai early today that the Adayar Ananda Bhavan in Bangalore (part of a chain of restaurants with Chennai-based owners) got vandalised,"" a senior police officer said. Even when the monsoon is not playing truant, the Cauvery remains a sore spot as Karnataka wants to build one more dam at Mekadattu, 110km from Bangalore, to feed its capital's growing drinking water needs. Tamil Nadu sees it as another plea to deprive it of its tribunal-stipulated share of water. One solution mooted to decrease the two states' dependence on the Cauvery is to link the peninsular rivers starting from Mahanadi in Odisha down to the Vaigai in southern Tamil Nadu. With Tamil Nadu already locked in water wars with three neighbouring states - including Andhra Pradesh -however, that proposal may never take off. Farmers in the Cauvery delta have been slowly resorting to alternative crops that need less water compared with rice. This could create another kind of dependence on other states - for rice - by lowering rice production in Tamil Nadu. ""Even in a good year, the water flow along the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu is hampered by the huge pits created on the riverbed by reckless sand mining. The irrigation channels are not desilted, either, to take the water to the tail-end areas,"" an agricultural scientist said. ""We should address these issues with greater sincerity, too, while we demand our share of the water.""","a woman takes her child from a karnataka sangha school in chennaion monday.

""it was only after new woodlands (a hotel owned by a family with karnataka roots) was attacked in chennai early today that the adayar ananda bhavan in bangalore (part of a chain of restaurants with chennai-based owners) got vandalised,"" a senior police officer said. even when the monsoon is not playing truant, the cauvery remains a sore spot as karnataka wants to build one more dam at mekadattu, 110km from bangalore, to feed its capital's growing drinking water needs. tamil nadu sees it as another plea to deprive it of its tribunal-stipulated share of water. one solution mooted to decrease the two states' dependence on the cauvery is to link the peninsular rivers starting from mahanadi in odisha down to the vaigai in southern tamil nadu. with tamil nadu already locked in water wars with three neighbouring states - including andhra pradesh -however, that proposal may never take off. farmers in the cauvery delta have been slowly resorting to alternative crops that need less water compared with rice. this could create another kind of dependence on other states - for rice - by lowering rice production in tamil nadu. ""even in a good year, the water flow along the cauvery in tamil nadu is hampered by the huge pits created on the riverbed by reckless sand mining. the irrigation channels are not desilted, either, to take the water to the tail-end areas,"" an agricultural scientist said. ""we should address these issues with greater sincerity, too, while we demand our share of the water."""

590a30a77be9e033b96ebace,Halting desertification,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581090/halting-desertification.html,2016-11-14,,Deccan Herald,"Sriroop Chaudhuri and Mimi Roy, Nov 15, 2016 23:16 ISTFOOD, CLIMATE, MIGRATION : About 96.4 million hectares land area (29.3% of total landmass) of India is currently under land degradation/desertificatioIn the last couple of decades, land degr-adation/desertification has grown into an appalling menace to sustainable human development, affecting billions around the world including India, leaving the authorities reeling over dire resource depletion/inadequacy. A major reason for it has been a lack of consensus over a precise definition of desertification.As per the United Nations Convention for Combating Desertification (UNCCD), desertification is virtually any form of land degradation in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, resulting from a combination of climatic variations and unplanned human expansion. Desertification, by newer definitions, is no more just about sand dunes and oasis. Today it means the collective damage caused to the worlds dryland ecosystems.In India, combating land degradation/ desertification has emerged as a top environmental priority to the authorities concerned. India is signatory to the UNCCD and intends to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030. On June 17, 2016, on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), and Arid Zone Forest Research Institute (AFRI), jointly released desertification maps of the country. These maps, compiled by the Space Application Centre, Isro along with 19 partner instit-utes, for the 2003-05 and 2011-13 periods, have brought up some disturbing facts.It appears that about 96.4 million hectares (Mha) land area (29.3% of total landmass) of the country is currently under land degradation/desertification, as compared to about 94.5 Mha (28.7%) during 2003-05. By far, Rajasthan appears to be the hot-seat of degradation/ desertification in the country followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Cumulatively, these nine states account for about 23% of the total land area under degradation/desertification in India.But what bakes the cake really is the state-wise land area under degradation/ desertification. In Jharkhand (68.9%), Rajasthan (62.9%), Delhi (60.6%), Gujarat (52.2%) and Goa (52.1%), over half the land area is under intense threat of land degradation/desertification. To add further to the aggravation, in each on these states/UTs, land degradation/desertification has increased between 2003-05 and 2011-13 period with the worst scenario apparent in Delhi, registering about 11% increase.Desertification/degradation is on steep gradients in the Northeast as well. In Tri-pura, land degradation/desertification increased by about 10.4% between 2003-05 and 2011-13, in Nagaland by 8.7% and Mizoram 4.3%. Overall, in 25 states/UTs, desertification appears to be on the rise.But why the heck we care for desertification of the drylands? Here is what the drylands do: they constitute about 34% of worlds total landmass and are major source of food, especially for the poor. One in three crops cultivated today, including oats, barley, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage and saffron, originated from drylands. About half the worlds livestock is concentrated in the drylands.Recent UNCCD reports suggest that about 52% of worlds agricultural land area is moderate to severely degraded. About 12 Mha of productive land are turning barren annually resulting from desertification/drought, toppling cha-nces of about 20 mt of food grains which acutely exacerbates global food crises.As added vice, desertified areas are noted for their long-range adversities on climate. For example, reduction in vegetation (frequently associated with desertification) cover elevates atmospheric aerosol/dust levels which affect cloud formation and rainfall patterns, carbon cycle, and biodiversity.Visibility crises in Beijing, a well-known menace these days, is believed to have been caused by springtime dust storms originating in the Gobi Desert. Yellow Dust from China costs the Korean and Japanese economy a huge revenue each year. It is also taken for US air quality deterioration in recent times. In China itself, desertification, leading to recurrent droughts and massive crop-losses, takes a nice bite of the countrys annual GDP. Studies find that desertification can hugely magnify global warming in days ahead.But putting aside the tangible issues regarding food/water shortage, and climate, there are others that do not meet naked eye. One such is forced migration. Desertification is destabilising large communities globally, turning them into migrants and homeless refugees.Environmental migrationAn estimated mob of 60 million will migrate from desertified areas in sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and/or Europe by 2020. By 2050, about 200 million people will turn up as perman-ently displaced environmental migrants. Governmental reports suggest that such displaced mob and forced migrants often take to radicalisation and extremism, inciting brutal resource-driven conflicts.Environmental migration is largely triggering political instability, terrorist disturbances, and food/water riots across desertified areas, ultimately spilling over to neighbouring lands. So what can we do to halt desertification? Or shall we do anything at all? Monitoring for causes of desertification should be central any action plan. Aberrant climatic shifts is of course the major impaling factor.But other than climate, unleashed human expansion contributes a great deal to desertification:a) Land cover change (due to urban sprawl): deforestation/logging beyond permissible limits; forest fires/encroachment into forest lands; conversion of native croplandsb) Land management protocol: inadequate soil conservation measures (soil erosion); improper crop rotation /shift in cultivation patterns; improper irrigation schemes (water-logging/leaching); indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals (soil salinisation)c) Overexploitation of natural resources (overpopulation/demand): overgrazing; unplanned groundwater extraction; inequitable sharingd) Lack of resources (tools/funds/ trained professionals) to: support innovative dryland agriculture; reclaim water-logged and/or saline soilsThese days, climate change also is a ramified effect of human expansion (urbanisation/carbon emission/freshwater abstraction) only.

here is what the drylands do: they constitute about 34% of worlds total landmass and are major source of food, especially for the poor. one in three crops cultivated today, including oats, barley, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage and saffron, originated from drylands. about half the worlds livestock is concentrated in the drylands.recent unccd reports suggest that about 52% of worlds agricultural land area is moderate to severely degraded. about 12 mha of productive land are turning barren annually resulting from desertification/drought, toppling cha-nces of about 20 mt of food grains which acutely exacerbates global food crises.as added vice, desertified areas are noted for their long-range adversities on climate. for example, reduction in vegetation (frequently associated with desertification) cover elevates atmospheric aerosol/dust levels which affect cloud formation and rainfall patterns, carbon cycle, and biodiversity.visibility crises in beijing, a well-known menace these days, is believed to have been caused by springtime dust storms originating in the gobi desert. yellow dust from china costs the korean and japanese economy a huge revenue each year. it is also taken for us air quality deterioration in recent times. in china itself, desertification, leading to recurrent droughts and massive crop-losses, takes a nice bite of the countrys annual gdp. studies find that desertification can hugely magnify global warming in days ahead.but putting aside the tangible issues regarding food/water shortage, and climate, there are others that do not meet naked eye. one such is forced migration. desertification is destabilising large communities globally, turning them into migrants and homeless refugees.environmental migrationan estimated mob of 60 million will migrate from desertified areas in sub-saharan africa to north africa and/or europe by 2020. by 2050, about 200 million people will turn up as perman-ently displaced environmental migrants. governmental reports suggest that such displaced mob and forced migrants often take to radicalisation and extremism, inciting brutal resource-driven conflicts.environmental migration is largely triggering political instability, terrorist disturbances, and food/water riots across desertified areas, ultimately spilling over to neighbouring lands. so what can we do to halt desertification? or shall we do anything at all? monitoring for causes of desertification should be central any action plan. aberrant climatic shifts is of course the major impaling factor.but other than climate, unleashed human expansion contributes a great deal to desertification:a) land cover change (due to urban sprawl): deforestation/logging beyond permissible limits; forest fires/encroachment into forest lands; conversion of native croplandsb) land management protocol: inadequate soil conservation measures (soil erosion); improper crop rotation /shift in cultivation patterns; improper irrigation schemes (water-logging/leaching); indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals (soil salinisation)c) overexploitation of natural resources (overpopulation/demand): overgrazing; unplanned groundwater extraction; inequitable sharingd) lack of resources (tools/funds/ trained professionals) to: support innovative dryland agriculture; reclaim water-logged and/or saline soilsthese days, climate change also is a ramified effect of human expansion (urbanisation/carbon emission/freshwater abstraction) only. a disturbing fact about desertification is, it is largely irreversible. so, may be its time we seriously gave in to the uns recent plea stop deserting the deserts. other than building up holistic awareness among the common people, a major push should be to establish transnational partnerships to monitor, assess, re-assess and implement stringent actions plans.(the writers are assistant professors and assistant directors, centre for environment, o p jindal global university, sonipat, haryana)"

591f32c67be9e025a5d4bcbc,"Large farming cooperatives, a solution to farmers' suicides",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/530507/large-farming-cooperatives-solution-farmers.html,2016-02-22,,Deccan Herald,"Large farming cooperatives, a solution to farmers' suicidesBapu Heddurshetti, February 23, 2016 0:07 ISTAccording to the National Crime Records Bureau of India, in 2014, a total of 1,31,666 persons committed suicide in India. Of them, 5,650 or 4.29 per cent, were farmers. Of these, 64.5 per cent were marginal and small farmers.The Bureau also reported that 25.6 per cent of farmers suicides were due to bankruptcy and indebtedness. According to the Niti Aayog head Arvind Panagaria, who conducted a survey in 2008, 20.35 per cent of these suicides were due to drinking and gambling, 16.81 per cent due to failure of crops, 2.65 per cent due to indebtedness and fall in agricultural prices each.The remaining 57.54 per cent were due to other reasons like discord in the family etc. In 2014, 4,400 farmers committed suicide due to drinking and gambling and 1,250 due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices while 3,672 farmers who committed suicide were marginal and small farmers.Suicides committed by farmers due to drinking, gambling and family discordsetc, cannot be termed as agriculture related though persons committing suicides were farmers. But suicides due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices are farmer-specific.Farmers are distressed because of three reasons: their landholdings are uneconomic and unviable; failure of crops due to floods and draughts; and fall in agricultural prices. After Independence, the number of marginal and small land holdings has increased due to land reforms. For example, when land reforms were implemented in Karnataka in 1971, the number of land holdings with less than two hectares was 29,22,000. By 2011, it was 59,87,000.According to the Department of Agriculture in Karnataka, the size of the land holding should be 2.56 hectares to be economically viable. The average size of land holdings of these marginal and small farmers also increased, though marginally, from 0.60 in 1971 to 0.81 in 2011, still leaving the holding economically unviable. It was quite natural that the number of suicides by these farmers also increased.To alleviate the problems of the marginal and small farmers, some people have suggested providing them with improved inputs. But the proper solution to the problem lies in encouraging cooperative farming. If farmers can pool their land by forming a cooperative, then the problem of unviability of the small holdings can be overcome as they will get the benefit of economies of scale. While a single small farmer cannot on his own dig a borewell or buy a tractor, a cooperative farm can easily do so. This may also to a great extent help the small farmers in overcoming the problem of fall in prices of agricultural produce.While a single small farmer may not have the capacity to store his produce and sell it only when he gets a better price and, hence, has to opt for distress sale, a farming cooperative can create such storing capacity and sustain itself when the agricultural prices fall. It is only then that a small land holding can become economically viable and prevent the losses.Since a farming cooperative with large tracts of land in its possession can go for multiple cropping, even if the prices of one or two of its produces fall, no member will be ruined because he will be sharing the profits earned by the cooperative from other produces.Agricultural pricesFailure of crops, which accounts for 16.81 per cent of the suicides committed by farmer, happens mostly due to floods or droughts which are natural phenomena. While crop insurance can be an answer to floods, irrigation could be the answer to droughts.The loss to farmers due to fall in agricultural prices is a man-made phenomenon. Since the demand for agricultural produce is by and large stable, the reason for the fall in agricultural prices is over-production.For example, if tomato fetches a good price in any one year, all farmers opt to grow tomatoes with the result that in the next year, there is over-production and the prices fall. There have been instances when farmers have thrown away their produce on the roads as they could not get a fair price.Some people have suggested solutions sans markets to this problem of fall in agricultural prices. They suggest that a floor price for agricultural produce should be fixed by law and no one should be allowed to sell his produce at a price lower than the statutory price. But then, the problem of fall in agricultural prices is not legal but an economic one and therefore, a legal solution to an economic problem will not ultimately work.Some have suggested the solution of a government intervention in the market by fixing support prices. But since the problem is one of over-production, this will only increase the financial burden on the government rather than solve the problem.The prices of agricultural produce in the markets fall when there is more supply than demand. The demand for agricultural produce, as compared to industrial produce, is more or less fixed. Hence, the demand cannot be reduced. But supply can be regulated to equalise with the demand. In the first instance, supply can be contained at the time of production itself. Since the demand is known, if the farmers can plan their supply, the fall in prices that happens due to over-production can be prevented.To achieve this, production will have to be meticulously planned at the national or at least at the state level. Secondly, if the far-mers can store their produce when the pri-ces fall and wait till the prices rise, they can overcome the problem of excessive supply.If large cooperative farms are encouraged and farming cooperatives can form a federation, it should be possible to plan what to produce and how much to produce depending on the demand. Only such solutions can solve the problems of the farmers and prevent them from committing suicides.","large farming cooperatives, a solution to farmers' suicidesbapu heddurshetti, february 23, 2016 0:07 istaccording to the national crime records bureau of india, in 2014, a total of 1,31,666 persons committed suicide in india. of them, 5,650 or 4.29 per cent, were farmers. of these, 64.5 per cent were marginal and small farmers.the bureau also reported that 25.6 per cent of farmers suicides were due to bankruptcy and indebtedness. according to the niti aayog head arvind panagaria, who conducted a survey in 2008, 20.35 per cent of these suicides were due to drinking and gambling, 16.81 per cent due to failure of crops, 2.65 per cent due to indebtedness and fall in agricultural prices each.the remaining 57.54 per cent were due to other reasons like discord in the family etc. in 2014, 4,400 farmers committed suicide due to drinking and gambling and 1,250 due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices while 3,672 farmers who committed suicide were marginal and small farmers.suicides committed by farmers due to drinking, gambling and family discordsetc, cannot be termed as agriculture related though persons committing suicides were farmers. but suicides due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices are farmer-specific.farmers are distressed because of three reasons: their landholdings are uneconomic and unviable; failure of crops due to floods and draughts; and fall in agricultural prices. after independence, the number of marginal and small land holdings has increased due to land reforms. for example, when land reforms were implemented in karnataka in 1971, the number of land holdings with less than two hectares was 29,22,000. by 2011, it was 59,87,000.according to the department of agriculture in karnataka, the size of the land holding should be 2.56 hectares to be economically viable. the average size of land holdings of these marginal and small farmers also increased, though marginally, from 0.60 in 1971 to 0.81 in 2011, still leaving the holding economically unviable. it was quite natural that the number of suicides by these farmers also increased.to alleviate the problems of the marginal and small farmers, some people have suggested providing them with improved inputs. but the proper solution to the problem lies in encouraging cooperative farming. if farmers can pool their land by forming a cooperative, then the problem of unviability of the small holdings can be overcome as they will get the benefit of economies of scale. while a single small farmer cannot on his own dig a borewell or buy a tractor, a cooperative farm can easily do so. this may also to a great extent help the small farmers in overcoming the problem of fall in prices of agricultural produce.while a single small farmer may not have the capacity to store his produce and sell it only when he gets a better price and, hence, has to opt for distress sale, a farming cooperative can create such storing capacity and sustain itself when the agricultural prices fall. it is only then that a small land holding can become economically viable and prevent the losses.since a farming cooperative with large tracts of land in its possession can go for multiple cropping, even if the prices of one or two of its produces fall, no member will be ruined because he will be sharing the profits earned by the cooperative from other produces.agricultural pricesfailure of crops, which accounts for 16.81 per cent of the suicides committed by farmer, happens mostly due to floods or droughts which are natural phenomena. while crop insurance can be an answer to floods, irrigation could be the answer to droughts.the loss to farmers due to fall in agricultural prices is a man-made phenomenon. since the demand for agricultural produce is by and large stable, the reason for the fall in agricultural prices is over-production.for example, if tomato fetches a good price in any one year, all farmers opt to grow tomatoes with the result that in the next year, there is over-production and the prices fall. there have been instances when farmers have thrown away their produce on the roads as they could not get a fair price.some people have suggested solutions sans markets to this problem of fall in agricultural prices. they suggest that a floor price for agricultural produce should be fixed by law and no one should be allowed to sell his produce at a price lower than the statutory price. but then, the problem of fall in agricultural prices is not legal but an economic one and therefore, a legal solution to an economic problem will not ultimately work.some have suggested the solution of a government intervention in the market by fixing support prices. but since the problem is one of over-production, this will only increase the financial burden on the government rather than solve the problem.the prices of agricultural produce in the markets fall when there is more supply than demand. the demand for agricultural produce, as compared to industrial produce, is more or less fixed. hence, the demand cannot be reduced. but supply can be regulated to equalise with the demand. in the first instance, supply can be contained at the time of production itself. since the demand is known, if the farmers can plan their supply, the fall in prices that happens due to over-production can be prevented.to achieve this, production will have to be meticulously planned at the national or at least at the state level. secondly, if the far-mers can store their produce when the pri-ces fall and wait till the prices rise, they can overcome the problem of excessive supply.if large cooperative farms are encouraged and farming cooperatives can form a federation, it should be possible to plan what to produce and how much to produce depending on the demand. only such solutions can solve the problems of the farmers and prevent them from committing suicides."

Edna Pesis (left) and Susan Luria.After drip irrigation-cum-fertigation, tissue culture and protected cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers, dissemination of Israeli post-harvest know-how is the latest focus of the Indo-Israel Agricultural Project (IIAP).Value-addition in horticultural crops is not just about processing and selling juices. It is also about technologies to maintain the quality of fresh produce for delivering in that form to consumers in distant locations or to harvest, say, pomegranates in September for selling in the US or Europe during the Christmas and New Year season, points out Susan Lurie, professor emeritus at the Department of Postharvest Science of Fresh Produce in the Agricultural Research Organization of Israels Ministry of Agriculture.Israel, according to her, has lot to offer to India when it comes to preservation of quality  texture, appearance, colour, taste, aroma, and nutritional and health attributes  of fresh farm produce, especially for exports to foreign markets.Most of what we produce  from cherry tomatoes and capsicum to mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, lychees, guavas and papayas  is for selling outside Israel. Unlike us, India is big and more like the US, where they grow in California to sell in New York or Boston. Theres no reason you cannot do the same here, which is where we can help, adds Lurie.Edna Pesis, an expert from the same department that is said to be the worlds largest research centre for post-harvest management, illustrates this through the example of mangoes. Mangoes are susceptible to diseases after harvest and prolonged storage, as a result of psychological changes occurring in the fruits that enable fungal pathogen development.An effective means to address the problem is through hot water brushing treatment  spraying a jet of water at about 52 degrees Celsius for 15-20 seconds on the harvested fruits in packing lines. This is followed by drying and waxing or wrapping the fruits with a layer of organic/synthetic waxing material. Hot water brushing significantly reduces decay from fungal development, while waxing prevents water loss that leads to shrinkage and premature ripening of the fruits. Both together help improve the keeping quality and general appearance of the mangoes in supermarket shelves.These apart, there are also other technologies like modified atmosphere packaging that involves covering the fresh produce with special permeable plastic films to reduce humidity. Fruits and vegetables are naturally respiring products, resulting in the condensation of their vapours into water and lowering shelf life. The mistake many people do is to take the harvested fruits directly to the cold storage. Doing that can cause not only shrinkage, but also makes the fruits prone to scalding and chilling injury, explains Pesis.The two Israeli women scientist-experts are part of a visiting team under the IIAP, a programme currently operational in nine states: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

Cultivation has gradually shifted to Varthur and Hoodi lakebeds on the downstream.But here lies the big problem: Highly polluted water from Bellandur flows into the downstream lakes, contaminating the ground water as well. It is mostly this water that is being drilled out through borewells by the farmers.As if this is not hazardous enough, the vegetables are also washed with the lake water before they are loaded onto distribution trucks.Their produce is supplied to vegetable markets in Marathahalli, KR Puram, Whitefield, HAL and other areas within a 20km radius.

These greens make their way to the KR Market and Kalasipalyam outlets, eventually heading to other vegetable bazaars in the city interior.Heavy metal contamination of water can be effectively tracked only with 24-hour sampling, says Priyanka.For the study on Vrushabhavathi, the water was measured day and night.

However, there is some good news, too  the fruit will be much sweeter this summer.Grape production has come down by 15 to 20 per cent in the areas the fruit is grown in Bengaluru Rural such as Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Nelamanagala and Hoskote, according to the Horticulture department officials.The area under grape cultivation has also reduced, say officials. Devanahalli and Doddaballapur, which register maximum grape cultivation, have seen a decline this year.Last year, the area under grape cultivation was 2,300 hectares in Devanahalli, but this year, it has come down to 2,150 hectares. In Doddaballapur, too, the area under cultivation has reduced from 80 acres to 15 acres, said a Bengaluru Rural Horticulture department official.The heavy November downpour destroyed seedless varieties of grapes, which are harvested only once a year. The area of cultivation has also come down as farmers indulged in growing vegetables such as pole beans, tomatoes and other leafy vegetables this year. They also grew guava and flowers, especially Marigold. In Doddaballapur, many farmers are a part of the mango cultivation and expansion programme and this has resulted in the reduction of the area under grape cultivation, the official added.Speaking to Deccan Herald, K M Parashivamurthy, Additional Director (Fruits and Floriculture), Horticulture Department, said the total area under grape cultivation in Karnataka is 20,000 hectares, of which 2,500 hectares is in Bengaluru Rural. The demand for wine grapes has increased because of the growing market for wine products. Farmers and wine companies have tie-ups, he added.Sweeter harvestS V Hittalmani, former additional director, Horticulture department, said the grape produce is sweeter this year due to the early onset of summer. Normally, grapes are grown in hot and dry regions. This time, because the heat was more, it has helped increase the sugar content in the fruit.

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained.
