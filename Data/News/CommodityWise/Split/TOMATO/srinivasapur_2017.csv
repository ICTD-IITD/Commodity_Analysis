The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate.

Photos: P.K. Badiger and SANTOSH SAGAR: Farmers of two districts marked the new year in an unusual manner. Utter frustration and helplessness drove cabbage growers of some villages in Belagavi district to feed their fresh crop to cattle, while tomato growers in Raichur distributed the produce for free.The crash in prices is being attributed to a glut in the harvest as well as the shortage of cash caused by demonetisation. This has resulted in traders refusing procurement, or quoting low prices.The price of cabbage crashed to Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.2 a kg in some of the wholesale markets in Belagavi district whereas in November, it was selling at Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 a quintal.Tomato growers in Raichur are also in dire straits. When a few farmers brought their produce to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard in Raichur, commission agents and traders refused to offer them more than Rs. 1 a kg. Helpless, they began giving away nearly six quintals of tomatoes for free in the Teenkandil locality of the city.Such a low price does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses, said a farmer. There is no point in taking the produce back home as not only is tomato a perishable commodity, it will also incur more transportation charges.A bountiful yield has hardly brought cheer to these farmers. Lakshmanagowda Kadgamdoddi, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, alleged that the price crash was a strategy of APMC traders and commission agents, who purchase from tomato growers in other regions and States on credit. Hence, there was no demand for the produce of local growers, who were being forced to sell at whatever price the traders quote, he said.","cattle feasting on cabbage at a field in kadoli village in belagavi taluk; and (above) people getting tomatoes forfree in raichur. photos: p.k. badiger and santosh sagar: farmers of two districts marked the new year in an unusual manner. utter frustration and helplessness drove cabbage growers of some villages in belagavi district to feed their fresh crop to cattle, while tomato growers in raichur distributed the produce for free.the crash in prices is being attributed to a glut in the harvest as well as the shortage of cash caused by demonetisation. this has resulted in traders refusing procurement, or quoting low prices.the price of cabbage crashed to rs. 1 to rs. 1.2 a kg in some of the wholesale markets in belagavi district whereas in november, it was selling at rs. 700 to rs. 800 a quintal.tomato growers in raichur are also in dire straits. when a few farmers brought their produce to the agricultural produce marketing committee yard in raichur, commission agents and traders refused to offer them more than rs. 1 a kg. helpless, they began giving away nearly six quintals of tomatoes for free in the teenkandil locality of the city.such a low price does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses, said a farmer. there is no point in taking the produce back home as not only is tomato a perishable commodity, it will also incur more transportation charges.a bountiful yield has hardly brought cheer to these farmers. lakshmanagowda kadgamdoddi, district president of the karnataka rajya raitha sangha, alleged that the price crash was a strategy of apmc traders and commission agents, who purchase from tomato growers in other regions and states on credit. hence, there was no demand for the produce of local growers, who were being forced to sell at whatever price the traders quote, he said."

File photo: C. VenkatachalapathyWith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. For a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.The last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. This is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. Many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. These vegetables are supplied from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.From costing Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled toRs. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25.All is not well with onions too. Mr. Balu said the onions supplied from Andhra Pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 in Vellore.Now, the supply from AP has stopped, and onions from parts of Maharashtra such as Pune and Ahmednagar have started to arrive. Those procuring the stock have to pay Rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. So, onions are sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.He added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from Maharashtra to stabilise.Drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. It was sold for Rs. 80.The rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise. The price dropped from Rs. 80 to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 last week, he said.While small onions (a kilo) costs Rs. 20, tomatoes are priced at Rs. 5 to Rs. 8. Potatoes cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 14, while ladys finger is priced at Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. The local thorny variety of brinjal is priced at Rs. 30 a kilo, while carrot is sold for Rs. 10.The rates of other vegetables are  cabbage  Rs. 6 to Rs. 8, ginger  Rs. 20 to Rs. 40, snake gourd  Rs. 12, bitter gourd  Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, pumpkin  Rs. 10, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30.Coconut was sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 8 (local), while those from Pollachi cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.The same rates will continue for a week, Mr. Balu said.","traders in vellore say the quality of some of the vegetables is good but their supply is insufficient. file photo: c. venkatachalapathywith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. for a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.the last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to a. balu, president of vellore town nethaji market kaikari vyabarigal sangam.the rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. this is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. these vegetables are supplied from andhra pradesh and karnataka, he said.from costing rs. 10 to rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled tors. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from rs. 15 to rs. 25.all is not well with onions too. mr. balu said the onions supplied from andhra pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for rs. 5 or rs. 6 in vellore.now, the supply from ap has stopped, and onions from parts of maharashtra such as pune and ahmednagar have started to arrive. those procuring the stock have to pay rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. so, onions are sold at rs. 15 to rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.he added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from maharashtra to stabilise.drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. it was sold for rs. 80.the rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise. the price dropped from rs. 80 to rs. 25 to rs. 30 last week, he said.while small onions (a kilo) costs rs. 20, tomatoes are priced at rs. 5 to rs. 8. potatoes cost rs. 12 to rs. 14, while ladys finger is priced at rs. 25 to rs. 30. the local thorny variety of brinjal is priced at rs. 30 a kilo, while carrot is sold for rs. 10.the rates of other vegetables are  cabbage  rs. 6 to rs. 8, ginger  rs. 20 to rs. 40, snake gourd  rs. 12, bitter gourd  rs. 15 to rs. 20, pumpkin  rs. 10, green chillies  rs. 20 to rs. 30, and coriander (a bunch)  rs. 25 to rs. 30.coconut was sold for rs. 5 to rs. 8 (local), while those from pollachi cost rs. 10 to rs. 20.the same rates will continue for a week, mr. balu said."

How are things? I asked the man selling Prasad. Very bad, Hukum (Sir), he replied in a feeble voice. By this time of the year, thousands of people should have arrived here. The tourists are just not coming! Although by the time December 25 ended, the tourists began arriving and the hotel occupancy was full again.Tanot is a place where the Pakistani army dropped dozens of bombs during the 1965 war. Several of these bombs also dropped in the temple complex, but miraculously none of them exploded. The locals attribute this to the blessings of the Devi and that is why the temple is always thronged by local and outstation tourists. But at the time I visited it, the temple was deserted.The situation was not very different at the clock-tower located in the heart of Jodhpur. Here, vendors have set up stalls to sell handicrafts. My wife stood before a tribal lady selling junk jewellery. We were her first customers of the day.

The afternoon was almost over, but the stalls selling handicraft hadnt got too many buyers.Read: Demonetisation: Window to deposit banned notes nears end as Modi eyes key electionsThe decision on demonetisation has wreaked havoc on farmers, labourers and those who live on the margins. A research-based report in Hindustan Times this week talked about how farmers around the country were forced to sell their vegetables at wholesale mandis at minuscule prices.Onions sold for just Rs 1 per kilogramme in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur and tomatoes for Rs 3 a kg in Karnatakas Kolar. Cauliflower sold for Rs 3 per kg in Patna, peas for Rs 3 in Chandigarh and potatoes for just Rs 2 in Farrukhabad.Clearly the farmers are likely to spend the next few months in deprivation.Small industry has also been hit hard and forced to cut jobs. The government in Uttar Pradesh has even doled out a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to 14 families whose loved ones died while waiting in ATM queues. Opposition parties say the number of people whove met an untimely death in this manner is more than hundred. The 50-day time limit that the prime minister had sought has ended. But people are still awaiting relief from cashlessness. When I passed through the village Bharol in Uttar Pradeshs Ferozabad district, I saw dozens standing in queues to draw money from an ATM. It was the 50th day of demonetisation.Because of these reasons, the Opposition, which had been in a semi-unconscious state for the last two and a half years, has suddenly found an opportunity to become aggressive. As 2017 begins, they want to put up a united front and evolve a combined strategy to corner the prime minister.So many aspersions wouldnt have been cast on the Union government had a few bank officials and their cronies hadnt found ways to dispense the new currency to turn their black money into white. It was highly unfortunate that at a time most bank employees were working day and night to alleviate the side-effects of demonetisation, some of their colleagues were busy sullying the image of the entire banking system. At one time, George Fernandes had said that wherever multinational banks had gone, they had encouraged corruption. Years later, his comment is ringing true. Most of those tainted were private bank employees. Employees of public sector banks also alleged that a larger number of currency notes were made available to private banks.This is an allegation that needs to be investigated.Read: We are with the Prime Ministers demonetisation drive: JD(U)Over the last few days, crores of currency has been recovered in raids across the country. The prime minister has been repeatedly warning at public forums that those still sitting on heaps of illegal currency should mend their ways. In 2017 no mercy will be shown to them. One hopes the government has set its sights on the big fish. The people still have confidence in the prime minister. And the man on the street is with him.Those who jump to hasty conclusions believe the PM has failed in his ambitious endeavour. Is that true? To find an answer, we return to the lady selling junk jewellery in Jodhpur. I asked her if she knew who had taken the decision to demonetise currency. Modiji, she replied. Is that a good thing or bad? The lady anxiously waiting for her first sale had her answer ready: Its good. Similarly workers engaged in repairing the Khama Fort near Jaisalmer said they were poor people. Theyd braved odds all their life but were confident that Mr Modi will set everything right.Clearly the common mans confidence in Modi hasnt been shaken. To keep it going, the Centre will have to make a Herculean effort. A lot will also depend on the manner in which the Indian economy responds. Assembly elections are due in five states including Uttar Pradesh in the next few months. Apart from a verdict on the incumbent governments in these states, these elections will also be a referendum on this bold initiative. If the prime minister and his colleagues can overcome this challenge, his popularity will rise more than any of his predecessors. If that doesnt happen, hell have to spruce up his politics once more, since the assembly polls of 2017 could well script the prologue to the 2019 general elections.Last, but not the least, greetings for the New Year!

The elephant was part of a small migratory herd from the North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary that stretches from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu.The accused, whose identity was not known, were from the same village and had allegedly indulged in wild boar hunting in Ulipandaa in the past. Hunting of wild boars is an offence in Tamil Nadu, though the Central government had declared the species to be vermin in a few States.On Monday night, the accused A.Basavaraj (34), son of Anumadhappa, and his friend T.Madesh, son of Thimmarayappa, were reportedly waiting in a tomato field. Basavaraj had taken the land adjoining the tomato field on lease for cultivation.The duo and three other men were waiting for the wild boar, when they spotted the elephant grazing afar.

Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation.

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies.

And this is only a conservative figure coming from the government. If one goes by the figures provided by farmers' associations, the number would swell to 6-7 suicides per day. The record heat and drought of 2017 could spell disaster for the farming community in the state, which has already seen 848 suicides in 2016-17, until February.Karnataka witnessed a record 1,478 suicides in 2015-16 due to severe shortage of rainfall, which put farmers in distress. They were unable to get desired prices for their produce and were neck-deep in debt with nationalised banks and private moneylenders. Regardless of what political parties may have said, the disturbing trend has proved beyond doubt that agriculture is no more a profitable venture.Getting back to governance after a fortnight full of bypoll politics, the Siddaramaiah government has a daunting task at hand of maintaining stability in the face of a severe drought. Even though the state government is trying to make agriculture profitable, estimates by the Karnataka State Agriculture Prices Commission indicate that it's far from so.The North Karnataka districts witnessed the highest suicides last year. This year, the cloud has moved over to the Malnad areas as several reservoirs here are dry since the monsoon failed and the groundwater plummeted.While Haveri district has topped the list with 86 suicides, Dharwad district witnessed 73. The coffee-growing district of Chikka-magaluru saw 70 suicides, followed by Mysuru and Mandya with 50 and 51 suicides, respectively. Both Mysuru and Mandya depend on Cauvery River for agriculture.Four consecutive years of drought are already weighing down on Karnataka's farmers. And now, reckless use of groundwater to compensate for the poor monsoon has only made things worse for them. The state budget, which made no mention of a loan-waiver, came as a huge disappointment for them.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of the sugarcane growers association, said: ""The government should have planned to prevent suicides. It failed to learn from last year's mistakes and the result is that even this year, there have been suicides. In less than one-and-a -half-years, as per our estimate, close to 3,000 farmers have committed suicide across Karnataka. Our only demand is that the government must stop loan recovery and waive off the loan. Shivanna (52) of Mandya district committed suicide when bank authorities slapped notices on him for the repayment of a loan of Rs 5 lakh. His entire paddy crop had perished as there was no water in the Cauvery basin this year.""While Siddaramaiah has made it clear that the Centre should waive the loan, farmers have a different understanding of the logic. ""If he (the CM) can give others, why can't he give to us? The CM claims that he cannot waive off the loan, but he has money to appoint a pay commission to revise the salaries of state government employees, which runs into several crores. If the exchequer is short of money, what was the reason for the government to procure new vehicles for presidents of zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat? What was binding on the government to increase the salary of MLAs, MLCs and ministers? Farmers and agriculture are not a priority for this government and it has been proved time and again,"" said Shanthakumar.Besides estimating that growing several crops would actually leave a farmer in loss, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has attributed the continuing trend of farmer suicides to demonetisation and unscientific cropping pattern.TN Prakash Kammaradi, chairman of the com-mi-ssion, said: ""Demo-ne-tisation has literally taken money out of markets. Because of this, there is no purchase of produce in the market. When there is no purchase in market, how can you ensure profit for farmers?""""The centre should have been more proactive in this regard rather than leaving things entirely to the states. Instead, it is going in for zero duty import of pulses and sugar, which will be detrimental to our farmers.""Rather than importing, the same money should have been diverted and given to farmers as a minimum support price (MSP). Centre's policies are driven by inflation and consumer interests rather than to benefit farmers,"" he said.Prakash also opined that the unscientific cropping pattern and season-bound production of crops has also resulted in severe losses.""In some regions, farmers take to the cultivation of just one crop, resulting in excess production and fall in prices. Under favourable conditions, all farmers in Kalaburagi go after tur dal or farmers in Kolar flood the market with tonnes of tomatoes. We need to have a proper cropping plan and farmers have to stick to such rules to get effective prices for their produce,"" he said.Considering the market fluctuation until December 2016, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has estimated loss and profit per acre for cultivation of each crop across Karnataka. As per the report, cultivating several staple crops would actually result in losses for farmers.Even though a few crops bring in profits, it would be insignificant. Cultivating several crops such as paddy, ragi (finger millet), foxtail millet, urad dal, sunflower, and coconut has only caused losses.","did you know that in karnataka , 2-4 farmers kill themselves every day? and this is only a conservative figure coming from the government. if one goes by the figures provided by farmers' associations, the number would swell to 6-7 suicides per day. the record heat and drought of 2017 could spell disaster for the farming community in the state, which has already seen 848 suicides in 2016-17, until february.karnataka witnessed a record 1,478 suicides in 2015-16 due to severe shortage of rainfall, which put farmers in distress. they were unable to get desired prices for their produce and were neck-deep in debt with nationalised banks and private moneylenders. regardless of what political parties may have said, the disturbing trend has proved beyond doubt that agriculture is no more a profitable venture.getting back to governance after a fortnight full of bypoll politics, the siddaramaiah government has a daunting task at hand of maintaining stability in the face of a severe drought. even though the state government is trying to make agriculture profitable, estimates by the karnataka state agriculture prices commission indicate that it's far from so.the north karnataka districts witnessed the highest suicides last year. this year, the cloud has moved over to the malnad areas as several reservoirs here are dry since the monsoon failed and the groundwater plummeted.while haveri district has topped the list with 86 suicides, dharwad district witnessed 73. the coffee-growing district of chikka-magaluru saw 70 suicides, followed by mysuru and mandya with 50 and 51 suicides, respectively. both mysuru and mandya depend on cauvery river for agriculture.four consecutive years of drought are already weighing down on karnataka's farmers. and now, reckless use of groundwater to compensate for the poor monsoon has only made things worse for them. the state budget, which made no mention of a loan-waiver, came as a huge disappointment for them.kuruburu shanthakumar, president of the sugarcane growers association, said: ""the government should have planned to prevent suicides. it failed to learn from last year's mistakes and the result is that even this year, there have been suicides. in less than one-and-a -half-years, as per our estimate, close to 3,000 farmers have committed suicide across karnataka. our only demand is that the government must stop loan recovery and waive off the loan. shivanna (52) of mandya district committed suicide when bank authorities slapped notices on him for the repayment of a loan of rs 5 lakh. his entire paddy crop had perished as there was no water in the cauvery basin this year.""while siddaramaiah has made it clear that the centre should waive the loan, farmers have a different understanding of the logic.

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017.","sunil kumar, a 31-year-old farmer in tondala village, kolar district, 85 km east of bengaluru, lost rs 300,000 in november when tomato prices crashed after the november 8, 2016, scrapping of 86% of bank notes, by value, and the excess supply of vegetables.kumar, who cultivates tomatoes on his five-acre farm, said he made a profit of rs 30 lakh during the same time last year.the 110% drop in income from 2016 has come at a time when the weatherand so the harvestwas good this year, said kumar. so, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. with money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.a 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between rs 30 and rs 50 (instead of rs 700 at its peak), said kumar. i had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. so, i uprooted all my tomato plants in late november to minimise the loss. this is the worst we have seen in my experience.kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in karnataka, and houses asias second-largest tomato market. in november, the ruling price of tomatoes in the kolar market was rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.kumars case is echoed across india. the price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, the new indian express reported on december 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in nashik, hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.worst hit: southern tomato farmers, western onion farmerstomato farmers in karnataka and tamil nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in maharashtra and gujarat, according to an indiaspend analysis of vegetable prices in seven indian citiesahmedabad, bengaluru, chennai, hyderabad, delhi, kolkata and mumbaibetween november 2015 and november 2016.source: national horticulture board;

Cost of supply chain include 5% commission and 1% hamali and other handling cost. This cost will be significantly higher in unorganised sector due to involvement of middlemen at multiple levels.Interestingly, the ruling Congress has refused to denotify perishables despite directions from the party vice president Rahul Gandhi to all the Congress-ruled state governments in 2014.

The scientists describe it as a serious pest as the vine was killed by the insects.Joshi and his colleagues reported in the journal Current Science that they collected this insect in large numbers from Vittal, Karnataka which is near the major pepper-growing area of Kasargod in Kerala.The insect can easily spread to such areas in Kerala and become a serious pest, they said.The third species Trijuba oculata was also reported from Bengaluru and Mandya. It could be a threat to custard apple trees and grapevines in Karnataka and Maharashtra.The fourth species Pulvinaria urbicola, Joshi said, was a notoriously destructive one that can be a big threat to potato, tomato, brinjal, bell pepper and capsicum.

His village of Kannamoochi lies a few kilometres from Mettur Dams reservoir. This is where Cauvery comes to after a run across the plains of Dharmapuri district. Coursing along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, it tumbles over Hogenakkal Falls and is captured by Stanley Reservoir in Salem district.It used to be a majestic reservoir, created in 1934 during the construction of Mettur Dam, now the subject of more litigation than irrigation. Now its a memory for most of the year.Seven of Thavasi Rajs nine borewells are dry. Whose arent in this summer of discontent? But this is the flood plain of Cauvery, and the depth of his two functional borewells indicate how deep the river has sank. One is 1,100ft and the other 900ft, reports Thavasi. The speed of water from the second one has gone down, and Im scared itll stop working soon.Thavasi is lucky to have any water at all. Smaller farmers cant afford to burrow so deep. Im just lucky because there is still some ground water left in Kannamoochi, he says.Salem is big on horticulture. Orchards occupy roughly 25 percent of all cultivable land: chillies, turmeric, plantain, tapioca, areca nut, tomatoes and other vegetables. The famous Salem mangoes are grown in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.This year, inflorescence was promising in January, but never came. Now farmer R Venkatachalam of Vanavasi village is showing us the fruit of his labour. Its a tiny Kiimooku that fits into the pit of his palm. Kiimookus grow to 300gm, but this one is 100gm.Venkatachalam and his brother Raju R struggled all spring to irrigate the 600 trees they have in their 10-acre orchard. They bought dozens of 5,000-litre tankerloads, each for Rs 600-700. But the deliveries were never prompt. Other farmers needed water too.In the village, another farmer, P Kasigounder, reels off his losses: 25 percent in 2015, 50 percent in 2016 and 85 percent this summer. I lost Rs 3 lakh, says Kasigounder. The kind government offered Rs 5,900 as drought relief.Further off from the Mettur Dam, we stop at the field of Selvaraj R in Kolathur. Its barely 8km from Stanley, but his chilli field is cinder-dry with his cattle scrounging for tufts of grass. A chilli field beyond him has been baked bronze. Selvaraj plucks a pepper and holds it up by the stalk like a scientist would a lab rat. How will anybody buy this! he sighs.Kolathur chillis are known for their kick on the palate. They are the flavourful condiment vathal milagai you get with South Indian food. The local trick is to allow the chillies to ripen and dry in the field and take them straight to the shandy (market). This year, the pods didnt stand a chance.The Kolathur chilli crop yields five or six harvests in 15-day intervals during the February-May period. This year, farmers lost 80-90 percent of it. The crop withered even before the first harvest.The February-March period was a desperate time in horticulture villages like Thalaivasal. One farmer, P Kalayarasan, said he struggled to keep his crop alive as his only borewell began to die. We spent Rs 25,000 to save our chilli field. It was of no use, he said. Now we dont have water for cattle.Some five per cent of the crop made it to the market in the Thalaivasal block this year. With time on his hands, Kalayarasan remembers the good times: During peak seasons, we used to bring chillies to the shandy in 10-15 bicycles and sold it at Rs 150 per kg. It wasnt only short-duration crops like chilli that didnt survive. Coconut and areca nut groves gave horticulturists as much grief.Areca begins yielding in three years and lives up to 35. But 65 percent of the trees died in Salem district this year. Farmer Pandian P said that 2015 hadnt been a good year either, but his two borewells saved him. In 2017, both gave up.How some beat the droughtDrip, drip, dripAmidst the vast expanse of dry fields in Kannampoochi village, one tiny field of plantain, belonging to farmer Thavasi, looked like it had a tinge of green. At the foot of the boles, a black pipe snakes along the ridges on which the plantain saplings grow. Drip irrigation trickled into Salem about a decade ago and it is gaining popularity given that drought has blighted the region.This year, Thavasi has made a profit because, although banana production fell due to drought, the drip saved his crop. If a well irrigates one acre of land, a drip takes care of two-three acres, he says. I dont think I would have had a crop without it.The districts horticulture department offers a total subsidy to small farmers (those owning less than 5 acres) and a 75 per cent subsidy to big farmers. However, drip irrigations popularity is restricted to plantains and tapioca. It has not spread to other crops.Plastic mulchAnother new technique used by vegetable and tapioca farmers is plastic mulch  a long sheet of plastic with several circular holes in it. Several acres of vegetables are grown in these holes. These mulches reduce evaporation, control growth of weed and can be re-used for a second harvest, a horticulture official says. Between 2014 and 2016 over 100 hectares of land were mulched in Salem. This technique is applied alongside drip irrigation.Pitcher irrigationPitcher irrigation is another strategy implemented in some parts of the district. An earthen pot with a lid on top and holes at the bottom is buried in the soil. Crops, particularly vegetables, are sown around the pitcher. This ensures water does not evaporate and reaches only the roots. But the technique is less popular than mulching.Go tapiocaTapioca is used for making sago and starch. Salem contributes to about one-third of all sago produced in India. Although tapioca is drought-resistant, its cultivation has gone down by half, according to the horticulture department. If tapioca gets affected by a drought, chances are that the situation is very severe, a senior official said.","vessel in hand with thirst to quench, a farmer ventures towards the arid unknown in avinashi village in tirupur, where even coconut trees are struggling to stand tall | a raja chidambaramsalem: banana farmer thavasi raj has nine bore wells. his village of kannamoochi lies a few kilometres from mettur dams reservoir. this is where cauvery comes to after a run across the plains of dharmapuri district. coursing along the karnataka-tamil nadu border, it tumbles over hogenakkal falls and is captured by stanley reservoir in salem district.it used to be a majestic reservoir, created in 1934 during the construction of mettur dam, now the subject of more litigation than irrigation. now its a memory for most of the year.seven of thavasi rajs nine borewells are dry. whose arent in this summer of discontent? but this is the flood plain of cauvery, and the depth of his two functional borewells indicate how deep the river has sank. one is 1,100ft and the other 900ft, reports thavasi. the speed of water from the second one has gone down, and im scared itll stop working soon.thavasi is lucky to have any water at all. smaller farmers cant afford to burrow so deep. im just lucky because there is still some ground water left in kannamoochi, he says.salem is big on horticulture. orchards occupy roughly 25 percent of all cultivable land: chillies, turmeric, plantain, tapioca, areca nut, tomatoes and other vegetables. the famous salem mangoes are grown in dharmapuri and krishnagiri.this year, inflorescence was promising in january, but never came. now farmer r venkatachalam of vanavasi village is showing us the fruit of his labour. its a tiny kiimooku that fits into the pit of his palm. kiimookus grow to 300gm, but this one is 100gm.venkatachalam and his brother raju r struggled all spring to irrigate the 600 trees they have in their 10-acre orchard. they bought dozens of 5,000-litre tankerloads, each for rs 600-700. but the deliveries were never prompt. other farmers needed water too.in the village, another farmer, p kasigounder, reels off his losses: 25 percent in 2015, 50 percent in 2016 and 85 percent this summer. i lost rs 3 lakh, says kasigounder. the kind government offered rs 5,900 as drought relief.further off from the mettur dam, we stop at the field of selvaraj r in kolathur. its barely 8km from stanley, but his chilli field is cinder-dry with his cattle scrounging for tufts of grass. a chilli field beyond him has been baked bronze. selvaraj plucks a pepper and holds it up by the stalk like a scientist would a lab rat. how will anybody buy this!

She is in her early 60s and her family has been doing the laundry for 15 families for generations. As is the tradition for rural dhobis, she is paid at wedding time in cash and new clothes. Or she is paid in paddy every year, 50 seru (one seru is a little over a kg) per person in her household.Hulligeammas life depends on water. She makes a living from it and gets paid in produce that needs it. So the current drought has hit her harder and Hulligeamma is crying hoarse about it.Rajoli is a village in the drought-prone district of Raichur (rainfall less than 650 mm) in Karnataka. It has seen six consecutive seasons of deficient rainfall. In the past monsoon year, two cycles of rain (the southwest monsoon from June to September and the northeast from October to December) were short by 15 per cent and 71 per cent respectively in Karnataka.Farmers in Rajoli suffered losses on their cotton crop last season with high temperatures causing a pink bollworm attack, and switched to red chilli. But too many people planted chilli and prices crashed this year.It was a bitter harvest. Standing chilli crops have been burnt to avoid the reaping expenses. Many fields are dotted with abandoned heaps of chilli, like hot blisters.With little money to go around and barely enough water, tempers are short and generosity scarce.All of Rajolis drinking water sources have dried up and its people have to go to a tap in Irapuram village, 3 km away. Hulligeamma says, You will have to go without drinking water if you dont have a two-wheeler.The gram panchayat has tried to ease the villagers hardship by renting a tap from a farmer for Rs 8,000 a month but it rarely serves all the families.There are 11 people in Hulligeammas family: three sons, three daughters-in-law, three grandchildren, Hulligeamma and her paralysed husband. Her youngest son brings drinking water, four pots every two days, for the entire family on a borrowed motorcycle.He gets up at 6 am and spends an hour at the tap, she says. Often there are people from Irapuram too. Then he has to wait till they are done, which means he has to spend nearly two hours at the tap.If the boy falls ill, then the family simply has to make do with what is left because none of the others knows how to ride a two-wheeler. Should that happen, the good water is reserved for the older people and the younger ones drink salt water. Salt water gives us diarrhea, Hulligeamma explains. At least the young people have the health to withstand it.Sometimes, she begs the neighbours to fetch her a pot too. They can be insulting, she says. They dont have enough to be generous.The dhobi community of Rajoli live along a three feet wide canal. Theres a tap that gives salt water for a few hours in the evening and each family might get five to eight pots on a good day. If the children have any play time after school, they are handed water pots to go look for a tap.Food is cooked in salt water so the dal ends up rare. We have to pour oil and even then it is only half cooked, says Hulligeammas daughter-in-law. Better-off neighbours with fewer mouths to feed, like Yeramma Iraimatti, have switched to vegetables like ladies finger and tomatoes. Yeramma is also one of the rare few who orders water cans from a store.Last week there was a wedding in the wealthier part of the Rajoli. Barely in their twenties, Nagesh and Saraswati wed in the presence of over 500 guests and nearly a hundred stayed over in the neem-shaded house. The young groom says, We had to hire tankers for the water: Rs 500 for the tanker and Rs 800 for a tractor to pull it... I drove it myself. We need two such tankers a day. I wish I hadnt married.Hulligeamma has been called in to do the laundry. Normally my daughters-in-law and I would take the clothes to the canal nearby, she says, but that has dried up. Her regular customers send her a lesser load once a week. Earlier the upper-caste households used to send a bundle twice a week.There is the water stored in a drum (500 litres).

Its their ATM in fact. The rural economy here would have been battered but for African Tall Maize (ATM).The crop is providing an assured and steady income for farmers while also boosting dairy farming with a regular supply of fodder for cattle. ATM, a low water-intensive crop, is being grown throughout the year now as a fodder crop.Concerted efforts by local farmers, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and the Kolar district administration in encouraging cultivation of ATM are now paying dividends.Suresh is among the many farmers in Doddahasahalla village of Kolar taluk who have entered into an agreement with the local milk cooperative union to grow ATM. ""Earlier, I used to grow tomato or other vegetables, he says. The problem with tomato is that you are never sure of the income. If all goes well, I might make Rs 1.5 lakh per acre in one season and almost nothing the next.""Fed up with unpredictable rains and unreliable support prices, Suresh decided to grow ATM. Now he is assured of around Rs 50,000 per acre with the ATM fodder pre-sold to dairy farmers in his village.M Venkatesh, a farmer of E Kamballi village is an ATM fan too. ""Earlier, it was difficult to get fodder, especially in the summer.We used to import dried fodder from Andhra or Tamil Nadu which is not good for cattle,"" he said. It was also a costly affair, as each kilo of dry fodder costs Rs 10-15. Due to ATM initiative ,farmers like Venkatesh are now getting fresh fodder for less than half that amount.Dry fodder, according to Dr Chennakeshava, deputy director of animal husbandry, causes a lot of complications for cattle. ""Apart from causing blisters in their mouths, dry fodder results in kidney stones among cattle and reduces the quality and quantity of milk produced,"" he said.Dr Srinivas Gowda, deputy manager of KMF, said that since November 2016, the states Animal Husbandry Department and KMF have distributed almost 70,000 mini-kits of ATM seeds. He said agreements are being made with farmers to grow all the fodder that is required to feed cattle in the district. ""ATM fodder has increased the quantity of milk generated by two to three litres per animal, he added.Speaking to New Indian Express, Dr K V Thrilok Chandra, deputy commissioner of Kolar district, explained that such a project was essential, as 90 per cent of the 2.76 lakh heads of cattle in the district were milch cows. ""Since starting this project, the solid not fat (SNF) content of milk too has increased, making farmers eligible for incentives offered by the state government,""he said.Though there are several other projects to improve water availability, and others are being implemented in the district, the ATM project has impacted many people in a short period.

Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers.","farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. chilli farmers in andhra pradesh and telangana, tomato growers in karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. but whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. for one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. for instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.price fluctuationssecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. this comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. when farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.such competition though is precisely what is missing from the indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. the result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in india is wasted because of it. this, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. this significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. by some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing indian farmers."

A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. these are the three factors agitating indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of indias 1.2 billion people.as anger sweeps rural madhya pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an indiaspend analysis and reportage from rural maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.the primary reason farming is unviable in india is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of indian agriculture.it is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.those are the larger issues. here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply.

I had cultivated tomato on a two-acre plot and invested Rs. 2 lakh. Now, at the time of harvest, the rates have crashed, said Nagarajappa, a farmer in Mallasandra, Kolar taluk. I am going to suffer a loss of a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh, he said.Currently, tomatoes are being cultivated on an estimated 9,850 acres of land across Kolar district.Most farmers are struggling to get the produce into the market, and they feel it is not worth the effort. We are not even able to cover the cost of labour and transportation, K.M. Nagaraj of Srinivasapur taluk said.Varying pricesThe lack of standardisation in prices is also cause for concern.For instance, a 15 kg box fetched only Rs. 25 at Srinivasapur APMC yard on Saturday, which is less than Rs. 2 per kg. However, at Kolar APMC, the rates were marginally better: a 15 kg box was going for anywhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 (about Rs. 4 per kg) on Saturday.Only a month ago, tomatoes fetched on an average Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 for a 15 kg box, which is around Rs. 13 per kg. Farmers were relatively happy with this price.A farmer can reap profit only if they get at least Rs. 300 per 15 kg box. The government should come forward to provide relief to the farmers, said P.R. Suryanarayan, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha district unit, Kolar.Price variations are forcing farmers to leave tomatoes to rot in the field. Dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common scene in the district.However, while there is a glut in the market as more farmers have taken up tomato cultivation, the slump in demand in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is being seen as the main reason for the crash in price.

An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A

in 2016-17. so was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the state into despair.while most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.after the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned dr. r.s. deshpande, former director of the institute of social and economic change (isec), bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.chilli woesa long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both telangana and andhra pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.however, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from april first week. as the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior telangana agriculture department official told the hindu . but, it was not to be. the centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in telangana with a support price of rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.the crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.few takers for grapesthe suicide of 36-year-old manik randive and 25-year-old chetan vasal, both from nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. according to shriram gadhave, president, vegetable growers association of india, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. the average input cost per acre of grape was rs. 3 lakh. yet farmers were selling their produce at barely rs. 2 lakh, he said.according to him, in april last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.farmers even received a decent rate of rs. 40-42 per kg. this year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry rs. 8 a kg.dent in tur pricestur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. in maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.the total purchase by the government through its agencies at a minimum support price (msp) of rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the msp through the agriculture produce market committees (apmc). several lakh tonnes remain unsold.but, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. for instance, even though a consumer paid almost rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just rs. 45 to rs. 50, said dr. deshpande. does it take rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.echoing dr. deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, mr. srinivas, a progressive farmer from t. narsipura near mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( with inputs f romlaiqh a khan in mysuru, b chandrashekar in hyderabad, shoumojit banerjee in pune and alok deshpande in mumbai )"

The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village lodh in mandsaur district. pti photo madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village lodh in mandsaur district. pti photothe farmers protests in madhya pradesh (mp) and maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. if such unrest could happen in mp, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-gdp growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.mp has been a showcase for the performance of bjp-ruled states in agriculture. but it now appears that agriculture could be prime minister narendra modis achilles heel. the governments poor performance in the sector at the all-india level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the pm heavily in 2019.what has really gone wrong with agriculture during the modi era?

5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,,Indian Express,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestwhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in november, would significantly impact farm production. we were proved wrong. good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. they successfully weathered the demo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: potatoes in farrukhabad, uttar pradesh, fetched below rs 350 per quintal this february, compared to rs 600 or more last year. moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed rs 1,100/quintal by mid-may, they are stuck even now at rs 350-400. the same goes for rabi onions in lasalgaon, maharashtra, that traded at an average of rs 450 per quintal in may, as against rs 750-800 and rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at kolar, karnataka, in early may for rs 300-400 per quintal, down from rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.when was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within rs 20/kg?

We quite like the kairi chutney that makes our mouths water and eyes shrivel, but little do we know that the raw garlic chutney is just our first tryst with a meal that feels as it was meant to keep vampires at bay.For the vegetarian options, we choose the non-traditional: paneer ajadina (Rs. 180), which has cubes of crispy cottage cheese in a sukka masala of grated coconut, kundapura masala of chillies, cumin, coriander seeds and fenugreek. A tad bit too salty, the sukka is high on finely-chopped garlic that we wish had been used more discreetly. The non-veg starter, clams chilli coriander (Rs. 200) is a big relief, and we love the taste of sea, salt and coriander chilli paste minced in a palatable fishy mash. We take a big sip of the sol kadi, but it sets off an unwanted green chilli fire in our mouths. Sadly our crisp bombil fry (Rs. 150) doesnt have enough of a crusty coating and the batter falls apart from the flaky fish.For mains, we opt for the mutton stew with fluffy appams (Rs. 290).

Our server has forgotten our order of Kundapur Chicken (Rs. 270) but brings us the side of neer dosa that sadly goes cold by the time our Mangalorean curry arrives. But, we relish the curry with a soft and flaky Malabari parotta, which maybe the best we have had till date.For sweets: the paal payasam (Rs. 90) feels like an overdose of coconut shavings, and we wish the milk had been allowed to thicken into a pudding. We love the gulab badam kulfi (Rs. 150) but it came to us in a semi-melted state, instead of neat, frozen pieces.Despite the hits and misses Thangabali holds the promise of a traditional eatery.

5a05e6e49855b76bf13c1c20,Fault lines in the fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fault-lines-in-the-fields/article18952749.ece,2017-06-10,,The Hindu,"Abhishek Patidar, 19, had just passed his Class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started.","abhishek patidar, 19, had just passed his class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. his family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in barkheda path, a village 22 km north of mandsaur in madhya pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). on june 6, abhishek went to mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from madhya pradesh to maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. he was too young but was keen to join the protest. we grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says abhisheks father, dinesh patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.price pinch in malwabarkheda path is typical of the villages in this region. with an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. the last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above rs. 3,000. not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.madhya pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other states, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. yet as per the national crime records bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the state in 2016-17. a combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. like their counterparts in many parts of maharashtra, farmers in mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. as thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.farmers from the mandsaur-neemuch stretch in the malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. we never sold methi below rs. 4,000 per quintal during the manmohan singhs government. but ever since modi became pm, methi prices have collapsed, says dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.in addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says lalchand mali, a farmer from barkheda panth.interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. if the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. the problem is

Discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? But any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. This is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. This is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965.If this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? For long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. While there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural India. And just one look at the state of Indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. So solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.Use and abuse of soil, waterThe problem with Indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called Green Revolution of the 1970s. I use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. Yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. And India no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. But this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. It completely neglected two-thirds of Indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. There is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. Large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact on our soil and water. Deep drilling by tubewells to grow these water-intensive crops has happened without any reference whatsoever to Indias unique hydrogeology, where nearly two-thirds of our land is underlain by hard rock formations which have very low rates of natural recharge.This has meant that there is now a serious water crisis, with both water tables and water quality falling rapidly. We have arsenic, fluoride, mercury, even uranium in our drinking water, creating serious health issues. What is worse, to get the same increase in production, farmers have had to apply more and more fertilisers and pesticides over time. This dramatically raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate increase in production. More than 3,00,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last two decades, which has absolutely no precedent in Indian history.Sustainable agricultureSo what can we do to address these twin tragedies of suicides and violence by farmers? First, we need to transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture. This becomes even more urgent in the context of climate change. Large-scale evidence now exists that non-chemical agriculture has become a profitable alternative. As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on production. The biggest votary of non-chemical farming is the Prime Minister himself. He has also launched the Soil Health Card Scheme, which potentially enables farmers to more carefully manage input regimes. The government must announce a comprehensive package to give a green direction to the nature of subsidies in the sector.Second, we must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater to ensure that the water in our irrigation commands reaches the farmers for whom it is meant and groundwater is managed sustainably in a way that ensures that no one is deprived of their right to water for life. There is positive movement in both these directions within government except for some hesitation in going ahead with a new model groundwater Bill drafted by the Ministry of Water Resources. This landmark Bill seeks to replace archaic British Common Law from the 19th century, which has provided legal legitimacy to the over-extraction of groundwater that underpins the current agrarian crisis. The new law needs urgent adoption and advocacy with the States by the Government of India.On diversificationThird, we require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as livestock and fisheries, among the fastest-growing segments of the rural economy, which could be hurt by recent policy changes. We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat. This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic. The key change required here is aggressive and extensive procurement of these crops by the government. FCI procurement focusses only on rice and wheat although this year we saw some initial steps in the direction of procurement of pulses. This is a welcome move but needs to go much further. The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day meal programmes.Fourth, investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would enable farmers to move up the value chain. We cannot continue to have them dumping their vegetables and milk on the road. They should be processed before they are sold and farmers must get their due share in the value chain.Fifth, we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85% small and marginal farmers. This is why I am strongly opposed to farm loan waivers as they destroy the integrity of the banking system and potentially undermine the extraordinary anti-poverty initiative led by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of women across the country. So many of these extremely poor women, with more than 97% loan recovery ratios, have helped the banking system survive in remote rural India. All this great work of providing an alternative to the usurious moneylender-traders is threatened by loan waivers.Finally, we need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation.Demonetisation crunchWhile many cumulative factors have taken a toll on farmers over decades, more proximate factors explain the outbreak of extreme violence. Speaking to farmers and traders, it appears that demonetisation squeezed so much liquidity out of the system that traders did not have requisite cash to buy the farmers produce. Farmers also feel that persisting with imports, even after clear signs of a bumper harvest, further depressed prices. Having lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, I do not recall a crash in prices as dramatic as this years, that too in the peak of summer. In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of tuar, gram, soybean, grapes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk, garlic, cumin, coriander and fenugreek are at historical lows. And when this happens in crops with high costs of cultivation and inadequate government support, the impact is catastrophic, leading to what the Reserve Bank of India has called fire sales. Which has also created apprehensions about kharif sowing. No wonder the farmers are upset.Violence shows no way forward. But this is a juncture agrarian policy reform in India cannot afford to ignore. Only a comprehensive policy response can ensure that farmers distress becomes a thing of the past.Mihir Shah, a member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, has lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh

S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg.

The country is in the midst of a severe food oversupply, say experts, and farmers are selling their produce for prices less than what they spent growing them.It is also a reflection of demonetisation, when farmers did not have cash to buy seeds for Rabi season. The lack of resources, borrowed money, bumper crop and low demand reflect todays inflation numbers and farmers distress, says economist Arun Kumar.Painting a further grim picture of the economy, factory output for the month of May grew at a meagre 1.7 per cent, compared to 8 per cent last year.The subdued growth in manufacturing is worrying as some major sectors like capital goods, automobile and textiles have shown degrowth. This underlines the need for major reforms to improve the investment climate, said industry body FICCI secretary Didar Singh.It was food prices, that have a weightage of 49 per cent in inflation calculation, which brought the overall numbers down. Vegetable prices are in negative territory for the 10th straight month and pulse prices for the 7th straight month on yearly basis, says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI in report.Low inflation is not necessarily a good sign in the long run, says Seema Sharma Economist at IIT Delhi. More so because current numbers fall below the Reserve Bank of Indias tolerable levels that ranges between 2 and 6 per cent.It is a bad sign RBI will not be guided by June numbers, but by what happens in July, because it is the first month of GST and it will try to examine the impact on economy. Its likely that RBI may hold current rates, said Kumar, indicating that the new tax regime might make a repo rate cut unlikely.The government, however, has a different perspective. It feels these are reflections of a consolidation process in the ongoing macroeconomic activity. The number of 1.54 per cent is historically low and reflects the firm and ongoing consolidation of macroeconomic stability, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said.Tomatoes, however, defied economics with prices skyrocketing above `90 in Chennai.

This has led to a sharp fall in arrivals in Chennai which usually gets 800 tonnes of tomato a day. It has shrunk now to 400 tonnes.Apart from the meagre quantity of tomato from Krishnagiri, which accounts for only about five per cent, the traders at Koyambedu pick up bulk of the produce from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.We used to get tomatoes from Dindigul, Theni, North Arcot, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Kaveripattnam etc. But because of the failed monsoon and farmers not getting enough money for their produce, there is a scarcity, added Thiagarajan, urging the State government to look into the issue.Vendors, too, have demanded timely action from the government to solve this problem.

Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products. Restaurateurs, for instance, are using lemon powder while householders are opting for tamarind.CFarmers are happy to see tomato fetching good prices after a long time. Rates are likely to go higherN.

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say.

Other vegetables are also drilling a hole in the pocket, with prices rising over the past 15 days. Prices are likely to increase further in coming days, said vegetable traders, adding that monsoon arrived late this year which led to poor crop of seasonal vegetables, while heavy rains later damaged the produce. Tomato was worst hit by rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Seasonal vegetables hit by unfavourable weather conditions include brinjal, ladyfinger, bitter gourd, colocasia and potatoes. Cost of bottle guard, pumpkin, pointed guard and cauliflower has dropped up to 40%.Wholesale dealer Shahikant Singh said, ""Rains damaged the tomato crop in Karnataka and also affected its transport."" Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down. Also, these vegetables don't have a long shelf life, so vendors are selling them for less.Housewife Pooja Rastogi said, ""The hike in prices of tomato and potato is pinching most as there is hardly any dish one can make without these two.

But their efforts fell through as they could not get credit without providing non-agricultural assets as collateral guarantee, pointed out Executive Director G.V. Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA).The 30% tax on farmers cooperative societies was a big dampener and just like the IT sector, there should be a tax holiday for farmers cooperative societies to get them into the market system, he suggested, at a recent workshop on Bangaru Telangana and Sustainable Development Goals attended by government officials and agriculture experts.While the proposed Rs. 4,000 financial assistance per acre to be extended to farmers by the Telangana government was welcome, it would do well to adopt Karnatakas model of having a State-level price mechanism to compensate farmers if prices fell below the floor price. Meagre farm incomes as against rising cost of living, lack of support systems for credit access or for marketing the produce, high cost of production and no commensurate support prices have resulted in growing debt burden and farmers suicides, observed Dr. Ramanjaneyulu.The government, which brought out agricultural action plans, should also be submitting review reports and data related to how many farmers got the credit and minimum support price etc., should be kept in the public domain. And, when prices of vegetables like tomato suffer wide variations from Rs. 1 a kg to Rs. 100 a kg, States should not brook delay in pushing for one country, one market to benefit both farmers and consumers.Farmers have been cultivating only three to four main crop varieties across all areas increasing the risk factor as all areas would not be suitable for all crops, therefore cropping pattern changes has to be crucial. For instance, cotton being cultivated in 40 lakh acres this season could be a risky proposition. Same goes with paddy, a water intensive crop, he says.Dr. Ramanjeyalu also alludes to the fact that TS accounted for the highest fertiliser consumption in the country which means the farmers cost of production has only increased even as the soil health took a hit.","high hopes:farmers toiling in their fields as monsoon is active over telangana for the past one month.file photoa credit guarantee fund to farmers and their cooperative societies akin to those available for the industry is the immediate need of the hour besides other multiple interventions to improve incomes of the small and marginal farmers, argues a voluntary organisation working on farmers issues.farmers cooperative societies tried to intervene by purchasing and stocking up when red gram prices crashed. but their efforts fell through as they could not get credit without providing non-agricultural assets as collateral guarantee, pointed out executive director g.v. ramanjaneyulu of centre for sustainable agriculture (csa).the 30% tax on farmers cooperative societies was a big dampener and just like the it sector, there should be a tax holiday for farmers cooperative societies to get them into the market system, he suggested, at a recent workshop on bangaru telangana and sustainable development goals attended by government officials and agriculture experts.while the proposed rs. 4,000 financial assistance per acre to be extended to farmers by the telangana government was welcome, it would do well to adopt karnatakas model of having a state-level price mechanism to compensate farmers if prices fell below the floor price. meagre farm incomes as against rising cost of living, lack of support systems for credit access or for marketing the produce, high cost of production and no commensurate support prices have resulted in growing debt burden and farmers suicides, observed dr. ramanjaneyulu.the government, which brought out agricultural action plans, should also be submitting review reports and data related to how many farmers got the credit and minimum support price etc., should be kept in the public domain. and, when prices of vegetables like tomato suffer wide variations from rs. 1 a kg to rs. 100 a kg, states should not brook delay in pushing for one country, one market to benefit both farmers and consumers.farmers have been cultivating only three to four main crop varieties across all areas increasing the risk factor as all areas would not be suitable for all crops, therefore cropping pattern changes has to be crucial. for instance, cotton being cultivated in 40 lakh acres this season could be a risky proposition. same goes with paddy, a water intensive crop, he says.dr. ramanjeyalu also alludes to the fact that ts accounted for the highest fertiliser consumption in the country which means the farmers cost of production has only increased even as the soil health took a hit."

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture.

The country is in the midst of a severe food oversupply, say experts, and farmers are selling their produce for prices less than what they spent growing them.It is also a reflection of demonetisation, when farmers did not have cash to buy seeds for Rabi season. The lack of resources, borrowed money, bumper crop and low demand reflect todays inflation numbers and farmers distress, says economist Arun Kumar.Painting a further grim picture of the economy, factory output for the month of May grew at a meagre 1.7 per cent, compared to 8 per cent last year.The subdued growth in manufacturing is worrying as some major sectors like capital goods, automobile and textiles have shown degrowth. This underlines the need for major reforms to improve the investment climate, said industry body FICCI secretary Didar Singh.It was food prices, that have a weightage of 49 per cent in inflation calculation, which brought the overall numbers down. Vegetable prices are in negative territory for the 10th straight month and pulse prices for the 7th straight month on yearly basis, says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI in report.Low inflation is not necessarily a good sign in the long run, says Seema Sharma Economist at IIT Delhi. More so because current numbers fall below the Reserve Bank of Indias tolerable levels that ranges between 2 and 6 per cent.It is a bad sign RBI will not be guided by June numbers, but by what happens in July, because it is the first month of GST and it will try to examine the impact on economy. Its likely that RBI may hold current rates, said Kumar, indicating that the new tax regime might make a repo rate cut unlikely.The government, however, has a different perspective. It feels these are reflections of a consolidation process in the ongoing macroeconomic activity. The number of 1.54 per cent is historically low and reflects the firm and ongoing consolidation of macroeconomic stability, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said.Tomatoes, however, defied economics with prices skyrocketing above `90 in Chennai.

5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,,The Hindu,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA","what happened in july?july saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in june, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in july against contraction of 29.4% in june, according to data from the centre for monitoring indian economy. brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in july, from junes contraction of 3.1%. the prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.why is supply low?while the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing states, including maharashtra, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, himachal pradesh and karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern states.the fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. the centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. the other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. however, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.where is the problem?for years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. while the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. the middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. as vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.will better storage help?agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.economists like prof. m.s. sidhu at punjab agricultural university believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. in the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.according to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in india, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.what about the supply chain?the mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. they can work in tandem across the states and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.most farmers in india have small landholdings. nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. this will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.vikas vasudeva"

It is said that about a century ago, Hasin Baig, a bawarchi from the kitchens of the Nawab of Arcot relocated to his hometown Ambur and started preparing biryani there with a similar recipe as the Arcot biryani.While the biryani at Nawabs court was prepared in basmati rice, Baig started making his Ambur version for the masses using cheaper seeraga samba rice. The biryani (spelt briyani in Ambur) which was initially sold on bicycles, became so popular that a small shop was set up and people from even outside the town started to flock to this shop. Over the years, this recipe, now known as Ambur Biryani, has spread to parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where it is hugely in demand. Bangalore and Chennai, for example, has many eateries offering this version of biryani.Apart from the variety of rice (seeraga samba rice is known as chitti mutyalu in Telangana), there are other differences Ambur Biryani has with its Hyderabadi counterpart. The meat here is cooked before putting the biryani on dum, and tomatoes are used frequently in the recipe. Also, in the biryani more of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and green chillies are used yet it is not as spicy as the Hyderabadi variety. Moderate use of tomatoes, coriander and mint leaves gives a uniform colour to the dish.While preparing Ambur biryani, the meat is first pre-cooked with onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, curd and whole spices. Separately cooked rice and this meat are then layered in a degh and topped with ghee before putting on dum. In some places the rice and meat are mixed together instead of layering. The biryani is preferably eaten with an eggplant gravy known as kathirikal pachidi.In Hyderabad, a small place in the bylanes of Madhura Nagar near Ameerpet is perhaps the only place serving Ambur Biryani.

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods.

This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price. The trade fairs will function from August 20 to September 3, a day ahead of Thiruvonam. ""There will be special festival offers and gift coupons for consumers,"" said marketing manager R N Satheesh. Every customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw. The first prize winner will get one sovereign gold, while the state-level winner will get five sovereigns of gold. The vegetable stall at Supplyco fair is set up by Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council of Kerala. Vegetables like carrot, potato and cabbage are brought from Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Munnar.

5a146c4a9855b76bf13e42cd,Tomato prices skyrocket,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170720/jsp/odisha/story_162769.jsp,2017-07-20,,Telegraph,"Vendors sell tomatoes at the Unit-I market in Bhubaneswar. Picture by Ashwinee PatiTomato prices have soared in the past month, from Rs 25 per kilogram to Rs 100-Rs 110 per kilogram in Bhubaneswar. Lelin Mallick of The Telegraph speaks to traders, residents, and experts to find out the rationale behind the price rise The problem Tomato was being sold at Rs 25 a kilogram in various city markets just a month ago. The state's tomato farmers resorted to agitation in March and dumped quintals of the fruit on the roads to protest against distress sale. The price of the crop had even dipped to Re 1 per kilogram in Keonjhar, Angul and Bargarh during the summer, spurring the Opposition Congress and the BJP to demonstrate against the government. Reason behind the price rise The city is dependant on Karnataka for supply tomato with 20 trucks arriving daily. It has come down to three to four trucks over the past few days. Traders said the city's daily requirement was 100 tonnes of tomato, the supply of which has come down by almost 80 per cent. Traders fear that the price would touch Rs 100 in a couple of days. The city is reliant on Bengal, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh for the crop. Low yield in Bengal led to a stop in tomato imports to the city. Besides, fresh crop from Karnataka reaches the city in a week. Traders said the state capital never depended on locally grown tomato during monsoon. Price difference The wholesale price of the fruit is Rs 60 per kilogram but when it reaches the retailers, the price rises by Rs 20 (around 30 per cent). Traders attributed the difference to the crop's perishable nature. They also said the crop couldn't be stored for long. Improvement likely Traders said the situation was likely to improve in a week or two. ""We have to wait for fresh produce, either from Karnataka or Himachal Pradesh, which may take another one to two weeks,"" said secretary of the Raw Vegetable Merchants' Association, Kabiraj Swain. State's role The state government attributed sale of tomato at throwaway prices in various districts to over production of the crop. But it had failed to set up adequate cold storages to store tomato, which has been witnessing frequent price rise along with onion.

The price of tomato is shooting up faster than the Sensex. The buzz in the markets is that a dip in production across the country has led to a shortfall in supply, coinciding with the season when local produce is not available. The price of tomato has increased by almost Rs 40 a kilo in the Maniktala market since Metro first highlighted the upswing on July 11. The produce currently available in Calcutta markets is mostly from Karnataka. Tomato becomes dearer between late June and early or mid-August, when the city becomes dependent on supplies from Karnataka. The markets are flooded with produce from within Bengal for around five months before that. Several retailers said the price rise this year was abnormal. College teacher Debayan Basu, who lives in Maniktala, bought tomato for Rs 120 a kilo last week. ""I do not remember when I last paid so much for this vegetable,"" he said. Compared to Maniktala, the price of a kilo of tomato is at present lower in New Market (Rs 80) and Lake Market (Rs 90). Abhijit Kumar Nandi, head of the department of agricultural economics at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, linked the abnormal price rise to less than normal production in the last crop year (July to June). ""During the 2015-16 crop year, tomato production in India was very good, because of which farmers did not get the price they expected,"" he said. After taking a price hit in the 2015-16 crop year, wary farmers apparently scaled down production in the subsequent year, which meant less supply to markets like Bengal. ""The total area under tomato cultivation was smaller in 2016-17 because farmers did not want a rerun of 2015-16. They preferred growing other crops instead. They feared that they may again incur losses if supply of tomatoes is higher than demand,"" Nandi said. The second factor in the price rise is that produce from Bengal has long disappeared from the markets. Tomato is grown in the state in winter. During that period, the price of the vegetable plummets because of abundant supply. Besides farmers reducing the area of cultivation, climatic conditions have had a role to play in the quantity of production this year.

(Above): Workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in Ranebennuru in Haveri district, Karnataka. (Below) The gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. A farm hand in Ranebennuru, Haveri district.Sudhakara JainManzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. He scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. I know for sure you cant eat this, he says. He speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. It is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. When he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. Pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.Neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. Water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.Manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. No one has told him that in the West, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. Confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village Thimmapura in Haveri district, close to the River Tungabhadra in Central Karnataka. They laugh. No, it cannot be. When our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. If they eat it, they will fall sick. It fills the stomach with gas, says Rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.The recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. In these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. Its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.But the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. The three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from April to June, August to October, and December to February.Discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. Amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in Karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. These range from the Goods and Service Tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over Russian military aggression, to even the weather in Vietnam. A bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in India, and thus the lives of Manzoor and Rajappa.A crop like no otherWith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the State, and perhaps in the country. Seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from Europe. Export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of Karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.The fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of Madrid to the supermarkets of Manhattan.In the 1990s, as information technology (IT) and the outsourcing boom transformed Bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as Kolar and Bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. Just like the IT boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.For more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. Export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and SEZs. While banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the State. The gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 2006.By 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern India were engaged in gherkin cultivation. The sectors exports touched Rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth Rs. 180 crore.When it was dropped into the State two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. Now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. Most say that it is a corruption of the Kannada word,midi, meaning small. Farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.Karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of Indias production, with the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu chipping in.Similar to the dynamics in the IT sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of Bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.The Russia problemIn 2014, parts of central Karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the State battled drought. The perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. But just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: Russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of Crimea.The Russian annexation of Crimea had begun. Despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. Eventually, a pro-Russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.As Russia faced sanctions from Europe and America, suddenly, Indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. Thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of Karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the Russia crisis.A conversation in Hemodre, a village in drought-prone Sira taluk near the Andhra Pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. Beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.Beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. He has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. The credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. With the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. He is now in a debt of more than Rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.About 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern Ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.Srinivas R., the factory manager, explains what happened when Crimea was annexed. In 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. We prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. The rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. The Russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. We had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. Within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.The setback reverberated through company balance sheets. Exports to Russia came down from Rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just Rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. Russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by European buyers.The crisis devastated the industry. At least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. These are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says Mune Gowda, who heads Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd., and is the Treasurer of the Indian Gherkin Exporter's Association. Even the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. In the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. Production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. Making up for the loss of the Russian market by tapping the European one proved difficult as the latter is choosy and has strict compliance norms and certification requirements.The foreignerDomestically, cultivating gherkins comes with its own problems. Unpredictable weather takes a toll on the crop. The gherkin itself is a demanding crop that takes its pound of flesh from the land on which it is sown. It acts like a foreigner who lives here, says Ranganath at Hemodre village. He is relatively less enamoured of the cucumber. He is not taken in by the promise of high yields. If the wind changes direction for an hour, it falls sick, he says.Gherkins need constant care, which isnt easy given the harsh realities of farming in India: monsoons are erratic and prone to failure; rural distress has sparked large-scale migrations and reduction in the availability of labour; tropical diseases sweep across large tracts; and groundwater reserves are dwindling. This constant battle has made the farmers christen the fruitkiri kiritarakari(irritating vegetable) andsoutekaye savasa(problematic cucumber).A little more than a month after the seeds are sown, gherkins pop out of the base of the flower, yielding fruits incessantly for the next two months.It is here that the trouble begins. If it is not picked within a few hours of flowering, it grows exponentially in size, and for the farmers, the bigger it is, the smaller their returns. The gherkins are graded according to their size and there are five grades in all. The smallest gherkins (160 of them can fit in a crate) could fetch Rs. 32 per kilo. The biggest (less than 30 in a crate) fetch just Rs. 2. If transportation of the plucked gherkins is delayed, up to one-third of the produce could be lost.We need 15 labourers a day just to pick the fruit. Most of the youth have gone to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs. If we delay the picking by one day, the gherkin grows and becomes unviable for us, said 41-year-old Siddarameshwara in the remote Udramappanahalli village of Sira taluk. His crop this year has been ravaged by mildew, which sets upon gherkins when it rains.Its because of these reasons that despite his success with the crop in the past 10 years, he has confined gherkins to just 0.5 acres of his 12-acre farm. As white, stringy fungus envelops the gherkin, he hopes that the winter crop can compensate for his loss. However, in the slight chill of the winter lurks the melon fly which, farmers say, no quantity of pesticide can effectively contain.More disconcertingly, the crop guzzles water. If the field is not irrigated daily, gherkins become shrivelled and bent, unsuitable for export. For the 50 days or so that it flowers, farmers have to draw water from their borewells. If maize needs water thrice in two weeks, the gherkin needs it every day. Maize is grown twice a year; gherkins thrice a year. For all the three seasons to yield sizeable profits, it needs more than 150 days of irrigation.The guru of gherkinsEight years ago, it was the sight of a group of Spaniards inspecting gherkins in Bagepalli, just 100 km from Bengaluru close to the Andhra Pradesh border, that enthralled villagers. Taking them around the clusters of gherkin villages was B. Srinivas, whose company acted as a conduit for the bigger companies and farmers. The Spaniards had told the gherkin growers that the produce here was the best they had seen.Having taken to the gherkin sector in 1998, it was he and a small band of agents who persuaded farmers to try this new crop. Agents and company facilitators propped up. Bollywood-style films on gherkin management were shown to farmers to attract them to the crop. Gherkins, it was believed, could lift the region out of poverty.Srinivas remembers the gherkin rush. Farmers would line up for seeds. We could even do large swathes of 30 acres in each village. Things were easy back then.Over 1,000 acres of gherkins  a limit constrained only by the volume of the companies export orders  were sown in 2006-07. Money flowed as advances to farmers, agents kept a steep commission from the output, and for farmers, gherkins did translate into money.Then the inevitable happened. By the late 2000s, the rains started failing, and one by one, the borewells went dry. Groundwater dipped in places from 400 feet to more than 1,200 feet. In places where the borewells ran through the summer, they now stopped two months before the rains, and later, didnt function even in the winter. Gherkins, with their immediate need for water, were the first to be affected.By 2011, the number of red farmers  those with debts  rose dramatically, and the agents had to look farther for suitable land, with some going as far as Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. It just didnt work out. We would get half an acre in one village and a couple of acres elsewhere far away. The debts kept rising. I had to get out, Srinivas says.In the hustle of the Bagepalli market, the man who many farmers and agents say was the guru of gherkins in the region now runs an agro-business focussing only on traditional vegetables and maize seeds. Just three agents operate now, and struggle to cumulatively cover 50 acres.Cycles of debtDrought and international price fluctuations have left behind a cycle of debt  unpaid loans for field agents and gherkin farmers, who, in turn, have to pledge a greater share of future gherkin production.In the past decade, the prices of the seeds, all imported, went up from 6 paise to 68 paise per seed. If tomato seeds cost Rs. 700 for 10,000, the cost for gherkins is up to Rs. 10,000. The returns, however, havent kept up. In the same period, the price of premium gherkins has gone up from Rs. 8 to Rs. 32 per kg.In some areas, agents have racked up debts of more than Rs. 50 lakh. Agents like Gangappa in Bagepalli who claims to have nearly Rs. 70 lakh in debt from farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have pinned their hopes on the recent rains that have filled up tanks. They hope that these farmers can repay the debt by cultivating gherkins again.The rains have indeed given life to the dry lands of Bagepalli, Sira and central Karnataka, which glimmer now in various shades of green. There is slight optimism in the corporate offices of exporters too: a steady year can blunt Indias reputation as an uncertain producer that frequently misses shipment dates. But is it possible that, somehow, the U.S. and Russia would normalise relations and bring Indian gherkins back on Russian tables?Well, the fruit is fickle and vulnerable, and uncertainties loom, much like the dark vestigial monsoon clouds that threaten to wash out this seasons crop.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough.BeereshA local agentEven the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production.Mune GowdaHead, Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd.","bitter harvest:karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of indias production. (above): workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in ranebennuru in haveri district, karnataka. (below) the gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. a farm hand in ranebennuru, haveri district.sudhakara jainmanzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. he scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. i know for sure you cant eat this, he says. he speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. it is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. when he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. no one has told him that in the west, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village thimmapura in haveri district, close to the river tungabhadra in central karnataka. they laugh. no, it cannot be. when our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. if they eat it, they will fall sick. it fills the stomach with gas, says rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.the recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. in these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.but the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. the three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from april to june, august to october, and december to february.discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. these range from the goods and service tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over russian military aggression, to even the weather in vietnam. a bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in india, and thus the lives of manzoor and rajappa.a crop like no otherwith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the state, and perhaps in the country. seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from europe. export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.the fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of madrid to the supermarkets of manhattan.in the 1990s, as information technology (it) and the outsourcing boom transformed bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as kolar and bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. just like the it boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.for more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and sezs. while banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the state. the gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the institute for social and economic change (isec) in 2006.by 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern india were engaged in gherkin cultivation. the sectors exports touched rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth rs. 180 crore.when it was dropped into the state two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. most say that it is a corruption of the kannada word,midi, meaning small. farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of indias production, with the neighbouring states of andhra pradesh, maharasthra and tamil nadu chipping in.similar to the dynamics in the it sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.the russia problemin 2014, parts of central karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the state battled drought. the perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. but just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of crimea.the russian annexation of crimea had begun. despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. eventually, a pro-russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.as russia faced sanctions from europe and america, suddenly, indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the russia crisis.a conversation in hemodre, a village in drought-prone sira taluk near the andhra pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. he has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. the credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.i used to contract 250 farmers. but due to the russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. with the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. he is now in a debt of more than rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.about 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.srinivas r., the factory manager, explains what happened when crimea was annexed. in 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. we prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. the rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. the russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. we had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.the setback reverberated through company balance sheets. exports to russia came down from rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by european buyers.the crisis devastated the industry. at least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. these are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says mune gowda, who heads exotic agro pvt. ltd., and is the treasurer of the indian gherkin exporter's association. even the u.s. has started importing from mexico, while vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. in the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. making up for the loss of the russian market by tapping the

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought.","bengaluru: rainfall during harvest season may prove detrimental to the farming community this year. farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout october. dr n nagaraj, professor of plant pathology, university of agricultural sciences (uas) told express that if it rains heavily during october, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. as a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. quoting the example of an experimental plot of uas, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as phytophthora late blight. other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. however, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. if water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. shivkumar naiklal, scientist at karnataka state natural disaster monitoring cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. he said that 99% of the state had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

As the BJP tries to win back its loyal supporters, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitinbhai Patel speaks in the midst of hectic campaigning in Mehsana.The Patidar factor or their anger seems to be your biggest challenge. Whats your assessment?When the agitation began, there was more support. However, we have been able to address the issues by starting new schemes for non-reserved categories, including Patidars.For example, when a boy or a girl who takes admission to a self-financing college or a government institution, the Gujarat government pays 50% of the tuition fee. It covers engineering or medical colleges.When a rural student stays in a hostel, the government now pays up to Rs. 1,200 of the food bill. From primary to Class 12 students, books and uniforms are given by the government. Earlier, these used to be given to only students of SC and ST but we have done away with the distinction.After Congress leader Kapil Sibal offered a formula for reservation to PAAS leaders, your comment that a foolish formula had been offered to fools became controversial, as insulting your community.I had said the Supreme Court, through various judgments, has made it clear that there can be no reservation beyond the existing ceiling (50% reservation limit). Despite knowing this, a well-known lawyer like Kapil Sibal had offered a formula. He himself knows that it will be struck down in one appeal. But to take political advantage, he misled everyone. The Congress, even till this minute, has still not made the formula public.When such a big lawyer, after knowing Supreme Court judgments, offers a formula, then it is making fools out of those fellows who are part of their [PAAS] core group. I didnt say anything insulting about our community.The Congress has also questioned your development model and has alleged that vikas has gone mad. Your response?If they are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning. You are travelling around the State and you must have seen how good the roads are. Look at our power situation, look at our water supply or our agriculture. We have the best of best infrastructure in Gujarat. Whether it is a tribal village or a remote part of the State, every part has good connectivity and good infrastructure.Rahul Gandhi is campaigning hard in Gujarat this time. His rallies are being well attended and it is being said that people are listening to what he has to say. How do you view it?Even in this small village, people of all ages have come  from children to seniors. So people come to see him as well but it does not mean that they will vote. And the Congress also gets people from outside to fill its meetings. When a leader or an actor comes, people come to see them but it doesnt mean they will get support. Even during Indira jis time there used to be people. Sonia Gandhi also used to come to Gujarat frequently yet we have been ruling the State for 22 years. In recent times, they have lost eight State elections and more recently, they got wiped out in Uttar Pradesh. Last week, in civic polls, they lost even Amethi that has been with them for the last 50 years.Mr. Gandhi hasnt said anything about that. It is clear that people these days want to see work and not go by name alone.The Congress and Mr. Gandhi have raised the issue of price rise or monghvari in Gujarati and people are connecting with the issue. Whats your take?Price rise has two aspects. A farmer wants good price for his produce and the consumer wants the same at minimum price. As a government, it is our responsibility to manage both. Many a time when there is a temporary surge, it naturally applies to all equally. It is not as if prices have gone up because there is a BJP government in Gujarat. In Karnataka, there is a Congress government and tomatoes, potatoes and onions would be similarly priced. Or in Kerala where there is a Communist government, prices of vegetables would be similar.How many seats will the BJP get in these elections?We have already accepted the challenge of 150 plus seats. We have done good work and peoples faith and support are with us.You dont think there is anti-incumbency?We dont have anti-incumbency as we have delivered. Governments that dont work start feeling anti-incumbency but our ministers, MLAs, workers all go and work among the people. Nobody can tell us that we have come to the people after five years. We firmly believe that we will get 150 seats.If they [the Congress] are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning","if bjps 22-year rule in gujarat faces a challenge in the 2017 assembly elections, it is mainly because of the hardik patel-led patidar anamat andolan samiti (paas) demanding reservation in jobs and educational institutions. as the bjp tries to win back its loyal supporters, gujarat deputy chief minister nitinbhai patel speaks in the midst of hectic campaigning in mehsana.the patidar factor or their anger seems to be your biggest challenge. whats your assessment?when the agitation began, there was more support. however, we have been able to address the issues by starting new schemes for non-reserved categories, including patidars.for example, when a boy or a girl who takes admission to a self-financing college or a government institution, the gujarat government pays 50% of the tuition fee. it covers engineering or medical colleges.when a rural student stays in a hostel, the government now pays up to rs. 1,200 of the food bill. from primary to class 12 students, books and uniforms are given by the government. earlier, these used to be given to only students of sc and st but we have done away with the distinction.after congress leader kapil sibal offered a formula for reservation to paas leaders, your comment that a foolish formula had been offered to fools became controversial, as insulting your community.i had said the supreme court, through various judgments, has made it clear that there can be no reservation beyond the existing ceiling (50% reservation limit). despite knowing this, a well-known lawyer like kapil sibal had offered a formula. he himself knows that it will be struck down in one appeal. but to take political advantage, he misled everyone. the congress, even till this minute, has still not made the formula public.when such a big lawyer, after knowing supreme court judgments, offers a formula, then it is making fools out of those fellows who are part of their [paas] core group. i didnt say anything insulting about our community.the congress has also questioned your development model and has alleged that vikas has gone mad. your response?if they are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning. you are travelling around the state and you must have seen how good the roads are. look at our power situation, look at our water supply or our agriculture. we have the best of best infrastructure in gujarat. whether it is a tribal village or a remote part of the state, every part has good connectivity and good infrastructure.rahul gandhi is campaigning hard in gujarat this time. his rallies are being well attended and it is being said that people are listening to what he has to say. how do you view it?even in this small village, people of all ages have come  from children to seniors. so people come to see him as well but it does not mean that they will vote. and the congress also gets people from outside to fill its meetings. when a leader or an actor comes, people come to see them but it doesnt mean they will get support. even during indira jis time there used to be people. sonia gandhi also used to come to gujarat frequently yet we have been ruling the state for 22 years. in recent times, they have lost eight state elections and more recently, they got wiped out in uttar pradesh. last week, in civic polls, they lost even amethi that has been with them for the last 50 years.mr. gandhi hasnt said anything about that. it is clear that people these days want to see work and not go by name alone.the congress and mr. gandhi have raised the issue of price rise or monghvari in gujarati and people are connecting with the issue. whats your take?price rise has two aspects. a farmer wants good price for his produce and the consumer wants the same at minimum price. as a government, it is our responsibility to manage both. many a time when there is a temporary surge, it naturally applies to all equally. it is not as if prices have gone up because there is a bjp government in gujarat. in karnataka, there is a congress government and tomatoes, potatoes and onions would be similarly priced. or in kerala where there is a communist government, prices of vegetables would be similar.how many seats will the bjp get in these elections?we have already accepted the challenge of 150 plus seats. we have done good work and peoples faith and support are with us.you dont think there is anti-incumbency?we dont have anti-incumbency as we have delivered. governments that dont work start feeling anti-incumbency but our ministers, mlas, workers all go and work among the people. nobody can tell us that we have come to the people after five years. we firmly believe that we will get 150 seats.if they [the congress] are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning"
5aeb244e9855b7179ad71a46,Fields of despair,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-rural-economy-bjp-fields-of-despair-4973039/,2017-12-08,,Indian Express,"Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Bharat vs India, a phrase coined by Charan Singh to describe the conflict between villages and cities, remains relevant. This is evident from the Kisan Sansad (farmers parliament) that met in Delhi last month. More than 40,000 peasants belonging to 180 farmers organisations came together to form the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. According to the National Sample Survey, the average Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in 1993-94 was Rs 281 in rural India and Rs 458 in urban India. It rose to Rs 772 (up 174 per cent) and Rs 1,472 (up 221 per cent) for rural and urban India respectively in 2007-08, which means that the gap between rural and urban jumped from 63 to 91 percentage points. The gap diminished somewhat between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with rural MPCE reaching Rs 1,430 (up 85 per cent) as an average and the urban rising to 2,630 (up 79 per cent), but it remained more than 20 percentage points higher than what it was in 1993-94 at 84 percentage points.This is partly due to the slow growth of agriculture over the last decade. Between the years 2005-06 and 2011-12, the average annual growth rate of industry at constant 2004-05 prices has been 7.5 per cent, while services grew at an ever-quicker pace, 9.95 per cent. However, agriculture lagged behind at 3.8 per cent. In the following three years, 2012-2015, the average agricultural GDP growth rate was 1.7 per cent. In 2014-15, the growth rate of agriculture was negative at  0.2 per cent. It was only 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 and, thanks to a good monsoon, about 4 per cent in 2016-17, the growth rate the five-year plan considered as necessary to ensure food security.Different factors are responsible for these changes. First, the size of holdings has shrunk over the years: The average land owned by peasants fell from 0.725 ha to 0.592 ha between 2002-03 and 2012-13. As a result, the proportion of those owning less than one ha increased from 79.7 per cent to 82.8 per cent. Since a farm household needs at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet, over half of the farmers are in debt: The average loan amount for a farm household in India today is Rs 47,000. Second, irrigation has stagnated with less than half of Indian farmland irrigated, partly because of the groundwater crisis: Water tables fell by 65 per cent in 10 years. Third, peasants suffer from one obsession of the government: The price of food. To neutralise any risk of inflation on that front, the growth rate of rural wages has been limited  in 2015, it was the lowest in 10 years (and lower than the inflation rate). That was related to the squeezing of the MGNREGA programme, which was blamed for rising rural wages. But more than wages, food prices were targeted. To spare urban consumers, they were kept low and the government even precipitated food prices deflation by allowing imports. Soyabean is a case in point, when this year market was flooded with cheap soyabean oil imports. Though the government can impose duty up to 45 per cent, but it kept the rate at 12.5 per cent.In 2017 summer, farmers across India started agitating for better prices. They wanted the M.S. Swaminathan Commission report, which recommended minimum support prices, to be implemented. Maharashtra farmers demanded better prices for onions and other pulses; in Himachal Pradesh, it was for tomatoes; in Punjab and Haryana, it was potatoes and maize; in Rajasthan, garlic; in Gujarat, groundnuts; in Madhya Pradesh, soyabean; in Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli and so on. In June, when Maharashtra farmers, who were on strike, took out a march to Mumbai, the BJP government agreed to a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver. The protest spread to Madhya Pradesh, where five people were killed in Mandsaur district in police firing. Farmers mobilised also because of demonetisation, which badly affected rural India.Though the agitation fit the traditional pattern of kisan politics, the mobilisations, unlike in the previous decades, achieved little. Loans were waived for peasants, mainly in Maharashtra and UP. However, this measure didnt help much. The procedure to receive reimbursement is bureaucratic and the amount waived is sometimes minimal (Rs 10 to Rs 500). Besides, only a third of the small and marginal farmers have access to institutional credit: Banks do not lend money to the poor. The others turn to money lenders, who do not waive loans. Besides, loan waiver is only a temporary relief.Why did the peasant mobilisations achieve so little? The reason could be the urban consumer bias of the BJP, the new political hegemon. The party has turned its back to the Gandhian dimension of Deendayal Upadhyayas Jana Sangh and is focussed on urban development, as evident from the smart cities flagship programme. It sees industrialisation as the best way to modernise India and create jobs. More urban dwellers supported the party than villagers in the 2014 election  by 10 percentage points, according to the CSDS-Lokniti survey. The urban bias of the government was obvious in its attempt to amend the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2015 in favour of industrialists. When the Opposition forced the government to backtrack, Prime Minister Modi invited the states to reform and the BJP-ruled states were the first to change the law.Budget cuts have reduced the spending on the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Integrated Watershed Management Programme and Accelerated Irrigation Benefits and Flood Management Programme. In this context, it isnt surprising that 40 per cent of Indian farmers do not like to farm any more. Hence the demand among young Patels, Marathas, Jats and Kapus for reservations in the (urban) public sector.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","rural india has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms.

Earlier, the vegetable was being sold at a steep Rs. 35 to Rs. 50 per kg.

Shankar Pingle, former director, APMC (vegetable division), said: The rates of drumsticks have been on the rise since November due to unseasonal flash showers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There has been a dip in supply from Gujarat and Nashik too, which meet most of the supply in December and January.Meanwhile, the prices of onions which had fallen to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 on Monday, shot up again to Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 on Friday despite stable supply.

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato.","bengaluru: after eggs, onion prices have shot through the roof in the past few days. a kg of good quality onions now costs rs 65-rs 70 in bengaluru's retail markets decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. even shallot prices have doubled; they range from rs 160 to rs 170 in the open market. such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from north karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.on an average, bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from hubballi and parts of andhra pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the bangalore onion traders association . as a result, a kg of onion which was available at rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs rs 70. and in another one week, it may cross rs 80, fear traders.in the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at hubballi apmc, asia's largest wholesale market for onions. modal prices have been hovering at rs 3,000-rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.north karnataka districts, including dharwad, gadag, koppal, belagavi and raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of karnataka's onion demand. the state gets the remaining 25 per cent from andhra pradesh and maharashtra.""normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said wahab mulla, general secretary, onion and potato merchants association m k patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (mep) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. they have also asked public sector body minerals and metals trading corporation (mmtc) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from north karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."
5b2e93039855b72640116345,Make MSP legally binding,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/667222/make-msp-legally-binding.html,2017-12-12,,Deccan Herald,"For over two weeks last month, farmers in Chhattisgarh's Durg district dumped tomatoes on to the streets. In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot.","for over two weeks last month, farmers in chhattisgarh's durg district dumped tomatoes on to the streets. in just one village, parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. after a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of january, retail prices plunged.far away, farmers in erode district in tamil nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. from rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as re 1 per kg. in chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.not fetching more than rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. the deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.this is primarily because of higher production. whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. a higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.t rajaganesh, a farmer in erode district, asks: ""farmers spend at least rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than rs 50,000 a month.since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. how can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of rs 1 per kg?""in the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. for the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at rs 1.25 lakh per acre.till the first week of january, when i travelled to meet tomato farmers in durg, the prices were much better - about rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. but, with the advent of tomato crop from karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.now, let's take the case of chana. according to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about rs 3,600 per quintal, against the minimum support price (msp) of rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.with production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. even wheat price has remained below msp by 6-8% in gujarat and madhya pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.in february last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of rs 5,500 at tandur market in telangana.meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in chhattisgarh poured in again in early march. this is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to re 1 per kg. in fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.karnataka modelafter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. while the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.it is here that i see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by dr tn prakash, chairman of the karnataka agricultural prices commission. he has called for making the minimum support price of crops to be legally binding. he said: ""consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above mrp and can approach the courts. but, even after 70 years of independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""for the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than msp in various parts of the country. at times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. even the introduction of the unified market platform in karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 enam (national agricultural market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.the concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. enam in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.in addition to 23 crops for which msp is announced every year, state governments must work out msp for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.many states already have a farmers' commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.the immediate need is to convert them into state agricultural prices commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in karnataka. if karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the msp announced by the centre, i see no reason why other states cannot."
