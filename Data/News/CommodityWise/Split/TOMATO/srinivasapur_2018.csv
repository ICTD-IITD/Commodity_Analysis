As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here.

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App","exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies.

So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project and five more will be operational by next month. Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. Last years budget announced a Rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, Hussain added.","a nursery at the horticulture centre of excellence in karnal, haryana. so far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the indo-israeli agriculture project and five more will be operational by next month. photo: israel embassynew delhi: india and israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old indo-israeli agriculture project (iiap) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in maharashtra and demonstrating to indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.for a country like israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for india, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.so, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. the implementing partners for the project are the national horticulture mission (nhm) under the agriculture ministry, mashav, israels agency for international development cooperation, and indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.our goal is to help the indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said dan alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at mashav, delhi.there is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, alluf said, adding, each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. a unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.so far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. notable among these are centres for vegetables in karnal, haryana, for mangoes in dapoli and for citrus fruits in nagpur, both in maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in bassi, rajasthan.among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.following prime minister narendra modis visit to israel in july last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.according to a mashav document, vegetable intervention in haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said alluf.one of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a niti aayog concept paper released in october last year.however, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in india, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.in states which are water-stressed such as maharashtra, karnataka, telangana and gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said siraj hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the delhi-based indian council for research on international economic relations.the centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. last years budget announced a rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, hussain added."

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time.","ashwini m sripad byexpress news servicebengaluru: with the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. in karnataka, vegetable growers are more in kolar, bengaluru rural, chikballapur, chitradurga, ramanagara, mysuru, mandya, chamarajanagar, hassan and other places. with good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. the price of many vegetables has come around rs 20 per kilo which was more than rs 70 a few months back. while the tomato has declined to rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is rs 13 per kg, raddish is rs 18, snake gourd is rs 18, while beetroot and potato are rs 22 per kg, according to the horticultural producers cooperative marketing and processing society (hopcoms) price list.former additional director (fruits), dr s v hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. the lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.with this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. if there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. this is what has happened now, he said.citing an example, hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. but this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. if the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. in winter season, tomatoes normally grow. this year, growers in tamil nadu, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. this means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.people, vendors happyaruna, a resident of rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. even after buying so much, my bill was hardly d100. i was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. she said just a couple of months back, she used to spend d250 for the same quantity of vegetables. the vendors too are happy. carrot was d90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to d45. similarly, potato was d80 per kg and it has fallen to d22. people do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, rudresh, a vegetable vendor at vijayanagar said. another vendor, mahesh at shivajinagar, said customers are happy. we too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.from less supply to tomato glutaccording to deputy director of horticulture department chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. the price of tomatoes had reached d90 per kg. it was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. tomatoes need three months to grow. there was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. there is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. in summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

These fairs offer relaxed markets where farmers, traders and city slickers mingle. We have an annual kadalekai parishe, or peanut fair, and last week, while running through the citys sprawling Cubbon Park, I dodged enthusiasts thronging a millets fair and millets marathonthe agriculture minister, whose trim frame betrays a proclivity to fitness, enthusiastically participated in the latter.My wife, who always persuades me to patronize the local Ramzan and Christmas festivitieswhich she can appreciate through only sight and soundhas always wanted to indulge her own culinary tastes, which are vegetarian and appreciative of local farmers and traditions. The problem is the bean and peanut festivals are across town, and given my reluctance to engage with Bengalurus formidable traffic, we had not been there.One bright winter morning, I bundled her into an autorickshaw and off we went to Sajjan Rao Circle in VV Puram, where old traditions, homes and trees linger. This is a vegetarian Kannadiga stronghold, and that is evident in the meat-free offerings on thindi beedi, or food street, a 100m stretch of carts, small eateries and condiment stores. One of these, Sri Vasavi Condiments, organizes the annual avarebele mela that focuses entirely on a green-and-white broad bean, made with skin or without. The bean is particularly appropriate for a city that is often called bean town in the English translation from one of its supposed root names, bende kaal ooru, or town/village of boiled beans (although this is likely bunkum).Everything at the fair was about the avare bean, and nothing was costlier than Rs60. The avarebele was mixed with dosa, idli and bonda batters; worked into curries, ragi and rice rotis; blended with pulaos, upmas, payasams and evengreenhoney jalebis. Oh, how could I forget the union of north and south, the avarebele rumali roti, and, of course, that pinnacle of fusion, avarebele manchurian. I daresay no other festival boasts of the wild experimentation of the green bean soire, although I refused to experiment with the last two. We jostled around the coupon issuers, grabbed our precious tokens and waved them frantically at the chefs until we got, on leaf plates, our avarebele dosa with hithkabeleor beans without skinsaru (curry), avarebele ragi roti and avarebele idlis. We packed avarebele chikki, spiced hithkabele snacks and raw beans and plunged into the midday traffic to make our way back home.The next day, I cooked the beans and tossed them with some sea salt, hoping to create my own avarebele entre. The first thing I did was to integrate them with our daily dosa, as you can see in the recipe below. I think the Sri Vasavi Condiments dosa was made from beans with the skinavarelebe dosa, while mine was hithkabele, without the skin.I was happy to have finally made the long-pending journey to the mela. The avarebele has been a gap in my acquaintance with state tradition; about 90% of the southern crop comes from Karnataka. I have eaten the basic curry now and then, but I was not acquainted with the beans diverse uses. The avarebele is nutritious, packed as it is with vitamins and iron, and it is a particularly important source of protein for vegetarians. In Bengaluru, even those who dont eat iteven in my homeapparently know of the great, green bean.After we returned home the day of the fair, I was telling my pork-eating seven-year-old of our trip and how we had eaten all manner of delicious food made with green-and-white beans; you know, I told her, the same beans we sometimes pick up from Cubbon Park when we go cycling.

Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg.

Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware.

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot.","its now being called the citys centre of culture, art and food, or south mumbais soho. im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the venetian gothic-styled david sassoon library behind rampart row all the way to flora fountain on one end and horniman circle at the other.for what its worth, kala ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of mumbais iconic restaurants. samovar, tucked inside the jehangir art gallery, and wayside inn, wrapped around the corner next to rhythm house.wayside inn was epochal because it was at table no 4 that babasaheb ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the indian constitution. its here that struggling progressive artists husain, ara and gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like arun kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. here that mohammed ali jinnah romanced his parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and behram contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. and where a whole generation of post-independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.rampart row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. all the fun is now inside the lanes. (ht file photo)i used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.rampart row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. wayside inn has given way to punjab grill. khyber looks a bit lost. copper chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is boston butt. but all the fun is now inside the lanes.it all started with kala ghoda caf. from a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. its cavernous hall and bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old mumbai mansion.at the pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over india. the quiche lorraine they do with oodles of cream gruyere alone is worth the visit. (ht file photo)the menu is eclectic. fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. ten kinds of egg, from the parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. there are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. its an ideal breakfast place. but lunch isnt bad either. you can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.just off ropewalk lane is the pantry. white, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over india. their cheese for example comes from pondicherry and the quiche lorraine they do with oodles of cream gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.la folie is a stylish patisserie. the tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.at ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. to me, its the michelin star version of bade miyan. (ht file photo)then theres nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. but the emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the mumbai local sandwich hit the spot for me.a little further away is plenty. its not exactly kala ghoda, but a short walk towards horniman circle. brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.they have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl i like is the kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. but my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. the finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.watch out for maska maarke by kunal vijayakar in hindustan times, mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every saturday morning.as the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of kala ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, i am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. walk past the aqua-coloured knesset eliyahoo synagogue and at the end of vb gandhi marg (vb gandhi is the man who decided that mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. and that fire is from ayubs.ayubs the michelin star version of bade miyan. the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. thats kala ghoda for me as well.but the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of kala ghoda, because at the moment sobos soho stands for so bloody hot."

And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece.

Ladies finger is among the few vegetables that is quoted at Rs. 25 a kg. The price of beans, which hovers around Rs. 70 per kg for most part of the year, has crashed to Rs. 15-20 a kg.Radish and tomato are among the top vegetables that are sold at Rs. 4 and Rs. 6 a kg respectively. In Gandhi Market, which gets its supply of tomato from Bengaluru in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, a kg of top quality tomato was sold at Rs. 6. It was Rs. 8 at Uzhavar Sandhai in Thennur on Thursday.The cost of one box (25 kg) of tomato wasRs. 150 in the wholesale market. There were not many takers for radish as the market was flooded with heavy arrival on Thursday.Retail vendors at Gandhi Market are hardpressed to sell the vegetables. Some traders, who could not clear the arrivals, preferred to dump them as waste, which eventually was transported to Ariyamangalam dump yard on Wednesday.Traders attribute the slump in prices to heavy arrival of vegetables than the actual demand over the past few weeks.

5b147c029855b72e9ad63f1d,Learning from the ‘long march’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-from-the-long-march/article23345442.ece,2018-03-25,,The Hindu,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely Adivasi farmers descended on Mumbai earlier this month. The right thing, that is, if the objective was to as quickly as possible remove this disturbing reminder of farm distress from the glare of the media  and future, non-farmer voters. He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas. MSPs remain on paper, arbitrary and irrational price and import/export curbs in the name of the consumer actually end up hurting both consumers and producers one could go on.Perhaps the real lesson to be learnt from farmers protests like the long march is that pushed long enough and hard enough by the current system, the India farmer will eventually rise up and try to change it  with or without your consent.","maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely adivasi farmers descended on mumbai earlier this month. the right thing, that

On Wednesday (March 28), the price stood at Rs. 7.20. However, it jumped to Rs. 12.80 per kg on Thursday. Incidentally, the price has plummeted to Rs. 2 a kg and even below at several markets in southern States.Chairman of the Madanapalle tomato market committee R. Gurappa Naidu said since November, the price had not gone down below Rs. 5, which was a unique thing in the annals of the local market.

Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal.","farmer raju at his poly-house where broccoli is grown without pesticides in doddaballapur taluk; (right) broccoli crop is selling like hot cakes.b.s. satish kumarat a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.in fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.the indian institute of horticultural research (iihr) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.the main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said m.s. rao, head of iihrs division of entomology and nematology.this will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of rs. 900 crore.what has come as a shot in the arm for the iihr is that a 24-year-old farmer raju in doddaballapur taluk near bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.it is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. but, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.mr. raju, who migrated to karnataka from andhra pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.what has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. the farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of iihr, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. he was able to earn about rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.dr. rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the iihr.it has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.if a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur j. gavaskar, who has taken licences from the iihr to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. big farmers and some farmer producers organisations from pune, some cities in andhra pradesh, tamil nadu and kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.other successesdr. rao said icar-iihr has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, european cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in karnataka, tamil nadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra, and bengal."

(Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Opposition Congress and INLD on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Khattar led BJP government alleging every section was fed up with its misrule.In separate news conferences here, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLDs Abhay Singh Chautala targeted the state government over a host of issues including those on farmers, employees, youth and players. Hooda said Manohar Lal Khattar governments Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana, launched to protect the growers in the event of crash in prices, had failed to yield results. He said recently farmers at many places had been forced to throw their tomato crops on roads or give them to the Gaushalas.The government did not come to the rescue of tomato farmers when prices crashed. They have not got any benefit under this Yojana, the former chief minister claimed. On the players issue, he said: The government first cancelled the awards ceremony and afterwards has been coming out with contradictory statements regarding honouring them. They are not clear which policy they have to follow and players are being disrespected. He was also asked about the state government suspending Haryana Staff Selection Commission chairman B B Bharti after a row over an objectionable question pertaining to Brahmins, in an examination conducted by the board.Hooda said there was no provision to suspend HSSC chairman and the government should either dismiss him or ask him to resign. He said, moreover, the state government too should be held equally responsible as it was not a mere mistake in a question paper but an insult to the entire Brahmin community. Hooda also asked the government to immediately resolve the issue of ongoing strike by the sanitation workers. While this government keeps talking so much about Swachh Bharat and Swachh Haryana, it is making no efforts to end the 10-day old strike which has resulted in heaps of garbage being piled up and inconvenienced the citizens he stated.Meanwhile, INLDs senior leader Abhay Singh Chatuala, while addressing another news conference, demanded the Khattar government issue a white paper on the five foreign trips undertaken by the Chief Minister and those part of his entourage on different occasions giving full details. Chautala said that while the government has claimed that investments worth over Rs 7 lakh crore had fructified as a result of MoUs signed with various governments and other agencies during these trips, the white paper should detail how much revenue has actually been garnered out of these investments.Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, also said that the Chief Minister had claimed that lot of wasteful expenditure has been incurred as part of hospitality expenses during Hoodas tenure. ..then it is the responsibility of the present government to tell what steps are being taken to reclaim that money, he added. However, while reacting to this, Hooda said, if people come to meet the Chief Minister (during his time), it is his responsibility to offer them a cup of tea and snacks. But everyone knows that nobody comes to meet him (Khattar). If they have their way, the present government would even set up a Commission of Inquiry to go into how much tea and biscuits had been consumed on the hospitality that was extended. On criticism by Hooda to INLD-BSPs ongoing Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL canal issue, and his dubbing it as Bus Bharo Andolan, Chautala said,those coming from five star culture will not understand our agitation.Our leaders and workers have been courting arrest and authorities let us off in the evening saying they do not have any place to keep us in jails. Hooda had said that INLDs Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL was limited to getting on to the buses, courting arrest and getting released in the evening. Had they been serious, they would have actually gone to jail on this issue, Hooda said.On the developments in Karnataka, both Hooda and Chautala said B S Yedurappas resignation had thoroughly exposed the BJP, which allegedly wanted to encourage horse trading despite knowing they did not have numbers on their side to cobble up a majority.Replying to another question, Chautala said Mayawati-led third front will come into existence and the BSP supremo will be the countrys next prime minister after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","haryana cm manohar lal khattar.

Farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the APMC.Vegetable supplies at the APMC wholesale market this winter has doubled. The daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. The crop has been better in the last two years, said Shivaji Pahinkar, APMC Mumbai secretary. The APMC comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. Farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the APMC. The loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.Broccoli is largely supplied from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. Pahinkar added, There is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. This year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. Pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. A micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said.","navi mumbai: in view of overall good production of vegetables, supply of several vegetables from neigbouring states of gujarat, madhya pradesh and karnataka has led to a surplus in the market. farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the apmc.vegetable supplies at the apmc wholesale market this winter has doubled. the daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. the crop has been better in the last two years, said shivaji pahinkar, apmc mumbai secretary. the apmc comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the apmc. the loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.broccoli is largely supplied from karnataka, gujarat and madhya pradesh. wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. pahinkar added, there is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. this year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. a micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said."

Though the output has doubled in the last three months, the prices are yet to pick up. On Monday, the model price for the number one variety stood at Rs. 56 per 10 kg box, and the second at Rs. 30 per box.Though the stocks are reaching the Madanapalle market in several loads, the prices are not encouraging, say the farmers. From the last week of April, the produce showed signs of cracks due to intolerance to the abnormal heat. Mercury hardly crossed 35 degrees Celsius in the previous years in the area. For this reason, the first variety loads have dwindled, leaving the second variety to thrive, causing concern at trading.As the undamaged stocks are being sent to all over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other southern States, the domestic market has to depend on the loads with cracks and black spots.No cheer till JuneThe trade is unlikely to bring cheers to the farmers till May end or June first week, though it is projected that the stocks reaching the market would increase from the present 360 tonnes a day to more than 500 tonnes.Expecting profits, the farmers of Anantapur district, Chintamani, Rayalpadu and other border areas of Karnataka are also thronging the Madanapalle market. Despite the discouraging conditions, they have some consolation that the price is better than their domestic markets.Market Committee (Madanapalle) Chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said compared to the other markets in Rayalaseema or the southern States, the trade is not that disappointing.

I hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. My father says the right spelling is chee but I think he is editorialising.So wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. If you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. But do it for sure  because you deserve it.A ridiculous notionYou silly goose! Deserve it my foot! I was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. And you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! This has to be the height of self-delusion. Do you people really believe the credit for all that India has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? I am asking a genuine question here and I want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? Did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? I am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. Never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.What makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved Prime Ministers dreams. And yet, you have let him down so badly. Each one of you. True, the Indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. It is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through GST, and deposited Rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian who worked in the IT Cell for a minimum of 56 days.Nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown Indians with more respect than ever before. Foreigners are so much in awe of our Prime Minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. After 60 years of Dark Ages under the Congress, today every Indian village has woken up to light and Paytm.Four great featsIn fact, Modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what Nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. But the pseudo-sickular Indian media that has sold out to the hate-Modi industry simply wont show them to the Indian public. If you think I am being too harsh, Ill give you just four examples of Modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.Im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in Indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an Indian Prime Minister when the Singapore government decided to name a beautiful Indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, Dendrobrium Narendra Modi. Or that Modiji became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit a Mariamman temple in Singapore. Were you aware that the IAEA has hailed the achievement of electrifying all Indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? Or that for the first time in Indias history, an Indian Prime Minister purchased a Madhubani painting in Singapore using a RuPay card? Do you know how many Madhubani paintings Nehru bought using a RuPay card, either in India or in Singapore? Zero. Thats right. If Modiji and Nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, Modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.The one thing we couldnt doThats the kind of Prime Minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. In return, he had only one small request for all of us: a Congress-mukt Bharat. And Im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.As the Karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is India far from being Congress-mukt, the entire Opposition is ganging up against one man. And you all are sitting quietly and watching like Gandhijis monkeys? After all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of Achhe Din in 2019, I must say you are not fit to remain in this country. I suggest you pack off to Pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch Veeradi Veera Wedding with your jihadi grandmother.","my dear friends and loyal readers, please join me in congratulating ourselves on four fantastic years of achhe din. i hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. my father says the right spelling is chee but i think he is editorialising.so wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. if you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. but do it for sure  because you deserve it.a ridiculous notionyou silly goose! deserve it my foot! i was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. and you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! this has to be the height of self-delusion. do you people really believe the credit for all that india has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? i am asking a genuine question here and i want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? i am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.what makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved prime ministers dreams. and yet, you have let him down so badly. each one of you. true, the indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. it is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through gst, and deposited rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every indian who worked in the it cell for a minimum of 56 days.nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown indians with more respect than ever before. foreigners are so much in awe of our prime minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. after 60 years of dark ages under the congress, today every indian village has woken up to light and paytm.four great featsin fact, modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. but the pseudo-sickular indian media that has sold out to the hate-modi industry simply wont show them to the indian public. if you think i am being too harsh, ill give you just four examples of modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an indian prime minister when the singapore government decided to name a beautiful indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, dendrobrium narendra modi. or that modiji became the first indian prime minister to visit a mariamman temple in singapore. were you aware that the iaea has hailed the achievement of electrifying all indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? or that for the first time in indias history, an indian prime minister purchased a madhubani painting in singapore using a rupay card? do you know how many madhubani paintings nehru bought using a rupay card, either in india or in singapore? zero. thats right. if modiji and nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.the one thing we couldnt dothats the kind of prime minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. in return, he had only one small request for all of us: a congress-mukt bharat. and im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.as the karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is india far from being congress-mukt, the entire opposition is ganging up against one man. and you all are sitting quietly and watching like gandhijis monkeys? after all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of achhe din in 2019, i must say you are not fit to remain in this country. i suggest you pack off to pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch veeradi veera wedding with your jihadi grandmother."

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay.

Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops.

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10.

It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply.

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)","one of the oldest civilisations, the indus valley civilisation,

income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. this will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.if farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. this is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.as the swaminathan committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in india. bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than rs 20. but re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. a farmer gets rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than rs 40. who then gets the benefit? it is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.so what is the way out? an amul like cooperative model that brought about the white revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. the wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. this will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(the writer is a senior

However the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the Budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of State Farmers Federation, had expected categorical commitment from the Modi government on implementing the Swaminathan Committee report, which Modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. However, he welcomed the Budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.The proposal is also to extend the MSP scheme to all the 89 crops. It was earlier restricted to 43. He also welcome Kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.Shanthakumar told The New Indian Express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.Though the Budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. It needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.I will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the Modi government, Shantakumar said.On allocating Rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert S V Hittalamani said in Karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.However, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is Rs 11,000 crore. How much of it actually goes to farmers? Whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. Budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.He further added that if the Centre can bear Rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation.","by express news servicebengaluru: union budget with a slew of promises has evoked optimism in the farm sector. however the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.kuruburu shanthakumar, president of state farmers federation, had expected categorical commitment from the modi government on implementing the swaminathan committee report, which modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. however, he welcomed the budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (msp) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.the proposal is also to extend the msp scheme to all the 89 crops. it was earlier restricted to 43. he also welcome kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.shanthakumar told the new indian express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.though the budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. it needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.i will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the modi government, shantakumar said.on allocating rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert s v hittalamani said in karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.however, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. karnataka rajya raitha sangha president kodihalli chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is rs 11,000 crore. how much of it actually goes to farmers? whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.he further added that if the centre can bear rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation."

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. We have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. As the declaration of drought mandals took place early in June and July, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said.","the year ends on a sour note for farmers in the district, who were saddled with a staggering loss of rs. 200 crore due to two failed monsoons.a rainfall deficit of minus 48% this year wreaked havoc on farmers, mainly the ones growing paddy, tomato, sugarcane and groundnut.acreage dips by 80%the groundnut crop, considered the lifeline of the western mandals, was wiped out in several mandals, while many farmers avoided venturing into the fields from june. of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. for the ongoing rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. with closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.tomato fares betterthe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in august and september which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. during peak season, the madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over rs. 1.5 crore a day. however, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.host of issuesother predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. some small-scale farmers reportedly took up nrega works and temporarily migrated to tamil nadu and karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.joint director of agriculture vijay kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. the major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. however, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. we have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. as the declaration of drought mandals took place early in june and july, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said."

Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav led one such group from Bijwasan. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, All India Kisan Sabhas Hannan Mollah and others joined the protest that was held under the united banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee The march Thursday led to traffic snarls on 26km of city roads. We are saying sorry to people who have been troubled due to traffic snarls. We have distributed pamphlets among them to briefly explain the farmers distress, Yadav said.The pamphlets urged the people to join them when they march to the Parliament on Friday. Farmer groups also threatened to protest naked if stopped from reaching there.The pamphlets stated that farmers get only Rs 5 per kilo of tomato while consumers pay Rs 30. Our life is also cheap. In the last 20 years, over three lakh farmers have committed suicide, the pamphlet informed.The farmers said they demand the convening of the Parliament to pass two bills: one pertaining to one-time full loan waiver, the other for a long-term institutional measure to ensure farmers are not pushed into debt again. They also demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations that say the minimum support price should be fixed at 50% above the comprehensive cost of production.Yadav called the BJP government at the Centre the most anti-farmer government ever. The protest march is for the liberation of farmers from the spectre of suicides, from various forms of exploitation propagated by the state and from organised loot and plunder, he said.Anish Kumar from Delhi School of Social Work said there is a lack of political will to address the agrarian distress.

Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver.

So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project and five more will be operational by next month. Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding.

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said.

One of these, Sri Vasavi Condiments, organizes the annual avarebele mela that focuses entirely on a green-and-white broad bean, made with skin or without. The bean is particularly appropriate for a city that is often called bean town in the English translation from one of its supposed root names, bende kaal ooru, or town/village of boiled beans (although this is likely bunkum).Everything at the fair was about the avare bean, and nothing was costlier than Rs60.

This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel.

5b13c89a9855b762ecebf660,Pencils that sprout,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pencils-that-sprout/article22487973.ece,2018-01-22,,The Hindu,"Did you know over 2,500 wooden pencils can be created from a single tree? And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece.

The price of beans, which hovers around Rs. 70 per kg for most part of the year, has crashed to Rs. 15-20 a kg.Radish and tomato are among the top vegetables that are sold at Rs. 4 and Rs. 6 a kg respectively.

5b147c029855b72e9ad63f1d,Learning from the ‘long march’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-from-the-long-march/article23345442.ece,2018-03-25,,The Hindu,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely Adivasi farmers descended on Mumbai earlier this month. The right thing, that is, if the objective was to as quickly as possible remove this disturbing reminder of farm distress from the glare of the media  and future, non-farmer voters. He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas. MSPs remain on paper, arbitrary and irrational price and import/export curbs in the name of the consumer actually end up hurting both consumers and producers one could go on.Perhaps the real lesson to be learnt from farmers protests like the long march is that pushed long enough and hard enough by the current system, the India farmer will eventually rise up and try to change it  with or without your consent.","maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely adivasi farmers descended on mumbai earlier this month. the right thing, that is, if the objective was to as quickly as possible remove this disturbing reminder of farm distress from the glare of the media  and future, non-farmer voters. he caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the forest rights act of 2006.convenient movesit was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. but a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. and it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.except that it isnt. if anybody knows the issues indian farmers grapple with, its the father of indias green revolution, m.s. swaminathan. and he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.in the union budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. the actual farmer gets to see little of the money.but loan waivers are politically sexy, so every state is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. while the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. in maharashtra, of the rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to maharashtra legislators by the state government,firstpostreported. and even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. a shiv sena mla created a furore in the maharashtra assembly by pointing out that he had received rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. to be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one state. more recently in tamil nadu, farmers in dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for rs. 5 and rs. 10, when the government had promised up to rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!the same old problems recur with depressing regularity. the odisha assembly was disrupted last friday after opposition mlas protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the state. meanwhile in karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. the growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.the government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. at a talkfest in the capital last week, rajiv kumar, vice chairman of niti aayog, said, it is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. what farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (prime minister narendra modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.political turfbut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas. msps remain on paper, arbitrary and irrational price and import/export curbs in the name of the consumer actually end up hurting both consumers and producers one could go on.perhaps the real lesson to be learnt from farmers protests like the long march is that pushed long enough and hard enough by the current system, the india farmer will eventually rise up and try to change it  with or without your consent."

Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal.","farmer raju at his poly-house where broccoli is grown without pesticides in doddaballapur taluk; (right) broccoli crop is selling like hot cakes.b.s. satish kumarat a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.in fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.the indian institute of horticultural research (iihr) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.the main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said m.s. rao, head of iihrs division of entomology and nematology.this will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of rs. 900 crore.what has come as a shot in the arm for the iihr is that a 24-year-old farmer raju in doddaballapur taluk near bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.it is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. but, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.mr. raju, who migrated to karnataka from andhra pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.what has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. the farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of iihr, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. he was able to earn about rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.dr. rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the iihr.it has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.if a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur j. gavaskar, who has taken licences from the iihr to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. big farmers and some farmer producers organisations from pune, some cities in andhra pradesh, tamil nadu and kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.other successesdr. rao said icar-iihr has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, european cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in karnataka, tamil nadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra, and bengal."

(Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Opposition Congress and INLD on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Khattar led BJP government alleging every section was fed up with its misrule.In separate news conferences here, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLDs Abhay Singh Chautala targeted the state government over a host of issues including those on farmers, employees, youth and players. Hooda said Manohar Lal Khattar governments Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana, launched to protect the growers in the event of crash in prices, had failed to yield results. He said recently farmers at many places had been forced to throw their tomato crops on roads or give them to the Gaushalas.The government did not come to the rescue of tomato farmers when prices crashed. They have not got any benefit under this Yojana, the former chief minister claimed. On the players issue, he said: The government first cancelled the awards ceremony and afterwards has been coming out with contradictory statements regarding honouring them. They are not clear which policy they have to follow and players are being disrespected. He was also asked about the state government suspending Haryana Staff Selection Commission chairman B B Bharti after a row over an objectionable question pertaining to Brahmins, in an examination conducted by the board.Hooda said there was no provision to suspend HSSC chairman and the government should either dismiss him or ask him to resign. He said, moreover, the state government too should be held equally responsible as it was not a mere mistake in a question paper but an insult to the entire Brahmin community. Hooda also asked the government to immediately resolve the issue of ongoing strike by the sanitation workers. While this government keeps talking so much about Swachh Bharat and Swachh Haryana, it is making no efforts to end the 10-day old strike which has resulted in heaps of garbage being piled up and inconvenienced the citizens he stated.Meanwhile, INLDs senior leader Abhay Singh Chatuala, while addressing another news conference, demanded the Khattar government issue a white paper on the five foreign trips undertaken by the Chief Minister and those part of his entourage on different occasions giving full details. Chautala said that while the government has claimed that investments worth over Rs 7 lakh crore had fructified as a result of MoUs signed with various governments and other agencies during these trips, the white paper should detail how much revenue has actually been garnered out of these investments.Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, also said that the Chief Minister had claimed that lot of wasteful expenditure has been incurred as part of hospitality expenses during Hoodas tenure. ..then it is the responsibility of the present government to tell what steps are being taken to reclaim that money, he added. However, while reacting to this, Hooda said, if people come to meet the Chief Minister (during his time), it is his responsibility to offer them a cup of tea and snacks. But everyone knows that nobody comes to meet him (Khattar). If they have their way, the present government would even set up a Commission of Inquiry to go into how much tea and biscuits had been consumed on the hospitality that was extended. On criticism by Hooda to INLD-BSPs ongoing Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL canal issue, and his dubbing it as Bus Bharo Andolan, Chautala said,those coming from five star culture will not understand our agitation.Our leaders and workers have been courting arrest and authorities let us off in the evening saying they do not have any place to keep us in jails. Hooda had said that INLDs Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL was limited to getting on to the buses, courting arrest and getting released in the evening. Had they been serious, they would have actually gone to jail on this issue, Hooda said.On the developments in Karnataka, both Hooda and Chautala said B S Yedurappas resignation had thoroughly exposed the BJP, which allegedly wanted to encourage horse trading despite knowing they did not have numbers on their side to cobble up a majority.Replying to another question, Chautala said Mayawati-led third front will come into existence and the BSP supremo will be the countrys next prime minister after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","haryana cm manohar lal khattar.

With the peak summer days round the corner, the cost of several vegetables is slowly on the rise.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market noted that the prices of vegetables were steadily increasing since the last week of March. While some vegetables are costlier by up to 40 % compared to last month, most of them are priced at least 20 % more. However, many merchants reported brisk sales due to the festive season.Beans, broad beans and tomatoes are among the costly vegetables this season. While one kg of beans is sold for nearly Rs. 55 depending on the quality, broad beans are priced at Rs. 50 a kg in the wholesale market. These vegetables are sold for Rs. 65-Rs. 70 a kg at the retail market.Some residents like Sivagami B., a resident of Anna Nagar, use green vegetables from their home garden more often to deal with runaway increase in prices.According to wholesale traders at Koyambedu, the citys hub of perishable goods, some staple vegetables such as potato, onion and small onions remain affordable. Drumsticks are among the few seasonal vegetables that are cheaper.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the prices of vegetables begin to increase in April as yield would be less due to depleting groundwater sources.

It actually stands for 'National Democratic Alliance' and is a coalition of parties headed by the BJP About Modi's ""TOP"" comment, the Karnataka Congress got into a smidgen of trouble yesterday and on Sunday.What happened was that the Congress social media head and Karnataka unit member Divya Spandana asked referring to Modi's comment, ""Is this what happens when you're on POT?""The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly.

He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Spandana then wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on!

Farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the APMC.Vegetable supplies at the APMC wholesale market this winter has doubled. The daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. The crop has been better in the last two years, said Shivaji Pahinkar, APMC Mumbai secretary. The APMC comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. Farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the APMC. The loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.Broccoli is largely supplied from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. Pahinkar added, There is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. This year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. Pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. A micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said.","navi mumbai: in view of overall good production of vegetables, supply of several vegetables from neigbouring states of gujarat, madhya pradesh and karnataka has led to a surplus in the market. farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the apmc.vegetable supplies at the apmc wholesale market this winter has doubled. the daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. the crop has been better in the last two years, said shivaji pahinkar, apmc mumbai secretary. the apmc comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the apmc. the loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.broccoli is largely supplied from karnataka, gujarat and madhya pradesh. wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. pahinkar added, there is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. this year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. a micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said."

Though the output has doubled in the last three months, the prices are yet to pick up. On Monday, the model price for the number one variety stood at Rs. 56 per 10 kg box, and the second at Rs. 30 per box.Though the stocks are reaching the Madanapalle market in several loads, the prices are not encouraging, say the farmers. From the last week of April, the produce showed signs of cracks due to intolerance to the abnormal heat. Mercury hardly crossed 35 degrees Celsius in the previous years in the area. For this reason, the first variety loads have dwindled, leaving the second variety to thrive, causing concern at trading.As the undamaged stocks are being sent to all over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other southern States, the domestic market has to depend on the loads with cracks and black spots.No cheer till JuneThe trade is unlikely to bring cheers to the farmers till May end or June first week, though it is projected that the stocks reaching the market would increase from the present 360 tonnes a day to more than 500 tonnes.Expecting profits, the farmers of Anantapur district, Chintamani, Rayalpadu and other border areas of Karnataka are also thronging the Madanapalle market. Despite the discouraging conditions, they have some consolation that the price is better than their domestic markets.Market Committee (Madanapalle) Chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said compared to the other markets in Rayalaseema or the southern States, the trade is not that disappointing. By the next two weeks, the heat might come down with seasonal showers or monsoons arrival. We are expecting bulk stocks from this month end.

I hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. My father says the right spelling is chee but I think he is editorialising.So wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. If you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. But do it for sure  because you deserve it.A ridiculous notionYou silly goose! Deserve it my foot! I was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. And you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! This has to be the height of self-delusion. Do you people really believe the credit for all that India has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? I am asking a genuine question here and I want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? Did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? I am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. Never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.What makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved Prime Ministers dreams. And yet, you have let him down so badly. Each one of you. True, the Indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. It is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through GST, and deposited Rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian who worked in the IT Cell for a minimum of 56 days.Nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown Indians with more respect than ever before. Foreigners are so much in awe of our Prime Minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. After 60 years of Dark Ages under the Congress, today every Indian village has woken up to light and Paytm.Four great featsIn fact, Modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what Nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. But the pseudo-sickular Indian media that has sold out to the hate-Modi industry simply wont show them to the Indian public. If you think I am being too harsh, Ill give you just four examples of Modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.Im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in Indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an Indian Prime Minister when the Singapore government decided to name a beautiful Indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, Dendrobrium Narendra Modi. Or that Modiji became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit a Mariamman temple in Singapore. Were you aware that the IAEA has hailed the achievement of electrifying all Indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? Or that for the first time in Indias history, an Indian Prime Minister purchased a Madhubani painting in Singapore using a RuPay card? Do you know how many Madhubani paintings Nehru bought using a RuPay card, either in India or in Singapore? Zero. Thats right. If Modiji and Nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, Modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.The one thing we couldnt doThats the kind of Prime Minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. In return, he had only one small request for all of us: a Congress-mukt Bharat. And Im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.As the Karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is India far from being Congress-mukt, the entire Opposition is ganging up against one man. And you all are sitting quietly and watching like Gandhijis monkeys? After all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of Achhe Din in 2019, I must say you are not fit to remain in this country. I suggest you pack off to Pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch Veeradi Veera Wedding with your jihadi grandmother.","my dear friends and loyal readers, please join me in congratulating ourselves on four fantastic years of achhe din. i hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. my father says the right spelling is chee but i think he is editorialising.so wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. if you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. but do it for sure  because you deserve it.a ridiculous notionyou silly goose! deserve it my foot! i was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. and you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! this has to be the height of self-delusion. do you people really believe the credit for all that india has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? i am asking a genuine question here and i want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? i am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.what makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved prime ministers dreams. and yet, you have let him down so badly. each one of you. true, the indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. it is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through gst, and deposited rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every indian who worked in the it cell for a minimum of 56 days.nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown indians with more respect than ever before. foreigners are so much in awe of our prime minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. after 60 years of dark ages under the congress, today every indian village has woken up to light and paytm.four great featsin fact, modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. but the pseudo-sickular indian media that has sold out to the hate-modi industry simply wont show them to the indian public. if you think i am being too harsh, ill give you just four examples of modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an indian prime minister when the singapore government decided to name a beautiful indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, dendrobrium narendra modi. or that modiji became the first indian prime minister to visit a mariamman temple in singapore. were you aware that the iaea has hailed the achievement of electrifying all indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? or that for the first time in indias history, an indian prime minister purchased a madhubani painting in singapore using a rupay card? do you know how many madhubani paintings nehru bought using a rupay card, either in india or in singapore? zero. thats right. if modiji and nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.the one thing we couldnt dothats the kind of prime minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. in return, he had only one small request for all of us: a congress-mukt bharat. and im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.as the karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is india far from being congress-mukt, the entire opposition is ganging up against one man. and you all are sitting quietly and watching like gandhijis monkeys? after all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of achhe din in 2019, i must say you are not fit to remain in this country. i suggest you pack off to pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch veeradi veera wedding with your jihadi grandmother."

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.sugarcane farmers in uttar pradesh are owed over rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (sap). maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of rs 2,213 crore as on march 31, that too, against the centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (frp). yet, cane area in maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from october is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of up farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. one reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. the fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from october to april further adds to the attractiveness.but the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. we are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. these are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (msp) through government procurement. sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the frp/sap, though the monies may come with a few months delay. theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. oilseeds and pulses have been trading below msps over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: tomatoes in kolar (karnataka), onions in lasalgaon (maharashtra) and potatoes in agra (up) are currently selling or were just sold at rs 6-7 per kg.given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in madhya pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in punjab. this is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. the policy prescription to address it is simple: the centre and state governments should desist from hiking msps/frps/saps of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. instead, farmers should be ensured of getting msps and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app"

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply.

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)","one of the oldest civilisations, the indus valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. this is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. farm crisis in india is real, particularly in states like karnataka and tamil nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.this is one side of the coin but agriculture secretary s k pattanayak, a karnataka cadre ias officer, argues that all is not bad with indian agriculture. it has come a long way and this year india is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.but the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of india. a farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. also, if the indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. this is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.for the woes of karnataka and tamil nadu farmers, pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip

However the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the Budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of State Farmers Federation, had expected categorical commitment from the Modi government on implementing the Swaminathan Committee report, which Modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. However, he welcomed the Budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.The proposal is also to extend the MSP scheme to all the 89 crops. It was earlier restricted to 43. He also welcome Kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.Shanthakumar told The New Indian Express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.Though the Budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. It needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.I will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the Modi government, Shantakumar said.On allocating Rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert S V Hittalamani said in Karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.However, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is Rs 11,000 crore. How much of it actually goes to farmers? Whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. Budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.He further added that if the Centre can bear Rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation.","by express news servicebengaluru: union budget with a slew of promises has evoked optimism in the farm sector. however the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.kuruburu shanthakumar, president of state farmers federation, had expected categorical commitment from the modi government on implementing the swaminathan committee report, which modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. however, he welcomed the budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (msp) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.the proposal is also to extend the msp scheme to all the 89 crops. it was earlier restricted to 43. he also welcome kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.shanthakumar told the new indian express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.though the budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. it needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.i will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the modi government, shantakumar said.on allocating rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert s v hittalamani said in karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.however, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. karnataka rajya raitha sangha president kodihalli chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is rs 11,000 crore. how much of it actually goes to farmers? whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.he further added that if the centre can bear rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation."

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low.

The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming.

Dried eucalyptus branches, which are burnt to crack the stone underneath, litter the hill. The entire hillock has been carved out, leaving just a small fort on top.Every night, 2 to 4 truckloads of stones are taken from the hill... the mining has been happening for decades by some influential people, said a villager.Over the years, quarrying has come to the edge of the fort. Now, blocks are removed from right under the fort. The fort wont last long, said the villager. The origin of the fort is unclear, with some historians believing that the structure could date back to the 17th century, where it was used as a defence post for the army. It is from this post, that they could get a view of the plains stretching till Bengaluru.However, there is no legislation to protect the structure.No recognition givenThe unprotected site is just one of the estimated 30,000 historical structures dotting the States landscape that has not been recognised under either the Central Acts governing the Archaeological Department or State laws for the State Archaeological Department.Experts believe a majority of these structures, like the Uddappanahalli fort, are under threat. Their fears were communicated to Tourism Department officials during a recent meeting on protecting such monuments.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942. Surveys do not cost much, and there are enough archaeologists and students who can do it.It needs to be done before we lose out on a lot of history. Weve already spoiled megalithic burial (10,000 to 30,000 years old) sites in most places of the states, said N.S. Rangaraju, a former Archaeology professor and a member of the Heritage Expert Committee.A few years ago, he and his students had taken up a pilot of three districts in south Karnataka. Over 550 unprotected structures were identified. These monuments are over 100 years old, and many of these are religious structures under the Muzrai Department, which does not have the expertise for conservation, he said.S.K. Aruni from Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) said a majority of these unprotected structures represent hundreds of years of village histories.There needs to be a micro-level documentation of history. But, it needs involvement from the people and the panchayat first. If they can get a preliminary document of the historical structures in the village, then researchers can build upon it, he said.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942.

RangarajuMember of the Heritage Expert Committee","a muddy path snakes its way between eucalyptus plantations, stone quarries and fields of tomatoes to reveal a hollowed-out hill at uddappanahalli in kolar district. dried eucalyptus branches, which are burnt to crack the stone underneath, litter the hill. the entire hillock has been carved out, leaving just a small fort on top.every night, 2 to 4 truckloads of stones are taken from the hill... the mining has been happening for decades by some influential people, said a villager.over the years, quarrying has come to the edge of the fort. now, blocks are removed from right under the fort. the fort wont last long, said the villager. the origin of the fort is unclear, with some historians believing that the structure could date back to the 17th century, where it was used as a defence post for the army. it is from this post, that they could get a view of the plains stretching till bengaluru.however, there is no legislation to protect the structure.no recognition giventhe unprotected site is just one of the estimated 30,000 historical structures dotting the states landscape that has not been recognised under either the central acts governing the archaeological department or state laws for the state archaeological department.experts believe a majority of these structures, like the uddappanahalli fort, are under threat. their fears were communicated to tourism department officials during a recent meeting on protecting such monuments.there has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942. surveys do not cost much, and there are enough archaeologists and students who can do it.it needs to be done before we lose out on a lot of history. weve already spoiled megalithic burial (10,000 to 30,000 years old) sites in most places of the states, said n.s. rangaraju, a former archaeology professor and a member of the heritage expert committee.a few years ago, he and his students had taken up a pilot of three districts in south karnataka. over 550 unprotected structures were identified. these monuments are over 100 years old, and many of these are religious structures under the muzrai department, which does not have the expertise for conservation, he said.s.k. aruni from indian council for historical research (ichr) said a majority of these unprotected structures represent hundreds of years of village histories.there needs to be a micro-level documentation of history. but, it needs involvement from the people and the panchayat first. if they can get a preliminary document of the historical structures in the village, then researchers can build upon it, he said.there has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942. surveys do not cost much, and there are enough archaeologists and students who can do it. it needs to be done before we lose out on a lot of history.n.s. rangarajumember of the heritage expert committee"

However, market research department at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) said tomato prices were likely to improve after the onset of northeast monsoon.A price advisory from the university attributed the drop in the prices to steady arrival of tomato to local markets from Karnataka. Once the monsoon sets in, transport of the crop from the neighbouring state might get hit and as a result tomato prices might go up in the state.Tomato is being sold at Rs 19-Rs 23 per kg in retail stores and markets, while the farm gate price is around Rs 11-Rs 13 per kg. However, maintaining and harvesting the crop is labour intensive and heavy rain had led to some spoilage, Veerappa, a farmer from Thondamuthur, said.
