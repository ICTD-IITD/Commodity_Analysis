2020-02-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/coronavirus-outbreak-kerala-india-china-wuhan-6258175/,"The Flu: How Kerala, China are tackling coronavirus","For Kerala, the virus is a fresh challenge after the deadly Nipah outbreak of 2018 and 2019 that had claimed 17 lives, all in 2018. For Kerala, the virus is a fresh challenge after the deadly Nipah outbreak of 2018 and 2019 that had claimed 17 lives, all in 2018.Kerala: Three positive cases in country, all from state; 3,144 people under observationThe 22-year-old, a medical student at a university in Wuhan, China, is home in Malappuram and, as usual, the focus of everyones attention. Only, this time, its edgy. Twice a day he gets a call from the local government hospital, inquiring if he has fever or sore throat. A few times in the day, his mother serves him food wearing a mask. The rest of the time he is on his smartphone.The 22-year-old has been under a 28-day quarantine at his home in Keralas Malappuram district ever since he came back on January 22 from Wuhan, the capital of Chinas Hubei province and the epicentre of a virulent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that has, as of February 8, claimed at least 723 lives and infected 34,600 people in China.The 22-year-old is one of the 3,144 people under observation in Kerala, which has reported three positive cases of coronavirus, so far the only confirmed cases of the virus in India. I am feeling perfectly fine. But the person who calls from the hospital says that if I develop any symptoms, the local primary health centre will send an ambulance over. The health inspector has told me that I should not voluntarily move out, he says over the phone.I watch the news on my mobile phone. I am also in touch with friends from Wuhan who are under observation, he says, adding, I recently got a message from the state health department calling me a hero for surrendering my freedom for the safety of society.For Kerala, the virus is a fresh challenge after the deadly Nipah outbreak of 2018 and 2019 that had claimed 17 lives, all in 2018. The state has been on vigil since January 17, when the Centre sounded an alert for coronavirus. By January 30, the figure of those under observation had touched 1,053. Within the next five days, with the three positive cases being reported, Kerala declared a state calamity. At 418, Malappuram district has the highest number of persons under observation for suspected exposure to the virus.To tackle the challenge, the state health department has fallen back on its past experience in managing the Nipah outbreak and put in place a multi-level mechanism for surveillance and control of the infection.Outside an isolation unit at the Government Medical College, Thrissur, where one of the three positive coronavirus cases has been reported.

Express Photo by Anoop K VenuWe have an excellent system at various levels to monitor those exposed to the infection. We have activated the emergency system which was in operation during the Nipah days, says Dr Mohanan Kunnummal, vice chancellor of Kerala University of Health Sciences.By the third week of January, when the Union government sounded a nCoV alert, the health department set up a state-level control room and a rapid response team which were directly linked to the 14 district medical offices.Isolation units were prepared in all the six medical colleges and 14 district government hospitals. The most critical aspect of reining in the virus was zeroing in on persons with suspected exposure to the virus in China and isolating them, says Dr Amar Fettle, the state health departments nodal officer for Public Health Emergency of International Concern.Explained: Remdesivir, the drug a China college wants to patent to fight coronavirusThe control room started by first obtaining a list of passengers from China who had deboarded at the states international airports, and tracked them down. Initially, only passengers at Kochi International Airport were screened, but the exercise was soon extended to the other three international airports  Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur  in the state. Even domestic passengers  who had landed at international terminals in other states and moved to Kerala  were screened.Simultaneously, a screening exercise was initiated at the grassroots level. Junior public health inspectors, public health nurses and ASHA workers kept a tab on those who had returned from abroad. A list of those suspected to have caught the flu was sent to the control room, which, in turn, sent a list of people to be monitored to all district medical officers. Thereafter, each person on the list was assigned to a primary or family health centre.At the primary health centre, the medical superintendent and the staff ensure that the patients are strictly following the quarantine guidelines. These centres also have to mail two reports, one in the morning and another in the evening, to the state control room everyday via the district medical officer, explains Dr V Jayasree, the medical officer in Kozhikode district, where 378 persons are under observation (as on February 8).Since those who left China before the Indian governments evacuation exercise came to Kerala via Kolkata, it was fairly straightforward for the state health department officials to prepare a list of those with Chinese travel history. As the list was compiled quickly, all of them were put under instant observation. While many of these people voluntarily reported to the department and went into isolation at homes, we had to track down another section of people who had returned from China but were unsure about what to do next, says Dr Fettle.After the health department received information about the positive tests, the next step was to prepare a list of those who had come in contact with infected patients. These people were categorised into two sections  high- and low-risk. Those in the high risk were persons who had spent long hours with the confirmed cases, or those who had had any fluid contact with them.The Nipah virus was confined to Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. This time, while the three confirmed cases are from Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasaragod, those under observation hail from districts across the state, said an official.So far, Kerala has deployed over 100 experts and officials, including doctors, at the state-level control room. The team has been further split into 18 committees, each with a specific task  managing the treatment of the positive cases, collecting samples and their dispatch, community-level volunteers for supporting those in isolation, and a psychological support team for those under home quarantine, among other duties. Apart from a state-level medical board, three separate medical boards have been instituted in the three districts that has reported the positive cases of coronavirus.Read | 61 coronavirus cases on ship, Indian crew in quarantineWe have also set up a call centre to address the publics doubts about the infection. We have received 9,000 calls so far, said an official. Also, 7,515 elected representatives in local self-governing bodies and 14,177 Kudumbashree (the poverty eradication and women empowerment programme of the state government) volunteers have been trained on public health issues as part of a capacity-building exercise by the state health department.Since February 3, the control room has also been helping those in quarantine with tele-counselling. So far, we have not received any complaints of mental trauma. Most people in quarantine only had doubts about the infection, says Dr Maya Peethambaran, nodal officer for tele-counselling in Alappuzha district.China: 723 deaths, over 34,000 infectionsPatients at an exhibition centre that has been converted into a temporary hospital in Wuhan. (AP Photo) Patients at an exhibition centre that has been converted into a temporary hospital in Wuhan. (AP Photo)Ningning thinks of them as DIY slogans. From 8 am to 5 pm, a loudspeaker outside her parents home in a closely packed apartment compound in Shiyan in northwestern Hubei hollers at the community: If you have one peck of rice, dont go anywhere crowded; if you have one sprig of onion, dont hang at the market; if you have one piece of meat, dont show your face at the supermarket; if you have a breath of air, stay home and guard the ranch.Like the rest of Hubei province, Shiyan, a prefecture-level city about a seven-hour drive from Wuhan, is under lockdown. For the 300 families confined to their apartments, these slogans sound like cheesy poems on a loop, says Ningning, a 26-year-old who studies in Beijing. Like millions of people in China, she too was part of what is seen as the worlds largest annual migration  a trip home for the Chinese New Year. But from 1 am on January 25, Shiyan went quiet.The lockdown has brought life to a halt for the over 50 million residents of Hubei, who are now following a series of instructions  stay indoors, wash hands with soap regularly, wear a mask while stepping out, and nominate family members for grocery runs, among others. With authorities racing against time to build two hospitals, gyms and exhibition centres in the region are being converted into make-shift isolation wards.Read | Why Kerala could have a lesson on how to contain coronavirusAccording to Chinese health authorities, as of February 8, the virus has claimed at least 723 lives and infected 34,600 people in China. Twenty-four other countries have confirmed at least 266 infections in all. On January 30, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global emergency.Among those forced to stay indoors in Wuhan is Monika Sethuraman, a PhD scholar in international relations at the Central China Normal University in Wuhan. From late December, the 31-year-old had been poring over virus-related articles, after first reading about it in a Chinese blog. By the last week of January, I still saw very little news about it in the Indian media. I was worried, lots of Indians had left the town before the lockdown, she says.As the virus outbreak grew, the first batch of 324 Indian students were evacuated from Wuhan on February 1. One of the evacuees captured the journey in a five-minute video titled Indians evacuation on silent roads of China, set to the soundtrack of Miss Everything by Mindme and uploaded it on YouTube. The next day, a video of students wearing masks and dancing to Punjabi music from their quarantine camp in Manesar, Haryana, went viral.For weeks, says Sethuraman, she remained confused over whether to stay or leave. I was sniffling a bit and felt confused over what to do, whether it was safe to travel There were reports that the virus could be transmitted through faecal material, what if the public toilets are unclean? I just decided to stay, she says over WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app, from Wuhan.Among those who, as Sethuraman says, left just before the lockdown was a 25-year-old medical student from Delhi. He travelled with two of the three students from Kerala who tested positive for the coronavirus. We were doing our internship at a hospital in Wuhan in January when a patient with coronavirus was admitted. All foreign students were told to stay away though it wasnt certain at the time if human-to-human transmission was confirmed, he says over the phone from South Delhi.When word got out that a lockdown was imminent on January 24, he and a group of 12 students left town immediately. We took a train from Wuhan to Kunming, and then from there we flew to Kolkata. I then took a train to Delhi, he says. A journey of roughly 48 hours in all.Back in China, as the virus rapidly spread out of Wuhan, many kept a watch on those coming from Hubei  a Chinese identity card starting with the digits 42 indicates Hubei residency. In the weeks following the outbreak, many residents of the province have been subjected to unsolicited phone calls from strangers inquiring if they are running a fever.At Roshchino Airport outside Tyumen, Russia, medical teams prepare to receive passengers arriving from Wuhan. Reuters Photo At Roshchino Airport outside Tyumen, Russia, medical teams prepare to receive passengers arriving from Wuhan. Reuters PhotoEarlier this week, four Chinese cities, including Hangzhou and Taizhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang (about 800 km from Wuhan), restricted movement of its residents. The AFP reported that landlords in some parts of the province were also forbidden from renting property to people from severely affected areas such as Hubei if they had travelled to their hometowns recently.In Zhengzhou in Henan province, over 500 km from Wuhan, an Indian doctor explains the restrictions on residents. People in my apartment block are allowed to step out for only five hours each morning: 6 am to 11 am. We border Hubei province and we are under red alert, he says. Everywhere they check our temperature, when we leave the apartment, at the supermarket, on our way back. When I come back home, I have to show the apartment security team my passport and briefly pass through a room that sprays disinfectant on me to kill any germs on my clothes, he adds.Also Read | At key testing centre in Pune, 604 samples checked so farSince January 31, the 25-year-old doctor, who has been in China for seven years, has not been allowed to visit the hospital he works at. I step out of my room to use the toilet or cook some food. There is no fresh air here, he says.Across China, danwei or work units have been asked to monitor every employee. Every danwei across the country has been instructed to keep health details of its employees updated, including information such as temperature, health problems in the family, and if they have travelled to Wuhan, says Shanghai University Assistant Professor Rajiv Ranjan, adding, In Shanghai, there is a rationing system for masks, to avoid hoarding. The first batch of masks will be handed out from February 2 to 11. A household can register in their society using their hukou (household registration) or passport, and five masks per family for 2.5 kuai will be handed out.A British national who was visiting a friend in Hubei for the Chinese New Year says smaller towns have been dealing with the health crisis in a much calmer manner, unlike big cities which have been alarmed with real-time news reports. In villages, local authorities have been using gongs and loudspeakers to disseminate information because people may not read the news.While most Chinese cities wear dystopian looks, online, people seem to have found ways to amuse themselves. Videos of bored people reading books on statistics to their cats, making masks out of orange peels, dressing up as dragons, and playing indoor badminton have flooded the Internet.A Chinese man went to a public square in France wearing a mask and held a placard that read I am a human, I am not a virus. And then French people are seen hugging him, says Ranjan, recalling a video shared on a WeChat group to address the prejudice against Chinese people abroad after the outbreak.While most took to the Internet to kill time, Cui Xiaohui, a professor at Wuhan Universitys Big Data and Cloud Computing Lab, decided to use it to build an online platform to connect hospitals in need of medical supplies and those wanting to donate them. Using WeChat to organise 40 students, who sat alone in their apartments plugged into their laptops, Cui built Luoying Shanlian that connected donors to 800 hospitals across China. It is designed for smart phones. We send you a link and both donors and hospitals can submit contact information and details of what they have or need, he says. In the first two hours of its launch on February 1, the platform saw 1,00,000 clicks.For the Chinese, the year of the rat was meant to be auspicious, and as the country struggles to deal with the public health emergency, Lin Yin, a 35-year-old university professor from Foshan city in Guangdong province, is hopeful. This Spring festival, my father suffered a stroke and now there is misfortune for my country But we shall overcome this and help each other out, she says.Back in Wuhan, Sethuraman now spends her days volunteering at her universitys disease control centre, serving food and sharing information and reminders in various dormitory groups. During nights I do my term papers, she says. Apart from that I am trying to stay updated about the virus. I have no idea how this is going to end. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Residents of villages near the forest have been living in panic and do not venture out of their houses after sunset. The forest staff efforts to drive away the herd by burning tyres, beating of drums and blasting of crackers have not yielded the desired result.The elephants take shelter in the forests of Kendukhunta, Ghardgarda, Janhiphulia, Kalajodi, Baghbuda and Bhadua during the day and sneak into human habitation in the evening. Villagers of Dhanaghera, Sralibasa, Kendragadia, Sukhajodi, Luhapada, Taradigha, Dharampur, Chakuapada, and Kalajoid are the worst affected by the menace. Malati Singh, a resident of Baghbuda village said her family has been spending nights on the roof of her under-construction Indira Awas Yojana house for the last one week owing to the fear of the elephants. Sanjeeb Kumar Patra of Khuard village said communication between Denganalia and Raibania has been cut-off as few people dare to travel on the road after 5 pm.In a bid to tackle the menace, the Balasore Forest Division has started an initiative called Operation Gajraj in the district. DFO Biswaraj Panda said the herd has damaged rice, paddy and even houses in the affected areas. He said the elephants have been sneaking into human habitation in search of Mahua flowers. Panda said since the elephants cannot enter Rajabandh in West Bengal due to several obstacles placed by people there, they sneak into the district and create havoc here. As many as seven teams comprising Rangers of five forest ranges in the district along with other personnel have been engaged to drive out the elephants from the district.The DFO said officials of NESCO have been asked to cut-off electricity supply to places where the elephants have been sighted. Jaleswar Ranger Saroj Kumar Mohanty said the herd has been divided into three separate ones. While one of them is staying in Rangamatia forest, the other two are present at Sukjudi and Ambpua forests, just six to seven km from the West Bengal border We are keeping a close watch on their movements, he said.","by express news servicebalasore: a herd comprising 18 elephants from dalma forest in neighbouring jharkhand has been wreaking havoc in areas under raibania forest within jaleswar range for the last one month. residents of villages near the forest have been living in panic and do not venture out of their houses after sunset. the forest staff efforts to drive away the herd by burning tyres, beating of drums and blasting of crackers have not yielded the desired result.the elephants take shelter in the forests of kendukhunta, ghardgarda, janhiphulia, kalajodi, baghbuda and bhadua during the day and sneak into human habitation in the evening. villagers of dhanaghera, sralibasa, kendragadia, sukhajodi, luhapada, taradigha, dharampur, chakuapada, and kalajoid are the worst affected by the menace. malati singh, a resident of baghbuda village said her family has been spending nights on the roof of her under-construction indira awas yojana house for the last one week owing to the fear of the elephants. sanjeeb kumar patra of khuard village said communication between denganalia and raibania has been cut-off as few people dare to travel on the road after 5 pm.in a bid to tackle the menace, the balasore forest division has started an initiative called operation gajraj in the district. dfo biswaraj panda said the herd has damaged rice, paddy and even houses in the affected areas. he said the elephants have been sneaking into human habitation in search of mahua flowers. panda said since the elephants cannot enter rajabandh in west bengal due to several obstacles placed by people there, they sneak into the district and create havoc here. as many as seven teams comprising rangers of five forest ranges in the district along with other personnel have been engaged to drive out the elephants from the district.the dfo said officials of nesco have been asked to cut-off electricity supply to places where the elephants have been sighted. jaleswar ranger saroj kumar mohanty said the herd has been divided into three separate ones. while one of them is staying in rangamatia forest, the other two are present at sukjudi and ambpua forests, just six to seven km from the west bengal border we are keeping a close watch on their movements, he said."
2020-03-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/why-indias-popular-restaurants-are-creating-delivery-only-brands/article30998987.ece,Why India’s popular restaurants are creating delivery-only brands,"We all have our favourite restaurants, that we walk into for the familiar comfort of it, for the ambience, for the DJ who gets it just right, for the waiter who knows our go-to order, or for memories shared with friends, families or dates.And then we have our favourite order-at-home options, which may or may not be (and usually are not) the same as our walk-in haunts.Often, the latter is not a full-fledged restaurant but a cloud kitchen  one that focusses on how to portion and package a meal for one, indulgent or guilt-free, ideal for solitary binge sessions at the end of a long, hard day that leaves us too drained to cook. Restaurants are increasingly aware of why at-home diners prefer cloud kitchens over them. A large part of it has to do with serving size. First movers in Indias cloud kitchen scene  like Rebel Foods, the Pune-based entity that owns Faasos, Lunch Box, Behrouz, The Good Bowl and Oven Story among others  tend to have menus featuring either single-person dishes and combos, or party sizes fit for at least four to five people. Both tailored for a night in, be it social or solitary.Restaurants and cafs, on the other hand, serve items that are either meant to be shared by two people, or that come with their share of frills in terms of sides, sauces and platings. Attractive when eating out, cumbersome when dining in.So a few of them have started changing things around. Take, for instance, the 11-year-old chain Smoke House Deli, which has branches in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and Kolkata. The brand has started relaunching its restaurants as Smoke House Deli 2.0, the fourth and most recent one unveiled in Delhi this week.In a company statement, Smoke House Deli 2.0 boasts healthier options in its menu, a more airy, open, and modern ambience, and more importantly, a grab-and-go counter which has its own, separate presence on food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato. The latter is called Goodness To Go by Smoke House Deli, and features a menu curated by brand head and head chef Jaydeep Mukherjee.According to Jaydeep, the idea is to provide a station where patrons can step in to grab quick meals, healthy smoothies, salads, sandwiches etc. Easy and convenient, it allows patrons to keep up with their busy lifestyle on-the-go, while still eating mindfully. The packaging keeps that in mind, making the food easy to grab not only for rushing customers, but also for delivery personnel.Meanwhile, Chennai-based Ciclo Cafe, which expanded its presence to Bengaluru and Delhi, has now scaled back into its hometown and is working on regrouping, says marketing head Amrutha Anandanathan. The caf has launched a health-based delivery vertical called Ciclo Life, which features a salad bowl and meals, with plenty of quinoa, millets and cauliflower rice making their presence felt. Says Amrutha, We dont want to call it health food completely, but rather delicious food with a healthy leaning. The menu also includes popular staples that we have taken from Ciclo Cafe, and given healthier variations, including multigrain and keto-friendly options. The service has three successfully running branches in Chennai alone  RA Puram, Anna Nagar and OMR  and is now confident of expanding well in other cities. We have experienced chefs, and a team that knows how to run things. We are strengthening our home base first, adds Amrutha.In terms of operations, this system seems to be working out to the restaurants advantage, with the basic infrastructure already built in and a whole new clientle to reach out to. With the same team and kitchen staff handling these new verticals, restaurants can retain the image and branding that provided them loyal customers over the years, instead of depending on the outsourced kitchens and infrastructure provided by delivery platforms, that many cloud-only kitchens tend to depend on.Swiggy, for instance, is reportedly tying-up with Bengaluru-based restobar chain Gillys, for the operation of two new delivery-only brands. One is called Kitchens of Punjab, and the other is Kitchens of China. These outfits operate out of infrastructure that are already existent at Gillys outlets, and be run by the existing Gillys staff. Swiggy does not offer any infrastructure in this case; it only helps with delivery, according to Swiggy. Only the menu and the online presence will be separate from the motherbrand, and will be focussed entirely on delivery, according to Swiggy.Similarly, Goodness To Go by Smoke House Deli operates out of a central kitchen that is otherwise used for coordination between its various Mumbai branches. While Goodness To Go is mainly present as a counter within each Smoke House Deli 2.0, a standalone outpost operates inside a Crossword bookstore in Mumbais Kemps Corner, and depends entirely on this central kitchen. On delivery apps, too, this vertical stands on its own with a full menu. More are to follow, in other bookstores and unexpected hangouts. The idea, as chef Jaydeep puts it, is for it to metamorphose into an artfully imaginative, wholesome and evolved version of itself.","we all have our favourite restaurants, that we walk into for the familiar comfort of it, for the ambience, for the dj who gets it just right, for the waiter who knows our go-to order, or for memories shared with friends, families or dates.and then we have our favourite order-at-home options, which may or may not be (and usually are not) the same as our walk-in haunts.often, the latter is not a full-fledged restaurant but a cloud kitchen  one that focusses on how to portion and package a meal for one, indulgent or guilt-free, ideal for solitary binge sessions at the end of a long, hard day that leaves us too drained to cook. restaurants are increasingly aware of why at-home diners prefer cloud kitchens over them. a large part of it has to do with serving size. first movers in indias cloud kitchen scene  like rebel foods, the pune-based entity that owns faasos, lunch box, behrouz, the good bowl and oven story among others  tend to have menus featuring either single-person dishes and combos, or party sizes fit for at least four to five people. both tailored for a night in, be it social or solitary.restaurants and cafs, on the other hand, serve items that are either meant to be shared by two people, or that come with their share of frills in terms of sides, sauces and platings. attractive when eating out, cumbersome when dining in.so a few of them have started changing things around. take, for instance, the 11-year-old chain smoke house deli, which has branches in mumbai, bengaluru, delhi and kolkata. the brand has started relaunching its restaurants as smoke house deli 2.0, the fourth and most recent one unveiled in delhi this week.in a company statement, smoke house deli 2.0 boasts healthier options in its menu, a more airy, open, and modern ambience, and more importantly, a grab-and-go counter which has its own, separate presence on food delivery platforms swiggy and zomato. the latter is called goodness to go by smoke house deli, and features a menu curated by brand head and head chef jaydeep mukherjee.according to jaydeep, the idea is to provide a station where patrons can step in to grab quick meals, healthy smoothies, salads, sandwiches etc. easy and convenient, it allows patrons to keep up with their busy lifestyle on-the-go, while still eating mindfully. the packaging keeps that in mind, making the food easy to grab not only for rushing customers, but also for delivery personnel.meanwhile, chennai-based ciclo cafe, which expanded its presence to bengaluru and delhi, has now scaled back into its hometown and is working on regrouping, says marketing head amrutha anandanathan. the caf has launched a health-based delivery vertical called ciclo life, which features a salad bowl and meals, with plenty of quinoa, millets and cauliflower rice making their presence felt. says amrutha, we dont want to call it health food completely, but rather delicious food with a healthy leaning. the menu also includes popular staples that we have taken from ciclo cafe, and given healthier variations, including multigrain and keto-friendly options. the service has three successfully running branches in chennai alone  ra puram, anna nagar and omr  and is now confident of expanding well in other cities. we have experienced chefs, and a team that knows how to run things. we are strengthening our home base first, adds amrutha.in terms of operations, this system seems to be working out to the restaurants advantage, with the basic infrastructure already built in and a whole new clientle to reach out to. with the same team and kitchen staff handling these new verticals, restaurants can retain the image and branding that provided them loyal customers over the years, instead of depending on the outsourced kitchens and infrastructure provided by delivery platforms, that many cloud-only kitchens tend to depend on.swiggy, for instance, is reportedly tying-up with bengaluru-based restobar chain gillys, for the operation of two new delivery-only brands. one is called kitchens of punjab, and the other is kitchens of china. these outfits operate out of infrastructure that are already existent at gillys outlets, and be run by the existing gillys staff. swiggy does not offer any infrastructure in this case;

(Express photo by Partha Paul) A deserted market in Kolkatas Posta area on Wednesday. (Express photo by Partha Paul)Gauri Devi is squatting right in the middle of a narrow lane slicing through the Posta wholesale market in north Kolkata. She is inspecting a heap of pulses that is laid in front of her like a puzzle. On a regular day, the 70-year-old would have got in the way of coolies gingerly balancing sacks of rice, pulses and spices on their back, but this is not a regular day. These are not regular times.Ever since Prime Minister Modi announced the lockdown on 24th March, traders and wholesalers here and in markets around the country, have had to envisage scenarios that they couldnt ever imagine.After CM (Mamata Banerjee) came and asked us to ensure that there is smooth supply of goods to other markets of Kolkata. She said passes are to those who are regulars at these markets.We are opening the shops in phases. So that people dont crowd, says Chandan Chakraborty, working president of Posta Merchants association.Even then, the biggest wholesale market in eastern India and a vital source of grocery items and onions, wore a desolate look on a weekday morning.There are no labourers left here. Of the 5000 odd labourers who work exclusively for the Posta market, only about 350 have stayed back. So, even when retailers come, they dont have labourers to ferry good. Moreover, we have enough stock till the lockdown lasts, after that we will have to figure out what to do , says Chakraborty.In the fifty years that Gauri Devi has spent sweeping the floors of Posta Market, she has never seen anything like this. There have been floods, yes, but even then people would flock to buy essentials here. But this is something else, she says, adjusting a flimsy mask on her face.For the past two weeks, Gauri, a resident of the nearby slum of Alupatty, hasnt earned a penny. Generally, she earns enough to feed herself by sweeping spillages of goods that are carried by coolies, but now there is nothing to clean.Hardly anyone is coming to buy goods. Our sales are down by 75 per cent, says KK Gupta, who owns a wholesale spice shop at the market.Posta, which would see retailers from neighbouring states like Assam and Sikkim, among others, hasnt seen any buyers from neighbouring states.How will they come? They have no means to come. Though the CM has ensured that food supply wont be stopped, many retailers are afraid to come from faraway places. And interstate travelling is not allowed, says Shibu Das, who owns a wholesale grocery store at the market.Though there are reassurances of the supply chain being restored, many traders are a bit sceptical.There are a whole lot of items that are outsourced from other states. Like pulses and grains, which we get from UP and Gujarat. What will we do when our stock gets over. A rough estimate tells us that we have enough till the lockdown lasts. But if it is extended and the supply from other states dont come, we dont know what to do, says Prabhat Kumar Sarangi, a trader from Posta.The supply shortage has already taken toll in neighbourhood markets of the city. We are not facing problems reaching the wholesale market anymore. The problem is they are running out of goods and therefore are increasing price of items. Branded items, like spice powders, atta and oil which come from other states are being sold at premium rates, says Vijay Sau of Maniktala Bazar Byabsayee Samiti of North Kolkata.

This is absolutely unacceptable, Dilip Ghosh said.We have received reports that people are not getting relief material in many districts. Hoarding of essential items has led to price rise and the state government is doing nothing, Ghosh added.Urban development minister and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said the opposition leaders were breaking the rules of the lockdown announced to stop the spread of coronavirus disease.Opposition leaders should not put people at risk by starting a political competition.

They now do not have money to buy rice and other essential commodities from open market.A couple, Chaturbhuj Bera and Sakuntala Bera of Kuwardihi village said they catch fish from Subarnarekha river to sustain themselves.However, they have not ventured out of their house since the lockdown and this has affected their income. Sarojini Kisku of Chaksuliapada, who recently divorced her husband and lives with her six-year-old son, used to collect firewood from the nearby forest and is unable to do so since the lockdown.Similar is the plight of Mangal Hansdah who worked as a pick-up van driver.

However, this year, the festival, which celebrates the bounty of nature, will be in the middle of a lockdown to stop and slow the spread of COVID-19. So the celebrations are muted and in empathy with those battling the pandemic.Like many of his brethren, author Susmesh Chandroth, working with a visual media production firm in Kolkata, was planning to visit Kerala during the festival. But all that has been put off now. For Malayalis, Vishu in 2020 will be unlike any we have experienced in the last 100 years or so, says Susmesh.Susmesh Chandroth | Photo Credit: PV SUJITHWriter and scenarist Unni R feels that perhaps, for the first time in the history of Kerala, this Vishu will pass as just another ordinary day in our lives. After all, when the death toll (from the Coronavirus) balloons by the day and fear engulfs all around, I do not know how we can celebrate Vishu. I believe it would be a generous and beautiful gesture to curtail the elaboration of our customary sadya on the day and consider it a meal that can be shared with someone who may be in need of it this time, he believes.Unni R | Photo Credit: Thulasi KakkatThe Meesha author and screenplay writer S Hareesh points out that these are all man-made customs and practices. At present, places of worship are out of bounds for most people. This year, the Haj has been withheld and the Thrissur Pooram will be held only as a ritual without the pomp and pageantry associated with it. Last year, there were many who were agitated because they were worried that elephants may not be paraded as part of the Pooram. It would be nice if people remember that it is we who create all these festivals and traditions.S Hareesh | Photo Credit: Rajeev PrasadHe says he himself will have a simple home-made vegetarian sadya. I dont have this practice of arranging a Vishukkani (when vegetables and seasonal fruits are arranged in a bowl in the pooja room) and I will continue that practice, he adds.Although Vishu celebrations are always grand in Kozhikode, KP Sudheeras home town, she says that celebration is the last thing on her mind this time. Although Kerala is tackling the pandemic in a good way, I am worried about the lakhs of people across the world who are battling the virus. I can empathise with the plight of non-resident Malayalis who look forward to Vishu and the summer vacation to come home to meet their families, she explains.KP Sudheera | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAnita Nair says that for the last two years, she had spent Vishu in her cottage in her village at Mundakottukkurussi in Palakkad district. It was as basic as it could get with what was available  a sprig of Konnappoo (laburnum), a coconut, a hand of bananas, a kani-vellarikka, the mandatory mirror, mundu, rice, gold and coins. And since I live alone in my cottage, I would light the lamp with half-closed eyes and open them wide to see the kani. My caretaker there, Sundaran, was the first person who I saw on Vishu day for the last two years. I remember him asking me why I didnt have apples and grapes in the kani plate. And I remember telling him that I didnt think apples and grapes grew in Kerala so why on earth would that appear in the kani plate?However, this year, Anita is in Bengaluru with her husband and son who are both atheists and late risers [in all honesty, I dont know which is worse with reference to Vishu] and so I intend to see my kani in my library. She adds: Only this time there will be no konnappoo or kani vellarikka but as the superhero in heaven is a great one for irony, there will be apples and grapes for thats whats available. In my library, there are books and paintings, music and plants and everything that I hope my year will be blessed with. And this year, I am going to try making my ela ada with all-spice leaves...as any Malayali will tell you, we are the masters and mistresses of making do. And so it shall be.Anita Nair | Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar VermaTranslator, academic and author J Devika writes in an e-mail: I must confess that I do not plan to celebrate Vishu at all. In our region, Vishu and other festivals still mostly mark the rhythm of seasons and the agricultural calendar that accompanied it. Climate change ensures that this rhythm is now broken, the agricultural calendar is non-existent simply because we have turned away from farming!J Devika | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAnita recalls that on the day of Vishu in Kerala, she used to go across to her parents home to see them. We have no more fields and I havent seen a plough in years. Nevertheless, in my effort to be as traditional as possible, last year, I also made the ela ada, which is used to worship the plough.Susmesh adds that as a writer, he has observed that pandemics or disease outbreaks have lent themselves as stark themes for great literary works such as Albert Camus The Plague or Kakkanadans Vasoori. Even iconic authors in Malayalam such as O V Vijayan and M T Vasudevan Nair have touched upon elements of the theme in their works.

2020-04-13,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-sex-workers-real-threat-lies-after-the-lockdown-is-lifted/story-04hma6KgoCjPZrGXHjDN7O.html,Kolkata sex workers:&thinsp;Real threat lies after the lockdown is lifted,"kolkataUpdated: Apr 13, 2020 16:26 ISTSex workers of Kolkatas Sonagachhi and other red-light areas in West Bengal will confront their biggest threat of contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) when the lockdown is lifted and customers start visiting their brothels again, medical specialists said.The brothels are shut until the end of May -- a month beyond the end of April when an extended lockdown is expected to be lifted -- and relief materials in the form of rice, lentils and potatoes are being supplied to those who may be in need by government agencies, elected representatives and non-government organisations.Relief will stop coming once the lockdown is over. But it would be of great danger if the sex workers are allowed to operate as soon as the lockdown is lifted. Due to their nature of work and the congested way in which they live, one single case can infect a hundred, said Smarajit Jana, a doctor and chief advisor of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), the biggest NGO working with Bengals sex workers.DMSC, which has about 65,000 members  all of them sex workers  spread across 50 red-light areas in the state, has launched a social media campaign to raise money so that sex workers can be supported even after the lockdown and avoid having to accept customers.The minimum house rent in Sonagachhi is Rs5,000 per month. Besides, most of the sex workers families depend on them. If we failed to make an arrangement for them for the month of May, they will start accepting clients and it could lead to a disaster, said Bishakha, a sex worker based in Sonagachhi in Kolkata, Asias largest red-light area with about 11,000 sex workers.On average, Sonagachhi draws 35,000 footfalls per day. Most houses in the area that function as brothels have 30-35 residents.At Kalna in East Burdwan district, a local social organisation working for sex workers put up blockades at both entrances of the red-light area after some clients tried to enter the area last week.There would be huge crowds the moment the lockdown is lifted. It would be impossible for sex workers to identify people carrying the virus. And if they are not provided with some monetary relief apart from foodgrains, a section of them would accept clients and that would create a great risk, said Mafizul Rahman of Aamra Padatik, an organisation that works with the children of sex workers based in Kalna.He said the organisation had requested the police to ensure the area remains under lockdown until the end of May. How the 450-odd sex workers living here would be provided for in May remains to be decided, Rahman said.Organisations working in the industrial towns of Burdwan and Asansol have taken similar decision of keeping the red-light area out of bounds for the clients of sex workers until the end of May.It depends a lot how much support we get from the governments, NGOs and social organisations. Without help, sex workers may not listen to us, said Nilkamal, who works with sex workers in Durgapur. The red light area has about 800 active sex workers.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday asked the police commissioner of Kolkata to provide food to the sex workers and transgender communities in the city. Similar instructions were also issued to the Howrah police commissioner.I have asked Anuj Sharma, commissioner of Kolkata Police, to provide food to the sex workers, transgenders and the dwarf people in Kolkata. I have tried to help them as far as I could with volunteers.

However, this year, the festival, which celebrates the bounty of nature, will be in the middle of a lockdown to stop and slow the spread of COVID-19. So the celebrations are muted and in empathy with those battling the pandemic.Like many of his brethren, author Susmesh Chandroth, working with a visual media production firm in Kolkata, was planning to visit Kerala during the festival. But all that has been put off now. For Malayalis, Vishu in 2020 will be unlike any we have experienced in the last 100 years or so, says Susmesh.Susmesh Chandroth | Photo Credit: PV SUJITHWriter and scenarist Unni R feels that perhaps, for the first time in the history of Kerala, this Vishu will pass as just another ordinary day in our lives. After all, when the death toll (from the Coronavirus) balloons by the day and fear engulfs all around, I do not know how we can celebrate Vishu. I believe it would be a generous and beautiful gesture to curtail the elaboration of our customary sadya on the day and consider it a meal that can be shared with someone who may be in need of it this time, he believes.Unni R | Photo Credit: Thulasi KakkatThe Meesha author and screenplay writer S Hareesh points out that these are all man-made customs and practices. At present, places of worship are out of bounds for most people. This year, the Haj has been withheld and the Thrissur Pooram will be held only as a ritual without the pomp and pageantry associated with it. Last year, there were many who were agitated because they were worried that elephants may not be paraded as part of the Pooram. It would be nice if people remember that it is we who create all these festivals and traditions.S Hareesh | Photo Credit: Rajeev PrasadHe says he himself will have a simple home-made vegetarian sadya. I dont have this practice of arranging a Vishukkani (when vegetables and seasonal fruits are arranged in a bowl in the pooja room) and I will continue that practice, he adds.Although Vishu celebrations are always grand in Kozhikode, KP Sudheeras home town, she says that celebration is the last thing on her mind this time. Although Kerala is tackling the pandemic in a good way, I am worried about the lakhs of people across the world who are battling the virus. I can empathise with the plight of non-resident Malayalis who look forward to Vishu and the summer vacation to come home to meet their families, she explains.KP Sudheera | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAnita Nair says that for the last two years, she had spent Vishu in her cottage in her village at Mundakottukkurussi in Palakkad district. It was as basic as it could get with what was available  a sprig of Konnappoo (laburnum), a coconut, a hand of bananas, a kani-vellarikka, the mandatory mirror, mundu, rice, gold and coins. And since I live alone in my cottage, I would light the lamp with half-closed eyes and open them wide to see the kani. My caretaker there, Sundaran, was the first person who I saw on Vishu day for the last two years. I remember him asking me why I didnt have apples and grapes in the kani plate. And I remember telling him that I didnt think apples and grapes grew in Kerala so why on earth would that appear in the kani plate?However, this year, Anita is in Bengaluru with her husband and son who are both atheists and late risers [in all honesty, I dont know which is worse with reference to Vishu] and so I intend to see my kani in my library. She adds: Only this time there will be no konnappoo or kani vellarikka but as the superhero in heaven is a great one for irony, there will be apples and grapes for thats whats available. In my library, there are books and paintings, music and plants and everything that I hope my year will be blessed with. And this year, I am going to try making my ela ada with all-spice leaves...as any Malayali will tell you, we are the masters and mistresses of making do. And so it shall be.Anita Nair | Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar VermaTranslator, academic and author J Devika writes in an e-mail: I must confess that I do not plan to celebrate Vishu at all.

We have no more fields and I havent seen a plough in years. Nevertheless, in my effort to be as traditional as possible, last year, I also made the ela ada, which is used to worship the plough.Susmesh adds that as a writer, he has observed that pandemics or disease outbreaks have lent themselves as stark themes for great literary works such as Albert Camus The Plague or Kakkanadans Vasoori. Even iconic authors in Malayalam such as O V Vijayan and M T Vasudevan Nair have touched upon elements of the theme in their works.

It also exposed holes in the governments repeated claims that it has been providing food and other essentials to those who need it most.News of the protest led almost immediately to political bickering between the government and opposition - an indication of how difficult it has been for migrant workers to get politicians to halt their oneupmanship and just listen - even during a pandemic.It isnt just the migrants pleas that have fallen on deaf ears; those who have taken up their cause have been ignored, according to Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN), a group of 73 volunteers. It has interacted with 640 groups comprising 11,159 stranded workers across the country, including 291 groups comprising 3,992 migrants in Maharashtra.SWAN, which has been trying to procure food and other essentials from the government for these groups, said that not a single group of migrants its volunteers met in thehas received any aid from the government. We have made repeated calls to government helplines and reached out to them on Twitter but ultimately no rations have been delivered. None of the groups in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region that we met has received any help from the government whatsoever, said a volunteer.Damningly, its report on the matter states that a whopping 71 per cent of migrants interviewed in Maharashtra said they had enough rations for just one meal a day. The figure for Karnataka was 36 per cent.On Wednesday, Mirror reporters met migrant workers in various parts of Mumbai, including Durga camp at Antop Hill, Shastri Nagar in Bandra East, and Worlis Adarsh Nagar, and asked about the hardships they have been facing, what they need, and what support, if any, they have received from the government. Read on to find out what they said.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(32)Durga camp, near the church at Antop HillAbout 100 migrants in the area are stuckShankar Shahu, who makes a living installing and repairing tiles in homes and offices, said his family - a wife and two children - has been surviving on one meal a day for the past fortnight. He said, I have been running the house on borrowed money. I have taken food grains from shops on credit and have asked people I know for cash. But now I am running out of people to ask for help. We have been eating only one meal a day because there is no money to buy enough rations for the family. I havent even paid my house rent for the last month.Shahu, who is originally from Bihar, has been living in a chawl at Antop Hill for the past 12 years. He said he used to earn a decent amount - enough to feed his family and send his children to school - but now everything has changed.I doubt whether things will return to normal any time in the near future. I dont think my work will restart immediately after the lockdown is lifted. No one has money to spend on anything. I am worried about my childrens future and education, he said. When asked if government officials or anyhas reached out to help him, he said no. Neither did anyone come to help us nor did I try to flee the city. There is so much uncertainty [around travelling long distances on foot during the lockdown] and I did not want to get stuck in between. There are at least 100 people like me in this area. We are trying to support each other mentally, he said.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(24)Shastri Nagar, 2nd lane, Bandra (West)7,000 to 8,000 migrants in the area are stuckMasum Ali, who has been working at construction sites across the city for the past seven years, witnessed on Tuesday how hundreds of migrants came out on the streets near Bandra (West) railway station. Alis family is in West Bengal while he lives in Mumbai with other migrants. His ailing parents and two sisters are financially dependent on him. He said, I do not know exactly what happened [on Tuesday]. A large number of people who wanted to go home started gathering at the station. We all have no work and no money and, until two days ago, no food. Only for the last couple of days has someone been sending us food twice a day. I do not have any reason to stay here. I live in a tiny room with 10 others. I would like to at least go back to my village and be safe with the family.Ali said he was worried by the extension to the lockdown and that it would be impossible to continue like this until May 4. I cannot sustain myself here with just food packets. I need work and money too. If the situation does not change quickly then I wont be able to survive. Even my family cannot go on like this, he said.The BMC said it has started supplying food to migrants in Bandra and has distributed 50,000 food packets since March 28. After Tuesdays incident, the civic body sent 4,000 more food packets and made toilets and other sanitation facilities available to the migrant workers.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Baiganwadi, Govandi100A majority of the migrant workers in Baiganwadi are from West Bengal, and a few are from Bihar and Jharkhand. Most of them are employed in a mid-size footwear manufacturing factory in the locality, and earn about Rs 10,000 a month. Many of them arrived in Mumbai in their teens looking for work, and have settled into dingy rooms which accommodate ten to 15 of them.One of the factory workers, 36-year-old Iqbal Sheikh, says that he arrived in Mumbai when he was just 20 years old, and he has never felt this helpless. The factory has been shut and we couldnt go back home because of the lockdown. We havent eaten anything for the past few days. Many among us are losing hope, we are getting increasingly frustrated, Sheikh says, asking if we could arrange food for them.Over the years, Baiganwadi has grown into one of Mumbais most densely populated slum pockets. And like most slum colonies, it lacks basic amenities such as toilets, sanitation, and proper roads. Sheikh, who lives in a tiny room with eight others, says he and his roommates called up theon several occasions, but did not even get a proper response, leave aside food. Please, let us just go back to our villages. Please, we dont want anything else, he says.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lohar Khata, Dockyard Road200As the name suggests, Lohar Khata is the hub of metal industry in Mumbai. Rows and rows of iron casting and nuts and bolts manufacturing units, and tiny rooms housing hundreds of people toiling in these units, stand cheek by jowl in one of Mumbais oldest localities. During the time when Mumbai was Bombay, there was a saying that every labourer arriving in the city looking for work first lands up at Lohar Khata.Now that these factories have been silenced by coronavirus, the migrant workers are trapped in no mans land: theres no money and no food here, and theres no transportation to return home. One such family  Mehbub Ali Chauhan, his son Sameer, and brother Feroz  arrived in Mumbai from Rajasthan barely a few days before the countrywide lockdown was declared on March 24, hoping to earn in Mumbai after losing everything they had in Mehbub and Ferozs fathers cancer treatment. Thanks to a few acquaintances the city, the three managed to find shelter in a 150 sq ft office in Lohar Khata where they had found work before it shut down.Mehbub, his son, and his brother havent eaten for two days. We drink water when hunger strikes, he says. After our father died, my brother and I decided to come to Mumbai and earn something. We have nowhere to go now, he says.The situation is precarious back home too. My widowed mother, wife and daughter dont have much to survive on. We desperately want to return to them, Mehbub says.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Poisor And Malvani4,000Poisor in Kandivali East, and Malvani in Malad West, could be the twins separated at birth. Poverty, high crime rate, rows of slums and ground-plusone-storey structures housing mostly people from northern India who work as auto and taxi drivers, at hair-cutting saloons, at malls and restaurants, and a large number of people just looking for employment. The lockdown has hit these people hard.Sunil Sharma, 28, from Gounda in Uttar Pradesh who earns a livelihood through carpentry in Mumbai, says there is nothing to do now except watch movies on the mobile phone, and when that gets too tiring, play cards with roommates. We cook whenever the owner of this room hands us. Sometimes an NGO or a political party gives food packets, he says.The situation is worse in Malvani, which has been sealed after a few Covid-positive cases emerged from the locality. A resident, Mohammad Alam, says he and 13 members of his family are surviving on a sack of potatoes, onions, and rice they had stored a few weeks ago. Some days we get food packets but those often dont reach us, he says.Another Malvani resident, Jamil Shaikh, a tailor, says the entire locality is scared. We earn on a day-to-day basis. How are we to survive without work, he asks.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Janta Colony, WorliMore than 1,000Randeep Senapati, Dushmanta Behra, Sushant Shetti, Prasanjit Senapati and Sitaram Behera squeeze into their 6X8 sqft room. The discomfort on their faces is palpablethere is no room to stretch and the heat is stifling. Every night, before going to sleep, they have to stack their bags on top of each other to make space, says Randeep. The five daily wagers from Odisha have had no work since the lockdown began, and food rations are running dangerously low. We have to send money to our families. We have already used up the little savings we had, and can no longer afford to eat three times a day. We will be skipping meals till the lockdown is lifted, says Randeep, adding that if arrangements are made for them to head home, the five will leave readily.Their next-door neighbour, the Ghasmares, did try to leave over the past weekend. The family of four, which includes two children aged 11 and 13, set off on foot to cover the 40-km distance to their village, Revdanda in Raigad district. But they had to return after police personnel at the Vashi toll naka refused to let them cross. Rajendra Ghasmare, employed as a delivery agent for an e-tailer who hasnt worked a day since the lockdown began, says the slums alley is so narrow that a passer-by has to step into his house to cross it. He says many residents have started skipping meals to get by. Veggies and non-vegetarian food are off the plates because no one can afford to buy them. We are surviving on just rice and dal, he says. I dont know how we will survive. After my children go to sleep, I cry every night.","bandra railway stationnationwide lockdownmumbai metropolitan regioncase study 01photo by raju shindengocase study 02photo by satish malavadecase

Red zones indicate that the number of cases (in the area) is doubling in four days. Many districts are in the orange zone, he added.Sinha said there are 144 active Covid-19 cases in Bengal on Thursday while 3,811 people had been tested for the infection till date. On Wednesday, the figure stood at 3,470, he said.I cannot understand why the media is biased towards the Centre and is comparing data on different parameters. Rest assured there are no lapses on the part of the state government. The state and the Centre work together, Sinha said at a press conference at Nabanna, the state secretariat, when he was asked whether door-to-door survey was being done following guidelines of the Union health ministry. He was speaking in the presence of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Agitated by repeated complaints on unavailability of rice and other items at fair price shops, which triggered agitations and road blocks in several districts, Banerjee on Thursday pulled up the civil supplies department and transferred Manoj Agarwal, its secretary. She announced this at the press conference.There was disruption in supply in around 10 per cent places in the state. We will appoint a new secretary. The ration shop owners were not ready for this crisis. Also, many of them do not have enough space to stock up a months quota of ration for enlisted beneficiaries in that area. I have asked the administration to use the premises of local community clubs to disburse ration. As announced, we will give five kg rice to all those who are needy along with pulses. People will get ration for six months free of cost, said Banerjee.Let me make it clear that this is government-supplied ration and not anyones personal property, the CM said in a veiled threat to Trinamool Congress workers in some districts who have been accused of using food distribution to gain mileage for local party units.Banerjee also announced that acting on requests from sweet shop owners the government was extending their time of operation from 8 am to 4 pm. Earlier, the shops were allowed to open at 12 pm.On Thursday, the government also allowed online registration of property so that people dont have to visit registration offices. The chief secretary said people would get a 20 per cent discount on registration fee with the maximum ceiling on the discount fixed at Rs 20,000.Asked how the government was determining death figures, Sinha said, We list all deaths and these are sent to the audit committee of doctors. We are not aware how many deaths the audit committee has reviewed so far and how many it has marked as non Covid-19 related.Dr Sukumar Mukherjee, a member of the global advisory committee set up by the state government, told the media in Banerjees presence that the audit committee of doctors reviewing the deaths is following guidelines of ICMR and WHO.","indiaupdated: apr 16, 2020 21:39 istthe bengal government on thursday said three more deaths due to covid-19 had been confirmed by its audit committee comprising of five doctors, taking the toll in the state to 10, while 24 new cases were detected since wednesday.chief secretary rajiv sinha said kolkata and howrah figured in the red zone earmarked by the union health ministry. red zones indicate that the number of cases (in the area) is doubling in four days. many districts are in the orange zone, he added.sinha said there are 144 active covid-19 cases in bengal on thursday while 3,811 people had been tested for the infection till date. on wednesday, the figure stood at 3,470, he said.i cannot understand why the media is biased towards the centre and is comparing data on different parameters. rest assured there are no lapses on the part of the state government. the state and the centre work together, sinha said at a press conference at nabanna, the state secretariat, when he was asked whether door-to-door survey was being done following guidelines of the union health ministry. he was speaking in the presence of chief minister mamata banerjee.agitated by repeated complaints on unavailability of rice and other items at fair price shops, which triggered agitations and road blocks in several districts, banerjee on thursday pulled up the civil supplies department and transferred manoj agarwal, its secretary. she announced this at the press conference.there was disruption in supply in around 10 per cent places in the state. we will appoint a new secretary. the ration shop owners were not ready for this crisis. also, many of them do not have enough space to stock up a months quota of ration for enlisted beneficiaries in that area. i have asked the administration to use the premises of local community clubs to disburse ration. as announced, we will give five kg rice to all those who are needy along with pulses. people will get ration for six months free of cost, said banerjee.let me make it clear that this is government-supplied ration and not anyones personal property, the cm said in a veiled threat to trinamool congress workers in some districts who have been accused of using food distribution to gain mileage for local party units.banerjee also announced that acting on requests from sweet shop owners the government was extending their time of operation from 8 am to 4 pm. earlier, the shops were allowed to open at 12 pm.on thursday, the government also allowed online registration of property so that people dont have to visit registration offices. the chief secretary said people would get a 20 per cent discount on registration fee with the maximum ceiling on the discount fixed at rs 20,000.asked how the government was determining death figures, sinha said, we list all deaths and these are sent to the audit committee of doctors. we are not aware how many deaths the audit committee has reviewed so far and how many it has marked as non covid-19 related.dr sukumar mukherjee, a member of the global advisory committee set up by the state government, told the media in banerjees presence that the audit committee of doctors reviewing the deaths is following guidelines of icmr and who."

Read MoreHere's the's complete statement:'Today, humanity faces perhaps the trial of its time as COVID-19 grips the world in its deadly embrace. Everywhere, as also in India, the mission is to do whatever it takes to prevent epidemiological curve from steepening any further. Human spirit is ignited by the resolve to overcome the pandemic. It is during our darkest moments that we must focus on the light. As Mahatma Gandhi said in his famous address at Kingsley Hall, London in October 1931: In the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists.2. Before I begin, I wish to place on record our gratitude to all functionaries and personnel in the government, the private sector, banks and other financial institutions who risk their lives on a daily basis by going to work or by working from home to fight the pandemic by keeping essential services operational. Our deepest appreciation goes out to doctors, healthcare and medical staff, police and law enforcement agencies who are at the frontline. In the RBI, I would like to specially commend and thank our team of 150 officers, staff and service providers who are in quarantine, away from families, and are at work 24X7 to keep essential services such as currency in circulation, retail and wholesale payment and settlement systems, reserve management, financial markets and liquidity management, financial regulation and supervision, and a host of other services available so that the nation may survive COVID-19. Banks and financial institutions have risen to the occasion and have ensured normal functioning. Their efforts are praiseworthy. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the RBI who set aside personal health concerns and join me in fashioning the array of measures taken by the RBI in the context of COVID-19. I also thank our teams for their intellectual support, analytical work and logistical arrangements.I. Assessment of the Current Economic Situation3. Since March 27, 2020 when I spoke to you last, the macroeconomic and financial landscape has deteriorated, precipitously in some areas; but light still shines through bravely in some others. On April 14, the IMF released its global growth projections, revealing that in 2020, the global economy is expected to plunge into the worst recession since the Great Depression, far worse than the Global Financial Crisis. The IMFs Economic Counsellor has named it the Great Lockdown, estimating the cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 at around 9 trillion US dollars  greater than the economies of Japan and Germany, combined. Within this downturn, the projections are replete with even sharper declines in output in various countries. India is among the handful of countries that is projected to cling on tenuously to positive growth (at 1.9 per cent). In fact, this is the highest growth rate among the G 20 economies. The World Trade Organisation sees global merchandise trade contracting by as much as 13-32 per cent in 2020. Global financial markets remain volatile, and emerging market economies are grappling with capital outflows and volatile exchange rates. Crude oil prices remain in a state of flux, despite the agreement on production cuts by OPEC plus countries. For 2021, the IMF projects sizable V-shaped recoveries: close to 9 percentage points for global GDP. India is expected to post a sharp turnaround and resume its pre-COVID pre-slowdown trajectory by growing at 7.4 per cent in 2021-22.4. Over the last three weeks, there have been a few data releases on domestic developments, but they are too disjointed to allow a comprehensive assessment of the state of the economy. Yet, there are a few slivers of brightness amidst the encircling gloom. In my statement of March 27, I had referred to the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities on the back of all-time highs in the production of food grains and horticulture, with huge buffer stocks of rice and wheat far in excess of the buffer norms. By April 10, pre-monsoon kharif sowing had begun strongly, with acreage of paddy  the principal kharif crop  up by 37 per cent in comparison with the last season[1]. States such as West Bengal, Telangana, Odisha, Assam, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh are leading in sowing activity despite the lockdown. On April 15, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast a normal south west monsoon for the 2020 season, with rainfall expected to be 100 per cent of the long period average. These early developments bode well for rural demand, supported as they are by accelerating fertiliser production up to February 2020. The robust growth of 21.3 per cent in tractor sales up to February 2020 - as against a contraction of 0.5 per cent in April-February last year  may provide an offset to farm labour shortages on account of the lockdown.5. In other production sectors, the situation is more sombre. On April 9, the index of industrial production for February was released, showing that industrial output accelerated to its highest rate in seven months. The impact of COVID-19 is not yet captured in these prints. More tellingly, however, the revival in electricity generation  a coincident indicator of demand  that had commenced from January 2020, has been halted by a sharp fall in daily demand in the range of 25-30 per cent after the lockdown announcement on March 25, 2020. Automobile production and sales, and port freight traffic declined sharply in March, as recently released data indicate. The manufacturing purchasing mangers index (PMI) for March 2020, which was released on April 2, was the lowest in the last four months. Notably, suppliers delivery time lengthened for the first time in five months, indicating supply disruptions. The April 6 release showed that the services PMI declined into contraction in March 2020, pulled down by a sharp downturn in export business, new domestic orders and employment.6. In the external sector, the contraction in exports in March 2020 at (-) 34.6 per cent has turned out to be much more severe than during the global financial crisis. Barring iron ore, all exporting sectors showed a decline in outbound shipments. Merchandise imports also fell by 28.7 per cent in March across the board, barring transport equipment. Consequently, the trade deficit declined to US$ 9.8 billion in March 2020 from US$ 11.0 billion a year ago. Net foreign direct investment inflows amounted to US$ 40.6 billion during 2019-20 (April-February), up from US$ 29.9 billion a year ago. In February, net FDI was of the order of US$ 2.9 billion as compared with US$ 1.9 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment in equities recorded inflow of US$ 0.4 billion during 2020-21 (till April 9) as against the inflow of US$ 0.2 billion a year ago. Portfolio debt investment recorded an outflow of US$ 0.7 billion as against net outflow of US$ 0.9 billion a year ago. In addition, net investment by FPIs under voluntary retention route (VRR) was US$ 0.1 billion during the same period. The level of foreign exchange reserves continue to be robust at US $ 476.5 billion on April 10, 2020 equivalent to 11.8 months of imports.7. Turning to the status of banking operations since the nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Government of India from March 25, 2020, the RBI has taken a number of steps to ensure normal business functioning by the entire banking sector. As a result, the payment infrastructure is running seamlessly. Banks have been required to put in place business continuity plans to operate from their disaster recovery (DR) sites and/or to identify alternate locations for critical operations so that there is no disruption in customer services. Our data show that there was no downtime of internet or mobile banking. On an average, ATM operations stood at over 91 per cent of full capacity. The average availability of Business Correspondents (BCs) is over 80 per cent. Regional offices of the RBI have supplied fresh currency of Rs.1.2 lakh crore from March1 till April 14, 2020 to currency chests across the country to meet increased demand for currency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks have risen to the occasion by refilling ATMs regularly, despite logistical challenges.8. In my statement of March 27, I had indicated that together with the measures announced on March 27, the RBIs liquidity injection was about 3.2 per cent of GDP since the February 2020 MPC meeting. Since then, surplus liquidity in the banking system has increased sharply in the wake of sustained government spending. Systemic liquidity surplus, as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF, averaged Rs. 4.36 lakh crore during the period March 27- April 14, 2020. As announced on March 27, the RBI undertook three auctions of targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO), injecting cumulatively Rs. 75,041 crore to ease liquidity constraints in the banking system and de-stress financial markets. Another TLTRO auction of Rs.25,000 crore will be conducted today (April 17). In response to these auctions, financial conditions have eased considerably, as reflected in the spreads on money and bond market instruments. Moreover, activity in the corporate bond market has picked up appreciably, with several corporates making new issuances. There are also indications that redemption pressures faced by mutual funds have moderated.II. Additional Measures9. Against this backdrop and based on our continuing assessment of the macroeconomic situation and financial market conditions, we propose to take further measures to (i) maintain adequate liquidity in the system andits constituents in the face of COVID-19 related dislocations; (ii) facilitate and incentivise bank credit flows; (iii) ease financial stress; and (iv) enable the normal functioning of markets.II(A). Liquidity Management10. The RBI has moved in a calibrated fashion to ensure conducive financial conditions and normalcy in the functioning of financial markets and institutions. The initial efforts to provide adequate system level liquidity are reflected in the sizable net absorptions under reverse repo operations. With this achieved, the RBI has undertaken measures to target liquidity provision to sectors and entities which are experiencing liquidity constraints and/or hindrances to market access. Long term repo operations (LTROs) to ensure adequate liquidity at the longer end of the yield curve, exemptions from the cash reserve ratio for the equivalent of incremental credit disbursed by banks as loans in certain select areas/segments and targeted LTROs or TLTROs fall in this class of sector-specific measures. It is, however, observed that the deployment of TLTRO funds so far has largely been to bonds issued by public sector entities and large corporates, especially in primary issuances. The disruptions caused by COVID-19 have, however, more severely impacted small and mid-sized corporates, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro finance institutions (MFIs), in terms of access to liquidity.Targeted Long Term Operations (TLTRO) 2.011. Accordingly, it has been decided to conduct targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO 2.0) for an aggregate amount of Rs.50,000 crore, to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes. The funds availed by banks under TLTRO 2.0 should be invested in investment-grade bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs, with at least 50 per cent of the total amount availed going to small and mid-sized NBFCs and MFIs. The guidelines will spell out the details. These investments have to be made within one month of the availment of liquidity from the RBI. As in the case of TLTRO auctions conducted hitherto, investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held to maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio. Exposures under this facility will also not be reckoned under the large exposure framework. Notification for the first TLTRO 2.0 auction will be issued today.Refinancing Facilities for All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)12. All India financial institutions (AIFIs) such as the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) play an important role in meeting the long-term funding requirements of agriculture and the rural sector, small industries, housing finance companies, NBFCs and MFIs. These All India Financial Institutions raise resources from the market through specified instruments allowed by the Reserve Bank, in addition to relying on their internal sources. In view of the tightening of financial conditions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, these institutions are facing difficulties in raising resources from the market. Accordingly, it has been decided to provide special refinance facilities for a total amount of Rs. 50,000 crore to NABARD, SIDBI and NHB to enable them to meet sectoral credit needs. This will comprise Rs. 25,000 crore to NABARD for refinancing regional rural banks (RRBs), cooperative banks and micro finance institutions (MFIs); Rs. 15,000 crore to SIDBI for on-lending/refinancing; and Rs. 10,000 crore to NHB for supporting housing finance companies (HFCs). Advances under this facility will be charged at the RBIs policy repo rate at the time of availment.Liquidity Adjustment Facility: Fixed Rate Reverse Repo Rate13. As I have mentioned earlier, the surplus liquidity in the banking system has risen significantly in the wake of government spending and the various liquidity enhancing measures undertaken by the RBI. On April 15, the amount absorbed under reverse repo operations was Rs 6.9 lakh crore. In order to encourage banks to deploy these surplus funds in investments and loans in productive sectors of the economy, it has been decided to reduce the fixed rate reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 4.0 per cent to 3.75 per cent with immediate effect. The policy repo rate remains unchanged at 4.40 per cent, and the marginal standing facility rate and the Bank Rate remain unchanged at 4.65 per cent.Ways and Means Advances for States14. On April 1, 2020 the RBI had announced an increase in the ways and means advances (WMA) limit of states by 30 per cent. It has now been decided to increase the WMA limit of states by 60 per cent over and above the level as on March 31, 2020 to provide greater comfort to the states for undertaking COVID-19 containment and mitigation efforts, and to plan their market borrowing programmes better. The increased limit will be available till September 30, 2020.II(B). Regulatory Measures15. On March 27, 2020 the Reserve Bank had announced certain regulatory measures to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of COVID-19 and to ensure the continuity of viable businesses. Based on a review of the rapidly evolving situation, and consistent with the globally coordinated action committed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to alleviate the impact of Covid19 on the global banking system, additional regulatory measures are being announced today.Asset Classification16. Economic activity has come to a standstill during the period of the lockdown, with consequential lingering effects which have unambiguously affected the cash flows of households and businesses. On March 27, 2020 the RBI had permitted lending institutions (LIs) to grant a moratorium of three months on payment of current dues falling between March 1 and May 31, 2020. It is recognized that the onset of COVID-19 has also exacerbated the challenges for such borrowers even to honour their commitments fallen due on or before February 29, 2020 in Standard Accounts. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has taken cognizance of the financial and economic impact of COVID-19 and very recently announced that . the payment moratorium periods (Public or granted by banks on a voluntary basis) relating to the COVID19 outbreak can be excluded by banks from the number of days past due in respect of NPA recognition.17. Therefore, it has been decided that in respect of all accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant moratorium or deferment, and which were standard as on March 1, 2020, the 90-day NPA norm shall exclude the moratorium period, i.e., there would an asset classification standstill for all such accounts from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. NBFCs, which are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards (IndAS), may be guided by the guidelines duly approved by their boards and as per advisories of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) in recognition of impairments. In other words, NBFCs have flexibility under the prescribed accounting standards to consider such relief to their borrowers.18. At the same time, we are cognizant of the risk build-up in banks balance sheets on account of firm-level stress and delays in recoveries. With the objective of ensuring that banks maintain sufficient buffers and remain adequately provisioned to meet future challenges, they will have to maintain higher provision of 10 per cent on all such accounts under the standstill, spread over two quarters, i.e., March, 2020 and June, 2020. These provisions can be adjusted later on against the provisioning requirements for actual slippages in such accounts. Extension of Resolution Timeline19. Under RBIs prudential framework of resolution of stressed assets dated June 7, 2019, in the case of large accounts under default, Scheduled CommercialBanks, AIFIs, NBFC-ND-SIs and NBFC-D are currently required to hold an additional provision of 20 per cent if a resolution plan has not been implemented within 210 days from the date of such default. Recognizing the challenges to resolution of stressed assets in the current volatile environment, it has been decided that the period for resolution plan shall be extended by 90 days. Details will be spelt out in the circular.Distribution of Dividend20. It is imperative that banks conserve capital to retain their capacity to support the economy and absorb losses in an environment of heightened uncertainty. It has, therefore, been decided that in view of the COVID-19related economic shock, scheduled commercial banks and cooperative banks shall not make any further dividend payouts from profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020 until further instructions. This restriction shall be reviewed on the basis of the financial position of banks for the quarter ending September 30, 2020.Liquidity Coverage Ratio21. The Reserve Bank has been proactively taking measures to address the systemic liquidity issues through a slew of monetary and market operations. In order to ease the liquidity position at the level of individual institutions, the LCR requirement for Scheduled Commercial Banks is being brought down from 100 per cent to 80 per cent with immediate effect. The requirement shall be gradually restored back in two phases  90 per cent by October 1, 2020 and 100 per cent by April 1, 2021.NBFC Loans to Commercial Real Estate Projects22. In terms of the extant guidelines for banks, the date for commencement for commercial operations (DCCO) in respect of loans to commercial real estate projects delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoters can be extended by an additional one year, over and above the one-year extension permitted in normal course, without treating the same as restructuring. It has now been decided to extend a similar treatment to loans given by NBFCs to commercial real estate. This will provide relief to NBFCs as well as the real estate sector.III. Concluding Remarks23. In conclusion, I would like to review recent developments relating to inflation and the outlook without infringing in any way on the mandate of the monetary policy committee (MPC). The press release of the National Statistics Office (NSO) on April 13, 2020 showed that CPI inflation for March 2020[2] declined by 70 basis points to 5.9 per cent. This is, however, based on data gathered up to 19th March, 2020. The data showed a softening of food inflation by around 160 basis points on account of the easing of prices of vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, pulses, oils and fats, fruits and sugar. In other categories of the CPI, inflation pressures remained firm. Daily data on 22 essential food items covered by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) suggest that food prices have increased by 2.3 per cent in April so far (up to April 13, 2020) in a broad-based manner, though onion prices have continued to decline while PDS kerosene prices have slumped by 24 per cent in the first fortnight of April. Domestic LPG prices also declined by 8 per cent. These early developments suggest that inflation is on a declining trajectory, having fallen by 170 basis points from its January 2020 peak.24. In the period ahead, inflation could recede even further, barring supply disruption shocks and may even settle well below the target of 4 per cent by the second half of 2020-21. Such an outlook would make policy space available to address the intensification of risks to growth and financial stability brought on by COVID-19. This space needs to be used effectively and in time.25. The RBI will monitor the evolving situation continuously and use all its instruments to address the daunting challenges posed by the pandemic. The overarching objective is to keep the financial system and financial markets sound, liquid and smoothly functioning so that finance keeps flowing to all stakeholders, especially those that are disadvantaged and vulnerable. Regulatory measures that have been announced so far  including those made today - are dovetailed into the objective of preserving financial stability. Although social distancing separates us, we stand united and resolute. Eventually, we shall cure; and we shall endure.Thank you.Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business NewsSubscribe Start Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

The RBI chief unveiled a slew of measures which included reduction in reverse repo rate and liquidity support for financial institutions, among others.","rbi governor shaktikanta das while addressing a press conference via video link during the nationwide lockdown... read morehere's the's complete statement:'today, humanity faces perhaps the trial of its time as covid-19 grips the world in its deadly embrace. everywhere, as also in india, the mission is to do whatever it takes to prevent epidemiological curve from steepening any further. human spirit is ignited by the resolve to overcome the pandemic. it is during our darkest moments that we must focus on the light. as mahatma gandhi said in his famous address at kingsley hall, london in october 1931: in the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists.2. before i begin, i wish to place on record our gratitude to all functionaries and personnel in the government, the private sector, banks and other financial institutions who risk their lives on a daily basis by going to work or by working from home to fight the pandemic by keeping essential services operational. our deepest appreciation goes out to doctors, healthcare and medical staff, police and law enforcement agencies who are at the frontline. in the rbi, i would like to specially commend and thank our team of 150 officers, staff and service providers who are in quarantine, away from families, and are at work 24x7 to keep essential services such as currency in circulation, retail and wholesale payment and settlement systems, reserve management, financial markets and liquidity management, financial regulation and supervision, and a host of other services available so that the nation may survive covid-19. banks and financial institutions have risen to the occasion and have ensured normal functioning. their efforts are praiseworthy. i would also like to thank my colleagues in the rbi who set aside personal health concerns and join me in fashioning the array of measures taken by the rbi in the context of covid-19. i also thank our teams for their intellectual support, analytical work and logistical arrangements.i. assessment of the current economic situation3. since march 27, 2020 when i spoke to you last, the macroeconomic and financial landscape has deteriorated, precipitously in some areas; but light still shines through bravely in some others. on april 14, the imf released its global growth projections, revealing that in 2020, the global economy is expected to plunge into the worst recession since the great depression, far worse than the global financial crisis. the imfs economic counsellor has named it the great lockdown, estimating the cumulative loss to global gdp over 2020 and 2021 at around 9 trillion us dollars  greater than the economies of japan and germany, combined. within this downturn, the projections are replete with even sharper declines in output in various countries. india is among the handful of countries that is projected to cling on tenuously to positive growth (at 1.9 per cent). in fact, this is the highest growth rate among the g 20 economies. the world trade organisation sees global merchandise trade contracting by as much as 13-32 per cent in 2020. global financial markets remain volatile, and emerging market economies are grappling with capital outflows and volatile exchange rates. crude oil prices remain in a state of flux, despite the agreement on production cuts by opec plus countries. for 2021, the imf projects sizable v-shaped recoveries: close to 9 percentage points for global gdp. india is expected to post a sharp turnaround and resume its pre-covid pre-slowdown trajectory by growing at 7.4 per cent in 2021-22.4. over the last three weeks, there have been a few data releases on domestic developments, but they are too disjointed to allow a comprehensive assessment of the state of the economy. yet, there are a few slivers of brightness amidst the encircling gloom. in my statement of march 27, i had referred to the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities on the back of all-time highs in the production of food grains and horticulture, with huge buffer stocks of rice and wheat far in excess of the buffer norms. by april 10, pre-monsoon kharif sowing had begun strongly, with acreage of paddy  the principal kharif crop  up by 37 per cent in comparison with the last season[1]. states such as west bengal, telangana, odisha, assam, karnataka and chhattisgarh are leading in sowing activity despite the lockdown. on april 15, the india meteorological department (imd) forecast a normal south west monsoon for the 2020 season, with rainfall expected to be 100 per cent of the long period average. these early developments bode well for rural demand, supported as they are by accelerating fertiliser production up to february 2020. the robust growth of 21.3 per cent in tractor sales up to february 2020 - as against a contraction of 0.5 per cent in april-february last year  may provide an offset to farm labour shortages on account of the lockdown.5. in other production sectors, the situation is more sombre. on april 9, the index of industrial production for february was released, showing that industrial output accelerated to its highest rate in seven months. the impact of covid-19 is not yet captured in these prints. more tellingly, however, the revival in electricity generation  a coincident indicator of demand  that had commenced from january 2020, has been halted by a sharp fall in daily demand in the range of 25-30 per cent after the lockdown announcement on march 25, 2020. automobile production and sales, and port freight traffic declined sharply in march, as recently released data indicate. the manufacturing purchasing mangers index (pmi) for march 2020, which was released on april 2, was the lowest in the last four months. notably, suppliers delivery time lengthened for the first time in five months, indicating supply disruptions. the april 6 release showed that the services pmi declined into contraction in march 2020, pulled down by a sharp downturn in export business, new domestic orders and employment.6. in the external sector, the contraction in exports in march 2020 at (-) 34.6 per cent has turned out to be much more severe than during the global financial crisis. barring iron ore, all exporting sectors showed a decline in outbound shipments. merchandise imports also fell by 28.7 per cent in march across the board, barring transport equipment. consequently, the trade deficit declined to us$ 9.8 billion in march 2020 from us$ 11.0 billion a year ago. net foreign direct investment inflows amounted to us$ 40.6 billion during 2019-20 (april-february), up from us$ 29.9 billion a year ago. in february, net fdi was of the order of us$ 2.9 billion as compared with us$ 1.9 billion a year ago. net foreign portfolio investment in equities recorded inflow of us$ 0.4 billion during 2020-21 (till april 9) as against the inflow of us$ 0.2 billion a year ago. portfolio debt investment recorded an outflow of us$ 0.7 billion as against net outflow of us$ 0.9 billion a year ago. in addition, net investment by fpis under voluntary retention route (vrr) was us$ 0.1 billion during the same period. the level of foreign exchange reserves continue to be robust at us $ 476.5 billion on april 10, 2020 equivalent to 11.8 months of imports.7. turning to the status of banking operations since the nationwide lockdown was imposed by the government of india from march 25, 2020, the rbi has taken a number of steps to ensure normal business functioning by the entire banking sector. as a result, the payment infrastructure is running seamlessly. banks have been required to put in place business continuity plans to operate from their disaster recovery (dr) sites and/or to identify alternate locations for critical operations so that there is no disruption in customer services. our data show that there was no downtime of internet or mobile banking. on an average, atm operations stood at over 91 per cent of full capacity. the average availability of business correspondents (bcs) is over 80 per cent. regional offices of the rbi have supplied fresh currency of rs.1.2 lakh crore from march1 till april 14, 2020 to currency chests across the country to meet increased demand for currency in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. banks have risen to the occasion by refilling atms regularly, despite logistical challenges.8. in my statement of march 27, i had indicated that together with the measures announced on march 27, the rbis liquidity injection was about 3.2 per cent of gdp since the february 2020 mpc meeting. since then, surplus liquidity in the banking system has increased sharply in the wake of sustained government spending. systemic liquidity surplus, as reflected in net absorptions under the laf, averaged rs. 4.36 lakh crore during the period march 27- april 14, 2020. as announced on march 27, the rbi undertook three auctions of targeted long term repo operations (tltro), injecting cumulatively rs. 75,041 crore to ease liquidity constraints in the banking system and de-stress financial markets. another tltro auction of rs.25,000 crore will be conducted today (april 17). in response to these auctions, financial conditions have eased considerably, as reflected in the spreads on money and bond market instruments. moreover, activity in the corporate bond market has picked up appreciably, with several corporates making new issuances. there are also indications that redemption pressures faced by mutual funds have moderated.ii. additional measures9. against this backdrop and based on our continuing assessment of the macroeconomic situation and financial market conditions, we propose to take further measures to (i) maintain adequate liquidity in the system andits constituents in the face of covid-19 related dislocations; (ii) facilitate and incentivise bank credit flows; (iii) ease financial stress; and (iv) enable the normal functioning of markets.ii(a). liquidity management10. the rbi has moved in a calibrated fashion to ensure conducive financial conditions and normalcy in the functioning of financial markets and institutions. the initial efforts to provide adequate system level liquidity are reflected in the sizable net absorptions under reverse repo operations. with this achieved, the rbi has undertaken measures to target liquidity provision to sectors and entities which are experiencing liquidity constraints and/or hindrances to market access. long term repo operations (ltros) to ensure adequate liquidity at the longer end of the yield curve, exemptions from the cash reserve ratio for the equivalent of incremental credit disbursed by banks as loans in certain select areas/segments and targeted ltros or tltros fall in this class of sector-specific measures. it is, however, observed that the deployment of tltro funds so far has largely been to bonds issued by public sector entities and large corporates, especially in primary issuances. the disruptions caused by covid-19 have, however, more severely impacted small and mid-sized corporates, including non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) and micro finance institutions (mfis), in terms of access to liquidity.targeted long term operations (tltro) 2.011. accordingly, it has been decided to conduct targeted long-term repo operations (tltro 2.0) for an aggregate amount of rs.50,000 crore, to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes. the funds availed by banks under tltro 2.0 should be invested in investment-grade bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures of nbfcs, with at least 50 per cent of the total amount availed going to small and mid-sized nbfcs and mfis. the guidelines will spell out the details. these investments have to be made within one month of the availment of liquidity from the rbi. as in the case of tltro auctions conducted hitherto, investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held to maturity (htm) even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the htm portfolio. exposures under this facility will also not be reckoned under the large exposure framework. notification for the first tltro 2.0 auction will be issued today.refinancing facilities for all india financial institutions (aifis)12. all india financial institutions (aifis) such as the national bank for agriculture and rural development (nabard), the small industries development bank of india (sidbi) and the national housing bank (nhb) play an important role in meeting the long-term funding requirements of agriculture and the rural sector, small industries, housing finance companies, nbfcs and mfis. these all india financial institutions raise resources from the market through specified instruments allowed by the reserve bank, in addition to relying on their internal sources. in view of the tightening of financial conditions in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, these institutions are facing difficulties in raising resources from the market. accordingly, it has been decided to provide special refinance facilities for a total amount of rs. 50,000 crore to nabard, sidbi and nhb to enable them to meet sectoral credit needs. this will comprise rs. 25,000 crore to nabard for refinancing regional rural banks (rrbs), cooperative banks and micro finance institutions (mfis); rs. 15,000 crore to sidbi for on-lending/refinancing; and rs. 10,000 crore to nhb for supporting housing finance companies (hfcs). advances under this facility will be charged at the rbis policy repo rate at the time of availment.liquidity adjustment facility: fixed rate reverse repo rate13. as i have mentioned earlier, the surplus liquidity in the banking system has risen significantly in the wake of government spending and the various liquidity enhancing measures undertaken by the rbi. on april 15, the amount absorbed under reverse repo operations was rs 6.9 lakh crore. in order to encourage banks to deploy these surplus funds in investments and loans in productive sectors of the economy, it has been decided to reduce the fixed rate reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) by 25 basis points from 4.0 per cent to 3.75 per cent with immediate effect. the policy repo rate remains unchanged at 4.40 per cent, and the marginal standing facility rate and the bank rate remain unchanged at 4.65 per cent.ways and means advances for states14. on april 1, 2020 the rbi had announced an increase in the ways and means advances (wma) limit of states by 30 per cent. it has now been decided to increase the wma limit of states by 60 per cent over and above the level as on march 31, 2020 to provide greater comfort to the states for undertaking covid-19 containment and mitigation efforts, and to plan their market borrowing programmes better. the increased limit will be available till september 30, 2020.ii(b). regulatory measures15. on march 27, 2020 the reserve bank had announced certain regulatory measures to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of covid-19 and to ensure the continuity of viable businesses. based on a review of the rapidly evolving situation, and consistent with the globally coordinated action committed to by the basel committee on banking supervision to alleviate the impact of covid19 on the global banking system, additional regulatory measures are being announced today.asset classification16. economic activity has come to a standstill during the period of the lockdown, with consequential lingering effects which have unambiguously affected the cash flows of households and businesses. on march 27, 2020 the rbi had permitted lending institutions (lis) to grant a moratorium of three months on payment of current dues falling between march 1 and may 31, 2020. it is recognized that the onset of covid-19 has also exacerbated the challenges for such borrowers even to honour their commitments fallen due on or before february 29, 2020 in standard accounts. the basel committee on banking supervision (bcbs) has taken cognizance of the financial and economic impact of covid-19 and very recently announced that . the payment moratorium periods (public or granted by banks on a voluntary basis) relating to the covid19 outbreak can be excluded by banks from the number of days past due in respect of npa recognition.17. therefore, it has been decided that in respect of all accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant moratorium or deferment, and which were standard as on march 1, 2020, the 90-day npa norm shall exclude the moratorium period, i.e., there would an asset classification standstill for all such accounts from march 1, 2020 to may 31, 2020. nbfcs, which are required to comply with indian accounting standards (indas), may be guided by the guidelines duly approved by their boards and as per advisories of the institute of chartered accountants of india (icai) in recognition of impairments. in other words, nbfcs have flexibility under the prescribed accounting standards to consider such relief to their borrowers.18. at the same time, we are cognizant of the risk build-up in banks balance sheets on account of firm-level stress and delays in recoveries. with the objective of ensuring that banks maintain sufficient buffers and remain adequately provisioned to meet future challenges, they will have to maintain higher provision of 10 per cent on all such accounts under the standstill, spread over two quarters, i.e., march, 2020 and june, 2020. these provisions can be adjusted later on against the provisioning requirements for actual slippages in such accounts. extension of resolution timeline19. under rbis prudential framework of resolution of stressed assets dated june 7, 2019, in the case of large accounts under default, scheduled commercialbanks, aifis, nbfc-nd-sis and nbfc-d are currently required to hold an additional provision of 20 per cent if a resolution plan has not been implemented within 210 days from the date of such default. recognizing the challenges to resolution of stressed assets in the current volatile environment, it has been decided that the period for resolution plan shall be extended by 90 days. details will be spelt out in the circular.distribution of dividend20. it is imperative that banks conserve capital to retain their capacity to support the economy and absorb losses in an environment of heightened uncertainty. it has, therefore, been decided that in view of the covid-19related economic shock, scheduled commercial banks and cooperative banks shall not make any further dividend payouts from profits pertaining to the financial year ended march 31, 2020 until further instructions. this restriction shall be reviewed on the basis of the financial position of banks for the quarter ending september 30, 2020.liquidity coverage ratio21. the reserve bank has been proactively taking measures to address the systemic liquidity issues through a slew of monetary and market operations. in order to ease the liquidity position at the level of individual institutions, the lcr requirement for scheduled commercial banks is being brought down from 100 per cent to 80 per cent with immediate effect. the requirement shall be gradually restored back in two phases  90 per cent by october 1, 2020 and 100 per cent by april 1, 2021.nbfc loans to commercial real estate projects22. in terms of the extant guidelines for banks, the date for commencement for commercial operations (dcco) in respect of loans to commercial real estate projects delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoters can be extended by an additional one year, over and above the one-year extension permitted in normal course, without treating the same as restructuring. it has now been decided to extend a similar treatment to loans given by nbfcs to commercial real estate. this will provide relief to nbfcs as well as the real estate sector.iii. concluding remarks23. in conclusion, i would like to review recent developments relating to inflation and the outlook without infringing in any way on the mandate of the monetary policy committee (mpc). the press release of the national statistics office (nso) on april 13, 2020 showed that cpi inflation for march 2020[2] declined by 70 basis points to 5.9 per cent. this is, however, based on data gathered up to 19th march, 2020. the data showed a softening of food inflation by around 160 basis points on account of the easing of prices of vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, pulses, oils and fats, fruits and sugar. in other categories of the cpi, inflation pressures remained firm. daily data on 22 essential food items covered by the department of consumer affairs (dca) suggest that food prices have increased by 2.3 per cent in april so far (up to april 13, 2020) in a broad-based manner, though onion prices have continued to decline while pds kerosene prices have slumped by 24 per cent in the first fortnight of april. domestic lpg prices also declined by 8 per cent. these early developments suggest that inflation is on a declining trajectory, having fallen by 170 basis points from its january 2020 peak.24. in the period ahead, inflation could recede even further, barring supply disruption shocks and may even settle well below the target of 4 per cent by the second half of 2020-21. such an outlook would make policy space

with all stakeholders and at all levels. its ultimately for the union cabinet to take a call. personally, i think it will be akin to opening a pandoras box. we have a huge population and pds can be extended only for the needy.also read: coronavirus lockdown | enough grains for 9 months, says ram vilas paswanlakhs and lakhs of migrants workers are stranded in the cities, shouldn't the government had arranged special transport to ferry them back home?every one wants to reach home and rightly so. those who are hundred of miles away from home will have all sorts of anxieties. even if they get food, that alone is not enough, they may need soap, oil... so on. but the government rightly brought the lock down at the hour that it did. even a few days delay could have been fatal. and transporting the migrant workers is no mean task. we saw what happened in bandra, mumbai. just on the basis of a rumour that a train is plying thousands of workers collecting, forgetting all about social distancing norms and other precautions."

As of Sunday, we have received only 1,41,000 metric tonnes. How can we collect less than half the requirement? Whom should we deliver and whom should not? Let them send at least a months supply, said state food and supplies minister Jyoti Priya Mallick.Incidentally, following Dhankhars allegation on social media that there was a PDS scam in the state, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Saturday wrote a letter to the governor in which he too alleged that the Centre was not sending adequate supplies.In an interview to Hindustan Times in Sunday, Dhankhar said, I have personally spoken to union minister Ram Vilas Paswan and was shocked to know that the state had not even raised the requisition indent for the food grains that the Centre and the Food Corporation of India are ready to provide. Paswan had also spoken to Mallick a few days ago. The Centre has given all details and the same have been forwarded to the state administration.Paswan is the cabinet minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution.Dhankhar said that there were three problems with the PDS in West Bengal. First, supplies are not reaching the needy. Second, the PDS has been hijacked by the ruling party and distribution is taking place through them. And third, people are getting the food grains in lesser quantity and of poor quality, Dhankhar said.Mallick, however, said that Bengal did not need to send requisition because it is a direct procurement state. We never send requisition. The governor is unaware that we do not procure from the Centre. We procure directly from farmers. The Centre only needs to send what they have committed, he said.The Trinamool Congress also has rubbished Dhankhars allegation of political hijacking of PDS.The governor is misleading the people of the state. PDS is being distributed through ration shops. Whenever party leaders are distributing relief, it is they who are arranging for the funds. They are raising funds and paying from their own pockets. The governor should not confuse PDS with the distribution of relief material by our party, said TMC spokesperson Snehasish Chakraborty.Give us a single case of party leaders distributing PDS and action will be taken, Chakraborty said.Mallick said that the chief minister has decided to provide free rice to 9.5 crore people of the state. The states present population is estimated at above 10 crore at present. It was 9.13 crore, according to the Census of 2011.Mallick however, conceded that there are problems at ration shops. There are 21,000 ration shops and we dont have enough staff strength to monitor the activities of every shop in real-time. Many of them were previously penalised by the state government but they won the cases in the high court. It is only a handful of ration dealers who are still indulging in malpractices. We are taking action as soon as reports are reaching us, Mallick said.Mamata Banerjee has announced free ration  two kg rice and three kg wheat per head  to 9.5 crore people for six months.The food minister said that some ration shops could not provide people with the whole quota of 5 kg food grains due to a shortage of supply, as most rice mills remained closed.There are about 900 operational rice mills. Of them only about 200 are functional at present. We are trying to make the other mills operational at the earliest. In Kolkata, some ration shops are too tiny to store large quantities. They have been allowed to store in neighbouring schools.Right to Food activist Anuradha Talwar said that shortage of supply was the main issue for a good number of people not receiving adequate rice.Corruption is a minor issue. Going by the number of ration cards and the projected present population of the state, only 62% are to get rations. The state government additionally provides ration to another 20%. Altogether, only 82% are getting covered. It is absolutely essential that the Centre starts distributing food grains from its buffer stock which is meant for catastrophic situations, said Talwar.Biswambhar Basu, general secretary of All India Fair Price Shop Dealers Association, refuted the allegations of corruption. Not a single person who holds a digital ration card has been denied ration. Those who did not enrol for the digital ration cards and are no longer entitled to receive ration from our shops are the ones creating trouble, Basu said.He admitted that in some cases people were given half their entitlement because the shops did not get enough supplies due to shortage of manpower, difficulties in transport and lack of storage space for the surge in demand. Those who received half their entitlement would receive the rest before the end of this month, he added.Over the past few days, Bengal has witnessed a number of protests against ration shop owners.Leaders of BJP and Left parties had alleged that PDS reach the leaders of the ruling party, the Trinamool Congress, instead of those who needed it.The administration over the past three days have lodged police cases against 36 ration shop owners and several of them have been arrested, according to a senior officer of the state food and supplied department.","indiaupdated: apr 19, 2020

grains and accused ration shop owners in the state of giving inadequate ration to the people.the requirement of rice that the centre was supposed to provide under the pradhan mantri garib kalyan anna yojna is 3 lakh metric tonnes per month. as of sunday, we have received only 1,41,000 metric tonnes. how can we collect less than half the requirement? whom should we deliver and whom should not? let them send at least a months supply, said state food and supplies minister jyoti priya mallick.incidentally, following dhankhars allegation on social media that there was a pds scam in the state, chief secretary rajiva sinha on saturday wrote a letter to the governor in which he too alleged that the centre was not sending adequate supplies.in an interview to hindustan times in sunday, dhankhar said, i have personally spoken to union minister ram vilas paswan and was shocked to know that the state had not even raised the requisition indent for the food grains that the centre and the food corporation of india are ready to provide. paswan had also spoken to mallick a few days ago. the centre has given all details and the same have been forwarded to the state administration.paswan is the cabinet minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution.dhankhar said that there were three problems with the pds in west bengal. first, supplies are not reaching the needy. second, the pds has been hijacked by the ruling party and distribution is taking place through them. and third, people are getting the food grains in lesser quantity and of poor quality, dhankhar said.mallick, however, said that bengal did not need to send requisition because it is a direct procurement state. we never send requisition. the governor is unaware that we do not procure from the centre. we procure directly from farmers. the centre only needs to send what they have committed, he said.the trinamool congress also has rubbished dhankhars allegation of political hijacking of pds.the governor is misleading the people of the state. pds is being distributed through ration shops. whenever party leaders are distributing relief, it is they who are arranging for the funds. they are raising funds and paying from their own pockets. the governor should not confuse pds with the distribution of relief material by our party, said tmc spokesperson snehasish chakraborty.give us a single case of party leaders distributing pds and action will be taken, chakraborty said.mallick said that the chief minister has decided to provide free rice to 9.5 crore people of the state. the states present population is estimated at above 10 crore at present. it was 9.13 crore, according to the census of 2011.mallick however, conceded that there are problems at ration shops. there are 21,000 ration shops and we dont have enough staff strength to monitor the activities of every shop in real-time. many of them were previously penalised by the state government but they won the cases in the high court. it is only a handful of ration dealers who are still indulging in malpractices. we are taking action as soon as reports are reaching us, mallick said.mamata banerjee has announced free ration  two kg rice and three kg wheat per head  to 9.5 crore people for six months.the food minister said that some ration shops could not provide people with the whole quota of 5 kg food grains due to a shortage of supply, as most rice mills remained closed.there are about 900 operational rice mills. of them only about 200 are functional at present. we are trying to make the other mills operational at the earliest. in kolkata, some ration shops are too tiny to store large quantities. they have been allowed to store in neighbouring schools.right to food activist anuradha talwar said that shortage of supply was the main issue for a good number of people not receiving adequate rice.corruption is a minor issue. going by the number of ration cards and the projected present population of the state, only 62% are to get rations. the state government additionally provides ration to another 20%. altogether, only 82% are getting covered. it is absolutely essential that the centre starts distributing food grains from its buffer stock which is meant for catastrophic situations, said talwar.biswambhar basu, general secretary of all india fair price shop dealers association, refuted the allegations of corruption. not a single person who holds a digital ration card has been denied ration. those who did not enrol for the digital ration cards and are no longer entitled to receive ration from our shops are the ones creating trouble, basu said.he admitted that in some cases people were given half their entitlement because the shops did not get enough supplies due to shortage of manpower, difficulties in transport and lack of storage space for the surge in demand. those who received half their entitlement would receive the rest before the end of this month, he added.over the past few days, bengal has witnessed a number of protests against ration shop owners.leaders of bjp and left parties had alleged that pds reach the leaders of the ruling party, the trinamool congress, instead of those who needed it.the administration over the past three days have lodged police cases against 36 ration shop owners and several of them have been arrested, according to a senior officer of the state food and supplied department."

(File) West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar. (File)Amid allegations of the state governments effort to hide actual numbers regarding COVID-19 positive cases and deaths, involvement in alleged PDS scam, and keeping BJP MPs under house arrest, Governor JAGDEEP DHANKHAR tells RAVIK BHATTACHARYA that the state government should synergistically work with the Centre.What do you think of the Centre sending two teams to Bengal to evaluate lockdown enforcement in seven districts (COVID-19 hotspots)?COVID-19 is to be faced unitedly, fully supporting our health warriors. Coronavirus is secular, non-discriminatory and adversely impacts all, irrespective of ideology or status. In the country, the fight against this menace to civilisation is being spearheaded by the prime minister with vision and imagination. It is required of all to be in cooperation mode.I have appealed to all in the state to extend full support to the state government. I have requested the state government to synergistically work with the central government.Central teams have come after due thought process and under a legal regime that binds us all. The Supreme Court order, dated March 31, is required to be followed by all, and that mandates  we trust and expect that all concerned viz., State Governments, Public Authorities and Citizens of this country will faithfully comply with the directives and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety.This is no time to dictate actions by political or otherwise considerations.CM Mamata Banerjee has said sending central team without valid reason might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism. What is your opinion on this?I am sure the CM will revisit her stand in the light of the legal provisions of the SC order and offer full cooperation to the central teams, so that the miseries of people can be mitigated and the sharpness of the fight against COVID-19 be enhanced.All are bound by constitutional provisions and must respect the same. While I have not appreciated the stand of the CM in not performing her constitutional duties, even qua my office, looking into the seriousness and sensitive situation, I continue to be in request mode. There has to be realisation by her. Bureaucracy must not be emasculated or in supine mode.On social media, you have criticised the alleged house arrest of BJP MPs during COVID-19 outbreak. What should have been done?MPs have critically significant role to play, more so during crisis period. Curtailment of their activities, inspired by political motivations, is unwholesome reflection on governance. I invited attention of the government to this aspect and the response of the state leaves everything to be desired. The cryptic response calls for stern action and that is engaging my attention. What an ironic situation that while one MP can feed thousands in a day and for days together, the others cant step out to discharge public service. This dichotomy is alarming and cannot be overlooked.What is your take on opposition parties, including BJP and CPM, challenging the number of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths?There are no takers for the COVID-19 death figures in the state on account of the series of discrepancies by the state government. The concern of the political parties, medical fraternity and citizens is well-premised. The trust deficit on this count between the government and medical fraternity as also between the government and people has attracted national and global focus. The concept of Audit Committee, unheard of so far, has worsened the situation people need to know the ground reality and such information is bound to generate seriousness in people towards observance of lockdown protocol and social distancing.I have urged the government that a credible sharing of information will go a long way in sharpening our fight against COVID-19.You have talked about PDS scam in Bengal during the lockdown and stated that it is getting bigger. What should be done? Did you speak to any Union minister over this issue?From all over the state, I have got worrisome inputs about PDS being hijacked politically, ration dealers being subjected by ruling party workers to coercive mechanism and distribution taking place in a politicised manner under token issued by the workers of the ruling party. This hijacking is a very poor reflection on the public functionaries and they will have to be held accountable for their lapses, failures and inaction in official duties.It is unfortunate that the benefits sought to be given to more than 6 crore people in the state under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) was stalled by the inaction on the part of the government. Under the PMGKAY, free ration is available for three months @ 5 kg rice per person per month and 1 kg dal per family per month. On one hand, people were facing huge shortage and problems of getting ration, and on the other, free ration, given by the Centre, was not being lifted. I took up the matter in earnestness and the process of taking free ration available under PMGKAY has at last started.PDS has to be transparently operated with full sense of accountability. The present state of affairs is a cause of concern if we go by the inputs I have received and what is being circulated in the social medial. All loopholes must be plugged, otherwise this PDS scam has the potential to take a shape beyond the earlier scams, which stigmatised the state.I have tried through my office to seek relevant inputs from the Chief Secretary, Food Minister and Food Secretary and talked to the Food Secretary. The details are yet to come. Their response, to say the least, is not appreciated.Are you satisfied with the state governments efforts in combating COVID-19 spread?As regards efforts of the state government in combating COVID-19, the intervention of the Home Ministry on April 10, indicates that more is required to be done. This is no time for anyone to engage in any criticism or confrontational posturing. The foremost need of the time is that all must act in unison and coordination. The sight of religious congregations under the very nose of the police indicates a worrisome spectacle.The only soldier who can beat coronavirus is the common man. He has to observe 100 per cent social distancing. This has to be ensured by the administration in all seriousness, without an eye on political vote bank or otherwise.Doctors and health workers have been reportedly infected in large number and hospitals are being partially sealed.Health workers in the state need to be saluted. I was considerably disturbed that when the PM gave a call for clapping for 5 minutes on March 22, the CM and her ministers and partymen were not seen in public domain as participating. The same was the situation with respect to lighting of diyas on April 5. These are certainly not in consonance with the united fight against COVID-19.The doctors, nurses and paramedical health workers have exposed themselves only to help us out. They are terribly stressed. A number of organisations have indicated to me that their professionalism has been undermined and the government on this count is not acting in a transparent manner. Even globally the issue has come to be focussed. High time that efforts are made to boost the morale of doctors and health workers and correctional steps are taken.TMC MPs have criticised your stand and said they will lodge a complaint against you with Lok Sabha Speaker? What is your response?During this crisis, and otherwise also, I have engaged in outreach to public representatives. I do not understand on what premise the representatives of the ruling party are maintaining a distance. All my actions are dictated in the interest of people of the state of West Bengal, and I would continue to work in that direction. The script that I follow emanates from the Indian Constitution. No TMC MP has ever got in touch with me or made a representation to me of any such grievance.Surely it is not appropriate for the CM to have an iron curtain with Raj Bhavan. Disregard of constitutional norms and objections at her end are just not condonable. I have repeatedly urged her to reflect. CM is acting in an undemocratic fashion by ignoring the Constitution that indicates authoritarianism. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

A PhD scholar from the Duke University, USA, Mitra is an ardent advocate of developmental economics. In a telephonic interview with Rajeev Jayaswal of Hindustan Times, he says the role of the Centre is to live up to the true spirit of co-operative federalism and take all measures to boost the sagging economy without worrying about breaching the laid-down fiscal deficit glide path in this difficult time of the coronavirus pandemic. Edited excerpts:The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed Indias economic growth to 1.9% in the current year when the global economy would contract by 3%. What do you suggest to boost the growth?This is an unprecedented situation and the central government should come up with a comprehensive plan to boost the economy  which is a must to check rising unemployment, poverty and hunger. The Centre must announce a package of 6% of GDP as suggested by CM [Mamata Banerjee] to the PM [Narendra Modi]. This is around Rs 10 lakh crore.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Union government and the Reserve Bank of India must come out of their lakshman rekha and take bold decisions, not incremental measures. There must be a big-bang announcement. A substantial stimulus is a must, and also possible, because India has headroom to borrow. Compared to many developed countries, Indias debt-to-GDP ratio is less than 70%, while it is 106% for the USA and 240% for Japan. Besides, international oil prices are subdued, which is in favour of a country like India that imports more than 80% of its crude oil requirements. Another source of headroom is Indias large foreign exchange reserves.Also Read: Covid spread, restrictions hit NREGS work allotmentThe Centre must leverage these incidental advantages now and stop worrying about the fiscal deficit at a time when the question is of survival. The government must provide money in the hands of the poor, who are fighting to survive. About Rs 4 lakh crore could be transferred to the states who have the capacity to digitally transfer the requisite money into the bank accounts of the poor. In West Bengal, all disbursements are done digitally, no cheques or cash is used in our treasury. The poor must be provided free ration, as we have done in West Bengal, providing rice and wheat at zero price from ration shops.What about the formal sector?Industry is facing both demand and supply challenges as supply channels have broken down. The stimulus will help in creating demand and provide liquidity in the system. It can even be considered to provide what is internationally done (during such times)  80% salary of the workers paid (for) by the corporate sector during the lockdown is borne by the government. This will allow the retention of the worker and this human capital can be quickly put on use when the Covid-19 pandemic is over.Also Read: Covid-19 update: BJP calls for new manufacturing policy to revive economyLiquidity crunch is acute, particularly for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It calls for soft loans for a period of four years with a moratorium on repayments and interest for at least the first year. This will give them the breathing space. Similarly, other formal sectors need calibrated support. Sectors such as aviation, hospitality, tourism, and non-essential retail have been almost crippled due to the lockdown.What is your assessment of the economic growth post Covid-19?It is difficult to predict at this juncture when even developed countries are unable to give any precise answer on when this [Covid-19 pandemic] will end. If the pandemic ends by October...with adequate policy and fiscal stimulations, India could see at best 1% GDP growth (in financial year 2020-21). But if the pandemic continued for longer, it will have a direct impact on GDP, which may even contract, posting a negative growth.Is Centre providing enough financial support to the states, particularly to West Bengal?The Centre is not as responsive as it should have been in an ideal co-operative federalism and at a time when states are fighting against a pandemic. Finance minister [Nirmala Sitharaman] has not replied to any of my letters, though I had one conversation with her. I have written eight letters, highlighting some genuine concerns of states and precarious financial positions they are suffering from. Of course, one or two suggestions have been accepted partially. An ideal co-operative federalism must encourage a culture of dialogue. States are the real implementers of policies and welfare programmes. They must be considered as part and parcel of a united India.Are you referring to the controversy regarding Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) being sent to West Bengal?The Centres decision to send two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams to West Bengal was done without consulting the state government. This is a breach of federalist protocol. The Centres move was not in the right spirit of co-operative federalism. We are also unable to understand, why particular districts had been chosen. In terms of both number of [Covid-19] cases and the rate of increase, Ahmedabad in Gujarat had far larger numbers of cases and faster rate of increase. But it was not in the Centres radar.","indiaupdated: apr 24, 2020 14:04 istwest bengal finance minister amit mitra is an economist by both training and practice. a phd scholar from the duke

So we decided to set up a community kitchen with police permission, Ms. Chakraborty, hugely popular as the character of June in Bengali teleserial Sreemoyee, told The Hindu.We are a team of eight people, including the lady who cooks. Apart from me, there are six local boys, you must name them  Swaroop, Sourav, Chiranjeet, Kinjal, Arnab and Rangan  who oversee the cooking and distribute the food, she said.When the lockdown began, we were cooking for about 50 people. Then we started cooking for 150 people. Now we provide rations to those who have stoves to cook and prepare food for about 120 people who dont have the means to cook, she said.State-wise tracker for COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing, and a map of confirmed cases in IndiaThe food is cooked in a place called Bijaygarh in Jadavpur, and the daily menu includes rice and dal and a vegetable.

A Ph.D scholar from Duke University in the US, Mitra is an ardent advocate of developmental economics. In this difficult time of the coronavirus pandemic, in a telephonic interview with Hindustan Times, he says that the role of the Centre is to live up to the true spirit of cooperative federalism and take all possible measures to boost the sagging economy without worrying about breaching the laid-down fiscal deficit glide path. Edited excerpts:The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed Indias economic growth to 1.9% in the current year when the global economy would contract by 3%. What do you suggest to boost the growth?This is an unprecedented situation and the Central government should come up with a comprehensive plan to boost the economy, which is a must to check rising unemployment, poverty and hunger. The Centre must announce a package of 6% of GDP as suggested by the CM [Mamata Banerjee] to the PM [Narendra Modi]. This is around Rs 10 lakh crore.The Union government and the Reserve bank of India must come out of their Lakshman Rekha and take bold decisions, not incremental measures. There must be a big bang announcement. A substantial stimulus is a must, and also possible, because India has headroom to borrow. Compared to many developed countries, Indias debt-to-GDP ratio is less than 70%, while it is 106% for USA and 240% for Japan. Besides, international oil prices are subdued, which is in favour of a country like India that imports more than 80% of its crude oil requirements. Another source of headroom is Indias large foreign exchange reserves. The Centre must leverage these incidental advantages now and stop worrying about the fiscal deficit at a time when the question is of survival. The government must provide money in the hands of the poor, who are fighting to survive. About Rs 4 lakh crore could be transferred to the states which have the capacity to digitally transfer the requisite money into the bank accounts of the poor. In West Bengal, all disbursements are done digitially, no cheques or cash is used in our treasury. The poor must be provided free ration as we have done in West Bengal providing rice and wheat at zero price from ration shops.What about the formal sector?Industry is facing both demand and supply challenges as supply channels have broken down. The stimulus will help in creating demand and provide liquidity in the system. It can even be considered to provide what is internationally {done during such times} -- 80% salary of the works paid {for} by the corporate sector during the lockdown is borne by the government. This will allow the retention of the worker and this human capital can be quickly put on use when the Covid-19 pandemic is over.The liquidly crunch is acute, particularly for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It calls for soft loans for a period of four years with a moratorium on repayments and interest for at least the first year. This will give them the breathing space.

2020-04-26,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kcr-has-ensured-state-will-not-face-water-war-says-ktr/article31440084.ece,"KCR has ensured State will not face water war, says KTR","In a world where water wars are predicted, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao ensured that the State would remain safe from them in future with the water revolution he has embarked upon through the Kaleshwaram project, IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao argues.As the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) celebrates its 20th anniversary on Sunday, KTR, who is also the TRS working president, sees the face of Telangana changing rapidly with several revolutions in the offing with water revolution being the first one and the rest being its off-shoots.The water revolution is not a six-year-old idea but it took birth on the day the party was established on April 27, 2001, in Jaladrushyam on the banks of Hussainsagar. Lifting Godavari water from 90 metres above the sea level to 618 metres is an unparalleled effort in independent India and in its course from Medigadda to Mallannasagar, Telangana is secured with 270 tmcft of water with 70% of the total 46,000 tanks and lakes filled. It is the worlds biggest multi-stage lift irrigation project.No other party could achieve so much in 20 years of its existence and just six-year rule, KTR argues, adding people have reposed faith in KCR in election after election. Such faith in a leader is unparalleled and his every word is gospel while TRS is the lifeline of Telangana. People eagerly wait for KCRs press conferences as they are so reassuring injecting confidence even in dire times.So is the party and leadership aiming to play a bigger role at the national level. We are already inspiring the country, the IT Minister says arguing Telangana model is the buzz word now. It has replaced the Gujarat models and West Bengal models that people used to refer to.The Rythu Bandhu scheme extending investment support to every farmer is the inspiration for the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and so is the Jal Jeevan mission, which is an off-shoot of Mission Bhageeratha that ensures piped drinking water to every household. Around 11 states in the country have studied the scheme to be implemented. Since its formation Telangana attracted the global giants of IT to its land and all known companies have their biggest offshore centres here. Their faith is justified with the government ensuring law and order and safe work environment.Far-sightednessThe farsightednes of our leader is an inspiration for several schemes and such ideas emanate from the passion to love their land and people, KTR argues. If we arent the role model who else it will be.Telangana dialect, once ridiculed as rustic and identified with villains, is now the mainstream on television, news programmes and even feature films. The achievement is no less than the water revolution.The water revolution will pave way for Green Revolution, Blue Revolution, Pink Revolution and White Revolution, benefiting all the communities. KTR recalls how the FCI chairman has described Telangana as rice bowl of India now. Paddy cultivation has more than doubled from 16.89 lakh acres in the Rabi season last year to 39.24 lakh acres due to abundant Godavari water. Same is the case with all cereals and pulses.It is also bringing in the blue revolution, increasing the acqa culture due to the tanks and lakes filled and Kaleshwaram project ensuring ground water level rising while the pink revolution is in the offing with Telangana emerging biggest market for meat due to the supply of lakhs of sheep to the sheep rearing communities. The State-owned Vijaya Dairy is now in a position to give dividend to the government, an indication of the White Revolution.

The money allowed her to pay for food and rent and also raise her four-year-old son. For nearly two months, however, Priya has had no work or money. With the coronavirus pandemic forcing the country into lockdown, the business has dried up. With no ration card, transport and no savings, Priya is now at the end of her tether.""If this goes on, my son and I will die of starvation,"" she said.This is the story of thousands of sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, a state with one of the highest number of sex workers and trafficking victims and survivors in the country after Maharashtra and West Bengal. With no business or access to rations, sex workers and their families have no choice but to wait in isolation for the government aid to arrive first.""At this rate though, death will arrive first,"" she mused.Shedding light on the issue, a non-governmental collective working for the rights of trafficking survivors and sex workers has written a letter to AP Chief Minister YSR Jagan Reddy, seeking immediate supplies for sex workers across the state.'No Ration Cards'The AP government has been distributing free rations to be delivered to the doorsteps of all residents of AP. On March 29, a month's quota of rice was distributed through village volunteers to poor households across the state along with one-kilo toor dal (a type of lentil) and Rs 1,000 cash assistance. No such aid came to Bhanu Priya's doorstep in Chirala, Prakasam.The government aid is meant for ration-card holders and Priya did not have one. She had applied for one through Vikmuthi, the NGO that drafted the letter to the CM, nearly two months ago in early March. But she had not yet received it.""About 50 percent of the sex workers in AP do not have ration cards for state-level help or Jan Dhan accounts for aid from central government,"" Vimukti General Secretary M Rammohan told News18. His organization has been working in collaboration with Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) and HELP to register sex workers for ration cards and help them get documents as well as government aid. ""These people and their families are receiving no aid. The added stigma of their profession also keeps benefactors away from making donations,"" Ramohan added, pointing out the hypocrisy of many who would rather give to an underprivileged group ""more suited to their preference"".Additionally, sex workers also did not have Jan Dhan accounts.(Sex workers receive rations from Vimukti)HIV patients sufferApart from rations, sex workers in AP, many of whom are receiving treatment for HIV have also been facing a severe crisis of medicines. With strict lockdown enforced across the state, many are facing issues procuring ART tablets needed for the treatment.According to Vikmukti office-bearer Mehrunnisa, ART tablets are only available in specific centers in government hospitals. ""Due to coronavirus, volunteers have been unable to visit the centers and the supply has been cut down to one batch of tablets every three months.""Even if patients do receive their quota of the medicine, it is only effective if consumed along with nutritious food. And the food is at a premium.According to M Rammhoan, the lack of precautions taken to ensure the safety of sex-workers, who have been deemed high-risk from coronavirus due to their claustrophobic living conditions, simply pointed to the apathy of government to take accountability for them. ""Authorities often say it is tough to identify sex workers, which is why it is tough to provide them with relief. But about 60-70 per cent of HIV positive sex workers are registered with APSACS. They can easily be identified, and helped,"" Rammohan said.'Save Our Children'In Andhra Pradesh, districts such as Guntur, Prakasam, Krishna, East and West Godavari and others are hubs of flesh trade and human trafficking. These areas are also densely populated with sex workers including voluntary and trafficked women who live in overcrowded brothels along with their children. According to statistics collected by Vikmukti and Indian Leadership Against Human Trafficking, there are 75,000 sex workers spread across some 30 red-light districts in the state.Vimukti and HELP documented a brothel in Guntur which had about 75 children living along with sex workers, wit nearly 22 of them between one to two years of age.While many migrant sex workers managed to return home, Lakshmi (name changed), a migrant sex worker from a village in the outskirts of Eluru, could not return home before the lockdown. she had just given birth and she did not think it safe to travel 30 km on uncertain transport with a one-month-old baby in tow amid the pandemic.Now, Lakshmi, 30, and her baby are stuck with no resources, food, or money. Even the owners of the brothel she worked in left without any intimation prior to the lockdown, leaving her and other sex workers who were unable to leave at their own devices.""We have very little food left which we are dividing among us and surviving somehow. I do not have enough milk to feed my baby, she said. We know we are outcasts in Indian society but even we are humans. If the government does not save us, we would starve. At least save our children."" she added.Yet another sex worker, Satya, 35, was also stuck at a brothel. Though her 8-year-old son did not live in the brothel but with a relative in another town, Satya was unable to send him or the family any money due to the lockdown. She was also running out of cash.If things continued this way, Satya felt that she and many others like her would have no option but to kill themselves and their children. ""Death is better than starvation or coronavirus,"" Satya said.Having written to the CM on April 18 regarding these issues, activists and sex workers now wait for the government's response and hope that their desperate pleas for help are met.","bhanu priya, 25, a sex worker, managed to earn rs 5,000 a month. the money allowed her to pay for food and rent and also raise her four-year-old son. for nearly two months, however, priya has had no work or money. with the coronavirus pandemic forcing the country into lockdown, the business has dried up. with no ration card, transport and no savings, priya is now at the end of her tether.""if this goes on, my son and i will die of starvation,"" she said.this is the story of thousands of sex workers in andhra pradesh, a state with one of the highest number of sex workers and trafficking victims and survivors in the country after maharashtra and west bengal. with no business or access to rations, sex workers and their families have no choice but to wait in isolation for the government aid to arrive first.""at this rate though, death will arrive first,"" she mused.shedding light on the issue, a non-governmental collective working for the rights of trafficking survivors and sex workers has written a letter to ap chief minister ysr jagan reddy, seeking immediate supplies for sex workers across the state.'no ration cards'the ap government has been distributing free rations to be delivered to the doorsteps of all residents of ap. on march 29, a month's quota of rice was distributed through village volunteers to poor households across the state along with one-kilo toor dal (a type of lentil) and rs 1,000 cash assistance. no such aid came to bhanu priya's doorstep in chirala, prakasam.the government aid is meant for ration-card holders and priya did not have one. she had applied for one through vikmuthi, the ngo that drafted the letter to the cm, nearly two months ago in early march. but she had not yet received it.""about 50 percent of the sex workers in ap do not have ration cards for state-level help or jan dhan accounts for aid from central government,"" vimukti general secretary m rammohan told news18. his organization has been working in collaboration with andhra pradesh state aids control society (apsacs) and help to register sex workers for ration cards and help them get documents as well as government aid.

And the recipients are always those who have lost their livelihoods in the lockdown, and now count among the poorest of the poor in those villages.So who is this Santa Claus and how is he able to identify the dwellings of the neediest? Until recently, no one had a clue. Then one day, somebody spotted the Good Samaritan on his rounds of distributing food and - Shyamal Majis cover was blown.Thirty-six- year- old Maji is a private tutor in Bolpur, a man of modest income and hardly well-off himself. Yet for the past two weeks, Maji and his flock of students - all from Bolpur and its environs - have been providing food to helpless people amid the ongoing lockdown due to Covid-19 disease across the nation.But why at night, when nobody can see them?Maji is a reluctant speaker and initially refused to be photographed.Look, I dont want any fame and would rather remain behind the wings. These people were mainly wage labourers who are jobless now. They still go out every day in search of work and are home at nightfall. But not all of them would like to stand in a queue for food, as some feel ashamed to seek help from others and would rather go hungry, Maji said.Maji has been giving tuition since 2006, and gets almost 200  250 students each year at his coaching centre. His network of students runs into a few thousands, and since he only teaches high school students and undergraduates, most are adults and many already employed.I have formed a 10-man team to accompany me on this job every night, Majji says. Since my students live scattered all over the area we operate in, they identify the neediest in their respective hamlets. Help pours in from the students themselves. Some are employed, others come from well-to-do-families and they all donate generously. Yet others chip in with whatever they can - sometimes with packets of puffed rice, he added.The recipients of Majis kindness are too poor to afford mobiles themselves, but have told their neighbours that Majis food packets are like godsends.Seventy-year-old Balai Kisku of my village, received a packet one night. He was so elated that we could actually see happiness and a sense of relief writ large on his face. He used to make thatched roofs for huts in the village but has been idle since the lockdown, said Uttam Das of Bolpurs Bondanga village. Das discovered only later, that the man behind the generous deed was none other than his own sons tutor, Shyamal Maji. It was good to know that Maji helped Kisku and others, without blowing his own trumpet, Das added.Sixty-year-old mason, Paru Murmu, of the same village was initially reluctant to accept Majis packets but once he did, the aid came as a great relief to him too.The people whom we choose to help are the poorest of the poor. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to do so, but we would prefer to remain in the shadows and work from behind the wings, said Taraknath Das, a student on Majis team.Each packet that he leaves on doorsteps contains around two kilos of rice, potatoes, some vegetables, cooking oil, salt, puffed rice and a soap.Sometimes I see people clicking photos while providing relief to poor people. One poor, needy man gets one kilo of rice and 15 persons gather around to click a photo. Is that what you are providing relief for? Das asked.Shyamal Maji, the tutor setting a worthy example for hundreds of young wards, is himself the father of a four-year-old daughter. He says that it is his wifes cooperation and encouragement alone, that has given him the courage to help others less fortunate then his own family.","kolkataupdated: apr 29, 2020 14:36 istfor the past two weeks, something strange has been happening every night, in villages on the fringes of santiniketan in bolpur town of bengals birbhum district.somebody has been leaving packets of food items and other essentials, at the doorsteps of some huts and shanties. and the recipients are always those who have lost their livelihoods in the lockdown, and now count among the poorest of the poor in those villages.so who is this santa claus and how is he able to identify the dwellings of the neediest? until recently, no one had a clue. then one day, somebody spotted the good samaritan on his rounds of distributing food and - shyamal majis cover was blown.thirty-six- year- old maji is a private tutor in bolpur, a man of modest income and hardly well-off himself. yet for the past two weeks, maji and his flock of students - all from bolpur and its environs - have been providing food to helpless people amid the ongoing lockdown due to covid-19 disease across the nation.but why at night, when nobody can see them?maji is a reluctant speaker and initially refused to be photographed.look, i dont want any fame and would rather remain behind the wings. these people were mainly wage labourers who are jobless now. they still go out every day in search of work and are home at nightfall. but not all of them would like to stand in a queue for food, as some feel ashamed to seek help from others and would rather go hungry, maji said.maji has been giving tuition since 2006, and gets almost 200  250 students each year at his coaching centre. his network of students runs into a few thousands, and since he only teaches high school students and undergraduates, most are adults and many already employed.i have formed a 10-man team to accompany me on this job every night, majji says. since my students live scattered all over the area we operate in, they identify the neediest in their respective hamlets. help pours in from the students themselves. some are employed, others come from well-to-do-families and they all donate generously. yet others chip in with whatever they can - sometimes with packets of puffed rice, he added.the recipients of majis kindness are too poor to afford mobiles themselves, but have told their neighbours that majis food packets are like godsends.seventy-year-old balai kisku of my village, received a packet one night. he was so elated that we could actually see happiness and a sense of relief writ large on his face. he used to make thatched roofs for huts in the village but has been idle since the lockdown, said uttam das of bolpurs bondanga village. das discovered only later, that the man behind the generous deed was none other than his own sons tutor, shyamal maji. it was good to know that maji helped kisku and others, without blowing his own trumpet, das added.sixty-year-old mason, paru murmu, of the same village was initially reluctant to accept majis packets but once he did, the aid came as a great relief to him too.the people whom we choose to help are the poorest of the poor. it gives me a great sense of satisfaction to do so, but we would prefer to remain in the shadows and work from behind the wings, said taraknath das, a student on majis team.each packet that he leaves on doorsteps contains around two kilos of rice, potatoes, some vegetables, cooking oil, salt, puffed rice and a soap.sometimes i see people clicking photos while providing relief to poor people. one poor, needy man gets one kilo of rice and 15 persons gather around to click a photo. is that what you are providing relief for? das asked.shyamal maji, the tutor setting a worthy example for hundreds of young wards, is himself the father of a four-year-old daughter. he says that it is his wifes cooperation and encouragement alone, that has given him the courage to help others less fortunate then his own family."

We have children to feed and the food being served at the village through community kitchen is not enough. We have no work and thus no earnings since the past two months, and soon we wont be able to afford both ration for the family and milk for children. We request that either government send us ration or make some arrangements to send back home, said Jyoti Sahu, who hails from Damoh district in Madhya Pradesh and works as domestic help in the neighbouring highrises in Sector 137. She lives with her in-laws  a large family of 25 people comprising 12 children. They had all come to Noida in search of work, now they wished to return.The Sahu family, along with their neighbours and other migrants stranded in Shahdara village also claimed that despite holding a Jan Dhan Account, they did not receive government funds either. In April, the Union government had promised to transfer 1,500 to these accounts held by women.The family I worked for helped me a lot, they even provided ration but how long can they feed us? We would need help from the government. We also did not receive money in our account, while some back in our village in Madhya Pradesh did, says Maya Rani Sahu and Anita Sahu, who also work as domestic help at the neighbouring highrises.Their landlord understood their predicament and did not ask for rent.Some 20 days back during the first lockdown, out of hundreds living here only 10 families received ration packets that had two kilo rice and atta and one kilo channa dal. There was no oil, vegetables, salt or spices. Many families who are my tenants approached me for help, so I dialled the helpline number at 0120-2425025, seeking ration but no help followed, said Ashok Sharma, the landlord who has rented rooms to more than ten such migrant families in the village.Laxmi Devi, a domestic help who migrated from Siwan district, Bihar was another marred by the lockdown.Before Holi, my husband went to Bhopal for work and got stuck there. I work as a domestic help here and have a seven-month-old baby girl. I dont have enough money to sustain longer and baby food is expensive. If only we can go back home, most of our problems would be solved, says Laxmi.Suman Bhartiyal, migrant from Champawat district in Uttarakhand was another sufferer with a toddler to feed and limited ration to sustain.My baby is not even a year old, so I cannot walk back home. If only we get chance or government arranges a bus, we all want to go home, says BhartiyalShanti Haldar, another migrant who hails from Malda in West Bengal and worked here at a construction site had similar story of no support from government and a sustenance that runs on credit.According to the officials however, the ration distribution will begin soon. Officials said that while the administration has already given orders to initiate the distribution of ration on priority basis to the ration card holders, a separate database is being worked upon to recognise the needy families without a ration card.We have over 1,85,000 families with ration card in the district of which 7,897 are Antyodaya card holder and remaining are PHH (person house hold ) card holder. The distribution is set to begin in two phase from May 1 to 12 and May 15 to 26. But these benefits are for the card holders from within the state. For the migrants, who dont have ration card or are the families in need, separate arrangements are being made. A database is being developed to recognise those in need and they will get a package that contains nine items including rice, pulses, atta, spices, salt, oil and vegetables, said RN Yadav, district supply officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.","noidaupdated: apr 30, 2020 22:51 istwith the community kitchen meals proving to be insufficient to feed the many people from different states stranded in the city due to the lockdown, there is palpable tension of the ground with them demanding that either the government find a way to send them back home or provide ration for sustenance.the union home ministry had recently allowed states to return migrant workers to their homes.in shahdara village in noidas sector 141, the residents come from different states -- madhya pradesh, bihar, jharkhand, uttarakhand, maharashtra and west bengal, among others -- but they have the same trouble: no money and often go to sleep hungry.all our savings are over and we dont know what to do. we have children to feed and the food being served at the village through community kitchen is not enough. we have no work and thus no earnings since the past two months, and soon we wont be able to afford both ration for the family and milk for children. we request that either government send us ration or make some arrangements to send back home, said jyoti sahu, who hails from damoh district in madhya pradesh and works as domestic help in the neighbouring highrises in sector 137. she lives with her in-laws  a large family of 25 people comprising 12 children. they had all come to noida in search of work, now they wished to return.the sahu family, along with their neighbours and other migrants stranded in shahdara village also claimed that despite holding a jan dhan account, they did not receive government funds either. in april, the union government had promised to transfer 1,500 to these accounts held by women.the family i worked for helped me a lot, they even provided ration but how long can they feed us? we would need help from the government. we also did not receive money in our account, while some back in our village in madhya pradesh did, says maya rani sahu and anita sahu, who also work as domestic help at the neighbouring highrises.their landlord understood their predicament and did not ask for rent.some 20 days back during the first lockdown, out of hundreds living here only 10 families received ration packets that had two kilo rice and atta and one kilo channa dal. there was no oil, vegetables, salt or spices. many families who are my tenants approached me for help, so i dialled the helpline number at 0120-2425025, seeking ration but no help followed, said ashok sharma, the landlord who has rented rooms to more than ten such migrant families in the village.laxmi devi, a domestic help who migrated from siwan district, bihar was another marred by the lockdown.before holi, my husband went to bhopal for work and got stuck there. i work as a domestic help here and have a seven-month-old baby girl. i dont have enough money to sustain longer and baby food is expensive. if only we can go back home, most of our problems would be solved, says laxmi.suman bhartiyal, migrant from champawat district in uttarakhand was another sufferer with a toddler to feed and limited ration to sustain.my baby is not even a year old, so i cannot walk back home. if only we get chance or government arranges a bus, we all want to go home, says bhartiyalshanti haldar, another migrant who hails from malda in west bengal and worked here at a construction site had similar story of no support from government and a sustenance that runs on credit.according to the officials however, the ration distribution will begin soon. officials said that while the administration has already given orders to initiate the distribution of ration on priority basis to the ration card holders, a separate database is being worked upon to recognise the needy families without a ration card.we have over 1,85,000 families with ration card in the district of which 7,897 are antyodaya card holder and remaining are phh (person house hold ) card holder. the distribution is set to begin in two phase from may 1 to 12 and may 15 to 26. but these benefits are for the card holders from within the state. for the migrants, who dont have ration card or are the families in need, separate arrangements are being made. a database is being developed to recognise those in need and they will get a package that contains nine items including rice, pulses, atta, spices, salt, oil and vegetables, said rn yadav, district supply officer, gautam budh nagar."

An official said the workers were misled by some supervisors who told them to leave immediately as that trains were started for migrant workers.Early on Sunday morning, 32-year-old Nilandan Das, a worker at a pharmaceutical company in Telanganas Sangareddy district, began walking on NH65 towards Lingampally railway station, from where a special train had left for Jharkhand on Saturday.His three-year-old son on his right shoulder and a bag of rice on his left, Das was among hundreds of workers who arrived at railway stations in and around Hyderabad on Sunday in the hope of finding a train home.On the way, he steals a glance at a table with food kept on the roadside by a good samaritan. I am not hungry. Give it to others who are coming behind us, he tells the man behind the counter. He picks up a packet of biscuits for his son, and walks on with his wife trailing behind him.At Lingampally, however, he and 20 of his companions, all pharma company employees in Sangareddy, found no trains.Disappointed, yet undeterred, the group, like many others, decided to make the long walk to Secundarabad railway station, some 25 km away.If not today, they will start tomorrow. We have to be at the station to catch the trains, says Das.Also among this crowd of hopefuls was Sanjiv Kumar, 26, a painter from Bihar. When they can send Jharkhand workers home why cant they send us too? We are at the end of our patience, locked down in shanties with nothing to do. Why isnt the Bihar government requesting the Telangana Government to arrange a train for us? he wondered.Elsewhere in Hyderabad city, several tried to get to Secundarabad station, but were stopped by police personnel. At Tolichowki, hundreds of migrant workers came out on the streets demanding they be allowed to go home. The workers-from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal-demanded the government arrange trains or buses for them.They work at the construction sites but there is no work now. Someone told them that government has allowed migrants to return to their homes and has arranged trains so they came out on the streets to go to Secunderabad. They are home sick and want to just go home. We informed them that as and when trains are arranged we will inform them and arrange for their transport. Then they went back, said Inspector K Sunil of Humayunnagar Police Station.Those who had already reached Secunderabad railway station, meanwhile, refused to return and decided to stay put on the footpath, even as the authorities tried to convince them to go to nearby shelters.An official said the workers were misled by some supervisors who told them to leave immediately as that trains were started for migrant workers.The supervisors and owners who were taking care of them by providing food probably wanted to get rid of them. So they told them that government has arranged special trains. They walked up to the railway station with false hope and now they are refusing to go back, he said.Meanwhile, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Sunday decided to allow people stranded on either side to return home.The Telangana Police also started giving passes to stranded migrants to enable them to leave the state. It is also being done to assess the number of stranded migrants, the states they belong to, and the number of trains or buses needed to take them home.After the Jharkhand train, a large number of migrant workers have started approaching police stations in Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates seeking help to go home.

Last month, during the second phase of the lockdown, the deserted Maidan welcomed into the world a filly that was named after the disease.Born to an eight-year-old mare on April 18, Covid has made its owner Sonu and other horseowners at Maidan  who are now without jobs  look to the future with hope. However, they couldnt celebrate the fillys arrival due to the lockdown restrictions.Horses are used in the Maidan area for joyrides. Every time a mare gives birth, sweets are distributed and horseowners join in a feast of chicken and rice. But this time it was different due to the lockdown and 32-year-old Sonu  who lives on a pavement near the Exide crossing on JL Nehru Road  didnt have the money for a grand treat. He, however, distributed sweets. Even though Sonu had decided to name it Roshni, fellow horseowner Md Zafar (58)  a veteran in the trade at Maidan  asked him to name it Covid.These are difficult times. I was worried about Covids mother Madhu when I found out that she was pregnant. But Zafar bhai helped me and was there at Maidan when she gave birth. We hope that Covid will bring us good luck, said Sonu.Now 15 days old and suckling, Covid will continue to feed on milk for the next six months. Thereafter, she will be given rice. Sonu earns about Rs 200 a day, which goes up to Rs 500 on weekends. He has to spend at least Rs 150 a day to feed five horses.Sonu struggles to make ends meet for a family of five and cant afford a horse cart. So, I use my horses for joyrides. Tourists and children are particularly fond of pony rides, he said.There are about 12 horseowners at Maidan who have 28 horses. The Kolkata Mounted Police had been providing a regular supply of husk and wheat for the horses during the lockdown. But it help hasnt been easy to come by over the last week, making Sonu anxious. For the last 42 days, he has had no earning. But he has promised a grand feast to his colleagues once the lockdown ends.For the moment, though, horseowners have been taking turns to keep a round-theclock vigil on the ponies as there have been instances of horses being stolen. Covid is very young and unlike the other horses, I cant keep her tied. So, she has to be kept under watch, said Sonu.","covid with her mother madhudownload the times of india news app for latest city newssubscribe start your daily mornings with times of india newspaper! order nowkolkata: its white with patches of brown and is called covid. but it has one of the most lovable faces that you can imagine. last month, during the second phase of the lockdown, the deserted maidan welcomed into the world a filly that was named after the disease.born to an eight-year-old mare on april 18, covid has made its owner sonu and other horseowners at maidan  who are now without jobs  look to the future with hope. however, they couldnt celebrate the fillys arrival due to the lockdown restrictions.horses are used in the maidan area for joyrides. every time a mare gives birth, sweets are distributed and horseowners join in a feast of chicken and rice. but this time it was different due to the lockdown and 32-year-old sonu  who lives on a pavement near the exide crossing on jl nehru road  didnt have the money for a grand treat. he, however, distributed sweets. even though sonu had decided to name it roshni, fellow horseowner md zafar (58)  a veteran in the trade at maidan  asked him to name it covid.these are difficult times. i was worried about covids mother madhu when i found out that she was pregnant. but zafar bhai helped me and was there at maidan when she gave birth. we hope that covid will bring us good luck, said sonu.now 15 days old and suckling, covid will continue to feed on milk for the next six months. thereafter, she will be given rice. sonu earns about rs 200 a day, which goes up to rs 500 on weekends. he has to spend at least rs 150 a day to feed five horses.sonu struggles to make ends meet for a family of five and cant afford a horse cart. so, i use my horses for joyrides. tourists and children are particularly fond of pony rides, he said.there are about 12 horseowners at maidan who have 28 horses. the kolkata mounted police had been providing a regular supply of husk and wheat for the horses during the lockdown. but it help hasnt been easy to come by over the last week, making sonu anxious. for the last 42 days, he has had no earning. but he has promised a grand feast to his colleagues once the lockdown ends.for the moment, though, horseowners have been taking turns to keep a round-theclock vigil on the ponies as there have been instances of horses being stolen. covid is very young and unlike the other horses, i cant keep her tied. so, she has to be kept under watch, said sonu."

2020-05-05,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-grain-stockist-with-a-role-still-relevant/article31504557.ece,A grain stockist with a role still relevant,"For several years now, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has drawn attention for all the wrong reasons. Set up under the Food Corporations Act 1964, in its first decade, the FCI was at the forefront of Indias quest of self-sufficiency in rice and wheat following the Green Revolution, managing procurement and stocking grain that supported a vast Public Distribution System (PDS).Also read: Foodgrain stock will last till next March, says FCI chiefOver time, however, many began to see it as a behemoth that had long outlived its purpose. Its operations were regarded as expensive and inefficient, a perception that has come to be accepted as fact. Even in the 1970s and 1980s, poor storage conditions meant a lot of grain was lost to pests, mainly rats; diversion of grain was widespread, prompting a former chairman to declare that there was a problem with human rats as well. By the late 1990s, the FCI was often referred to as the Food Corruption of India, not entirely facetiously.Why it is better placedNotwithstanding its dubious reputation, the FCI has consistently maintained the PDS, a lifeline for vulnerable millions across the country. Today, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, it holds the key to warding off a looming crisis of hunger and starvation, especially in regions where lakhs of migrant workers have returned with little in hand by way of money or food. Before the lockdown, many experts had observed that with 77 million tonnes of grains in its godowns and on the eve of a new round of procurement  of a bumper harvest of wheat  the FCI was facing a serious storage problem. This was worrying not just because of a shortage of modern storage facilities but also because the FCI lacked a pro-active liquidation policy for excess stocks. Today, this concern has all but disappeared, even if only temporarily, and many have called for opening up the godowns to release food stocks to those affected by the lockdown.As of April 13, 2020, the FCI had already moved 3 million tonnes (post-lockdown), to States, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Karnataka and those in the Northeast, where demand outstrips within State procurement and/or stocks. The FCI has also enabled purchases by States and non-governmental organisations directly from FCI depots, doing away with e-auctions typically conducted for the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). With rabi procurement under way in many States, it seems that the country will secure ample food supplies to cope with the current crisis. Given the extended lockdown, the FCI is uniquely positioned to move grain across State borders where private sector players continue to face formidable challenges. With passenger rail and road traffic suspended, grain can move quickly without bottlenecks. Yet, there is a widespread sense that the FCI is simply not moving fast enough and could do much more.Also read: A flawed approach to food securityFirst, the FCI is overwhelmingly reliant on rail, which has several advantages over road transport. In 2019-2020 (until February) only 24% of the grain moved was by road. The FCI has, however, long recognised that road movement is often better suited for emergencies and for remote areas. Containerised movement too, which is not the dominant way of transporting grain, is more cost-effective and efficient. Now, more than ever, it is imperative to move grain quickly and with the least cost and effort, to areas where the need is greatest.Positioning strategySecond, given that the coming months will see predictable demand of staples from food insecure hotspots where migrant workers have just returned or where work is scarce, one strategy that has been adopted widely in international food aid by the United States, for example, is pre-positioning shipments, where grain is stored closer to demand hotspots. The FCI already has a decentralised network of godowns. In the current context, it would be useful for the State government and the FCI to maintain stocks at block headquarters or panchayats in food insecure or remote areas, in small hermetic silos or containers; this would allow State governments to respond rapidly, not to mention the sense of assurance and psychological comfort that it will offer vulnerable communities. This is especially relevant for regions that are chronically underserved by markets or where markets have been severely disrupted.Also read: Outdated census data deprives over 10 crore of PDS: economistsThird, there is a strong case for the central government to look beyond the PDS and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and release stocks over and above existing allocations, but at its own expenses rather than by transferring the fiscal burden to States. Along with a prepositioning strategy, this would provide flexibility to local governments to access grains for contextually appropriate interventions at short notice, including feeding programmes, free distribution to vulnerable and marginalised sections, those who are excluded from the PDS, etc.; it also allows freedom to panchayats, for example, to sell grain locally at pre-specified prices until supply is restored. In many States, there is a vibrant network of self-help groups formed under the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) which can be tasked with last mile distribution of food aid other than the PDS. Consultative committees presumably exist already in each State to coordinate with the FCI on such arrangements.Fourth, typically, the FCIs guidelines follow a first in, first out principle (FIFO) that mandates that grain that has been procured earlier needs to be distributed first to ensure that older stocks are liquidated, both across years and even within a particular year. It is time for the FCI to suspend this strategy, if it has not already, that enables movement that costs least time, money and effort.Fifth, today farmers across the country growing for markets are seeking to reach out to consumers directly, many out of sheer despair. In many places, farmer producer organisations (FPOs) have been at forefront of rebuilding these broken supply chains. The FCI along with the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED), is well placed to rope in expertise to manage the logistics to support these efforts. NAFED has already taken the initiative to procure and transport horticultural crops. Several State governments too have put in systems to procure horticultural crops. The FCI should similarly consider expanding its role to support FPOs and farmer groups, to move a wider range of commodities including agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, packing materials and so on.There are two major concerns that many articulate regarding the FCIs role. The first is a long-term concern regarding the costs of food subsidy. An analysis of FCI costs spanning 2001-16 suggests, however, that on average about 60% of the costs of acquisition, procurement, distribution and carrying stocks are in fact transfers to farmers. Not all of what is counted as subsidy therefore represents a waste of resources, even if the distributional consequences and inefficiencies leave a lot to be desired. At the same time, the government needs to address the FCIs mounting debts  an estimated 2.55 lakh crore in March 2020 in the form of National Small Saving Funds Loan alone  and revisit its current preference for not liquidating these in order to contain the Union governments fiscal deficit. Some clarity on this aspect would enable the government to be bolder with deploying the FCI in the best possible way. A second concern is that extended food distribution of subsidised grain is akin to dumping and depresses food prices locally, in turn affecting farmers. These are legitimate concerns but perhaps only beyond the looming emergency this summer.When the pandemic is past, questions will once again surface on the relevance of the FCI. Even in 2015, the Shanta Kumar report recommended repurposing the organisation as an agency for innovations in Food Management System and advocated shedding its dominant role in the procurement and distribution of grain. There is no doubt that the FCI needs to overhaul its operations and modernise its storage. At the same time, the relevance of an organisation such as the FCI or of public stockholding, common to most Asian countries, has never been more strongly established than now, even as we contemplate its new role in a post-pandemic world.Sudha Narayanan is Associate Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai","for several years now, the food corporation of india (fci) has drawn attention for all the wrong reasons. set up under the food corporations act 1964, in its first decade, the fci was at the forefront of indias quest of self-sufficiency in rice and wheat following the green revolution, managing procurement and stocking grain that supported a vast public distribution system (pds).also read: foodgrain stock will last till next march, says fci chiefover time, however, many began to see it as a behemoth that had long outlived its purpose. its operations were regarded as expensive and inefficient, a perception that has come to be accepted as fact. even in the 1970s and 1980s, poor storage conditions meant a lot of grain was lost to pests, mainly rats;

The decision to settle a longstanding land dispute was well timed as moving from Bengaluru to his ancestral village in Tamil Nadu before the nationwide lockdown for Covid-19 has helped the 2009 Indian Open golf champion beat the blues.When Muniyappa, 43, returned home from a domestic event in Kolkata in mid-March, talk was rife that the pandemic was about to bring life to a standstill. If that happened, all facilities (including the Karnataka Golf Association course in Bengaluru where he practices) would shut down, he recalled hearing.With a piece of land purchased by his grandfather requiring attention, Muniyappa and his family of golferssons Kiran (16) and Prem (9), and daughter Gopika (13) all play the gamecrossed into Tamil Nadu on March 20 to be in Malaiyur village, a green zone, in the hilly Dharmapuri district that borders Karnataka.Muniyappa was always drawn by the serene surroundings. He makes it a point to visit the village once a year, though he had never thought of creating a practice facility despite the abundance of space. With no timeline in sight for the return to Bengaluru, he got to work, and a piece of land near their house was chosen.Being a rocky terrain, clearing a 40-yard strip was back-breaking effort. The task was to extricate rocks with shovels before the area could be levelled. The surface had to be watered as well, but unseasonal rain saved Muniyappa the effort.Comprising two par-three holes, the bigger one of 30 yards has a tee box on the fringe of the green from where Muniyappa uses a seven-iron, the only club he had taken with him, to hit 170 yards into farmland.

2020-05-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lockdown-bengal-paddy-late-harvest-labour-wages-up-6405549/,"In Bengal paddy bowl, yield of late harvesting: wages up","Lockdown, lack of cheap migrant labour mean harvest has spilled over from April. (Express Photo: Partha Paul) Lockdown, lack of cheap migrant labour mean harvest has spilled over from April. (Express Photo: Partha Paul)Yadav Ghorui has rarely been this busy during harvest season. He is one of eight farm labourers called in to work on a one-bigha field in his Ajapur village in Burdwan, about 100 km from Kolkata.Last year, I got Rs 200 and 2 kg of rice every day that I worked; this year I am getting Rs 350 and 2 kg rice. Our group of eight is booked for the entire month. Work began a week ago and we have to harvest, bundle the paddy and dehusk the grains in two days. We work at night too, said Ghorui, who lives with his wife and two children.The rabi crop, known as Boro Dhan in Bengal, is sown in November and usually harvested by April. But this year, the lockdown has delayed the harvest by over a month, and now, farmers are racing against time to finish before the rains at the end of June.The lockdown has also meant farm owners havent been able to bring in cheaper migrant workers from states such as Bihar and Jharkhand, or from Birbhum, Bankura and Purulia districts in the state. While the state government has allowed combine harvesting machines to move, most of the operators of these machines are from Punjab and Haryana. So, cultivators and owners have had to depend on local hands, thus pushing up demand and daily wages.Ghoruis co-worker, Sandhya Malik, her face and head covered with a cloth, said, Within a couple of weeks of the lockdown, we had exhausted all cash. But all that has changed. Now I can buy anything for the family  biscuits, milk and vegetables. God has been kind.Pradip Majumder, the advisor on agriculture to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said harvesting of paddy was happening on a war footing, with social distancing norms in place.Out of over 3,000 harvester machines in the state, around 800 have chain wheels (which work better in fields rendered wet after the rains). They are on their way to the fields, said Majumder.The sporadic rains since last week have added to the farmers worries. If there is more water, the paddy will germinate in the field and will be useless. If the grains have moisture content less than 12%, they can be stored. But anything more than 15% will mean pest infestation. And if the moisture content is over 20%, the rice will have to be discarded, said Jagannath Chatterjee, Deputy Director, Agriculture, Purba Burdwan.This year, paddy has been cultivated on 1.7 lakh hectares in the district, up from 1.2 lakh hectares last year.About 60 km from Ajapur, in Dharampur village, Sheikh Ashraf, 35, who owns 16 bighas, has only been able to harvest nine using machines, and is unsure if he can finish before the rains. His input costs have also gone up, he adds, listing how harvester machines are charging Rs 2,500 to 3,000 per hour, those with chain wheels around Rs 4,000 an hour, and the rise in wages from Rs 220 to Rs 360.On the road behind him, labourers use their feet to spread paddy grains on the tarmac. Since theres hardly any traffic, we leave the grain here to dry, said Ashraf.About 50 feet away, Kalyan Mondol stood by the harvester machine he owns, along with his driver Abesh Malas. They are here from neighbouring Bankura district; a month ago, they were in Murshidabad.I usually get the drivers from Punjab or Haryana. Now our boys here have learnt to operate the machine. I pay Abesh about Rs 900 a day. I have two drivers here, they take turns to operate the machine. I keep getting calls from farmers asking for the harvester, said Mondol, adding that his machine can lift paddy from 2.5 to 3 bighas of land in one hour.In neighbouring Eroar village, Mangobindo Adhikari, panchayat member and local Trinamool leader, said more is needed to generate employment. There was some talk of including harvesting under the MNREGS, but it has not been done yet, he said.In Golsi village, Sheikh Ajijur Rehman, 50, is waiting for the harvester to reach his 30-bigha land. On fields nearby, chain-wheel harvester machines can be seen cutting, de-husking and then emptying the grains into mini-vans along the road.Two days ago, I tried to get 12 labourers from Jharkhand, but police stopped them at the border near Dubrajpur (Birbhum district). The government is allowing labourers from other districts, but arranging transport for them is expensive, said Ajijur.He said he was 15th in the queue for a harvester. It will be around midnight when my turn comes, he said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Mahalakshmi, a resident of Keelavalavu village, said that she set out to cover the distance of over 200 km to meet her husband, Sivakumar who has a disability, and who was unable to come back home during the lockdown.I didn't have any money left. My child was crying. I had no idea what to do. And so I left, she said. Ms. Mahalakshmi said she survived the first month by herding goats but realised that she could not handle any further expenses. There is no water supply to my house as well. I had to wait for two days for a tanker to come and provide us a pot for 30. I heard that life was much better in Erode. The only way to survive was to go to my husband, she said.She had heard that migrants were walking all the way from Chennai to West Bengal. So she had the confidence to complete her journey. She said that the aim was to meet her husband as he was the main breadwinner of the family.Ms. Mahalakshmi said that she first walked towards Melur to sell her daughters silver anklets, her last remaining piece of jewellery for 1,000. She said that she needed enough money to last till Erode. When she was stopped at Melur, she thought she would walk to Arapalayam bus stand and catch a bus to Erode.I had forgotten that buses were not plying. I stopped at Vadipatti check post to ask the police personnel for directions but they said that I should not travel without permission from the district administration. They redirected me to the Collectors office, she said.And then some officials at the Collectorate and the district Red Cross team assisted her by providing her with 20 kg rice, pulses and oil to last the month. They also drove her, her child and goats back home in a car.Madurai Red Cross secretary M. Gopalakrishnan said that they are also making arrangements to try and bring her husband back in a Red Cross van that regularly travels between the two districts.Until then, we must wait, she said.","a 30 year-old woman, her five-year-old daughter and their five goats began walking to erode from their house in melur on friday morning, only to be stopped at vadipatti check-post the same day and sent back home in a car.s. mahalakshmi, a resident of keelavalavu village, said that she set out to cover the distance of over 200 km to meet her husband, sivakumar who has a disability, and who was unable to come back home during the lockdown.i didn't have any money left. my child was crying. i had no idea what to do. and so i left, she said. ms. mahalakshmi said she survived the first month by herding goats but realised that she could not handle any further expenses. there is no water supply to my house as well. i had to wait for two days for a tanker to come and provide us a pot for 30. i heard that life was much better in erode. the only way to survive was to go to my husband, she said.she had heard that migrants were walking all the way from chennai to west bengal. so she had the confidence to complete her journey. she said that the aim was to meet her husband as he was the main breadwinner of the family.ms. mahalakshmi said that she first walked towards melur to sell her daughters silver anklets, her last remaining piece of jewellery for 1,000. she said that she needed enough money to last till erode. when she was stopped at melur, she thought she would walk to arapalayam bus stand and catch a bus to erode.i had forgotten that buses were not plying. i stopped at vadipatti check post to ask the police personnel for directions but they said that i should not travel without permission from the district administration. they redirected me to the collectors office, she said.and then some officials at the collectorate and the district red cross team assisted her by providing her with 20 kg rice, pulses and oil to last the month. they also drove her, her child and goats back home in a car.madurai red cross secretary m. gopalakrishnan said that they are also making arrangements to try and bring her husband back in a red cross van that regularly travels between the two districts.until then, we must wait, she said."
2020-05-19,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/covid-19-the-resurgence-of-the-4-o-clock-tea/article31620045.ece,COVID-19: The return of the tea time snack,"It is 3.30 pm. Shreya N assembles rice flour, grated coconut and cumin, then puts water to boil. As she mixes the ingredients, she thinks about her grandmother, and how she too would go through the same routine putting together her piece de resistance, the star appam. It was indeed the star at the tea table whenever it was made, she says. Decades later, it is back on the dining table.The current lockdown to tackle COVID-19 has brought the resurgence of the 4 oclock tea, a ritual lost over the past few decades. Kitchens now stir to life in the afternoon, as people call their grandmothers, mothers and aunts for old family recipes. The dining table is the heart of the house once more.While teatime has been hijacked over the years by cappuccinos and cookies, till a few decades ago, home cooks experimented with local, and often home-grown, ingredients to whip up inventive snacks.UnnakkayaIn Kerala for example, besides the ubiquitous pazhampori (banana fritters), unniappam and parippu (lentil) vada, most families have their own snack recipes. Rahul Prasad, from Kozhikode, says the muttayappam (a savoury pancake) his mother makes is a unique combination of rice flour, eggs, coconut, shallots and green chillies, which he hasnt eaten anywhere else.Love letter (Elanji) IngredientsSugar -- 1/2 cupCoconut -- 1 cupMaida -- 1 1/2 cupWater -- as requiredMethodMix the maida with water to make a batter (thin dosa batter consistency). Pour it just as you would a dosa on a heated pan. As it gets cooked, spread coconut and sugar mix and intead of flipping the dosa, roll it. Take off pan and serve hot.The building blocks are often similar. A Malayali snack worth its salt must have coconut, jaggery and banana or jackfruit, says Sunitha Menon from Kanjiramattom. Shes making unnakkaya for tea, a delicious fusion of banana, coconut, sugar and ghee. The love letter (also known as elanji) has also resurfaced: this is a wrap filled with sweet, grated coconut. Then there are the madhura puffs (also known as pugada), a fried snack filled with grated coconut and sugar, popular in North Kerala in the 90s.Ribbon pakoda | Photo Credit: Johney ThomasMeanwhile, Shobhana Subramanian from Chennai experimented with the very traditional, yet much-loved ribbon pakoda. She sought help from her mother-in-law, who is an expert in the dish. She made the dough and I pressed it in the mould. The pakodas turned out really well  crispy and delicious, says Shobhana. To get great results, she says, the mix of besan, rice flour and roasted and powdered urad dal should be perfect. It is then seasoned with salt, chilli powder and asafoetida, and kneaded with a generous quantity of butter and heated oil. Ideally had with a cup of filter coffee, this pakoda is an ever-green snack.Ragini Kumar from Bihar is rediscovering two of the States favourite teatime snacks, spongy rosogullas and samosas stuffed with a spicy potato mash. Over the phone, from her home in Patna, she talks about how evening tea was a ceremony in Bihari families. Stating that while the rosogullas and samosas were staples, everyday, There was always an additional namkeen, (a savoury preparation) or a sweetmeat such as thekua, a deep-fried biscuit made of flour, with flower motifs impressed on it, and khaja, a deep-fried flaky pastry. The namkeens could be ghugni, stir-fried green gram or nimki, deep-fried diamond-shaped short eats.Hara channa frittersWinter evenings were for hara channa fritters, made with dried green chick peas, rice flour batter and onions; the deep-fried snack is still a popular favourite. The water chestnut halwa, no longer common, used to be made until a few decades ago. Nowadays it is had during a fast, says Ragini.The tea is also important, she adds, saying that the flavour, colour and body of tea is an important conversation point. Tea time was also when families dropped in to visit, hence a large spread was always ready. Ragini says the lockdown has given her ample time to discuss these recipes with family members. One thing we all plan to have post lockdown when we meet is the puffed rice-peanut mix, at least in memory of the lockdown.At Sweena Karnanis home in Visakhapatnam, teatime has become all about scarfing down traditional Marwari snacks. Food certainly comforts, she says, adding that her menu for the day is the Marwari traditional ajwain pakoda chaat, pyaaz ki kachori and gudd ki papdi. Plucking fresh ajwain leaves from her kitchen garden, Sweena combines it with spinach to coat it with a batter of gram flour and spices. This is then deep fried and served with yoghurt and tamarind chutney. This ajwain pakoda is a famous snack of Varanasi, she adds.Late afternoons are filled with the sizzle of punugulus wobbling in the frying pan at Jhansi Tripuranenis kitchen. This Telugu short eat is served with crimson ginger chutney for that spicy twist. Piping hot punugulus make for a perfect chai-time snack, adds Jhansi. Traditionally made with a batter of rice flour and black gram, Jhansi says these can be tried with leftover dosa batter too.Gunta punuguluAmong all the snacks Instagrammer Radhika Raja has tried out during the lockdown, the gunta punugulu  made with less oil, and so healthier  is her favourite. These are made with less oil and are therefore healthier. The lockdown has given me plenty of time to make different versions of this traditional snack, says Radhika. She prepares it by mixing boiled sweet corn, grated carrot, green chillies in dosa batter, sprinkled with jeera (cumin), salt and pepper. The batter is poured in the iron cast skillet to be cooked over a small flame till the punugulus turn golden brown.Sreeparna Sarkar relives her childhood in Kolkata through the Bengali snacks she has been trying out every day. The highlight of her experiments has been the korai sutir kochuri, a deep-fried kachori, stuffed with mildly spiced, asafoetida-infused green peas. Nobody can make this as good as mom, she sighs, but is quick to add: but thankfully there is FaceTime!Eggplant coated with gram flour and deep fried. | Photo Credit: creative_streaksThe Bengali in her loves all things deep-fried, which she has been making with her mothers help through video calls from Bolepur. Her lockdown teatime snack list includes aloo chop  mashed potato with spices, coated with egg and bread crumbs and deep fried in oil, fried begunis (batter fried eggplant) and peyaji (onion fritters).Tekeli Pitha IngredientsRice -- 2 cupsCoconut -- 2 cups, freshly gratedSugar -- Half cupSalt -- a pinchWater as requiredMethodSoak the rice for an hour. Wash and drain excess water and let it go semi dry. Grind to a fine powder. Keep the powder in a bowl covered with a wet cloth. Mix rice flour, freshly grated coconut, sugar and salt. Fill half a kettle with water and bring to boil. Place the rice flour mixture on the kettle lid and press gently. Cover it with a wet muslin cloth. Tie the ends and fold back to the head of the lid securing the mixture for steaming. Place the lid back on the kettle and let it steam on medium flame for 6-7 minutes. Remove the muslin cloth and take out the pithas and place it in a plate gently. Serve hot with tea.Certain foods go beyond their scope; they kindle fond memories of home and relationships, says Jisha M R, a Malayali married to an Assamese, living in Delhi. When she first came across the tekeli pitha, she knew she had found love. It looked like idli and tasted like puttu and since then, it has been my favourite, she says.

the deep-fried snack is still a popular favourite. the water chestnut halwa, no longer common, used to be made until a few decades ago. nowadays it is had during a fast, says ragini.the tea is also important, she adds, saying that the flavour, colour and body of tea is an important conversation point. tea time was also when families dropped in to visit, hence a large spread was always ready. ragini says the lockdown has given her ample time to discuss these recipes with family members. one thing we all plan to have post lockdown when we meet is the puffed rice-peanut mix, at least in memory of the lockdown.at sweena karnanis home in visakhapatnam, teatime has become all about scarfing down traditional marwari snacks. food certainly comforts, she says, adding that her menu for the day is the marwari traditional ajwain pakoda chaat, pyaaz ki kachori and gudd ki papdi. plucking fresh ajwain leaves from her kitchen garden, sweena combines it with spinach to coat it with a batter of gram flour and spices. this is then deep fried and served with yoghurt and tamarind chutney. this ajwain pakoda is a famous snack of varanasi, she adds.late afternoons are filled with the sizzle of punugulus wobbling in the frying pan at jhansi tripuranenis kitchen. this telugu short eat is served with crimson ginger chutney for that spicy twist. piping hot punugulus make for a perfect chai-time snack, adds jhansi. traditionally made with a batter of rice flour and black gram, jhansi says these can be tried with leftover dosa batter too.gunta punuguluamong all the snacks instagrammer radhika raja has tried out during the lockdown, the gunta punugulu  made with less oil, and so healthier  is her favourite. these are made with less oil and are therefore healthier. the lockdown has given me plenty of time to make different versions of this traditional snack, says radhika. she prepares it by mixing boiled sweet corn, grated carrot, green chillies in dosa batter, sprinkled with jeera (cumin), salt and pepper. the batter is poured in the iron cast skillet to be cooked over a small flame till the punugulus turn golden brown.sreeparna sarkar relives her childhood in kolkata through the bengali snacks she has been trying out every day. the highlight of her experiments has been the korai sutir kochuri, a deep-fried kachori, stuffed with mildly spiced, asafoetida-infused green peas. nobody can make this as good as mom, she sighs, but is quick to add: but thankfully there is facetime!eggplant coated with gram flour and deep fried. | photo credit: creative_streaksthe bengali in her loves all things deep-fried, which she has been making with her mothers help through video calls from bolepur. her lockdown teatime snack list includes aloo chop  mashed potato with spices, coated with egg and bread crumbs and deep fried in oil, fried begunis (batter fried eggplant) and peyaji (onion fritters).tekeli pitha ingredientsrice -- 2 cupscoconut -- 2 cups, freshly gratedsugar -- half cupsalt -- a pinchwater as requiredmethodsoak the rice for an hour. wash and drain excess water and let it go semi dry. grind to a fine powder. keep the powder in a bowl covered with a wet cloth. mix rice flour, freshly grated coconut, sugar and salt. fill half a kettle with water and bring to boil. place the rice flour mixture on the kettle lid and press gently. cover it with a wet muslin cloth. tie the ends and fold back to the head of the lid securing the mixture for steaming. place the lid back on the kettle and let it steam on medium flame for 6-7 minutes. remove the muslin cloth and take out the pithas and place it in a plate gently. serve hot with tea.certain foods go beyond their scope;

Five columns of the Kumaon Regiment were deployed with road-clearing equipment like payloaders and bulldozers on Southern Avenue and in Tollygunge, Ballygunge, Rajarhat, New Town and Behala, all places where Amphans lashing uprooted thousands of huge trees and blocked entire roads.Army support has been called for; NDRF and State Disaster Response Force teams deployed; Rly, Port & private sector, too, requested to supply teams and equipment, the state home department tweeted on Saturday after saying it was mobilising maximum strength in unified command mode on 247 basis for immediate restoration of essential infrastructure and services ASAP.The appeal and the quickened response followed protests in several city pockets over Friday and Saturday against the continuing power blackout, which also resulted in dry taps, especially in south Kolkata and the citys northern and southern fringes.

Set up in 1884, IJMA is the apex business chamber for Indias jute industry.Bengal is the highest producer of jute in the country. The fresh crisis comes at a time when mills in Bengal were under pressure from other states to produce bags on an emergency basis for transportation of Boro rice and relief materials being supplied to people during lockdown.Although there is no report of any damage to machinery, structures of the mills and stored raw jute suffered damage. We are yet to calculate the extent of loss but supplies of jute products will be definitely hit. All the 60 operational jute mills in the state had started production (with limited manpower) during the lockdown, said Gupta.Incidentally, last week IJMA said that during the lockdown the industry suffered a nationwide loss of Rs 1250 crore.The jute Industry is grappling for survival after being in lockdown for over one and a half months now. Already 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of production of jute goods has been lost estimated to be valued at Rs.1,250 crore. With the cash flows drying up, jute mill companies are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet, IJMA said in a statement on May 19.On April 3, the Centre urged the Bengal government to direct jute mills to resume operation in view of shortage in supply of packaging materials. In a letter, the Centre said, Procurement operations of foodgrain, for which availability of packaging material like jute bales are immensely required by major procuring states like Punjab, Harayana, Uttar Pradesh and Madya Pradesh where procurement operations will begin from April and peak season is for only two-three weeks only, the letter said.On April 5, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to open jute bag manufacturing units in Bengal and ensure transportation of jute bags through special goods trains to his state. Rao told Modi that there was a severe scarcity of bags and Telangana needed 20 crore jute bags to procure paddy.The Bengal government, however, issued permission to the jute mills to resume operation with limited manpower. Initially, permission was given to deploy only 15 per cent people which was later increased to 50 per cent in phases.Gupta told HT last week that the future of over three lakhs jute mill workers and 40 lakhs jute farmers hang in balance and if the situation persists it may result in permanent sickness and closure of mills.Jute industrys loss has been plastic industrys gain. Continuous dilutions under the provisions of the Jute Packaging Act has taken place over the lockdown period. Already about 3 lakh bales of orders for jute bags have been diverted to PP/ HDPE industry. If the lockdown situation continues any longer, further dilutions cannot be ruled out, IJMA said in a recent statement.The damage done by Amphan is going to hit relief work. This is a new crisis, said a senior state food and supplies department official who did not want to be named. The departments minister Jyotipriyo Mullick could not be contacted despite repeated attempts because of failure in mobile network.According to IJMA, the carryover of raw jute at the end of the jute crop year 2019-20 is expected to be over 22 lakh bales. With reports of normal sowing this year, across all jute growing areas, the prices of jute fibre has fallen below the Minimum Support Price of Rs. 4,225 per quintal for TDN3 grade, said IJMA in a statement.","indiaupdated: may 24, 2020 18:58 istalready reeling under the ongoing lockdown, many jute mills in bengal have suffered structural and material losses during cyclone amphan that hit kolkata and surrounding districts on may 20.among the worst-hit mills are a few the states oldest ones located in south 24 parganas and howrah districts, raghavendra gupta, chairman indian jute mills association (ijma), told ht on sunday. set up in 1884, ijma is the apex business chamber for indias jute industry.bengal is the highest producer of jute in the country. the fresh crisis comes at a time when mills in bengal were under pressure from other states to produce bags on an emergency basis for transportation of boro rice and relief materials being supplied to people during lockdown.although there is no report of any damage to machinery, structures of the mills and stored raw jute suffered damage. we are yet to calculate the extent of loss but supplies of jute products will be definitely hit. all the 60 operational jute mills in the state had started production (with limited manpower) during the lockdown, said gupta.incidentally, last week ijma said that during the lockdown the industry suffered a nationwide loss of rs 1250 crore.the jute industry is grappling for survival after being in lockdown for over one and a half months now. already 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of production of jute goods has been lost estimated to be valued at rs.1,250 crore. with the cash flows drying up, jute mill companies are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet, ijma said in a statement on may 19.on april 3, the centre urged the bengal government to direct jute mills to resume operation in view of shortage in supply of packaging materials. in a letter, the centre said, procurement operations of foodgrain, for which availability of packaging material like jute bales are immensely required by major procuring states like punjab, harayana, uttar pradesh and madya pradesh where procurement operations will begin from april and peak season is for only two-three weeks only, the letter said.on april 5, telangana chief minister k chandrasekhar rao requested prime minister narendra modi to open jute bag manufacturing units in bengal and ensure transportation of jute bags through special goods trains to his state. rao told modi that there was a severe scarcity of bags and telangana needed 20 crore jute bags to procure paddy.the bengal government, however, issued permission to the jute mills to resume operation with limited manpower. initially, permission was given to deploy only 15 per cent people which was later increased to 50 per cent in phases.gupta told ht last week that the future of over three lakhs jute mill workers and 40 lakhs jute farmers hang in balance and if the situation persists it may result in permanent sickness and closure of mills.jute industrys loss has been plastic industrys gain. continuous dilutions under the provisions of the jute packaging act has taken place over the lockdown period. already about 3 lakh bales of orders for jute bags have been diverted to pp/ hdpe industry. if the lockdown situation continues any longer, further dilutions cannot be ruled out, ijma said in a recent statement.the damage done by amphan is going to hit relief work. this is a new crisis, said a senior state food and supplies department official who did not want to be named. the departments minister jyotipriyo mullick could not be contacted despite repeated attempts because of failure in mobile network.according to ijma, the carryover of raw jute at the end of the jute crop year 2019-20 is expected to be over 22 lakh bales. with reports of normal sowing this year, across all jute growing areas, the prices of jute fibre has fallen below the minimum support price of rs. 4,225 per quintal for tdn3 grade, said ijma in a statement."

Every year, I would get my children new clothes and gifts for the festival. They have been waiting for me to reach home, but my registration has still not been done. What does the festival mean without family and friends? Here, we get some food to live by. I have run out of money to get them anything at all when I do go back, said Yusuf, who used to work at a toy-making unit in Sadar Bazar.He had left his rented room to head back to his village in Bihars Muzaffarpur and when he could not get on a bus, was brought to the shelter by civil defence volunteers.According to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) officials, the number of migrants at the shelters has reduced to just about 10-15% since the Shramik Special trains started on May 1. The NGOs roped in to run the shelters have been providing a basket of fruit and cold drinks for iftar, for those fasting during Ramzan. They will also be distributing sweets and dry snacks on Eid, on Monday, said a senior DUSIB official, on the condition of anonymity.The official said that the DUSIB runs 223 permanent shelters for the homeless, while the Delhi government had converted 256 school buildings to house migrants.Among those stranded, at south Delhis Shahpur Jat, is a group of around 1,000 hand embroidery from West Bengal. Earlier, we were waiting for our turn for train registration and now, the trains have been cancelled because of the cyclone. There is no money to even buy fruits or milk for children. Every year, we would buy new clothes, but this is the first time that there is no such thing for Eid.

They had hoped to return home, but have been stuck. We will be distributing sevaiyan (a vermicelli-based dessert) and food for the workers here so that they at least have something to celebrate.In Delhis 87containment zones, especially in central, east, northeast and south-east districts that house a sizeable Muslim population, the festivities will be limited to the households.Prominent markets at Sadar Bazar, Nabi Karim, Chandni Mahal and Bara Hindu Rao, which are generally abuzz with activity during Ramzan, have been deserted this year.Anwar Ullah, general secretary Chandni Mahal residents welfare association, said, The lanes are empty, there is no sound. It doesnt feel like its Eid tomorrow. The sweets shops have not been opened. We have got sevaiyan to cook but dont know if other snacks will be available tomorrow.

The lanes used to be full of people shopping and gathering to exchange greetings in the days leading to the festival. The lockdown has been the longest for us. Even though there has been no new positive case, the area has not been opened. We have procured food and other decorative material for houses from Bhogal. That is all we can do now.Ali Rehman, 32, who owns a garments store in Vivek Vihar, which is part of a containment zone, said there is little to celebrate due to the losses suffered during the lockdown. For small-scale businessmen, there has been no reprieve. Many people have lost their jobs. I have never seen such calm around the festival. Since we cannot go even to the masjids, which have been closed, or to relatives houses, we will just cook and pray at home, he said.In southeast Delhis Zakir Nagar, home to a large number of Muslims, Irshad Alam, who owns a footwear store, said that the usual fervour is missing due to safety concerns on peoples minds. Even if one wishes to, there is so much apprehension that one wouldnt go out to meet their relatives. Being in a confined area, that is not even a prospect. Its like celebrating Eid inside a prison-like complex, said Alam.In nearby containment zones of Shaheen Bagh and Okhla too, people said safety is first and that they can celebrate Eid next year once the country emerges from the shadow of this pandemic.","delhiupdated: may 24, 2020 23:27 istfor stranded migrant workers and people living in containment zones, eid preparations have been limited to making do with essentials as the lockdown to contain the spread of the covid-19 pandemic has dampened the fervour of the festival.some migrants are dependent on government and ngos for food to observe the festive traditions, while others have borrowed money from friends and relatives to buy sweetmeats.mohammad yusuf, 32, resident of a shelter home in central delhi, who could not register for a shramik special train, said that this would be the first time that he is not celebrating eid at home. every year, i would get my children new clothes and gifts for the festival. they have been waiting for me to reach home, but my registration has still not been done. what does the festival mean without family and friends?

Eid al-Fitr means festival of breaking the fast and it marks the end of 30-day Ramadan. Just like Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr starts with the sighting of the new moon, and Muslims around the world await to sight the crescent moon on Ramadan 29 or Ramadan 30 to be sure of the date. The dates for Ramadan and Eid change as per the Islamic calendar. Eid is not just a time for celebrations and feasts, but also a time when one remembers Allah and thank him for all his blessings. Zakat (charity) is offered on Eid as well as throughout Ramadan, so that we get the opportunity to share our joys with those who are less fortunate.Food is one thing that binds everyone amid festivities globally. Family and friends get together, cook traditional recipes, and enjoy the feast with all their near and dear ones. From biryani, to kebabs, sheer mal and kheer, here are a few recipes that you can make to celebrate the festival.Biryani:Biryani is derived from the Persian word Birian, meaning fried before cooking. There are multiple theories about how biryani came to India, after having originated in Western Asia.One legend has it that Timur, the Turk-Mongol conqueror, brought the precursor to the biryani with him when he arrived in India in 1398. An earthen pot full of rice, spices and all available meats would be buried in a hot pit. This was then dug up and served to the warriors in Timurs army.Another legend has it that the dish was first brought to the southern Malabar coast by Arab traders who were frequent visitors there. Records of a rice dish known as Oon Soru in Tamil literature have been found dating back to as early as the year 2 A.D. Oon Soru is said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf, and was used to feed military warriors.However, the most popular story traces the origins of Biryani Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahans beautiful queen who inspired the Taj Mahal.Traditionally, the dum pukht method (slow breathing oven in Persian) of cooking biryani used. In this method, the ingredients are loaded in a pot and slow cooked over charcoal, sometimes also placed on the top of the vessel to allow the dum or steam to blend all the flavours together. The pot is sealed around the edges with dough (atta) which allows the steaming meat to tenderise in its own juices while also flavouring the layers of rice.Meat or chicken is often the main ingredient in biryani, although in some coastal varieties, fish, prawns, and crabs are also used. Vegetarians too have options such as mixed veggies, soya chunks in a veg biryani. Use of rose water, sweet edible ittar and kewra water is still prevalent in biryani cooking since the medieval era.Mughlai biryani, Hyderabadi biryani, Calcutta biryani, Dindigul biryani, Lucknowi biryani, Arcot biryani, Memoni biryani, Thalassery biryani, Kampuri biryani, Tahari biryani, Beary biryani, Sindhi biryani, Bhatkali biryani, Bombay biryani, Doodh ki biryaniare the varieties that are cooked in India across regions.Almond Mixed Grain BiryaniIngredients1/2 cup Barley washed & drained, 1/2 cup Brown rice, washed & drained, 1/2 cup Pearl Millet, washed & drained, 2 tsp Ghee, 1 tsp Garlic, Chopped, 1 tbsp Ginger, Chopped, 1 tsp Green Chilli, Chopped, 1/2 cup Baby carrots, diced 1/4 cup Onion red, sliced, 1/2 tsp Salt to Taste Black Pepper, Crushed, 7 cups Vegetable stock, 1 tsp Cumin seeds , 1 tsp Chopped Coriander, 1 tsp Chopped Spring Onion, 1/4 cup AlmondsMethodHeat ghee in a large dutch oven/pot over medium heat.

Yet he continues to enter the forest to collect honey and beeswax from the hives of wild bees, as it is a lucrative business. ( HT Photos )The nationwide lockdown had already crippled Gopal Mondol, 55, even before Cyclone Amphan hit. Every year, in April and May, he would enter the tiger-infested mangrove forest of the Sunderbans to collect honey. But this time, the forest authorities did not issue any permit. As if the lockdown was not enough to cripple us, now we have been hit by the cyclone. We have lost almost everything. Our house is gone, Mondol said.Mondol said his father, two brothers and cousins were killed by tigers. Yet he continues to enter the forest to collect honey and beeswax from the hives of wild bees, as it is a lucrative business.

The 46-year-old block development officer for South 24 Parganas in Kolkata was in charge of Sagar Island, one of the worst-hit by the cyclone that made landfall on the coastlines of Bangladesh and West Bengal on May 20. After the Indian Meteorological Department issued the warning earlier this month, Mandal supervised the rescue and relief operations with nearly 500 officials and volunteers. Together, they evacuated around 45,000 villagers from various islands and shifted them to shelters.This is not his first rehabilitation effort. He was also involved in the operations after Cyclone Fani hit Odisha in May 2019, and a few months later, Cyclone Bulbul that hit the Bengal coast. Cyclone Amphan was by far the most destructive. Now that the cyclone has passed, relief and reconstruction work has started, he said.The challenge was greater due to the coronavirus pandemic. We not only had to shift villagers to safe locations but also ensure that there was social distancing. Around 500 migrant workers who had just returned from other states had to be kept in six quarantine centres, Mandal said, adding, My family members including my parents called me frequently to ask about my safety. But there was no mobile connectivity.Doubt if our roof is intact, wish I could talk to my kinEver since she watched television footage of Cyclone Amphan battering large parts of the South 24 Parganas district, Arati Sardar, 45, has not stopped praying for her family at Chunakhali, a remote gram panchayat area in the Sunderbans.I tried calling my husband and daughter. Their phones have not rung even once in five days. One of our relatives from another part of the district told me that there is no electricity and mobile phone towers have collapsed. I cannot take this anxiety anymore, Sardar said.A lot of people have died, they said on television, she added.The 45- year-old homemaker started taking a train to Kolkata to work as a domestic help when her husband, a mason, lost his job because of his excessive drinking, three years ago.Ever since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25, Sardar has been stranded at her employers home in Gariahat, south Kolkata. Her son, also a migrant worker, is stuck in Bengaluru where he recently underwent a kidney operation.The roof of our home is covered by an asbestos sheet. I doubt it is intact. We have some date palm, mango, banana and other trees on a small piece of land. The orchard must be ravaged. I wish I could talk to my husband once, Sardar said.Such calamites can come again... need to be ready: Septuagenarian hails renewable sources of energyAt a time when Madurdaha, a residential neighbourhood in east Kolkata plunged into darkness as Cylcone Amphan tore into Bengal and Bangladeshs coastlines and high tension electric wires snapped at grid supply sites, Choudhurys house enjoyed uninterrupted power supply. ( HT Photos/Joydeep Thakur )Septuagenarian SP Gon Choudhury and his wife Swapna, 69, live in their own house in east Kolkata with two domestic helps. Their son, an engineer, lives in London while their daughter, a doctor, lives in Australia.Choudhury, a former government employee is a renewable energy expert and received the Green Oscar award in 2003. And thus, at a time when Madurdaha, a residential neighbourhood in east Kolkata plunged into darkness as Cylcone Amphan tore into Bengal and Bangladeshs coastlines and high tension electric wires snapped at grid supply sites, Choudhurys house enjoyed uninterrupted power supply.Choudhury installed a rooftop solar panel in 2018, which produces 1 kilowatt of power when the sun shines  enough to operate a small pump to fill the overhead tank in emergency, apart from running lights, fans and even charge mobile phones.

Most of the migrant workers employed at these kilns stayed back when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown after the 'Junta Curfew' on May 22.The brick kiln industry has often been pulled up for not standing by its contractual workforce and leaving them with bare minimum resources coupled with unhealthy living and work conditions. But, contrary to the abysmal standard, many kiln owners have reached out to their workers and provided then with ration and the basic needs till some normalcy returns.Bacchi Devi, who works at the Bengal Brick Field in Hooghly's Adhishaptgram and hails from Sapora village in Bihar, says she can't believe how things have changed in a jiffy.

There are about 3,000 migrant workers in Corporation relief centers in the city, waiting to go back home.""When we began intensifying the operations to send these workers back home, the word spread very quickly. Migrant workers from in and around Chennai, neighboring districts and even neighboring states walked all the way to the city, seeking to return to their states,"" said Meghanath Reddy, Deputy Commissioner (Revenue &Finance).So far, 79 trains have been operated from Chennai to 17 different states. Among this, most number of trains were operated to Bihar (22) followed by Uttar Pradesh (14), Jharkhand (9) and six trains each to Assam, Odisha and West Bengal.""All of these trains were operated between May 9 and June 7. Each of the train costed anywhere between Rs 11 and 20 lakh. We have spent close to Rs 10 crore on transporting them. We provide them with water and food for the complete journey,"" said Meghanath.Another Corporation official added that they do not have exact number of the remaining migrant workers. ""A lot of them are now reluctant to go back since the economy has kick started and they got back their jobs.We are expecting only about 25 per cent of the migrant workers wanting to go home are remaining now. There is no official count since some of them have not registered at all, and those who registered, have registered multiple times. But we are positive that we can send the rest of them very soon.""Challenges faced by civic bodyThe civic body faced numerous challenges while co-ordinating the whole exercise.

""As soon as the government announced that travel can begin, everyone grew restless. Some of them left and started walking back home. Most challenging part was to convince them to stay, because if they don't more number of people will leave,"" said Hari.Another issue is that the Corporation sends a text message of the confirmed ticket to the migrant workers. Instead of just them coming, they get their acquaintances too requesting to go back home. So, instead of 500 people who have confirmed train tickets, 5,000 would be waiting at the station. However, currently according to Corporation officials, comparatively very few migrant workers are left and efforts are on to send them back home.","kv navya byexpress news servicechennai: while the stories about migrant workers walking back to their homes, sleeping outside railway stations and bus stops, continue to pour in, the chennai corporation on the other hand has sent more than 1 lakh guest workers back home.according to official records, the civic body in collaboration with greater chennai police and railways, has facilitated travel of 1,10,134 guest workers to different states including bihar, uttar pradesh, odisha and assam among others. there are about 3,000 migrant workers in corporation relief centers in the city, waiting to go back home.""when we began intensifying the operations to send these workers back home, the word spread very quickly. migrant workers from in and around chennai, neighboring districts and even neighboring states walked all the way to the city, seeking to return to their states,"" said meghanath reddy, deputy commissioner (revenue &finance).so far, 79 trains have been operated from chennai to 17 different states. among this, most number of trains were operated to bihar (22) followed by uttar pradesh (14), jharkhand (9) and six trains each to assam, odisha and west bengal.""all of these trains were operated between may 9 and june 7. each of the train costed anywhere between rs 11 and 20 lakh. we have spent close to rs 10 crore on transporting them. we provide them with water and food for the complete journey,"" said meghanath.another corporation official added that they do not have exact number of the remaining migrant workers.

Sinha and secretaries of food and civil supplies, agriculture, oil, non-conventional energy, and MSME, on Wednesday.Presently our ethanol production is  20,000 crore and imports are  6-7 lakh crore. So now we are planning to make ethanol economy of  1 lakh crore, he said adding there are 200 closed sugar factories which can be converted for bio-ethanol production.He added that in states like Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, there is a need to change the crop pattern and reduce the acreage of wheat and rice.In Punjab and Haryana, we do not have a place for storage also...So this a bad situation for the country. On one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage, Mr. Gadkari said.Further, he said that India imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth  90,000 crore as Indias oilseed production is not up to the mark.He said that soybean production per acre in the US and Brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in India, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre.There is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added.Talking about PPE kits, which are in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in India has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day.I have requested (Commerce and Industry Minister) Piyush Goyal ji that please give us permission to export PPE kits because we have got tremendous capacity now, he said.Similarly, Mr. Gadkari said, India has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders.On developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the World Bank to make Delhi -Mathura-Agra-Itawah-Allahabad-Varanasi waterway and though this Delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to Myanmar and southeast Asia.Further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata and develop smart cities and villages.He added that India needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here.My target for two years is for making roads of  15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me.

On one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage, Gadkari said.Further, he said that India imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth Rs 90,000 crore as Indias oilseed production is not up to the mark.He said that soybean production per acre in the US and Brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in India, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre.There is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added.Talking about PPE kits, which are in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in India has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day.I have requested (Commerce and Industry Minister) Piyush Goyal ji that please give us permission to export PPE kits because we have got tremendous capacity now, he said.Similarly, Gadkari said, India has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders.On developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the World Bank to make Delhi -Mathura-Agra-Itawah-Allahabad-Varanasi waterway and though this Delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to Myanmar and southeast Asia.Further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata and develop smart cities and villages.He added that India needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here.My target for two years is for making roads of Rs 15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me. M toll income is Rs 28000 crore per year. By the end of March, I am expecting Rs 40,000 crore and within five years, my toll income of NHAI will be Rs one lakh crore, he added.FDI can be allowed in NBFCs and I feel that can be a good route. We need to go to RBI and finance to find out the way to give permission for that, he said.","indiaupdated: jun 11, 2020 15:38 istthe governments minimum support prices for agriculture crops are way higher then domestic market prices and international rates, union minister nitin gadkari said on thursday as he stressed on finding alternative solutions before an economic crisis is created.while the government fixes the rate, called minimum support price or msp, at which it buys crops such as wheat and paddy from farmers, it also provides a subsidy to help export sugar.the most important problem in this sector is that (among) the international price for agriculture commodities and the market price and the msp, there is a vast difference. now there are a lot of problems, some political problems are also there. it is very difficult for the government to take decisions.but the ground reality is that our msp is higher than the market price and international price. so this is now going to create a big economic crisis for the country.we need to find out some options, alternatives for that, and without resolving that issue in agriculture, we cannot accelerate our economy because maximum purchasing power where we need to increase the potential in agriculture, gadkari said in a webinar.he said that the country has surplus rice and wheat and there is a problem of storage of these grains.also, the government provided rs 6,000 crore subsidy to export 60 lakh tonnes of sugar as the country is surplus in the sweetener, he said.the msme and transport minister said: in the agriculture area, there are some serious problems we are facing, we have surplus rice and wheat....we do not have a place for storage. it is totally full. we are surplus in rice and wheat for three years.gadkari also said that he has suggested for the formulation of a policy on converting rice into ethanol or bio-ethanol.he suggested this in a meeting with top officials, including principal advisor to prime minister p k sinha and secretaries of food and civil supplies, agriculture, oil, non-conventional energy, and msme, on wednesday.presently our ethanol production is rs 20,000 crore and imports are rs 6-7 lakh crore. so now we are planning to make ethanol economy of rs 1 lakh crore, he said adding there are 200 closed sugar factories which can be converted for bio-ethanol production.he added that in states like punjab, haryana and some parts of uttar pradesh, there is a need to change the crop pattern and reduce the acreage of wheat and rice.in punjab and haryana, we do not have a place for storage also...so this a bad situation for the country. on one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage, gadkari said.further, he said that india imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth rs 90,000 crore as indias oilseed production is not up to the mark.he said that soybean production per acre in the us and brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in india, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre.there is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added.talking about ppe kits, which are in demand due to the covid-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in india has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day.i have requested (commerce and industry minister) piyush goyal ji that please give us permission to export ppe kits because we have got tremendous capacity now, he said.similarly, gadkari said, india has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders.on developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the world bank to make delhi -mathura-agra-itawah-allahabad-varanasi waterway and though this delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to myanmar and southeast asia.further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like delhi, mumbai, chennai, bengaluru, and kolkata and develop smart cities and villages.he added that india needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here.my target for two years is for making roads of rs 15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me. m toll income is rs 28000 crore per year. by the end of march, i am expecting rs 40,000 crore and within five years, my toll income of nhai will be rs one lakh crore, he added.fdi can be allowed in nbfcs and i feel that can be a good route. we need to go to rbi and finance to find out the way to give permission for that, he said."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)AHEAD of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing a 21-day countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, long queues had formed on highways of trucks carrying essential goods and commodities, including medicines, milk, fruits and vegetables, by Tuesday, hours into several states sealing borders. While goods trains fall in the exempted category, freight services too were hit as states did not mention Railways as essential service in their respective orders.With confusion at the lower levels about exemptions, transport even within states was hit. Big online grocers such as Grofers and Big Basket too were left scrambling to ensure sustenance of their supply chains.Grofers CEO Albinder Dhindsa tweeted that their warehouse in Faridabad had been shut by officials, while Big Basket announced on its mobile app that they were not operational due to restrictions.

The government has locked everything down. Trucks are not being allowed to ply on roads If the transport chain breaks, it poses danger to the supply of essential commodities, he said, adding that drivers too were panicking, abandoning trucks at state borders to head to their native villages and towns. Once they go away, it is very difficult to get them back, he said.The situation is further complicated because rail and air transport too is almost entirely shut down.

If they dont work half day on Sundays, their salaries are deducted. They earn Rs 300 for eight hours of work and Rs 500 for 12 hours (four hours overtime) per day. The workers are paid Rs 13,000-15,000 per month, it said.The report further stated that the money required for their ration/food is borne by the workers themselves. The price of rice, vegetables, pulses and wheat has risen by Rs 10-20 due to the lockdown. This puts strain on workers who are expected to purchase their own ration, it stated.The living conditions in labor colonies are also in contravention to WHOs guidelines including social distancing and use of preventive gear.Each room within the colony houses 10-15 workers. Social distancing is impossible to practice within these confines. Workers are expected to sleep and cook within the same room. There are no fans. Due to poor ventilation there is no air circulation. Some colonies lack adequate lighting and face long power cuts.Garbage has not been cleared in weeks and piles of garbage make the place unhygienic. There is a fear of snakes in some of the labour colonies. Workers do not have access to masks/soap/sanitiser/gloves during the lockdown period. On average, two functional bathrooms are available for around 150 workers. These bathrooms are prone to clogging and do not have adequate supply of water, the report said.The report further stated that most labour colonies are spread across the city in the most obscure places - often in dilapidated buildings, makeshift rooms, which are hidden from public view. There are usually 12-20 workers in a 10X10 feet room, sometimes smaller, poorly ventilated with no storage facilities. Workers are also expected to cook in these rooms. Workers share common bathrooms and toilets.The report suggested that the BBMP, health department, BMRCL and labour department conduct an urgent survey of workers, inspection of BMRCL and contractors of construction companies in each colonies, waiver room rent, provide food materials and drinking water as well as provide sanitation and health facilities.

We have already said that we will support whatever decision the Centre takes in this regard. The PM also said the next two weeks are going to be very crucial and critical. I told the PM that there should korakori (strict enforcement), but no barabari (overzealousness), the CM said at Nabanna.Mamatas humane lockdown will be a mix of restrictions and relaxations, but different from curfew. Under the lockdown regulations in Bengal, people will have to stay home and maintain social-distancing while going to the market, medicine shop, grocery or ration shop to buy essentials.Schools and colleges, however, will remain shut till June 10.There is no need to go to the market at a particular hour in the morning because they will remain open from 10 am to 6 pm, the CM said. The state administration will use drones to check if people are crowding at markets.To ease supply of essentials, home delivery of goods will be allowed while flour mills, oil mills and bakeries will be allowed to resume operations, but in a sanitised manner, to ensure availability of commodities. There will also be a few taxis on the roads for people to avail in emergency.There will, however, be a total ban on crowding of streets and on gatherings of all sorts, including religious ones. I will not be going to the Kali temple the night before Poila Boisakh (Bengali New Year day on April 15). This will be the first time in my life that I wont be visiting the Kali temple on the day. I urge all of you to celebrate the Bengali New Year at home, Banerjee said.The CMs announcement came after a letter from the Union ministry of home affairs addressed to the state chief secretary pointed to lax enforcement of lockdown in certain areas.With an eye on the coming harvesting season in a state that contributes 17% to the countrys total rice produce, the CM gave relaxations for harvesting of boro and rabi crops. She also allowed tea gardens to resume operations with 25% of their labour force. Small-scale units and MSMEs will also be allowed to start operations if they have space to house the workers on their campus, Banerjee said.The government, however, would tighten containment measures in areas across the state where people have tested positive for Covid-19, the CM said.We are into an elaborate microplanning to zoom into these areas. These areas can be a multi-storied building, a lane or bylane. I have spoken to Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim. The KMC will sanitise the wards, one after another. We are not going to cordon off the entire area. There are reports indicating that large areas such as Burrabazar, Bagbazar, Parnashree, Bagri Market, the whole of Howrah will be cordoned off. These are all baseless. Markets will remain open but may be scattered to prevent overcrowding. We have asked for 50,000 testing kits from the Centre to ramp up random tests in these sensitive areas. How can we follow the revised ICMR guidelines if we dont get the kits? the CM said.Banerjee also seized the opportunity during the video-conference with the PM to demand a Rs 10-lakh crore financial package for states to help them tackle the Covid pandemic. The Centre has released Rs 1.7 lakh crore for this purpose. The amount is less than even 1% of Indias GDP. Other Covid-hit countries like US has allocated 10% of its GDP, UK 15% and Japan 20% of its GDP to fight the virus, she said. This apart, the CM wants the Centre to clear Rs 36,000 crore it owes to the state and grant a Rs 25,000 crore financial package for Bengal in view of its high debt-servicing component. Banerjee pointed out that the Centre is yet to keep its GST promise to states and release Rs 2,393 crore on account of GST from December to March.","cm mamata banerjeekolkata: chief minister mamata banerjee said on saturday that she will go along with prime minister narendra modi over his proposal to extend the covid-19 lockdown in the country for another two weeks till april 30, but emphasised that she would enforce the shutdown in bengal with a human face to balance life and livelihood.the pm, during the video-conference, said the lockdown will be extended till april 30. we have already said that we will support whatever decision the centre takes in this regard. the pm also said the next two weeks are going to be very crucial and critical. i told the pm that there should korakori (strict enforcement), but no barabari (overzealousness), the cm said at nabanna.mamatas humane lockdown will be a mix of restrictions and relaxations, but different from curfew. under the lockdown regulations in bengal, people will have to stay home and maintain social-distancing while going to the market, medicine shop, grocery or ration shop to buy essentials.schools and colleges, however, will remain shut till june 10.there is no need to go to the market at a particular hour in the morning because they will remain open from 10 am to 6 pm, the cm said. the state administration will use drones to check if people are crowding at markets.to ease supply of essentials, home delivery of goods will be allowed while flour mills, oil mills and bakeries will be allowed to resume operations, but in a sanitised manner, to ensure availability of commodities. there will also be a few taxis on the roads for people to avail in emergency.there will, however, be a total ban on crowding of streets and on gatherings of all sorts, including religious ones. i will not be going to the kali temple the night before poila boisakh (bengali new year day on april 15). this will be the first time in my life that i wont be visiting the kali temple on the day. i urge all of you to celebrate the bengali new year at home, banerjee said.the cms announcement came after a letter from the union ministry of home affairs addressed to the state chief secretary pointed to lax enforcement of lockdown in certain areas.with an eye on the coming harvesting season in a state that contributes 17% to the countrys total rice produce, the cm gave relaxations for harvesting of boro and rabi crops. she also allowed tea gardens to resume operations with 25% of their labour force. small-scale units and msmes will also be allowed to start operations if they have space to house the workers on their campus, banerjee said.the government, however, would tighten containment measures in areas across the state where people have tested positive for covid-19, the cm said.we are into an elaborate microplanning to zoom into these areas. these areas can be a multi-storied building, a lane or bylane. i have spoken to kolkata mayor firhad hakim. the kmc will sanitise the wards, one after another. we are not going to cordon off the entire area. there are reports indicating that large areas such as burrabazar, bagbazar, parnashree, bagri market, the whole of howrah will be cordoned off. these are all baseless. markets will remain open but may be scattered to prevent overcrowding. we have asked for 50,000 testing kits from the centre to ramp up random tests in these sensitive areas. how can we follow the revised icmr guidelines if we dont get the kits? the cm said.banerjee also seized the opportunity during the video-conference with the pm to demand a rs 10-lakh crore financial package for states to help them tackle the covid pandemic. the centre has released rs 1.7 lakh crore for this purpose. the amount is less than even 1% of indias gdp. other covid-hit countries like us has allocated 10% of its gdp, uk 15% and japan 20% of its gdp to fight the virus, she said. this apart, the cm wants the centre to clear rs 36,000 crore it owes to the state and grant a rs 25,000 crore financial package for bengal in view of its high debt-servicing component. banerjee pointed out that the centre is yet to keep its gst promise to states and release rs 2,393 crore on account of gst from december to march."

In 2018-19, as many as 163,555 vehicles crossed the land port and the passenger count was 23,54,962.As soon as the lockdown was announced, all drivers already at Benapole were told to leave the trucks and return to the Indian side. It was the same with Bangladeshi drivers. They too returned, leaving their vehicles. There are 100 loaded Indian trucks across the border while 30 Bangladeshi trucks are at Petrapole.Ajay Sahai, Director General and CEO, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, told The Indian Express over phone: We stand with the nation and the central and state governments at this time, fighting COVID-19. However, we have written to Chairman of Land Ports Authority and other agencies in India. As per orders and notifications of the government, ports  land, sea, air  and related activities and movement of cargo trucks to and from ports have been categorized under essential services.

There should be a proper medical team at the port. Nothing is moving here. The association has also written to the West Bengal Chief Secretary, seeking a medical unit for the land port.Pradip Kumar Dey, an exporter in Bongaon, said: The entire business chain will be hurt since the trucks are stranded. For instance, we deal in jute seeds. There are over 50 trucks with more than 1,000 tonnes of jute seeds stuck on the Indian side. Bangladesh farmers just have a little over a week to sow them. If the seeds do not reach in time, jute cultivation in Bangladesh will be hit. Bangladesh supplies jute to mills in India, and these will be hit. Lakhs of jute mill workers will be affected. All agencies should allow us to export and end the logjam.At No. 44 bus stand in Bongaon, near the CITU office, a group has gathered. Truck owners are not paying salaries to drivers and helpers. They say no payments unless goods are delivered. We are trying to provide ration to the drivers. So far, we have been able to help over 200 drivers, but there are so many, Ananda Biswas, a leader of the Janpath Paribahan Mazdoor Union, said.Local Trinamool Congress leaders have a different take though.

2020-05-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ck-narayana-from-indian-institute-of-horticultural-research-gives-jackfruit-a-make-over/article31581990.ece,"How a scientist developed jackfruit juice, chocolates and cookies","The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), in Bengaluru has developed a technology to make jackfruit juice, chocolates and cookies. It took me three years of research to develop this technique, says CK Narayana, Principal Scientist, and Former Head of the Division of Post Harvest Technology, IIHR, Hessaraghatta.Jackfruit, unlike the mango, was largely ignored until a few years ago. Jackfruit is believed to have originated in the Western Ghats and finds mention in traditional systems of medicine, says Narayana. Its benefits are varied. 100 grams of jackfruit bulbs provide 95 calories of energy, which is better than honey. The fruit is made of soft, easily digestible flesh with simple sugars such as fructose and sucrose that replenish energy instantly.Narayana spoke to MetroPlus on what makes jackfruit special. Excerpts:How much jackfruit is grown in India?As per the National Horticulture Board Statistics, we produce 1.74 million tonnes annually. Tripura, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand produce more than one lakh tonnes. Most are natural hybrids and each has a unique taste and texture. Many farmers grow jackfruit in their field bunds or backyards for their consumption. Huge quantities come from forests where they grow wild.Could you talk about the field gene bank?IIHR Bengaluru, a subsidiary of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), is a National Active Germplasm Site (NAGS) for jackfruit. We maintain a collection of more than 75 types collected from all over India. This is a continuous process and we keep enriching our gene bank. We help custodian farmers who have been conserving jackfruit trees in their homes or orchards for several generations. We recognise and reward these farmers, and also spread these rare types among other farmers and growers.Arka HalasurasWas jackfruit always a part of our traditional diet?Long ago, before India became self-sufficient in food grains, people from Kerala, coastal Karnataka, and Maharashtra used to boil jackfruit seeds and eat them during the rainy season or drought as no other food was available. After rice and wheat was made available in plenty, post the Green Revolution, people stopped eating jackfruit seed as it was seen as a symbol of poverty. Over the last few years, jackfruit started getting attention from global scientists, policy makers and farmers.What is IIHR doing to build awareness of the nutritional benefits of jackfruit?We have been organising jackfruit diversity shows for the last three years. I have also started researching ways and means to use every part of the fruit (edible flake, seeds and rind). As part of this project, I developed three products using jackfruit seeds, one from the pulp and one animal feed formulation using the rind.Could you tell us about the products you have developed?I have developed a process to make a ready-to-drink beverage, without added sugar or acid that can be stored for up to six months at room temperature without any preservative. We also have a process by which jackfruit seeds can be converted into flour that can be stored for up to one year. At IIHR, we have standardised the optimum ratio to be blended into rice or wheat without the taste being compromised. After our laboratory trials, we collaborated with a food processing industry (an IIHR off-site incubatee) in Mangaluru district to introduce this into the market as ready-to-eat chapatis.We have also developed a jackfruit seed chocolate, where the seed flour is blended with other food additives and non-sugar sweeteners and wrapped in chocolate. The jackfruit comprises almost 50% of the weight of each chocolate, reducing the calorific value by one-third, while raising its mineral content, as the fruit seed is rich in iron, zinc and calcium and other phytochemicals.Arka JackolateThe seed flour-based cookies we developed have 10% lesser calories and high amounts of iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc compared to the commercially available cookies. The licence to manufacture the cookies has been given to an entrepreneur in Shivamogga in Karnataka. Production will begin once lockdown is lifted.What are the nutritional benefits of jackfruit?Jackfruit is a wonderful gift of nature. The ripe fruit is a delicious dessert, while the unripe one can be cooked as a vegetable, as it has crude as well as dietary fibre. The seed is rich in resistant starch and phytochemicals that have medicinal properties.","the indian institute of horticultural research (iihr), in bengaluru has developed a technology to make jackfruit juice, chocolates and cookies. it took me three years of research to develop this technique, says ck narayana, principal scientist, and former head of the division of post harvest technology, iihr, hessaraghatta.jackfruit, unlike the mango, was largely ignored until a few years ago. jackfruit is believed to have originated in the western ghats and finds mention in traditional systems of medicine, says narayana. its benefits are varied. 100 grams of jackfruit bulbs provide 95 calories of energy, which is better than honey. the fruit is made of soft, easily digestible flesh with simple sugars such as fructose and sucrose that replenish energy instantly.narayana spoke to metroplus on what makes jackfruit special. excerpts:how much jackfruit is grown in india?as per the national horticulture board statistics, we produce 1.74 million tonnes annually. tripura, odisha, assam, west bengal, karnataka, kerala, chhattisgarh and jharkhand produce more than one lakh tonnes. most are natural hybrids and each has a unique taste and texture. many farmers grow jackfruit in their field bunds or backyards for their consumption. huge quantities come from forests where they grow wild.could you talk about the field gene bank?iihr bengaluru, a subsidiary of indian council of agricultural research (icar), is a national active germplasm site (nags) for jackfruit. we maintain a collection of more than 75 types collected from all over india. this is a continuous process and we keep enriching our gene bank. we help custodian farmers who have been conserving jackfruit trees in their homes or orchards for several generations. we recognise and reward these farmers, and also spread these rare types among other farmers and growers.arka halasuraswas jackfruit always a part of our traditional diet?long ago, before india became self-sufficient in food grains, people from kerala, coastal karnataka, and maharashtra used to boil jackfruit seeds and eat them during the rainy season or drought as no other food was available. after rice and wheat was made available in plenty, post the green revolution, people stopped eating jackfruit seed as it was seen as a symbol of poverty. over the last few years, jackfruit started getting attention from global scientists, policy makers and farmers.what is iihr doing to build awareness of the nutritional benefits of jackfruit?we have been organising jackfruit diversity shows for the last three years. i have also started researching ways and means to use every part of the fruit (edible flake, seeds and rind). as part of this project, i developed three products using jackfruit seeds, one from the pulp and one animal feed formulation using the rind.could you tell us about the products you have developed?i have developed a process to make a ready-to-drink beverage, without added sugar or acid that can be stored for up to six months at room temperature without any preservative. we also have a process by which jackfruit seeds can be converted into flour that can be stored for up to one year. at iihr, we have standardised the optimum ratio to be blended into rice or wheat without the taste being compromised. after our laboratory trials, we collaborated with a food processing industry (an iihr off-site incubatee) in mangaluru district to introduce this into the market as ready-to-eat chapatis.we have also developed a jackfruit seed chocolate, where the seed flour is blended with other food additives and non-sugar sweeteners and wrapped in chocolate. the jackfruit comprises almost 50% of the weight of each chocolate, reducing the calorific value by one-third, while raising its mineral content, as the fruit seed is rich in iron, zinc and calcium and other phytochemicals.arka jackolatethe seed flour-based cookies we developed have 10% lesser calories and high amounts of iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc compared to the commercially available cookies. the licence to manufacture the cookies has been given to an entrepreneur in shivamogga in karnataka. production will begin once lockdown is lifted.what are the nutritional benefits of jackfruit?jackfruit is a wonderful gift of nature. the ripe fruit is a delicious dessert, while the unripe one can be cooked as a vegetable, as it has crude as well as dietary fibre. the seed is rich in resistant starch and phytochemicals that have medicinal properties."

Till then, his holiday destination had reported only two cases of coronavirus. While on the trip, they were informed that Indians there were not allowed to return to their own country. Since then, the family has been stranded. After being unable to avail hotel accommodation, they rented an apartment in Turkey and have been living there since.Amit is among the 200 Indians or more who have been stuck in Turkey for more than a month now, as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus there exceed 1,50,000, as per reports.Amit Jain and his family in Turkey Amit Jain and his family in TurkeyAs a Jain family, Amit, his wife, three children and parents, are cooking their own food at their rented flat, he told indianexpress.com.

Our average daily expenditure amounts to 100-110 dollars, he said.While the Ministry of Civil Aviation announced evacuation flights as part of the Vande Bharat Mission to bring back stranded Indians, Turkey is yet to make it to the list of the countries, even in the second phase of the operation (scheduled for May).

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee earlier on Thursday said she would ask Modi to visit the state and witness the devastation for himself.He will conduct aerial surveys and take part in review meetings, where aspects of relief and rehabilitation will be discussed,"" the PMO said in a tweet on Thursday.Cyclone Amphan has left 72 people dead and thousands homeless in West Bengal, battering several parts of the state and washing away bridges and swamping low-lying areas. It also wreaked havoc in Odisha damaging power and telecom infrastructure in several coastal districts.The extremely severe cyclonic storm has weakened and moved to Bangladesh, said the India Meterological Department (IMD).The fiercest cyclone to hit Bengal in 100 years destroyed mud houses and crops, and uprooted trees and electric poles. It also wreaked havoc in Odisha damaging power and telecom infrastructure in several coastal districts. The Odisha government officials estimated that the cyclone has affected around 44.8 lakh people in the state.So far as per the reports we have received, 72 people have died in the state due to Cyclone Amphan. Two districts -- North and South 24 Pargana -- are completely devastated. We have to rebuild those districts from scratch. I would urge the Central government to extend all help to the state, said Banerjee after conducting a review meeting with officials.I will visit the affected areas very soon. The restoration work will start soon. A large part of North and South 24 Parganas and Kolkata are facing massive power cut since last evening. Even telephone and mobile connections are down, she said.I have never witnessed such a fierce cyclone and destruction in my life. I would request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come and visit Cyclone Amphan-affected areas, she said, also announcing a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh for the family members of each of the deceased.Modi's first visit outside Delhi since lockdownThis will be Modis first visit outside the national capital after the coronavirus lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24.Sources in the government said Modi will first reach Bengal in the morning and then go to Odisha in the afternoon.Besides North and South 24 Parganas and Kolkata, the districts of East Midnapore and Howrah were the worst hit in Bengal as portions of several dilapidated buildings came crashing down in several places.The death toll included 17 from North 24 Parganas, 15 from Kolkata, 10 from Basirhat and four from the South 24 Parganas-Sunderban region, officials said.Senior officials of the state government said it was too early to estimate the exact death toll or damage to property as the worst hit areas were still not accessible.In a series of tweets on Thursday, Modi said no stone will be left unturned in helping those affected by cyclone Amphan.Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan, he tweeted.Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan. In this challenging hour, the entire nation stands in solidarity with West Bengal. Praying for the well-being of the people of the state. Efforts are on to ensure normalcy.  Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 21, 2020Modi said National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams are working in the cyclone-affected parts. Top officials are closely monitoring the situation and also working in close coordination with the West Bengal government. No stone will be left unturned in helping the affected, he added.Modi said his thoughts are also with the people of Odisha as the state bravely battles the effects of the cyclone. He said authorities are working on the ground to ensure all possible assistance to those affected. ""I pray that the situation normalises at the earliest,"" he said.Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Banjerjee and assured them of all central help.The IMD said the cyclone has weakened significantly and moved to Bangladesh where 10 people have been killed.Bengal districts 'devastated'Banerjee, who has been monitoring the situation at state secretariat Nabanna since Tuesday night, said the impact of Amphan was ""worse than coronavirus"".Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim said more than 14 lakh people in the city are living without electricity since Wednesday night.

2020-06-18,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/prices-of-essentials-burn-hole-in-pocket/articleshow/76432720.cms,WB: Prices of essentials burn hole in pocket,"The hike in diesel price has its most immediate effect on vegetables.TimesView Amphans after-effects have added to the chaos in the supply chain. But a solution must be found. The entire effect of the disruption is often passed on to consumers and they need to be protected.KOLKATA: The Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, then Cyclone Amphan and now a hike in diesel price have come as successive blows for citizens, forcing them to cut more corners just to stay afloat. The spike in the price of diesel, which drives buses and trucks, has had a rippling effect on the cost of living of citizens at this difficult time. While bus operators are demanding higher fares, consecutive hikes in diesel price has also caused an upswing in the prices of essentials too.Since June 1, diesel price has risen to Rs 70.33 per litre  a substantial rise of Rs 5 per litre  and is likely to affect cost of living in every aspect. The cost of operation of a truck or a bus has risen by 30% due to this. Thus, almost every commodity will be costlier. The impact on essentials, however, is immediate as people consume them on a daily basis, said Tarun Biswas, a truck operator.It is a tight-rope walk with the steady rise of prices of essentials and salary cuts. We have cut corners to strike a balance. But even then, running a kitchen is getting costlier every day. Even a small rise in prices of essentials hits us hard, said Arup Ghosh, who works with a soft-drinks bottling plant. His salary was slashed by 30%.The spike has been seen across categories, but is the most significant in case of edible oil and spices. In the edible oil market, a spike in price of one oil affects the price of another. Because of border issues, import of crude rice-bran oil from Bangladesh was affected. This left most of the refineries idle. Now the shortage of edible oil has pushed up the prices of other oils, like mustard and soya, said Biswanath Agarwal , general secretary Posta Merchants Welfare Association.If the spike in diesel rate has led to rise in prices of essentials, rising labour cost has refused to flatten the price-curve of commodities that are now easily available. The higher labour cost for loading and unloading prevented retailers from reducing price of some commodities. The wholesale price of these commodities have dipped, but that has not been reflected in retail rates, said Gobindo Naskar, a trader at Kidderpore market.The hike in diesel price has its most immediate effect on vegetables. After Amphan, diesel price is the second successive blow to vegetable vendors. The cost of transportation has suddenly jumped. Though the production has stabilized, higher transportation cost inhibited many from taking vegetables to city markets. They are afraid vegetables will be unsold and they would have to distress sell the produce, said Kamal Dey, president West Bengal Vegetable Vendors Association.","the hike in diesel price has its most immediate effect on vegetables.timesview amphans after-effects have added to the chaos in the supply chain. but a solution must be found. the entire effect of the disruption is often passed on to consumers and they need to be protected.kolkata: the covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, then cyclone amphan and now a hike in diesel price have come as successive blows for citizens, forcing them to cut more corners just to stay afloat. the spike in the price of diesel, which drives buses and trucks, has had a rippling effect on the cost of living of citizens at this difficult time. while bus operators are demanding higher fares, consecutive hikes in diesel price has also caused an upswing in the prices of essentials too.since june 1, diesel price has risen to rs 70.33 per litre  a substantial rise of rs 5 per litre  and is likely to affect cost of living in every aspect. the cost of operation of a truck or a bus has risen by 30% due to this. thus, almost every commodity will be costlier. the impact on essentials, however, is immediate as people consume them on a daily basis, said tarun biswas, a truck operator.it is a tight-rope walk with the steady rise of prices of essentials and salary cuts. we have cut corners to strike a balance. but even then, running a kitchen is getting costlier every day. even a small rise in prices of essentials hits us hard, said arup ghosh, who works with a soft-drinks bottling plant. his salary was slashed by 30%.the spike has been seen across categories, but is the most significant in case of edible oil and spices. in the edible oil market, a spike in price of one oil affects the price of another. because of border issues, import of crude rice-bran oil from bangladesh was affected. this left most of the refineries idle. now the shortage of edible oil has pushed up the prices of other oils, like mustard and soya, said biswanath agarwal , general secretary posta merchants welfare association.if the spike in diesel rate has led to rise in prices of essentials, rising labour cost has refused to flatten the price-curve of commodities that are now easily available. the higher labour cost for loading and unloading prevented retailers from reducing price of some commodities. the wholesale price of these commodities have dipped, but that has not been reflected in retail rates, said gobindo naskar, a trader at kidderpore market.the hike in diesel price has its most immediate effect on vegetables. after amphan, diesel price is the second successive blow to vegetable vendors. the cost of transportation has suddenly jumped. though the production has stabilized, higher transportation cost inhibited many from taking vegetables to city markets. they are afraid vegetables will be unsold and they would have to distress sell the produce, said kamal dey, president west bengal vegetable vendors association."

2020-06-29,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/national-statistics-day-remembering-pc-mahalanobis/story-YuxqIJuoJu5tubCrZ2FEWI.html,National Statistics Day: Remembering PC Mahalanobis,"analysisUpdated: Jun 29, 2020 11:37 ISTDuring the communal riots in Delhi in 1947, many people from a minority community took refuge in Red Fort. The government had no count of the number of refugees, and contractors responsible to feed them charged high amounts. A team from the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) solved the problem. They felt that the contractors would have inflated the amount of rice and pulses, but had no reason to do so with salt as it was cheap. So, they divided the quantities of rice, pulses and salt used per day to feed all the refugees (according to the contractors) by the respective per capita requirements of these commodities, and got three estimates of the number of refugees. The estimate obtained by salt was the smallest and estimate from the rice was the largest  rice being the most expensive one, its quantity was probably exaggerated. They proposed the quantity obtained from salt as an estimate of the number of refugees. The method was verified as feasible in the case of the refugees at the site of Humayuns Tomb.The salt experiment is attributed to JM Sengupta  an associate of Professor Prashanta Chandra Mahalanobis. Did Mahalanobis have any role in developing the idea? I asked many people, but couldnt get a conclusive answer. However, its hard to believe that it was possible to conduct such a non-standard experiment in that era without discussing it with Mahalanobis. However, it illustrates that statistics is beyond data or methodology.Through decades of tireless effort and leadership, Mahalanobis built a strong statistical culture in India. He did world-class research on statistical theories and methodologies, carried out surveys, spotted and nurtured young scientists, established the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI)  a mighty monument of his handicraft, founded and nurtured Sankhy  the Indian Journal of Statistics, organised various statistical conferences, initiated teaching and training in statistics in the country, guided applications of statistics in various policy-decisions, let young talents, including future Nobel and Abel laureates blossom, and hosted world-class foreign scientists for academic interactions. An incredible achievement in one lifetime. Today is National Statistics Day today, the birthday of Professor Mahalanobis.As the president of the 1950 Science Congress in Pune, Mahalanobis delivered a lecture entitled Why Statistics? Statistics was a new technology for increasing the efficiency of human effort in the wildest sense to him, and he turned statistics as a key technology for the development of the nation. When the Hirakud dam on the Mahanadi was completed in 1957, Nityananda Kanungo, then chief minister of Orissa, wrote to Mahalanobis paying him a glowing tribute. The reason was that in 1926 when Mahananobis analysed 60 years of data related to floods in Orissa, which was the basis of the hydroelectric project on the Mahanadi. In his famous jute survey of Bengal in the 1940s, he exhibited accuracy and economy of sample surveys at a tenth of cost and fiftieth of the workforce.

The leadership of an expert like Mahalanobis is needed at this defining moment of changing statistical perspectives.Atanu Biswas is professor, Statistics, Indian Statistical Institute, KolkataThe views expressed are personal","analysisupdated: jun 29, 2020 11:37 istduring the communal riots in delhi in 1947, many people from a minority community took refuge in red fort. the government had no count of the number of refugees, and contractors responsible to feed them charged high amounts. a team from the indian statistical institute (isi) solved the problem. they felt that the contractors would have inflated the amount of rice and pulses, but had no reason to do so with salt as it was cheap. so, they divided the quantities of rice, pulses and salt used per day to feed all the refugees (according to the contractors) by the respective per capita requirements of these commodities, and got three estimates of the number of refugees. the estimate obtained by salt was the smallest and estimate from the rice was the largest  rice being the most expensive one, its quantity was probably exaggerated. they proposed the quantity obtained from salt as an estimate of the number of refugees. the method was verified as feasible in the case of the refugees at the site of humayuns tomb.the salt experiment is attributed to jm sengupta  an associate of professor prashanta chandra mahalanobis. did mahalanobis have any role in developing the idea? i asked many people, but couldnt get a conclusive answer. however, its hard to believe that it was possible to conduct such a non-standard experiment in that era without discussing it with mahalanobis. however, it illustrates that statistics is beyond data or methodology.through decades of tireless effort and leadership, mahalanobis built a strong statistical culture in india. he did world-class research on statistical theories and methodologies, carried out surveys, spotted and nurtured young scientists, established the indian statistical institute (isi)  a mighty monument of his handicraft, founded and nurtured sankhy  the indian journal of statistics, organised various statistical conferences, initiated teaching and training in statistics in the country, guided applications of statistics in various policy-decisions, let young talents, including future nobel and abel laureates blossom, and hosted world-class foreign scientists for academic interactions. an incredible achievement in one lifetime. today is national statistics day today, the birthday of professor mahalanobis.as the president of the 1950 science congress in pune, mahalanobis delivered a lecture entitled why statistics? statistics was a new technology for increasing the efficiency of human effort in the wildest sense to him, and he turned statistics as a key technology for the development of the nation. when the hirakud dam on the mahanadi was completed in 1957, nityananda kanungo, then chief minister of orissa, wrote to mahalanobis paying him a glowing tribute. the reason was that in 1926 when mahananobis analysed 60 years of data related to floods in orissa, which was the basis of the hydroelectric project on the mahanadi. in his famous jute survey of bengal in the 1940s, he exhibited accuracy and economy of sample surveys at a tenth of cost and fiftieth of the workforce. mahalanobis large-scale sample survey in famine-hit bengal during 1944-45 to study the causes and extent of the famine was also remarkable.it is little surprise that statistics under mahalanobis would play a leading role in independent india as well  through establishing various national, state, and district offices for smoother coordination of official statistics. he was also the architect of indias second five year plan. on his death, the un statistical commission in its resolution in 1972 said: remembering his pioneering efforts on behalf of social statistics, remembering him as a champion of statistical needs of the developing countries, remembering the outstanding stimulus he gave to statistical development throughout the entire world...in the last two decades, statistics has undergone a change in its style of functioning. as a result of the internet,there is a flood of data, mostly junk, and much more than statistical technology can leverage. consequently, a different set of experts  data scientists  has emerged, who primarily run routine software and algorithms for data analyses. however, the theory is still insufficient, and outcomes are often questionable. someone like mahalanobis, who had an uncanny knack for perfection and who understood the dance steps of numbers in the arena of time and space better than anybody else in this business, would have been the best person to handle such a situation  to guide analyses, or even to discard it was found to be meaningless.styles of major statistical activities such as censuses and surveys are also changing dramatically. indias 2021 census will be a digital exercise. countries like germany, switzerland, norway, estonia, singapore, the united kingdom, and the united states are now conducting or planning to conduct decennial censuses by combining registers of jobs, fiscal administration, social security, pension, school admission, hospital records and tax. the objective is to improve accuracy and simultaneously save time and money. the dynamics of other surveys will also change in the world of the coronavirus pandemic. the leadership of an expert like mahalanobis is needed at this defining moment of changing statistical perspectives.atanu biswas is professor, statistics, indian statistical institute, kolkatathe views expressed are personal"

This homemaker from Kolkata not only boasts of a collection of over 500 fountain pens but is also the moderator of a Facebook page that brings together people who still like to write the old-fashioned way, and is part of WhatsApp groups formed by those sharing the interest.My parents used to tell me that during my rice-feeding ceremony [the first feeding of solids to a baby], I picked up the fountain pen while ignoring everything else placed around me. When I was in primary school, I used to wonder when I would get to write with a fountain pen. Finally, from the age of 12 or 13, I began collecting fountain pens  I would use my tiffin money to buy them. Whenever people wanted to give me presents, I asked for fountain pens, Ms. Roy told The Hindu.Vintage pensVintage pens  belonging to another era and no longer in production  form a large part of her collection. I collect vintage pens mainly for two reasons: one, you get renowned brands at a relatively low price; two, the thrill in wondering who could have been its previous owner  it could have been held by a famous personality, who knows! Whats more satisfying is the knowledge that these models are no longer manufactured and therefore not easily available, said Ms. Roy.Having said that, she added, each pen in my collection is precious, even an Artex that would have cost me only 5. They are all priceless to me. A pen-lover would find her collection indeed priceless because they include obsolete  but in perfect working condition  models of Mont Blanc, Pelikan, Parker, Sheaffer, Eversharp, Blackbird and Swan. The most prized among them are a Conway Stewart of 1920 and a Parker Duofold Lucky Curve. Then there are Indian vintages: Guptoos, Brahman, Krishna and Bharati, among others.Ms. Roy said: It is common for many women to stop pursuing their hobbies after marriage and motherhood. We all have hobbies regardless of our gender. But a woman has to sacrifice a lot more in life. Maybe thats why we see very few female collectors in comparison to males.

This year the figure was 192.34 lakh tonnes.Also read | PM extends free foodgrains scheme till NovemberThe reason is obvious. After the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central government had announced that Priority Household (PHH) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cardholders in the country, regarded as the poor, would receive free additional entitlement of 5 kg per person per month, initially for three months (April to June) and now up to November. This was in addition to their entitlement under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Centre also came up with a scheme for providing wheat and rice to ration cardholders not covered under the NFSA or non-priority household (NPHH) cardholders at the rate of 21 per kg and 22 per kg respectively. This has been used by Tamil Nadu to provide additional entitlement of rice to about 85.99 lakh such cardholders.In addition, aimed at addressing the requirements of migrant labourers who were not covered under the NFSA or any scheme of the States, the Union government announced one more scheme  distribution of free food grains at 5 kg per person per month for May and June.The post-pandemic measures coupled with existing schemes have made a difference to the off-take position of rice.A perusal of FCI data reveals that seven States availed over 60% of the total quantity of rice during the three-month period. These are Uttar Pradesh (30.8 lakh tonnes), Bihar (20.94 lakh tonnes), West Bengal (14.04 lakh tonnes), Maharashtra (13.84 lakh tonnes), Andhra Pradesh (13.6 lakh tonnes), Tamil Nadu (13.5 lakh tonnes) and Karnataka (13.44 lakh tonnes).As for wheat, the rate of increase was not as high and stood at around 30%. Compared to 59.45 lakh tonnes lifted in the three months of 2019, the amount this year was 78.16 lakh tonnes.

2020-07-07,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/theres-no-one-to-fill-mahalanobiss-shoes/article32005985.ece,There’s no one to fill Mahalanobis’s shoes,"In Poverty and Famines (1981), Amartya Sen argued that poor distribution of food, wartime inflation, speculative buying and panic hoarding were important reasons for the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, while Madhusree Mukerjee, in her 2010 book, Churchills Secret War, wrote of the role of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, his wartime Cabinets decisions and denial policy in exacerbating the famine.Survey of the Bengal faminePrasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, Indias Plan Man and the architect of the countrys statistical system, conducted a large-scale sample survey of Bengals famine-ravaged villages between July 1944 and February 1945 for causal analysis, and to assess the extent of the disaster and an estimate of the number of people affected. The planning, preparations, challenges and findings of the survey are documented in an article in Sankhy, and in another article in The Asiatic Review, both published in 1946, among others. This survey provided very useful findings. It showed that one-fourth of the number of families (1.5 million people) who had owned rice land before the famine had either sold in full or in part their rice land or had mortgaged it. It also showed that the economic position of nearly four million people deteriorated during the famine. Economic differences became further accentuated during the famine. However, roughly 85% of the families maintained their status quo, showing that a large degree of economic inertia had persisted even under famine conditions.Bengals famine survey reminds us that we need estimates of the millions who will lose jobs or livelihoods and of the hundreds of millions whose economic conditions will deteriorate in todays COVID-19-hit India. The extent of feasibility, success and problem of online access, for example, also needs to be properly estimated in this new dawn.Mahalanobis is perhaps more relevant today when the accuracy of different sorts of data  from economic data to COVID-19 data  is under the scanner. Starting from the first area sample in the whole world for jute forecast in 1934, Mahalanobis built up a strong and trustworthy statistical heritage in India through his tireless efforts over the years, supplemented by his efficiency, wisdom, leadership, innovative ideas and brilliance. Mahalanobis envisaged large-scale sample surveys as statistical engineering rather than pure theory of sampling. He was instrumental in establishing the National Sample Survey (NSS) in 1950 and the Central Statistical Organization in 1951.Importance of accurate dataMahalanobis was very careful about data accuracy in his surveys. In Kautilyas Arthashastra, there is mention of the need for cross-checking by an independent set of agents for data collection: Spies under disguise of householders (Grihapatika, cultivators), who shall be deputed by the Collector-General for espionage, shall ascertain the validity of accounts (of Gopas, the village officers and Sthanikas, the district officers) regarding the fields, right of ownership and remission of taxes with regard to houses, and the caste and profession regarding families... (Chapter XXXV). This, according to Mahalanobis, was the striking feature in the Arthashastra. This might have prompted him to have an independent supervisory staff during the conduct of field operations by the NSS for collection of reliable data.Mahalanobis was a physicist by training, a statistician by instinct and an economist by conviction. His initial training in Physics might have made him conscious about errors in measurement and observation. Students even called him the Professor of Counting and Measurement, using the initials of his name. The desire to have built-in cross-checks and to get an estimate of errors in sampling led him to introduce the Inter-Penetrating Network of Subsamples, which is now considered as the curtain-raiser for re-sampling procedures like Bootstrap, a revolutionary concept of statistics indeed.However, even Mahalanobis could have faced hardship had he wished to conduct surveys now. First, even in pre-COVID-19 India, its widely reported that surveyors were facing tremendous resistance from people due to some sociopolitical reasons. None other than Pronab Sen, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Economic Statistics, and former Chief Statistician, expressed his concern that the survey system is already in deep trouble, and conducting household surveys with the Census as the frame would be very tough going ahead. The problem will intensify due to COVID-19. It was not easy to conduct surveys in famine-hit Bengal either. Through August 1944, 80 field workers were beset by malaria; half of them later dropped out of the project. However, conducting a survey in the age of contagion is understandably much harder.Use of technologyWhat would Mahalanobis have done in this situation? Would he have devised some instrument, like crop-cutting concentric circles, in addition to using masks and sanitisers and sending investigators for a socioeconomic survey? Or would he have used different sorts of secondary data instead? Its difficult to guess. Who knows, he might have efficiently churned big data for this  he could certainly have done a smarter job than most of the present-day big data analysts. Note that Mahalanobis never shied away from technology, whether in bringing statistical technology through volumes of Biometrika in his voyage from England, or even bringing computers to India. The Mahalanobis-led Indian Statistical Institute procured Indias first computer in 1956 and the second in 1959.At the end of his 1946 article in The Asiatic Review, Mahalanobis wrote: Statistics are a minor detail, but they do help. This is an eternal truth. What Mahalanobis didnt spell out is that one needs a top statistician for listening to the heartbeats of data and for framing data-based policy decisions for human welfare and national development. And unfortunately, theres no one to fill Mahalanobiss shoes, even about half a century after his demise.Atanu Biswas is Professor of Statistics, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata","in poverty and famines (1981), amartya sen argued that poor distribution of food, wartime inflation, speculative buying and panic hoarding were important reasons for the devastating bengal famine of 1943, while madhusree mukerjee, in her 2010 book, churchills secret war, wrote of the role of british prime minister winston churchill, his wartime cabinets decisions and denial policy in exacerbating the famine.survey of the bengal famineprasanta chandra mahalanobis, indias plan man and the architect of the countrys statistical system, conducted a large-scale sample survey of bengals famine-ravaged villages between july 1944 and february 1945 for causal analysis, and to assess the extent of the disaster and an estimate of the number of people affected. the planning, preparations, challenges and findings of the survey are documented in an article in sankhy, and in another article in the asiatic review, both published in 1946, among others. this survey provided very useful findings. it showed that one-fourth of the number of families (1.5 million people) who had owned rice land before the famine had either sold in full or in part their rice land or had mortgaged it. it also showed that the economic position of nearly four million people deteriorated during the famine. economic differences became further accentuated during the famine. however, roughly 85% of the families maintained their status quo, showing that a large degree of economic inertia had persisted even under famine conditions.bengals famine survey reminds us that we need estimates of the millions who will lose jobs or livelihoods and of the hundreds of millions whose economic conditions will deteriorate in todays covid-19-hit india. the extent of feasibility, success and problem of online access, for example, also needs to be properly estimated in this new dawn.mahalanobis is perhaps more relevant today when the accuracy of different sorts of data  from economic data to covid-19 data  is under the scanner. starting from the first area sample in the whole world for jute forecast in 1934, mahalanobis built up a strong and trustworthy statistical heritage in india through his tireless efforts over the years, supplemented by his efficiency, wisdom, leadership, innovative ideas and brilliance. mahalanobis envisaged large-scale sample surveys as statistical engineering rather than pure theory of sampling. he was instrumental in establishing the national sample survey (nss) in 1950 and the central statistical organization in 1951.importance of accurate datamahalanobis was very careful about data accuracy in his surveys. in kautilyas arthashastra, there is mention of the need for cross-checking by an independent set of agents for data collection: spies under disguise of householders (grihapatika, cultivators), who shall be deputed by the collector-general for espionage, shall ascertain the validity of accounts (of gopas, the village officers and sthanikas, the district officers) regarding the fields, right of ownership and remission of taxes with regard to houses, and the caste and profession regarding families... (chapter xxxv). this, according to mahalanobis, was the striking feature in the arthashastra. this might have prompted him to have an independent supervisory staff during the conduct of field operations by the nss for collection of reliable data.mahalanobis was a physicist by training, a statistician by instinct and an economist by conviction. his initial training in physics might have made him conscious about errors in measurement and observation. students even called him the professor of counting and measurement, using the initials of his name. the desire to have built-in cross-checks and to get an estimate of errors in sampling led him to introduce the inter-penetrating network of subsamples, which is now considered as the curtain-raiser for re-sampling procedures like bootstrap, a revolutionary concept of statistics indeed.however, even mahalanobis could have faced hardship had he wished to conduct surveys now. first, even in pre-covid-19 india, its widely reported that surveyors were facing tremendous resistance from people due to some sociopolitical reasons. none other than pronab sen, chairman of the standing committee on economic statistics, and former chief statistician, expressed his concern that the survey system is already in deep trouble, and conducting household surveys with the census as the frame would be very tough going ahead. the problem will intensify due to covid-19. it was not easy to conduct surveys in famine-hit bengal either. through august 1944, 80 field workers were beset by malaria; half of them later dropped out of the project. however, conducting a survey in the age of contagion is understandably much harder.use of technologywhat would mahalanobis have done in this situation? would he have devised some instrument, like crop-cutting concentric circles, in addition to using masks and sanitisers and sending investigators for a socioeconomic survey? or would he have used different sorts of secondary data instead? its difficult to guess. who knows, he might have efficiently churned big data for this  he could certainly have done a smarter job than most of the present-day big data analysts. note that mahalanobis never shied away from technology, whether in bringing statistical technology through volumes of biometrika in his voyage from england, or even bringing computers to india. the mahalanobis-led indian statistical institute procured indias first computer in 1956 and the second in 1959.at the end of his 1946 article in the asiatic review, mahalanobis wrote: statistics are a minor detail, but they do help. this is an eternal truth. what mahalanobis didnt spell out is that one needs a top statistician for listening to the heartbeats of data and for framing data-based policy decisions for human welfare and national development. and unfortunately, theres no one to fill mahalanobiss shoes, even about half a century after his demise.atanu biswas is professor of statistics, indian statistical institute, kolkata"

(File) This year, Bihar produced 60 lakh MMT maize as compared to 40 lakh MMT last year. (File)At times, I feel like committing suicide but then the faces of my children flash before my eyes. On one hand, private maize traders have opened hundreds of godowns to stock maize after purchasing it at low price from us and on the other, the government is not ensuring sale at MSP (Minimum Support Price), said Vinod Kumar Jaiswal, a farmer from Alauli in Bihars Khagaria district.I had taken a loan of Rs 1.75 lakh from a money lender at three per cent interest rate. I had hoped a good crop would help me pay back the loan. But I sold 25 quintal at Rs 1,100 per quintal to meet daily needs and have another 25 quintals stored in the hope of getting a better price in near future, he said. He also said he has not been able to pay his son Muskans school fee of Rs 12,000.Jaiswal is not alone. Several farmers across Khagaria, Saharsa and Begusarai, three of the 18 north Bihar districts that account for 40 per cent of national maize production, have similar accounts to share.One says he has mortgaged his wifes ornaments to arrange money for her treatment, others say they cannot pay school and college fees of their children as they have not been able to sell their crop.Some farmers are stocking up in the hope of getting better prices later. Others who have no option but to sell the crop for their daily needs are selling it at Rs 1,050-Rs 1,150 per quintal, even below the farmers cost of Rs 1,213. The MSP this year is Rs 1,850 per quintal.Last year, the farmers sold maize at Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,400 per quintal and the MSP was Rs 1,760. After getting good prices, farmers in the region increased maize cultivation this year over wheat and vegetables, hoping it would help them pay off loans and plan for the future.This year, Bihar produced 60 lakh MMT maize as compared to 40 lakh MMT last year.Dinesh Singh, a farmer from Sonbarsa in Saharsa, said, I sold 32 quintals at Rs 1,100 per quintal to meet the basic needs of my family. I was appalled to see about 100 godowns in Saharsa alone where traders from Haryana, UP, Nepal and West Bengal and some local people are storing maize. They are not giving us good prices, saying the price is low because of the Covid-19 crisis. Why cant the government ensure that farmers at least get the MSP rate?Dinesh said he had failed to pay his sons engineering college fee of Rs 80,000 and his son Amit Anand had recently returned from Delhi because he had no money to send him.Saharsa farmers Ranjeet Jha and Rajkumar Poddar have produced 400 quintals and 500 quintals of maize, respectively, but have been able to sell only 25 per cent of their stocks.Overall, farmers of Bihar have so far sold less than 40 per cent of the produce this year as compared to last years sale of about 80 per cent of produce till around this time.The dealers cited their own reasons.Amar Kothari, a dealer with Kanhaiya Trading Company in Khagaria, said, We understand the farmers concerns, but we are not getting enough orders from large maize traders in UP, Haryana, West Bengal and Odisha where they need maize for poultry and animal feed. No transportation in the lockdown and poor demand now are factors behind the low price and the distress sale..Bihar Kisan Manch president Dhirendra Singh Tuddu said, We want the Centre to bring a law ensuring no buyer can offer less than MSP to farmers. We are surprised why the Centre cannot purchase maize and why the Primary Agriculture Society of Bihar can purchase wheat and rice but not maize, which is the backbone of north Bihars economy?Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan told The Indian Express, We have often discussed if we can add distribution of 1 kg maize under PDS. Several states, including maize-growing ones, should discuss and see if they can help us procure maize.We are aware of the distress sale and how farmers are not getting MSP this year.

2020-07-18,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telanganas-covid-trials-and-tribulations/article32119383.ece,Telangana’s COVID trials and tribulations,"Around 8 a.m. on June 27, a distressed health volunteer sat next to his sick younger brother outside the Government General and Chest Hospital in Hyderabad. The brother, a software engineer, had had nine days of fever and shortness of breath. Suspecting COVID-19, the family rushed him to hospital. Two hours had passed since they reached the hospital, which had 308 beds, including 105 designated for those suspected of having COVID-19. But there was no information on whether he could be admitted. He desperately needed oxygen support, but no one from the hospital told us how much time it would take to admit him, the health volunteer said. The family spent several hours in agony. Finally, the 34-year-old techie was admitted a little after 10 p.m. Many other patients and attendants who wanted to get admitted at other government hospitals in the capital reported similar complaints.The beginningCOVID-19 didnt seem much of a threat to the Telangana government even when the first patient suspected of having the disease was detected in the last week of January. A 34-year-old postdoctoral research scholar in chemistry, who was studying at a laboratory in Wuhan, China, returned to Hyderabad on January 20. He was admitted at the Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases. The State health department officials sent his samples for testing to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. At the same time, they chalked out plans on where COVID-19 patients could be admitted. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when the research scholar tested negative. As days passed, more people suspected of having the disease were detected and more samples were sent to the institute for tests. All of them tested negative.More than a month later, on the afternoon of March 2, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced that a techie from Telangana with a travel history to Dubai had tested positive for COVID-19. That was the first case in the State. The 24-year-old from Hyderabad, who was working in Bengaluru, had developed symptoms a few days after returning from Dubai. He was admitted in State-run Gandhi Hospital and was diagnosed with pneumonia. The State government got down to tracing the techies contacts. Gandhi Hospital, where he was admitted, was later turned into the largest isolation centre in the State. It has been designated as a Centre of Excellence for COVID Care, but several issues, such as of COVID-19 patients on oxygen support waiting for hours for their soiled diapers to be changed, are hampering its reputation.Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao spoke of the techie in the State Assembly on March 7 and tried to allay fears. Quoting some doctors, he said a paracetamol tablet was sufficient to fight COVID-19. He called the techie a sannasi daridrudu (unfortunate nincompoop). He also claimed that the virus cannot survive in temperatures above 22C, despite the fact that there is no scientific basis for this claim.Coming under flak for his comments, Rao later said on record in the Assembly that it was a scientist who had told him that paracetamol would cure fever induced by COVID-19. He added that the statement had been blown out of proportion.Police high-handednessSoon after appealing to the people to remain calm, Rao announced a complete lockdown in the State from March 23 to March 31. Telangana was among the first States to announce a lockdown. The number of cases in the State then stood at 21. The government closed the inter-State borders during the period. No vehicles, except goods vehicles carrying essentials like medicines, were allowed into the State. The State government also suggested to the Union Health Ministry that all international passengers be stopped from entering as a majority of those who had tested positive until then had returned from abroad.Also read | Hyderabad police draw flak for inter-State border messThe decision to impose a lockdown was largely welcomed by everyone, but questions remained. During the initial days of the lockdown, a string of press conferences were held where some of these questions were raised. A reporter asked if the lockdown would resemble a curfew. Rao asserted that a lockdown was not a curfew, even as the Director General of Police issued new orders for a curfew-like bandobast. As day gave way to night, people began complaining about police excesses, especially in the three urban police commissionerates  Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda  of the State capital. Over the next few days, videos and photographs of police personnel chasing people on the roads and beating them mercilessly emerged on social media. In Wanaparthy, a man was assaulted by the police in front of his 12-year-old son, which forced IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao to intervene and direct the District Superintendent of Police, Apoorva Rao, to personally meet and apologise to the child. On the first day of the lockdown, several journalists were roughed up by the police despite showing their identity papers. In Khammam, a woman doctor who was on her way to the hospital was abused and assaulted by an Assistant Commissioner of Police.Police officers told The Hindu that they had received instructions from their seniors to use force and create an atmosphere of fear. The zonal officers were asked not to take calls from influential personalities. Our men were told to control any situation using batons, said a senior police officer.It was a tough time. Every senior officer gave us different instructions, an inspector with the Hyderabad City Police said. We were very confused. We all did whatever we felt was right according to the situation on the ground. Some of our men used their batons to control the situation and keep people inside. Many people were injured in the process.Also read | Bogged down by lockdown, policemen lose their temperIn a recent counter affidavit filed in the Telangana High Court on allegations that the Falaknuma police personnel had damaged vehicles parked outside homes in a residential area, the Hyderabad Police Commissioner, Anjani Kumar, submitted: The police had checked the vehicles using police lathis in order to see whether coronavirus was present or not. Though this statement was widely condemned on social media, no action has been taken against the lathi-wielding policemen.Also read | What social distancing? Hyderabad Commissioner of Polices meeting at jam-packed conference hallThe migrant crisisWhile contact-tracing of foreign returnees as well as those who had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi was being done, a new crisis began unfolding, like in the rest of the country. Abruptly left without any means of livelihood, food and money following the imposition of the lockdown, migrant workers began their exodus from Hyderabad. Over days and weeks, thousands of workers, clutching their belongings and their children, were seen walking in Hyderabad and other districts bordering Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. They were all desperate to go home. Even a month later, the scene did not change. Workers walked hundreds of kilometres to reach homes as far away as in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Chief Ministers attempts to woo them back with 12 kg rice and 1,500 in cash for each family did little to stop them. According to officials, there were more than 7 lakh migrants in the State. While some of them did choose to stay back after receiving help from the police, members of civil society and NGOs, the rest left.Junior doctors from Gandhi Hospital stage a protest after a post-graduate student was allegedly attacked by the attendants of a patient who died of COVID-19. | Photo Credit: Nagara GopalThose who chose to stay back were not happy either. On April 29, for instance, more than 2,000 migrant construction labourers stationed in the premises of IIT-Hyderabad erupted in agitation against their employer, the construction firm L&T, for forcing them to live in poor conditions during the lockdown. They claimed that they were left to fend for themselves, without any pay or help. Clashes with the police caused injuries to at least one police officer and damage to one police vehicle. The incident changed the State governments policy towards the workers.Two days later, on May 1, the Telangana government started sending back the workers home in special trains. Till June 10, the South Central Railway in coordination with the State government ran 146 special trains to send back more than 1.88 lakh migrants to their hometowns in Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Manipur. On May 23-24 alone, 41 trains took workers to five different States. The workers began going back, but many of them also carried the virus with them to the districts.Also read | 76% guest workers did not get government aidLack of transparencyThough it was among the first States to impose a lockdown immediately after the Janata Curfew, Telangana started conducting fewer and fewer tests. Worse, it stopped sharing information on cases and samples tested, in its daily medical bulletin, from March 25 to June 15. Doctors attending to COVID-19 patients in the State started comparing the State medical bulletin with the medical bulletins of other States on WhatsApp groups or on Twitter to ask why the Telangana health department was not releasing day-wise data on tests conducted.Also read | Clamour for transparency of testing data grows shrillerTelangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender and officials in the health department responded to the criticism by saying that the tests were being conducted according to the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research. When we strictly follow ICMR guidelines, we get more cases. Our accuracy of tests is greater. More tests can be conducted, but what purpose will it serve if tests are not focused and less positives are detected, asked officials in the health department.As criticism for conducting fewer tests mounted, the State government, on June 14, decided to conduct 50,000 tests in 10 days in 30 Assembly constituencies of Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Vikarabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy districts. Tests and treatment at private laboratories and hospitals were allowed. On the Chief Ministers directions, charges for tests at private establishments were capped at 2,200. For samples collected from homes, the rate was fixed at 2,800. A huge surge in positive cases was observed after the initiative was launched, from June 15. Besides RT-PCR tests, rapid antigen tests too were used from around July 8 to detect COVID-19 cases.The health departments June 16 and June 17 bulletins published information about the number of tests conducted, but this information again disappeared from the June 18 bulletin only to reappear the next day. After the health department started to conduct rapid antigen tests, questions were raised again about the break-up of tests and cases between RT-PCR and the antigen tests, which was not mentioned.Reasons for spread of virusThe lack of data was especially a problem given that by the end of May, there was a spike in cases. Though people had their theories for this, they sought answers from the government. On May 30, the States Director of Public Health, Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao, said increased movement of people following lockdown relaxations in May had led to the spike. Officials blamed the people for the surge in cases.Also read | As cases spike, Telangana sounds alert for vulnerable age groupsThe numbers in rural Telangana also went up rapidly when workers who had migrated for work to Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and other States started coming back home. The influx of migrant workers was very high, especially in the Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, Mancherial and Jagtial districts. Thousands of them were coming back every day, many with the infection. But cautious villagers and the strategy of the police department helped us in containing the spread of the virus, said an IPS officer.According to the officer, the infection came to Telangana in three waves: first, with the foreign returnees; next with the Markaz returnees; and then with the migrant workers, before community spread started. Many people who went to Cancer Hospital and other hospitals in Hyderabad for their regular treatment also returned with the infection. A few workers died within days of coming back to their native places, the officer said.While harsh measures were used to control the pandemic, politicians continued with their meetings. A large number of politicians, party workers and officials gathered together when the Chief Minister launched the sixth phase of Haritha Haram, the tree plantation programme, in Medak recently. There was no physical distancing and many were not even wearing masks, the officer said. Whether that made any difference to the number of cases or not, only time can tell. The Home Minister of Telangana tested positive for COVID-19 and was under treatment in a private hospital. He has now been discharged.Also read | Hyderabads high COVID-19 positivity rate worries expertsProblems in private labsThe cumulative positivity rate till July 15 was 18.85%, one of the highest in the country. Health department officials said there were discrepancies in private laboratories which had led to the high test positivity rate. Four teams inspected 16 private laboratories in Hyderabad in the last week of June. They suspected that a few labs had been conducting pool sampling. Instead of testing each sample in a pool, if even one sample in a pool tested positive, all samples were declared positive. Other discrepancies too were observed in the private labs. However, the officials did not provide precise data on the number of samples tested at government and private labs, which helps determine whether private labs have contributed to the high test positivity rate.Also read | Fingers raised at discrepancies in private lab COVID testsThe State government also came under criticism for another reason. From July 7, old Secretariat buildings began to be demolished in order to construct a new Secretariat. These buildings could have been used to accommodate more COVID-19 patients, people and Opposition parties said.Struggle in hospitalsFour and a half months after the first COVID-19 case was detected in Telangana, 39,342 cases were detected as on July 15, the seventh highest number of cases in the country. Telangana has among the lowest test rates (tests per million people) in India and the lowest in south India (5,722 per million people). Hospitals are struggling not only with beds but also with other infrastructural and manpower-related issues. On Wednesday, rainwater from storm water drains gushed into the in-patient block of Osmania General Hospital where patients were undergoing treatment (those suspected of having COVID-19 are treated in the out-patient block). Doctors said rather than recovering, patients were likely to contract new infections in such unhygienic conditions. They are worried that such a situation, if it were to occur in the out-patient block, might cause a grave health crisis. In Gandhi Hospital, over 600 outsourced staff comprising patient care providers, sanitation workers and others boycotted duties from Tuesday demanding regularisation of job and hike in salaries. They draw only 9,500 per month. They called off the protest on Wednesday after daily incentives and one week of quarantine after one week of work was assured to them. In the District Hospital, King Koti, people have complained that lack of a help desk or signboards has left them clueless, forcing them to spend time waiting for help among scores of other COVID-19 patients. Private hospitals are filling up; many are not admitting patients.Meanwhile, in one of the private hospitals, the techies brother is gasping for breath. The techie has fully recovered but his brother is now struggling.","around 8 a.m. on june 27, a distressed health volunteer sat next to his sick younger brother outside the government general and

Making the announcement over a webcast, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the scheme will be implemented within six to seven months.The Delhi government Tuesday cleared a proposal to allow home delivery of ration to PDS (public distribution system) beneficiaries in the national capital, implementing one of the major promises made by AAP in the run-up to the assembly polls held earlier this year.Making the announcement over a webcast, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the scheme will be implemented within six to seven months. Beneficiaries will have the option to choose between home delivery and the traditional way of collection from fair price shops.There are around 2,030 fair price shops in Delhi, catering to around 17.54 lakh families, having 71 lakh beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013. Kejriwal also announced that the Centres one nation, one ration card policy will also be implemented in Delhi from the day the doorstep delivery policy kicks in. The policy is aimed at making ration cards, issued by any particular state, valid across the country.The preliminary plan suggests that delivery agents will be given e-POS devices. Beneficiaries will be expected to share their ration card number with the agents, which will be entered into the device, along with fingerprint scanning or entering Aadhaar card number.The Delhi Food Department has already directed fair price shop owners to update the contact details and Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries. The e-POS system, which was suspended in Delhi in April 2018 following complaints that eligible beneficiaries were being deprived of food grains due to technical glitches, is also likely to be reinstated at the shops as well.The decision that was taken today in the cabinet meeting is a revolutionary step. The scheme will be called Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana. Under this scheme, people will not have to go to ration shops to collect ration, but the ration will be delivered to the homes of lakhs of people in Delhi. Wheat grains will be lifted from the FCI godowns and will be taken to the wheat grinding shops to be made into flour. Flour, sugar, rice and other items will be packed properly and will be delivered, Kejriwal said.In April this year, the Delhi government had launched doorstep delivery of ration across the citys containment zones.We are expecting this scheme to be implemented within six to seven months because there will be tendering and hiring of consultants before it is rolled out. The central governments one nation, one ration card scheme will be implemented on the same day as when the doorstep delivery scheme will be implemented.This scheme of the central government says that there should be one ration card for all. For instance, if somebody lives in West Bengal or Bihar, and he comes to Delhi in search of a job and work, his ration card for that state must be valid in Delhi as well. Personally, I am glad that this scheme has been approved and will be launched in Delhi, because before entering politics Manish Sisodia and I used to run an NGO called Parivartan. We used to work for the welfare of people living in slums and fight for the rights of the poor people in Delhi. We used to struggle and fight for people to get ration. We fought for the RTI, and the RTI Act was implemented, and we used the RTI Act to enable people to obtain ration, he added.When Kejriwal and Sisodia, were running the NGO, ration distribution in Sundar Nagri was among the biggest campaigns they led. Using RTI applications, they accessed records from ration shops and found up to 90% pilferage in many cases. On Twitter, the CM paid tribute to Santosh Koli, an AAP member who was associated with Parivartan since 2002, and died after being hit by a car.It is the sacrifice of brave activists like her that led to todays revolutionary reform in ration, he tweeted.

But in Bombay, when I was growing up, it meant a person from UP.It was neither affectionate nor insulting, just a matter of fact. The guy who brought you milk in the morning was called bhaiyya. So was the man who made your bhelpuri.I thought back to the bhaiyya days, the last time I was in Mumbai and noticed how the milkmen and the bhelpuri-wallahs had become a much less important part of the city.People now bought their milk in bottles or in cardboard or plastic packets. The tradition of the doodh-wallah, who came to your door each morning with fresh milk, had been almost forgotten. And the name bhaiyya for doodh-wallah had almost died out.So it is with bhelpuri-wallahs. When I was a child, the beaches were important centres of the social life of the city. It was normal for middle-class families to drive to Chowpatty, get out of their cars and walk on the beach, stopping only to eat bhelpuri.A restaurant called Swati in Mumbai serves Gujarati-style bhel and chaatThe bhelpuri stalls were all run by migrants from UP. The stalls were mostly run by men with the same name: Sharma Snack Stall or Sharma Bhel Centre. All the Sharmas were addressed as bhaiyya by their customers and were happy to be called that.I have no idea why the citizens of Mumbai believed that people from UP  whether milkmen or chaat-wallahs  should be called bhaiyya. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mumbai (or Bombay as it was then) was already Indias most cosmopolitan city but you could still tell the ethnicities apart.The Parsis lived mostly in South Mumbai. There were distinct Muslim areas. Such places as Shivaji Park had a high concentration of Maharashtrians. Matunga was South Indian. Bhuleshwar was Gujarati.Rather than the melting pot it is today, Mumbai was a shimmering mosaic where every community felt at home, but also maintained its own identity. Bollywood, for instance, had a largely Punjabi air and Bandra had a Christian character.Many of these communities consisted of migrants to the city. Over the years, people streamed into the city because it offered opportunities to all. I imagine that the migrants from UP came fairly long ago. While they kept their regional identity, they treated Mumbai as home and even in the 1970s, many of them had been born in Mumbai.Though some got into the dairy business, I doubt if they brought the milk trade with them. On the other hand, they certainly brought chaat to the city.Despite the many extravagant claims made for Delhi as the home of chaat (most legends throw in a Mogul emperor or two to sound more authentic), the truth is that UP is the natural home of chaat. The best chaat in India is still in such towns as Benaras and Lucknow, and nearly all great chaat dishes can usually be traced back to UP.There is no pav-bhaji without packaged bread and Amul butter today ( Shutterstock )There are two great exceptions. The first is Delhi-style chhola-bhatura, which seems to have gained in popularity only after Partition when Punjabis came to the city.And the second is bhelpuri.You cant really dispute that most Mumbai chaat came from UP. Yes, the names were changed. The UP batasha, for instance, has taken on many identities in different parts of India: puchka in Kolkata and golgappa in Delhi.In Mumbai it became pani puri, a purely functional name that described its primary constituents, puri and a spicy, watery solution.But bhelpuri has many ingredients that you dont find in UP chaat. Sev is very much a Gujarati thing. So are mumra (puffed rice or rice crispies if you want to get fancy). The general consensus when I was growing up in Mumbai was that bhelpuri was invented in the city by merging UPs chaat traditions with Gujarati flavours and Gujarati textures.There was even a restaurant that claimed to have invented it: Vithals near the New Empire cinema. But bhelpuri had moved beyond any ethnic origins and belonged to all of Mumbai. At the same time as the Sharmas were stirring it up on Chowpatty, the Shetty bhelpuri chain of restaurants (owned by people from Karnataka) was offering a more upmarket version, complete with bhelpuri packet, in case you were travelling and wanted to take it out of Mumbai with you.In many Gujarati homes, bhelpuri would be assembled (if not fully made) by housewives. This was never as masaledaar as the Chowpatty version but it could be delicious, clean and made with the best ingredients (a date chutney rather than the imli chutney preferred by some stalls).Soam in Babulnath, Mumbai, is also famous for its chaat ( Shutterstock )This tradition received a boost when a small restaurant called Swati (owned by Gujaratis) opened near Bhatia Hospital, and began serving bhel and Gujarati takes on chaat. Swati soon became a phenomenon, and now visitors to Mumbai regard its take on bhelpuri as the definitive version. (It is very good but my favourite remains Soam in Babulnath.) In the process, the Gujaratis have reclaimed bhelpuri and the poor bhaiyyas of Chowpatty are less and less associated with it.The best chaat in India is still in such towns as Benaras and Lucknow, and nearly all great chaat dishes can be traced back to UPLike most Mumbai people of my generation, I loved bhelpuri. In 1979, I wrote the cover story for the newly- launched Bombay magazine and I compared the city with its delicious mixture of separate and distinct elements all bound together in perfect harmony to bhelpuri. At the time, I thought the parallel was apt. (And so, presumably did our readers, the issue sold out in 24 hours.)But I wonder if I would use that parallel today. For a start, I dont think that bhelpuri is the great Mumbai dish any longer. Sure, you get it all over the city but it is just one more dish on a chaat menu. Todays chaat-eaters see no distinction between bhelpuri and pani puri. They dont care that one is distinctively Mumbai and one is pan-Indian.In fact, if you ask people what the great Mumbai street food dish is, they would probably say vada-pav or pav-bhaji. Both are dishes that were popularised in the 70s and after. They are like the dabeli and the Bombay sandwich, dishes that depend on industrial bread and increasingly, on bottled sauces.It is easy to see why they are popular. In essence, they are dishes that any fool can make. There is no pav-bhaji without packaged bread and Amul butter. In the old days, pav-bhaji wallahs used pav from small bakeries but it is all industrial bread now. There is a certain skill involved in cooking the bhaji but as anyone who has eaten pav-bhaji recently will tell you, apart from the use of pre-packaged pav-bhaji masala, there is no proper recipe. Everybody just makes it up, reckoning that packaged bread, butter and packets of ready-made masala will see them through.The vada-pav is now basically about the chutney ( Shutterstock )The vada-pav is now basically about the chutney. There are still people who put the spicing in the vada but more and more vada-pav wallahs are making basic mashed potato bondas and putting them in an industrial bun. A conscientious guy will make his own chutneys. But packaged versions are readily available.I understand why Mumbai street food is becoming no more than a way of assembling mass-produced industrial ingredients. It is cheaper and easier this way. Nor does it require that much skill. (That said, there are places that still make outstanding pav-bhaji and vada-pav in Mumbai).Also, there is the attraction of Westernisation: a vada-pav is a sandwich.But mostly, I think it is because in Mumbai, unlike say Kolkata, people are losing the taste for real chaat. They are happier with a Jain pizza or an alleged hakka noodle. They dont really want to stand by a stall and eat pani puri, one at a time. They think bhelpuri is a mess and they like the sophistication of a bread-based snack.Fair enough. But heres my fear. Making great bhelpuri was an art. No ingredient was industrial. Everything was artisanal. And the final quality of the dish depended on the hand of the man who mixed it all. Did he add the right amount of chutney? Were there too many crushed puris? Had he kept the mumra from taking in too much chutney and getting soggy?But I wont complain. One definition of modernisation is a switch from artisanal to industrial. So, I shall just sit quietly and order my bhelpuri and enjoy the mumra bursting on my palate, the sharp taste of the little shards of onion, the richness of the khajoor chutney and the satisfying crunch of the broken puris.You guys can enjoy your bread!From HT Brunch, July 26, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch","brunchupdated: jul 26,

It meant that after eating so many potatoes, I now looked like one. That is, fat! Im sure almost every single local language in India has a phrase that mirrors this one.Ive always taken high umbrage to this. Mainly because there are many, many factors that I have worked hard to master, to get as fat as I am. Also, because eating potatoes doesnt really make you fat.Yes, this is true. Potatoes are a lean food in themselves and its the fat in which they are cooked that makes you gain weight. Potatoes are also not empty calories, as they are thought to be. You couldnt be more wrong. Potatoes are full of almost all the nutrients a human being needs to survive. You could survive on boiled potatoes and a glass of milk for an entire year, and suffer no real deficiencies. The only rub is that the nutrients in potatoes are right under the skin and if you peel off the skin before cooking them, you lose all the amazing phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, zinc, fibre, Vitamin C and Vitamin B6.The famous English adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, introduced potatoes to the English in 1598, who in turn brought it to IndiaAs though all this isnt enough, they are great for people with heart trouble, because potatoes have zero cholesterol!

Potatoes have a decent bit of protein and they also help prevent constipation, a fact even the Incas knew.The everything foodPotatoes are the worlds fourth largest staple after wheat, corn and rice. Every day, over one billion people eat at least one potato. More than 300 million metric tonnes of potatoes are harvested each year. There are over 4,000 varieties of potatoes and they come in all colours from black to purple to red, orange, a pale cream and every shade in between.The reason for this huge variety is the fact that it can be easily grown anywhere on the planet, and from a small piece of potato you can harvest a large number of potatoes. They are naturally resistant to most pests (not including rodents) and have an enormous biodiversity.In The Martian (2015), Matt Damon is seen growing potatoes on MarsAll of this is why India has a Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI) in Shimla, which continuously monitors the health of the potato in India. The CPRI says the humble spud has substantially contributed to sustaining food production in our country and is a major weapon in the alleviation of hunger. If we can ramp up production in India, we could solve a major part of the nations hunger issues with the simple potato.Potatoes are not just a food  they are also used in the production of ethanol, which is consumed as vodka and can also be added to petrol to make a hybrid fuel, thereby decreasing our reliance on petroleum imports. Its a great cattle food and is also used to make glue, grease and biodegradable plates.300 years youngInterestingly, though it is found in practically every corner of India, the potato is not an autochthonous vegetable. It is a New World ingredient that came to us thanks to the colonials. The potato is endemic to the Andes in South America and was a staple food of the Inca Empire. The Spanish and Portuguese were responsible for bringing it to the Old World, and it was the famous English adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, who introduced it to the English in 1598, who in turn brought it to India.Its hard to believe that 300 years ago, there was no vada-pav in Maharashtra, no aloo parathas in North India and no masala dosa in South Indian homesIt was already here thanks to the Portuguese, but it was the British who took to it in a huge way in the 17th century, and actually popularised it all over the subcontinent. The potato was the petrol that fuelled the British armed forces and it was the army that was responsible, according to Indian food historians, for its introduction and popularity in India. Thus, the Indian love affair with the potato is actually less than 300 years old.Its hard to believe that 300 years ago, there was no vada-pav in Maharashtra, no aloo parathas in North India, no masala dosa in South Indian homes and no luchi alur dum in West Bengal! Potatoes were surprisingly welcomed in India, unlike in the Germanies in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 17th century, potatoes were thought to be aphrodisiacs eaten by the rich. Common folk wouldnt touch them. However, it was the same humble potato that saved the German nation from starvation during and after the Second World War.Apun ka aloo!Potatoes are the heart and soul of much of Indian cooking and they are grown all over the country. They make a good, hardy monsoon crop and are grown in the foothills of the Himalayas, the rain shadow regions of the Deccan, the Cauvery and Krishna basins, in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on the Ganges and her tributaries and in almost every corner of India. With the exception of the Jains, there is probably no community that doesnt eat them with gusto and joy.

im sure almost every single local language in india has a phrase that mirrors this one.ive always taken high umbrage to this. mainly because there are many, many factors that i have worked hard to master, to get as fat as i am. also, because eating potatoes doesnt really make you fat.yes, this is true. potatoes are a lean food in themselves and its the fat in which they are cooked that makes you gain weight. potatoes are also not empty calories, as they are thought to be. you couldnt be more wrong. potatoes are full of almost all the nutrients a human being needs to survive. you could survive on boiled potatoes and a glass of milk for an entire year, and suffer no real deficiencies. the only rub is that the nutrients in potatoes are right under the skin and if you peel off the skin before cooking them, you lose all the amazing phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, zinc, fibre, vitamin c and vitamin b6.the famous english adventurer, sir walter raleigh, introduced potatoes to the english in 1598, who in turn brought it to indiaas though all this isnt enough, they are great for people with heart trouble, because potatoes have zero cholesterol!

Read MorePANAJI: With each passing day, Richard Hanson is getting frustrated in Dimapur The Ghanaian had arrived in Nagaland early this year as coach-cum-player for Nagaland Rising Star Academy on a six-month contract. His plan was to prove himself and move elsewhere, but the coronavirus pandemic has turned his world upside down.""Good morning, Mr President. Please, we are footballers in India. We came for trials. I would like you to help us through your power to return. We can't even pay our rent and even to eat is very difficult in this time of Covid-19. Please help us to return home. Thank you,"" Richard tweeted in response to a post from the official account of Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana Richard wasn't speaking only for himself. He is the voice of about 30-odd Ghanaian players who had arrived here with dreams of a career in football, but are now stuck with almost nothing.""It's becoming increasingly difficult. I don't have anything. No money and I have to survive by eating rice all the time,"" Richard told TOI on Saturday.In Kolkata, Forson Kojo Obeng is counting the days when he will return home to his family. He had packed his bags and carried little money in the hope that he would, given a chance, impress a few clubs in India. He knocked on some doors, but before the door opened, Covid-19 had engulfed the nation.""We are three of us in a room here in Kolkata. Whatever little money we had brought from home is over. Now we cannot even afford to pay rent of Rs 9,500 and then we have to take care of our food too. We don't know what to do,"" said Forson. The Ghanaian footballers, most of them doing duty for lower-ranked clubs and who normally get paid on per-match basis while playing in non-recognised tournaments, had got in touch with the Consulate of Ghana. They were told that a flight is available but Rs $1200 (approx. Rs 90,000) per person was simply too much to pay. Besides, there were additional quarantine charges too.""We want to move out of India. Cases of coronavirus are on the rise. Our rent and eating is a big problem,"" said Richard.For Stephen Kwazi Menza, getting home is now a matter of life and death. The Ghanaian defender was doing well with Thrissur-based Jaya Bakery in the lucrative Sevens circuit. He was paid Rs 3,000 per game, if his team won there would be a bonus of Rs 1000. But for the last four months, Menza is bed-ridden with what the team manager says is a ""critical condition.""""I have informed his family but it's important that he gets home. With international flights yet to resume, we are all in a fix,"" said club manager Rafeeq P B.

We wanted to cater to those issues, so we decided to release the hygiene range now rather than next year Preeti Sureka, director, Emami GroupSeveral companies have found opportunity in the crisis and launched health andto help consumers in the wake of the pandemicIf you were unfamiliar with the phrase never waste a crisis before the pandemic, chances are you wont forget it now. It has come up hundreds of times in webinars, articles and even casual conversations. Some leading FMCG companies have taken the idea to heart. Theyve launched a host of health and hygiene products  from hand sanitisers and disinfectants like food washes to immunity-boosting food products  to help customers during the pandemic. Companies have reacted in different ways to this opportunity. In some cases, the new products are extensions of existing lines, with tweaks. In other cases, the company has pivoted to introduce something entirely new, though within its domain of expertise. Some companies say they were looking to introduce the same products a few months down the line, but brought the launch forward because of the outbreak.In the post-Covid-19 world, the importance of preventive healthcare and personal hygiene has been growing in the consumers mind, says Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur India. Demand patterns have changed, with consumers increasingly seeking ayurveda-based interventions for boosting their immunity, besides products that meet their personal and household hygiene needs. In the last three months, Dabur has introduced some 15 new products, from tulsi and haldi drops and giloyneem-tulsi juice, to air sprays and multisurface cleaners under the Sanitize brand, and even a vegetable wash. We have been working on two fronts, adds Malhotra. On the one hand, we have enhanced production of our existing immunity-building products like chyawanprash, and are ensuring uninterrupted supply of this to consumers across the country. On the other hand, we have strengthened our health and hygiene portfolio with the introduction of a range of new products to meet growing consumer need for immunity and personal and household hygiene.Immunity seems to have become the catchphrase today. Immunity-building has become more important in these testing times, says Dr RS Sodhi, managing director of Amul India. Consumers prefer healthier food products. We expect all companies to add an element of health to their offerings in consideration of consumers, and consumers to continue to demand health-promoting products in the long term. Amul has introduced ayurveda-based products to milk to come up with turmeric, ginger and tulsi doodh. There are not Covidspecific products, adds Dr Sodhi, but meant for the general health and overall well-being of people. We have also launched ashwagandha milk and Panchamrit [a mix of five ingredients usually offered in temples as prasad]. Also in the pipeline is honey milk. We are seeing a growing demand from everywhere and are trying to meet that.Turmeric, the time-honoured immunity booster, is also making a comeback with competitor Mother Dairy bringing out a haldi milk. This is the only new product we have launched during this time and its specifically for children, says Sanjay Sharma, business head, dairy products at Mother Dairy. [But] a lot of Covid-only hospitals inare asking us to deliver this milk for their patients. With the sudden onset of Covid, most companies have had tothe extensive market research that precedes a launch. Consumer insights are hard to get when consumers are stuck indoors and the stores are closed.In April, when Sameer Satpathy, chief executive, Personal Care Products Business at ITC, asked his teams to get back on new offerings, a five-point list landed on his desk within days. Since April-end, ITC has launched six products based on three of those points  among them the fruits and vegetables cleaner NimWash, and a surface disinfectant spray and germ protection wipes under thebrand  at a blistering pace of an average of one release every 15 days. More products will follow over the next few weeks. We worked with consumers to understand their pain points. We intuitively felt that there were certain things they wanted during these times, and worked towards building on that quickly, says Satpathy. At ITC, we have large R&D and innovation teams and we had the data and knowledge. So we worked on the previous learnings and crafted a portfolio of offerings. These are challenges we are facing as a country. In these circumstances, companies like ITC, with trusted brands, must stand up and say, I can help you out.According to Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan, director and CEO, Personal Care and Alliances at CavinKare. Typically, new products take 18 to 24 months to launch, and involve getting consumer insights and internal processes. Given the suddenness of the pandemic, weve had to accelerate our innovation cycles and launch some products immediately.Rushing out a product may be risky for both consumers as well as a wellrespected brand. Aditya V Agarwal, director of the Emami Group, says of their new Smart Balance Immunity Booster Oil that although clinical trials are still on, the FMCG major has received the requisite approvals to market the product. We dont mind if we fail, because business is all about taking chances. But the first thing was to take care of the health of consumers, says Agarwal. The new cooking oil contains Vitamin A, C, D, E and. We already had a cooking oil with vitamins A, D and E, and now weve added the other things, which has brought the product close to WHOrecommended standards, he says. Emamis other recent releases  soap, sanitiser and hand wash under the BoroPlus hygiene range  were already in the works. But the launch was brought forward by 11 months. With Covid raging, consumers are really anxious right now, says Emami Group director Priti Sureka. We wanted to cater to those issues, so we decided to release the hygiene range now rather than next year. It wasnt much of a pivot because we have an anti-bacterial heritage in BoroPlus.Do pandemic products make for good business sense? Most companies hope consumers will continue to use them even when Covid blows over. We had two perspectives in mind when we launched our products, says CavinKares Vijayaraghavan, referring to the Bacto V gadgets and multi-surface disinfectants and the Safoo fruits, vegetables and meat cleaners. First, that they must be scalable, which will happen when the categories penetration starts picking up post lockdown. Second, they must be habitforming. The company has launchedversions of its food cleaners, so they are affordable to a larger demographic. Even before Covid, there was a lot of confusion among consumers about how to clean their vegetables and meats, he adds. Now they have an option.Arvind Singhal, CMD of the management consulting firm Technopak doesnt see a future for products. People, who are in panic mode, will try anything, he says. Its only when the panic subsides that we will know if any of these products have created a market. The immunity-building properties of these products has not been scientifically proven, and it takes over 10 years to fortify ones immunity, not three months. As for becoming a habit, Singhal is sceptical. Rice cookers have been around for a long time in India, but very few actually sell. We still prefer to cook rice in the traditional way.Singhal feels that with profits down and the markets going slow, the companies are merely trying to find new opportunities. Mother Dairys Sharma appears to corroborate that. Some products, like beverages and ice-cream, are seeing very little demand, he says. People usually pick these up at supermarkets, which are shut. Wedding catering for ice-creams is a huge source of business for us, which is not happening now. The exponential growth that we had planned has not happened as certain parts of the business have simply stalled. Its critical for companies, he believes, to keep innovating and talking to their consumer base to gauge what they want.But, as Singhal says, snake oil solutions are not what consumers want. Give them something more tangible, more durable, he says. Dont cash in on their fears during the pandemic.","hygiene productsamul has launched turmeric milk as one of its immunity building productsdelhi ncrforegosavlonomega 3sachetemami group director aditya v agarwal (second from right) during the recent launch of the companys immunity boosting oil in kolkatawe worked with consumers to understand their pain points. we intuitively felt there were things they wanted and worked to build on that sameer satpathy, chief executive, itcdemand patterns have changed, with consumers increasingly seeking ayurveda-based interventions for boosting their immunity mohit malhotra, ceo, dabur indiaconsumers are really anxious right now. we wanted to cater to those issues, so we decided to release the hygiene range now rather than next year preeti sureka, director, emami groupseveral companies have found opportunity in the crisis and launched health andto help consumers in the wake of the pandemicif you were unfamiliar with the phrase never waste a crisis before the pandemic, chances are you wont forget it now. it has come up hundreds of times in webinars, articles and even casual conversations. some leading fmcg companies have taken the idea to heart. theyve launched a host of health and hygiene products  from hand sanitisers and disinfectants like food washes to immunity-boosting food products  to help customers during the pandemic. companies have reacted in different ways to this opportunity. in some cases, the new products are extensions of existing lines, with tweaks. in other cases, the company has pivoted to introduce something entirely new, though within its domain of expertise. some companies say they were looking to introduce the same products a few months down the line, but brought the launch forward because of the outbreak.in the post-covid-19 world, the importance of preventive healthcare and personal hygiene has been growing in the consumers mind, says mohit malhotra, ceo of dabur india. demand patterns have changed, with consumers increasingly seeking ayurveda-based interventions for boosting their immunity, besides products that meet their personal and household hygiene needs. in the last three months, dabur has introduced some 15 new products, from tulsi and haldi drops and giloyneem-tulsi juice, to air sprays and multisurface cleaners under the sanitize brand, and even a vegetable wash. we have been working on two fronts, adds malhotra. on the one hand, we have enhanced production of our existing immunity-building products like chyawanprash, and are ensuring uninterrupted supply of this to consumers across the country. on the other hand, we have strengthened our health and hygiene portfolio with the introduction of a range of new products to meet growing consumer need for immunity and personal and household hygiene.immunity seems to have become the catchphrase today. immunity-building has become more important in these testing times, says dr rs sodhi, managing director of amul india. consumers prefer healthier food products. we expect all companies to add an element of health to their offerings in consideration of consumers, and consumers to continue to demand health-promoting products in the long term. amul has introduced ayurveda-based products to milk to come up with turmeric, ginger and tulsi doodh. there are not covidspecific products, adds dr sodhi, but meant for the general health and overall well-being of people. we have also launched ashwagandha milk and panchamrit [a mix of five ingredients usually offered in temples as prasad]. also in the pipeline is honey milk. we are seeing a growing demand from everywhere and are trying to meet that.turmeric, the time-honoured immunity booster, is also making a comeback with competitor mother dairy bringing out a haldi milk. this is the only new product we have launched during this time and its specifically for children, says sanjay sharma, business head, dairy products at mother dairy.

2020-07-28,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/domestic-refuse-finds-way-into-bio-med-waste/articleshow/77206368.cms,Kol: Domestic refuse finds way into bio-med waste,"Bio-medical waste littered in a roadside vat in KolkataKOLKATA: Bio-medical waste collection from households affected by Covid-19 has suffered a setback with several patients and their family failing to segregate them from other domestic refuse According to a spokesperson of a private agency that has been entrusted with the job of collecting bio-medical wastes from households where Covid positive patients are in quarantine, mixing of general and bio-medical waste has created a major crisis and if not solved, it will get compounded and the scientific disposal system will crumble under pressure. Even some Covid-designate hospitals are also handing over mixed waste to the private agency, the spokesperson alleged.According to the spokesperson, people in several wards are pouring food leftovers like rice, pulses and cooked vegetables into the yellow bag that are being provided by the agency for accumulating bio-medical waste such as used masks, head cover/cap, gloves, tissues, toiletries and diaper (both adult & child), among others.This is not all. Plastic bottles, green coconuts and even flower bouquets are being poured into the yellow bags. This is posing a serious threat to the incinerator of the agency that is used for scientific burning of bio-medical waste.

2020-08-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/migrant-workers-return-to-scarce-jobs-low-salaries-6552377/,"Maharashtra: Migrant workers return to scarce jobs, low salaries","Migrant workers return to Mumbai as industries resume operations in a phased manner. (File)When Mantu Singh returned to Maharashtra on June 25 with a group of other migrant workers, who had returned home in April after the lockdown was imposed, he was hopeful of finding work quickly, and sending money back home to his family.Despite the apprehensions of his family in Uttar Pradeshs Varanasi about returning to a Covid-19 ravaged city, what really swung it for Singh, and the others, was what the contractor was offering  promise of safety measures at the construction site in Satara and prompt payment of wages.A little over a month later, however, 11 members of the group, including Singh, took the long journey back home again after their employer defaulted on paying their salaries.We were assured that we will be paid for the 14-day quarantine period and then the regular payment as per our work, said Singh, who had returned home for Holi before the lockdown was imposed. After the 14-day quarantine, when the group asked to be paid for that period, the contractor brushed them off.But still they went on to work at the site. Even for this, the contractor made no payments. The payments were to be made daily initially, but every day, he asked them to wait one more day. When the wages did not come, the group decided to return home.All they got was nearly Rs 8,000 per person when they were leaving. According to Singh, they are collectively owed Rs 69,000 as wages.Desperate to find work after the five-month lockdown, in the face of dwindling savings and the inadequate financial support from the government, many like Singh are returning to find work in the state, only to find they are worse off than before.Organisations associated with workers said that many are being promised wages for the period of quarantine or increased wages and ticket fare to return.Once workers return to the city, employers tell them about their poor financial condition and deduct the ticket fares and quarantine wages from their salaries. Many who have come back have also complained of not being paid on time and being paid less than they used to earn, said Deepak Paradkar of the non-profit group Aajeevika Bureau.Vishal Rai, a Mumbai-based worker employed in the garment sector, said he was being paid Rs 18,000 per month before the lockdown. My employer in a garment unit in Saki Naka said that I could only be paid Rs 16,000. I had to agree as there is no work. Now, we have been told that we will not be paid for our weekly offs, Rai added.Chand Mohammed and Habibul Shaikh, both residents of Murshidabad in West Bengal, too, got onto a train with money for the tickets arranged by an NGO. The two, who work on construction sites, along with eight others, reached Mumbai 40 days ago but did not find work for over a week.Every day, we would wake up and call every contractor we have ever worked for in the last five to six years. Most have themselves returned to their villagers or told us that work is yet to pick up. We have finally managed to find work with a contractor in Chembur. We were told that lockdown restrictions have eased and there is a shortage of labour. But we are getting paid less than what we used to get paid earlier, Mohammed said.While the group earned around Rs 450 to Rs 500 per day, now they get Rs 350. Shaikh said they are all under heavy debts taken back home, as there was no money left to eat after they returned home. In Mumbai, the high cost of basic supplies, including vegetables, has also pushed the group to eat plain rice on most days.Jamila Begum of Ghar Bachao, Ghar Banao Andolan, who had helped the group come back to the city, said that she receives calls daily from workers who have returned to their home states, asking if they can find work in Mumbai.There is no work or schemes providing financial assistance to them at home, they say. They have mortgaged their familys jewellery and if they fail to find work, whatever little land they have, will be sold. Those who have returned are unable to even get access to universal PDS, as their ration cards are back home, she added.The BMC has also scaled down on the number of community kitchens being run during the lockdown as well as the distribution of food packets. Labour department officials said that each district collectorate has been tasked with counting the number of workers returning to the workforce.Workers, however, said their details were not taken by any authority.

However, the huge demand drove up sales on Saturday, leading to over 100% jump in business, with most shops running out of stock by early evening. They had to start production all over again.Despite the lockdown, orders came pouring in online and we also took orders on phone. It looked quite daunting when we started work at 10pm on Friday night. Laddus were popular for years but modaks have become a craze for the past five years or so. Apart from traditional modaks made of rice flour and grated coconut, we have experimented with myriad flavours, said Sudip Mullick of Balaram Mullick .The popularity of modaks, a Maharashtrian favourite, has caught on with customers in the city so much that most traditional Bengali sweet shops are selling them now.We, too, made modaks in more than 10 flavours and experimented with fillings. Those sold more than laddus this time, said Tapan Das of Nalin Chandra Das.The Haldirams store near Rabindra Sadan saw brisk sales, too, but owner Avni Agarwal rued that stocks could not be given to many distributors on the city fringes owing to the lockdown days before that. Usually, the two days prior to Chaturthi sees 60% sales of laddus alone. We made up for that on Saturday though, she said.The flower market at Mullick Ghat below Howrah bridge teemed with people since early in the morning. While many people bought the idols on Wednesday, flowers couldnt be stored three days in advance. We will be going to Kumartuli to buy the idol after purchasing flowers. It is going to be a very basic affair this time without relatives joining in, said Puja Rajgaria, a resident of Kankurgachhi.","(this story originally appeared in on aug 23, 2020)kolkata: as the lockdown lifted on friday night, workers at sweet factories and workshops swung into action to ready thousands of kilograms of laddus and modaksthe two favourites of ganeshaso that on saturday, there was no dearth of offerings during the ganesh chaturthi pujas.most sweet shops opened shutters by 5am, while kumartuli and jagannath as well as mullick ghat were abuzz with activities from the crack of dawn as last-minute purchase of idols and flowers began.though sweet shops did brisk business throughout saturday, the owners rued they lost out on sales on locked down thursday and friday; traditionally, at least 90% laddus and modaks were sold the days before ganesh chaturthi. however, the huge demand drove up sales on saturday, leading to over 100% jump in business, with most shops running out of stock by early evening. they had to start production all over again.despite the lockdown, orders came pouring in online and we also took orders on phone. it looked quite daunting when we started work at 10pm on friday night. laddus were popular for years but modaks have become a craze for the past five years or so. apart from traditional modaks made of rice flour and grated coconut, we have experimented with myriad flavours, said sudip mullick of balaram mullick .the popularity of modaks, a maharashtrian favourite, has caught on with customers in the city so much that most traditional bengali sweet shops are selling them now.we, too, made modaks in more than 10 flavours and experimented with fillings. those sold more than laddus this time, said tapan das of nalin chandra das.the haldirams store near rabindra sadan saw brisk sales, too, but owner avni agarwal rued that stocks could not be given to many distributors on the city fringes owing to the lockdown days before that. usually, the two days prior to chaturthi sees 60% sales of laddus alone. we made up for that on saturday though, she said.the flower market at mullick ghat below howrah bridge teemed with people since early in the morning. while many people bought the idols on wednesday, flowers couldnt be stored three days in advance. we will be going to kumartuli to buy the idol after purchasing flowers. it is going to be a very basic affair this time without relatives joining in, said puja rajgaria, a resident of kankurgachhi."

I remember the taste so vividly, she says. Jeslin grew up in Muvattupuzha, near Kochi, where unlike today, fresh fish was not accessible every day and so dried fish was used instead  fried or as chutney.Borne out of necessity, at a time when consumption depended on local catch, fish has traditionally been dried for no-fishing months. Easy access to fish has changed all that, dried fish has now become infra dig. When you can get fresh fish from across the country, why would you eat unnakkameen (Malayalam for dried fish)?, asks Chef Saji Alex, chef de cuisine at Kochi Marriotts Kerala specialty restaurant Cassava, which has chemmeen dried prawn chutney on its menu.With the pandemic making it more challenging to go to the market, people are once again turning to dried fish. The process of drying involves enzymatic or microbial activity in the presence of salt. When packed and stored properly, dry fish has a shelf life of more than two years, says Pradeep Kalidindi, who runs a seafood firm in Andhra Pradesh.Dried fish has a strong flavour and an overpowering smell, which makes it an acquired taste. While smaller fish such as prawn/shrimp and anchovy are sundried, the process is different for fleshier fish such as king fish. Traditionally, cleaned fish would be rubbed with salt, packed in palm leaf baskets and hung to dehydrate; now machines do this job.In Kerala and Tamil Nadu the preparations stick to template  curry, fry, and chutney. Bengals shutki maach is perhaps the most versatile take. The Bengalis believe that adding shutki elevates the taste of vegetables. For instance, shutki combined with brinjal or pumpkin is a popular version.At Anwesha Banerjees home in Kolkata, the war between football clubs East Bengal and Mohun Bagan began about five years ago when she married Amlan, a Ghoti (Bengalis of West Bengal). That battle  this time for the humble shukti maach  moved into the kitchen. Popular varieties consumed by Bengalis are Bombay duck, shrimp, ilish and shidol. The sun dried fish was traditionally consumed by Bengalis of East Bengal (now Bangladesh), where Kolkata resident Anwesha Banerjees ancestors hail from.I have so many childhood memories associated with it. My husband though cant stand its strong pungent smell, she laughs, adding, My favourite is shutki bata (mishmash or chutney). This is a fiery creation made with onion, garlic and chilli cooked in mustard oil. It tastes heavenly with steaming rice, says Anwesha.Monsoon delightBombay duck (bombil), christened thus by the British, is perhaps the most iconic dried fish. Dried bombil is commonly used to make pickles and added to curries in Maharashtrian households.Many households crumble the dried-and-salted fish and sprinkle it over their dal or rice to add a crunchy texture. While making bombil curries, we usually soak it for half an hour to rehydrate and soften the fish, says Asavari Koli, a banker who is also a food enthusiast.Bombil vadas at Bombay Canteen | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementSoaking not only softens the fish, but also washes off the salt reducing its concentration. Koli, Malvani, Konkani and Goan communities each boast their own distinct bombil preparation. The Mangaloreans use rava for coating while the Konkanis use rice flour. In Goa, the bombil is cooked using a mix of both rava and the rice flour. The Koli community use their signature Koli masala to cook bombil, says Asavari.Of all the recipes that she learnt from her mother, dried Bombay duck masala is her favourite. Served as a starter, dried Bombay duck masala is a quick recipe using chilli powder, lemon juice, curry leaves and turmeric, she adds. In Bengal, too, it is had as a starter: dried fish is roasted on charcoal, mixed with onion, green chilli, coriander and lemon juice.Versatility at its bestAndhra Pradesh is one of the biggest manufacturers of dried fish in the country along with Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. In Visakhapatnam alone, over 5,000 fisherfolk, mostly women, eke out their livelihood by drying ribbonfish, lizard fish, sliver bellies, anchovies, crocker ray finned fish, goatfish, sardines and other pelagic fish. Not only are these exported to Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Bangladesh, they are also sent to other States such as Kerala.Everyday, three to four tonnes of dry fish is produced on average in the region, which is enough for local consumption. During the season, the production goes up to 10 tonnes per day. The process, after salting fresh fish, takes three to four days to dry.A taste of home Manik Deb, who lives in Nagpur, says the best shutki maach is the shidol type. A passionate cook who now takes care of an organic farm near Pench forest, Manik recalls cooking the shidol shutki brought all the way from Tripura by his friend. Shidol or puti mach (pool barb fish) is kept in an earthen vessel and sealed properly before it is buried. It is left there for months to provide anaerobic conditions for fermentation, says Manik. He prepares the shidol shutki jhaal cooked in mustard oil with onions and a generous dose of chilli, savoured with steamed rice. The pungent appetising aroma grows stronger when cooked. Just ensure that all the doors and windows are closed while cooking, chuckles Manik. (Nivedita Ganguly)Among the regional favourites is the endu chepala vankaya (dry fish brinjal curry)  seasoned with urad and chana dal, mustard and curry leaves, it is best had with steaming hot rice. Vineela Raju, a resident of Visakhapatnam, says, The dish is known for its robust flavour. It is prepared with a paste of tamarind, red chilli and asafoetida. I learnt this recipe from my grandmother who lived in the West Godavari district. It used to be prepared at a time when we did not get fresh fish in local markets. Now, it is a festive special in our household.Pride of placeIn Tamil Nadu, fish laid out to dry in front of homes, roofs, and terraces is a common sight in fishing villages. At the bigger fish markets such as Kasimedu Fishing Harbour in Chennai, there are designated areas for the preparation of dried fish.Raised concrete platforms arranged in rows by the quay, with ample space for people to walk in between them, and nearby, concrete tubs for soaking the fish with plenty of rock salt  this is what the dried fish area of Kasimedu looks like. Here, over 150 women are involved in the preparation, and all of them are members of the Karuvaadu Sangam (dried fish union).Fisherman R Vinod from Odai Kuppam, Besant Nagar, says that women in his locality prepare dried fish with unsold fish, and those that dont make the cut to the market. They rub rock salt on to the fish, and let this sit for a day. Then, the fish is dried till all the moisture runs out, he explains.Vinod says that women are involved in the laborious process through the year. Demand is high especially during the Tamil month of Aadi, since dried fish curry is part of the feast that follows a pooja that some people perform at home, he explains.For some varieties of dried fish, pricing can be the same as that of its fresh variant. A kilogram of seer fish today, costs between 900 and 1,200. For dried seer fish, the price is 1,000, says Vinod. The pricing also takes into account the fact that for one kilogram of fish, we get only half a kilogram of dried fish.Nevertheless, those involved in the preparation stand to gain since their products are good for up to six months.

2020-08-25,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bhopal-idol-makers-stare-at-deep-losses/article32439965.ece,Bhopal idol-makers stare at deep losses,"Gatherings remain banned owing to the COVID-19 pandemicEvery monsoon, Bharat Singh Prajapatis workshop bustled with activity  workers from Bengal moulding clay idols, his four children lending them a hand, and customers streaming in and out. But restrictions on public gatherings this year owing to the COVID-19 pandemic have left a numbing impact on the potter of 25 years.Ganesha Chaturthi has passed, yet the once-soothing sight of tens of two-feet idols and scores of taller unfinished ones, some left half-coloured and others needing a final touch, at his makeshift workshop on a temple premises in New Market here piques him. I wish I had gleaned my children from our traditional occupation earlier, so they could have picked something else. The pandemic has stolen away our identity, said Mr. Bharat, tears rolling down his cheeks.Restrictions on gatherings, including religious ones, during the pandemic have gnawed away at the livelihoods of Bhopals nearly 800 potter families, who make the most around Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja, as the demand for clay idols has crashed. Worse, the government has placed a cap of two-feet on idol height too late, just a week ahead of Ganesh Chaturthi, by when potters had taken orders in advance, invested in raw material and even readied a few idols, now left to decay.The faded colours of a few finished taller idols, due to corrosion from moisture over days, resemble the grim prospects confronting Mr. Bharat, who sits idle at the temples entrance gate, wondering how to repay 4 lakh in debt. Anticipating a normal season bringing in 2-3 lakh profit, he had taken a loan of 1 lakh at 10% interest and even mortgaged his house and wifes jewellery to buy raw material.I have been able to sell just 10 of the 120 idols we made. How will I repay the loan? he asked. He cancelled another 50 orders, but prospective buyers, munificent enough, did not ask for the 20,000 advance back. My family is having just namkeen with puffed rice to survive, he said.Thousands took part in the BJPs three-day membership drive in Gwalior-Chambal recently, but no one questioned them. Are COVID-19 safety norms meant only for the poor? asked Mr. Prajapati, wondering why idol tents couldnt be allowed with precautions and physical distancing. He now pins his hopes on the upcoming Durga Puja, and on selling diyas ahead of Diwali.In the Budhwara area, Mohan Lal Prajapati, among the citys oldest potters, has sold just 35 of the 100 idols. Home Minister Narottam Mishra two months ago told us we could go ahead with making idols, even taller ones, but he later restricted them. This is a betrayal of sorts, said Mr. Mohan, who has made70,000 this year so far instead of the usual 2-2.5 lakh.Yet, Mr. Mohan is desperate to sell the remaining idols, even at a loss. With most customers this time preferring smaller and cheaper plaster of Paris (PoP) idols for their homes, he is compelled to sell the two-feet idols readied for 1,000 each for half the price. Further, he earlier paid 3 lakh in advance to 20 sculptors in West Bengal, who arrive each season to his workshop, but not this time, owing to transport restrictions and reduced demand.Transport restrictions have also made raw material costlier. Ajay Prajapati bought a trolley of clay for 6,500, twice the usual cost. The irony is that while wine shops, malls and restaurants are open, public gatherings are being restricted, said Mr. Ajay, a member of the Murtikar Matikala Sangh, a group of sculptors. He said potters would protest outside the Chief Ministers residence soon, demanding compensation.Meanwhile, even small-scale potters selling PoP idols smaller than two feet stare at losses, though much less. From a roadside shed, Munni Bai could sell just half the idols she procured for 70,000 from Itarsi, 90 km away. The alternative of selling earthen pots hasnt been lucrative either. The lockdown was imposed in summer, the peak season for us, she explained.","gatherings remain banned owing to the covid-19 pandemicevery monsoon, bharat singh prajapatis workshop bustled with activity  workers from bengal moulding clay idols, his four children lending them a hand, and customers streaming in and out. but restrictions on public gatherings this year owing to the covid-19 pandemic have left a numbing impact on the potter of 25 years.ganesha chaturthi has passed, yet the once-soothing sight of tens of two-feet idols and scores of taller unfinished ones, some left half-coloured and others needing a final touch, at his makeshift workshop on a temple premises in new market here piques him. i wish i had gleaned my children from our traditional occupation earlier, so they could have picked something else. the pandemic has stolen away our identity, said mr. bharat, tears rolling down his cheeks.restrictions on gatherings, including religious ones, during the pandemic have gnawed away at the livelihoods of bhopals nearly 800 potter families, who make the most around ganesh chaturthi and durga puja, as the demand for clay idols has crashed. worse, the government has placed a cap of two-feet on idol height too late, just a week ahead of ganesh chaturthi, by when potters had taken orders in advance, invested in raw material and even readied a few idols, now left to decay.the faded colours of a few finished taller idols, due to corrosion from moisture over days, resemble the grim prospects confronting mr. bharat, who sits idle at the temples entrance gate, wondering how to repay 4 lakh in debt. anticipating a normal season bringing in 2-3 lakh profit, he had taken a loan of 1 lakh at 10% interest and even mortgaged his house and wifes jewellery to buy raw material.i have been able to sell just 10 of the 120 idols we made. how will i repay the loan? he asked. he cancelled another 50 orders, but prospective buyers, munificent enough, did not ask for the 20,000 advance back. my family is having just namkeen with puffed rice to survive, he said.thousands took part in the bjps three-day membership drive in gwalior-chambal recently, but no one questioned them. are covid-19 safety norms meant only for the poor? asked mr. prajapati, wondering why idol tents couldnt be allowed with precautions and physical distancing. he now pins his hopes on the upcoming durga puja, and on selling diyas ahead of diwali.in the budhwara area, mohan lal prajapati, among the citys oldest potters, has sold just 35 of the 100 idols. home minister narottam mishra two months ago told us we could go ahead with making idols, even taller ones, but he later restricted them. this is a betrayal of sorts, said mr. mohan, who has made70,000 this year so far instead of the usual 2-2.5 lakh.yet, mr. mohan is desperate to sell the remaining idols, even at a loss. with most customers this time preferring smaller and cheaper plaster of paris (pop) idols for their homes, he is compelled to sell the two-feet idols readied for 1,000 each for half the price. further, he earlier paid 3 lakh in advance to 20 sculptors in west bengal, who arrive each season to his workshop, but not this time, owing to transport restrictions and reduced demand.transport restrictions have also made raw material costlier. ajay prajapati bought a trolley of clay for 6,500, twice the usual cost. the irony is that while wine shops, malls and restaurants are open, public gatherings are being restricted, said mr. ajay, a member of the murtikar matikala sangh, a group of sculptors. he said potters would protest outside the chief ministers residence soon, demanding compensation.meanwhile, even small-scale potters selling pop idols smaller than two feet stare at losses, though much less. from a roadside shed, munni bai could sell just half the idols she procured for 70,000 from itarsi, 90 km away. the alternative of selling earthen pots hasnt been lucrative either. the lockdown was imposed in summer, the peak season for us, she explained."

Don’t forget to make them run and socialise,"Set them freeHelp them socialiseWant other pets? Get them firstProper diet does the magicUnlike other domesticated dog breeds, Indian hounds do not overeat. That way it is easier to maintain their weight. These sleek and agile breeds can have almost all dog foods and home-cooked food for dogs. Meat, curd, rice and veggies are good for them. Even though their protein requirement is not very high, a balanced diet is necessary. Feed then two to three times a day.What is asighthound?Sighthounds are also known as gazehounds. When dogs or even wolves hunt, they rely on olfactory senses. But sighthounds primarily use sight and speed to hunt. Unlike other dogs, they have a much better visual ability. Greyhound, a sighthound with a thin head and widely spread eyes, has a 270-degree vision, which means they can also see whats behind them.Lately, social media has been abuzz with posts on Indian dog breeds and how they are the most suitable pets for Indian homes. Despite having better immunity and a higher threshold for the extreme Indian climate than their foreign counterparts, these dogs are not easy to keep. Being sighthounds, most of these breeds are originally hunters and are still used for the same purpose in different parts of the country. So, despite their impressive agility and speed, these hunters are aggressive, have an extreme prey drive, territorial and often intolerant to other animals. But that doesnt mean you cannot cherish a Mudhol Hound (a breed that originated near the Karnataka-Maharashtra border) in your apartment.Since being a hunter is in their genes, it is difficult for them to overlook these instincts. So, these lean, agile breeds need proper running and exercise once in a while. Tejas Kamalkar, a Kolhapur-based cynologist, who has more than 50 Caravan, Pashmi and Mudhol Hounds, calls them the ultimate couch potato. Leash walking and jogging might work for other breeds, but what they need is a free run every now and then. Take them to the ground and set them free, he said.Agreeing with Tejas, Sukanta Mondal from Howrah said that he takes his Rampur Hound and Caravan Hound to the park once in three days and sets them free for an hour. This not just takes care of their need for exercise, but also channelizes their energy, which could otherwise turn destructive, he said.Sukanta, who has been keeping Indian breeds for the last six years, has noticed a unique characteristic among these dogs. They are unusually shy, which stems from their insecurity. These breeds thrive in packs and once separated, they develop fear. Thats why they do not like strangers and crowds. My Rampur Hound had a tendency of growling at people who approached him from the front at a speed, he said. Realising that the growling could turn into a bite anytime, Sukanta started taking his dog to a tea shop every morning. There he would meet strangers who tried to pet him. Gradually, he understood that not all strangers were bad. In technical terms, I made him socialise, which is important, he added.According to the owners, these hounds are very territorial and do not like other pets. Kolkatas Vickram Banerjee, who has been keeping a Chippiparai (a breed from Tamil Nadu ) for the last two years, said that his beloved Lalu is very loving to humans but not to other dogs and cats. When Lalu was 18 months old Vikram brought home a kitten, who was almost attacked by Lalu. I had to give the kitten away. If you want to keep other pets with an Indian hound, bring them home before you bring the hound, he said. Echoing similar sentiments, Chirag Malhotra from NCR, who has 16 Rampur Hounds, said that once the dogs are mature, it is difficult for them to tolerate other animals.","set them freehelp them socialisewant other pets? get them firstproper diet does the magicunlike other domesticated dog breeds, indian hounds do not overeat. that way it is easier to maintain their weight. these sleek and agile breeds can have almost all dog foods and home-cooked food for dogs. meat, curd, rice and veggies are good for them. even though their protein requirement is not very high, a balanced diet is necessary. feed then two to three times a day.what is asighthound?sighthounds are also known as gazehounds. when dogs or even wolves hunt, they rely on olfactory senses. but sighthounds primarily use sight and speed to hunt. unlike other dogs, they have a much better visual ability. greyhound, a sighthound with a thin head and widely spread eyes, has a 270-degree vision, which means they can also see whats behind them.lately, social media has been abuzz with posts on indian dog breeds and how they are the most suitable pets for indian homes. despite having better immunity and a higher threshold for the extreme indian climate than their foreign counterparts, these dogs are not easy to keep. being sighthounds, most of these breeds are originally hunters and are still used for the same purpose in different parts of the country. so, despite their impressive agility and speed, these hunters are aggressive, have an extreme prey drive, territorial and often intolerant to other animals. but that doesnt mean you cannot cherish a mudhol hound (a breed that originated near the karnataka-maharashtra border) in your apartment.since being a hunter is in their genes, it is difficult for them to overlook these instincts. so, these lean, agile breeds need proper running and exercise once in a while. tejas kamalkar, a kolhapur-based cynologist, who has more than 50 caravan, pashmi and mudhol hounds, calls them the ultimate couch potato. leash walking and jogging might work for other breeds, but what they need is a free run every now and then. take them to the ground and set them free, he said.agreeing with tejas, sukanta mondal from howrah said that he takes his rampur hound and caravan hound to the park once in three days and sets them free for an hour. this not just takes care of their need for exercise, but also channelizes their energy, which could otherwise turn destructive, he said.sukanta, who has been keeping indian breeds for the last six years, has noticed a unique characteristic among these dogs. they are unusually shy, which stems from their insecurity. these breeds thrive in packs and once separated, they develop fear. thats why they do not like strangers and crowds. my rampur hound had a tendency of growling at people who approached him from the front at a speed, he said. realising that the growling could turn into a bite anytime, sukanta started taking his dog to a tea shop every morning. there he would meet strangers who tried to pet him. gradually, he understood that not all strangers were bad. in technical terms, i made him socialise, which is important, he added.according to the owners, these hounds are very territorial and do not like other pets. kolkatas vickram banerjee, who has been keeping a chippiparai (a breed from tamil nadu ) for the last two years, said that his beloved lalu is very loving to humans but not to other dogs and cats. when lalu was 18 months old vikram brought home a kitten, who was almost attacked by lalu. i had to give the kitten away. if you want to keep other pets with an indian hound, bring them home before you bring the hound, he said. echoing similar sentiments, chirag malhotra from ncr, who has 16 rampur hounds, said that once the dogs are mature, it is difficult for them to tolerate other animals."

She says that this is the first time that an amount this large has been pitched. This is because the gross additional expenditure, with the net cash outgo, is probably one of the highest that budgets have ever seen in india.She highlights that the additional resources which are being placed in the first supplementary demand is largely going towards people-centric activity and some of the most critical government schemes like the PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.The MNREGA scheme has been allotted Rs 40,000 crore, with which the total amount touches Rs. 1 lakh crore- the highest ever spent amountt on MNREGA. Opponents should also recognise this, she says, alleging that under the UPA, the funds of MNREGA went to ghost accounts according to a CAG report.The total transfer to the States- tax plus grants- is 19% more than last year, she says. ""The total transfer to states exceeds centre's gross tax revenue- it is at 107%,"" she adds. The centre has gone much beyond what it had in protecting the States. ""61% of grants put in the budget provisions has already been given. There is a frontload.""FDI in this country is not coming only to ""the names you love to repeat"", Ms. Sitharaman says.On the 63 new entries, she says, a new line has been introduced for affordable housing for the middle classes, among other new windows.""Rs 500 for 3 months has gone to 20 crore poor women.

India will be 'atmanirbhar' only when farmers and labourers will get their rights, he adds.9 pm | Lok SabhaGaurav Gogoi, INC, says Congress leader Rahul Gandhi predicted the ""economic tsunami"". In India, we have had the strictest lockdown and the smallest fiscal stimulus, he alleges.The burden on the poor has increased with the rise in petrol and diesel prices, he says. ""The Finance Minister is only focussed on catchy words. Atmanirbhar Bharat is only a rehashed version of Make in India.""Instead of helping the States in the time of need, it has been abdicating its legal and moral responsinility to the States, he says. ""The Finance Minister must reconsider her options... You have the money to spend Rs 20,000 crore for an extravagant Central Vista Project. This Bill completely misses the need of the States, especially Assam.""He requests the Union Finance Minister to ""step aside"".

""There is a need to be agreeable across the centre and the states.""""There is a need to push more money into the economy and the government has been doing that,"" he says.

The Centre is accountable for providing GST compensation to the States.""The Central government's policy and financial response to the COVID crisis has been lukewarm; the economy has collapsed under the weight of the pandemic. It has not undertaken any economic reforms in the last six years,"" Mr. Maran says. He also questions the government's response that it had no data on migrant workers. He seeks release of a white paper on the economic crisis.""It is the middle class which is left out year after year when it comes to giving relief packages. Consumption is the only driver which will improve the situation. Covid-19 has affected the middle class the most, which has also suffered job losses.""The middle class has been given only lip service. No serious relief has been given to the common man. Why are you avoiding the middle class, who are expected to pay taxes diligently?"" Mr. Maran adds.TMC's Sougata Ray says that the revenue deficit will be 6 trillion in 2020-21. ""The economy was on a downward spiral even before Covid-19. India's GDP shrank by 23.9% during April-June. In China it grew by 3.2%.""""Unemployment has reduced post-unlock, but 18.9 million salaried jobs have been lost,"" he adds.The government should speed the transfer of revenues and increase spending on public infrastructure.

""I have not found anything to suggest that any new service has been contemplated in the demands for grants.""There has been a complete breach of trust by the Centre when it comes to revenue sharing with the States. This is completely unacceptable. States are being told to relinquish their rights to collect taxes,"" he adds.""The government does not intend to invest in infrastructure. You should come up with a scheme for migrant workers. Without any warning, you announced the lockdown; as a result lakhs of people were on the streets trying to go back home.""On September 1, the government said it had no data on the number of migrant workers killed during covid-19 outbreak. Reports from credible organisations say more than 1,000 migrant workers died due to various reasons, including exhaustion,"" he says.""Net tax revenue of the central government is 40% less. GDP estimate by many international agencies for 2020-21 ranges from -5 to -11.5%,"" he adds. ""The government wants to sell all the public enterprises.""Mr. Chowdhury seeks clarification from the Finance Minister on asset monetisation in PSUs. ""The government took no corrective measures refused to recognise that demonetisation was a wrong step, refused to recognise that a simplified GST should have been brought"".Timing of proceedings is extended till 9 p.m.""Fiscal stimulus given by the government was merely 1.7% of GDP, against 10 to 15% stimulus in other countries.""The next wave of Covid-19 will make the situation more precarious.""The government has been continuously increasing the fuel prices, the demand in rural areas has not been picking up""The government has no data on the jobs created. ILO figure says over 40 crore people are now in the BPL category; according to a report 57% people in rural areas have lost jobs..""In West Bengal, more than 13 lakh migrant workers have reached so far.

It was expected that jobs would be protected, but people lost their jobs,"" Mr. Chowdhury adds.6.20 pm | Lok SabhaBJP Member Jayant Sinha continues the discussion on the supplementary demands for grants, 2020-21. This is a manifesto for ""atmanirbharta"", he says.""We are seeking supplementary demand for Rs.2.35 lakh crore, in which huge amounts have been allocated for meeting expenses related to the COVID-19 outbreak.""The impact of expenses incurred is that right now we are conducting 10 lakh tests per day for Covid-19, work on vaccine candidates are under way, Covid care centres have been set up, ventilators are being manufactured. In 70 days, we have provided 50,000 ventilators. We should praise and thank the frontline workers,"" he says.""Funds are also being allocated for the benefit of MSMEs, thereby protecting employment. For those with distressed assets, Rs.250 crore has been allocated.""For MNREGA, an extra Rs.40,000 crore has been given, apart from the Rs.60,000 crore. While 6 crore people were earlier working under MNREGA, it is now 2 crore, as the economy is improving,"" he adds.""We have been able to stabilise the economy, RBI's role cannot be ignored. The government, in coordination with the RBI, has maintained the credit market well. In India, the rupee has appreciated against the dollar. The world.has confidence in our leadership.

Deb nodded cautiously. Five days earlier, he had tested positive for the coronavirus . Now his family members needed to be tested.They all refused.We cant afford to quarantine, explained Deb, a shopkeeper. If anyone else in his family was found positive, they would all be ordered to stay inside, which would mean even more weeks of not working, which would push the family closer to running out of food.The medical team moved on to the next house. But they kept meeting more refusals.The defiance of the coronavirus rules is being reflected across rural India, and it is propelling this nations virus caseload toward the No. 1 spot globally. Infections are rippling into every corner of this country of 1.3 billion people. The Indian news media is calling it The Rural Surge.In the megacities where the pandemic first hit, vigorous public awareness campaigns have left the populace mostly on guard. But when it comes to government efforts to contain the virus, rural India is resisting.In many villages, no one is wearing masks. There is no social distancing. People are refusing to get tested, and they are hiding their sick.Hospitals are straining; in the coronavirus ward of one hospital here in the state of Tripura, insects were left to crawl over corpses, according to photos from a former government official.In recent trips to more than a dozen rural areas spread across several states, from Tamil Nadu in the south to West Bengal in the far east, to Tripura, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the north, the reaction to the pandemic appeared to be completely different from that of the big cities like Delhi and Mumbai.Out in the rural areas, many people behave as if there is no coronavirus. Even many police officers who have been empowered to enforce the pandemic rules are not wearing masks.This intransigence has helped India catch up with the United States in terms of total infections. US cases are near 7.6 million, compared with Indias 6.8 million, according to a New York Times database. But India outpaces new US cases by 30,000 or so each day, putting it on a path to potentially surpass the United States in the coming weeks.Many people in villages believe their government is overstating the severity of the pandemic and showing no sensitivity to the economic hardship that they are suffering.Government officials have tried to reassure them that they are containing the virus while striking the best possible balance between protecting lives and livelihoods.Officials say Indias caseload is rising because nearly 1 million tests are being performed each day, five times the number a few months ago. They also point to Indias relatively low death rate, about an eighth or ninth of those of the United States, Spain, Brazil and Britain.Scientists say this is mainly because Indias population is younger and leaner, though they caution that most deaths in India, from any cause, are not investigated. And Indias deaths are steadily ticking up, by about 1,000 a day, now totaling about 105,000.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken on all available platforms and underlined the need and importance of wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing, said Manisha Verma , a spokesperson for Indias health ministry. The governments focus, she said, has been on changing behavior rather than enforcement.In fact, even as the coronavirus spreads through the rural regions, other parts of India are loosening containment restrictions to help the stricken economy. This month, the central government is allowing movie theaters to open. Schools can soon reopen if state governments agree.PM Modi locked down the country in March, with four hours notice, to buy time for India to scale up its production of masks and other protective equipment and to open treatment centers. But the severe lockdown spawned an exodus of millions of migrant laborers who could not afford to stay in urban areas. Their movement to rural communities helped spread the virus to nearly every corner of India.We are still in the first wave, said Rajib Acharya, a New Delhi-based research associate at the Population Council, a nonprofit that works on health and development issues.I dont see any new strategy for the rural areas, he added.Rural areas are not well positioned to cope. Nearly two-thirds of all hospital beds in the country are in urban areas, which are home to only one-third of the population.Hospitals around the country are struggling to provide enough oxygen for the rising number of patients. Many people, both in cities and in the countryside, have struggled to find beds for sick family members.Families in India are living in fear, grief, sadness, depression, anxiety and food insecurity, delaying their care from other health conditions, said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. It is a tragic time.She attributed the spread of the virus to habituation, desensitization, fatalism, fatigue, denial.The remote northeastern state of Tripura, heavily forested and largely rural, is a case study in the viruss spread. Before mid-June, the state of about 4 million people had reported a total of fewer than 1,000 infections. Now the total is 27,545, according to state data. Many experts believe that is a fraction of the true number. The states death rate is also steadily increasing, from its first reported death in June to more than 300 deaths now.In Tripuras small towns and villages, many people are scared to get tested because of the social stigma. Neighbors shout at people believed to be positive to stay indoors and to not even look out the window.During a walk through one neighborhood near Chawmanu, where many of the indigenous Tripuri people grow rice, tea and vegetables for a living, villagers pointed toward a small house with a rusty tin roof. One person inside was sick, they said.Aparna Saha, a woman with a penetrating gaze, opened the door. She acknowledged that her 72-year-old father had tested positive and had breathing problems.But, she was quick to add, in a shrill voice, Hes absolutely fine.A few days earlier, health workers had arrived to take Sahas father to a coronavirus facility in a neighboring town. Saha blocked them.Who knows what they will do to him? Saha said. Theres no corona.Even the families that have followed the rules and taken loved ones to hospitals say the experience was horrifying.On a muggy September evening, Rupam Bhattacharyajee broke down outside the Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital, Tripuras only critical care health facility, in the state capital of Agartala.Bhattacharyajees elderly father was inside, sprawled on a mattress on the floor  there were no spare beds  fighting for his life.I am totally helpless, Bhattacharyajee said.A local court is investigating Tripuras pandemic response, following news reports about conditions at the hospital. A photograph believed to have been taken recently in the hospitals coronavirus care center, which was shared with the Times by Sudip Roy Barman, a former state health minister, showed a dead body with insects crawling on it.Debashish Roy, the hospitals medical superintendent, declined to comment.After seeing the conditions inside the hospital, Bhattacharyajee brought his father back home. He paid more than $200 for a private ambulance and made the bumpy six-hour journey sitting in the back, swapping out oxygen cylinders continuously to keep his father breathing.Bhattacharyajee said that his recovering father is lucky to be alive.People are dying, one after another, Bhattacharyajee said. Nobody cares.","masli: sliding out of their rickshaw, masks on, fresh sanitizer smeared across their hands, a team of health workers approached one of the mud-walled homes in masli, a remote village

There is also a possibility of shortage of coal in the coming days, which will affect power generation.In the last nine days, around 10 lakh MT foodgrains (wheat and rice) could not be dispatched under the central pool as the farmers have stopped the trains. This, in turn, will lead to storage problems in the coming days as the stocks will pile up, Punjab Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told this newspaper.In September, approximately 15 lakh MT foodgrains were transported by rail rakes to other states. Expressing concern over the depleting fertilizer stock, Ashu said, As of now only 10-15 per cent of the fertilizer stock is left.The availability of urea is 1.7 lakh MTs against the required 13.5 lakh MT. There is also shortage of jute bags, which is hampering paddy procurement and transportation, he said. While 560 containers of jute bags arriving from West Bengal are stuck in Delhi due to the rail blockade, another 160 containers started today from Kolkata.The minister urged the farmers to at least allow goods trains to start so that movement of foodgrains and other essentials items can resume. An official of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited said, As of now, the thermal plants in the state have a stock ranging from 1 to 6 days.At present the corporation is not running its thermal plants as it is getting electricity at cheap rates from other states and also from private thermal plants within the state.

Agricultural growth, in independent India, has passed through many phases.The new laws are in sync with input subsidy, minimum support price, government procurement and distribution of foodgrains, introduction of contract farming through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act.The share of agriculture workers in the total workforce of the country has come down from 69.9% in 1951 to 54.6% in 2011, according to the Census. In the corresponding period, the share of agriculture as part of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) output has declined from 51.9% to 14.4%. The fall in employment share is not commensurate with the decline in the GDP share. The agriculture sector uses a workforce which far exceeds its economic value. The average income of an agricultural household as against its average monthly consumption is nearly on par.Indias agricultural policy right from Independence was geared towards food sufficiency. Remunerative crop pricing was never a priority. The standard approach towards increasing farmers income was always about devising supplementary means in the form of animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries and bee-keeping. This continued as a matter of policy even after we moved from food scarcity to food surplus.The Green Revolution is seen as the success of new technology, which brought with it high-yielding crops. However, what is often overlooked is the role of farmers. Since 1955, foodgrain imports from the United States (US) under the PL-480 scheme, in excess of market requirement, kept the prices artificially down. This resulted in farmers becoming demoralised. However, when imports were reduced to realistic levels, farmers felt the incentive to produce more. This is what we need today.Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has advocated doubling farmers incomes by 2022 from the levels of 2016. He spoke of remunerative pricing in this regard.On April 13, 2016, the government set up a Committee on Doubling Farmers Income chaired by Dr Ashok Dalwai. The committee, after consultations, came up with 14 reports. The farm laws were based on the insights provided by this committee.There are 23 crops, including 14 kharif, seven rabi and two calendar-year crops for which the government notifies the minimum support price based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. There is no legal prohibition to a farmer selling his/her produce in an open market in pursuit of a better price. What, however, was missing was a legal and marketing architecture to protect and incentivise the farmer.The minimum support price, since its introduction in the 1960s, has remained focused on the wheat belt of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. In the rice belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Assam distress sales were often reported. Today, the wheat belt farmers is agitating, based on the misperception that the minimum support price will be withdrawn. The fact is that the government has provided a better minimum support price over the last six years, and will continue the policy as witnessed by the recent procurement through the minimum support price. The new laws will provide better choices with adequate safeguards to the farmers.The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, provides farmers with a choices that have been denied to them so far. It does not replace the system of Agricultural Produce Market Committee-run mandis, government procurement, or minimum support prices. The 62nd report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture  Agriculture Marketing and Role of Weekly Gramin Haats  highlighted the mess the Agricultural Produce Market Committee-run markets are in.There has clearly been a political usurpation of a democratic institution. In some states, the market fee is levied even for trade transactions taking place outside the market yard, whereas in some states transactions outside the market yard are illegal.A farmer cannot go to a mandi other than that with which he/she is registered. In reply to my unstarred question (No.328 dated February 4), the minister for agriculture said that the government has decided to develop existing 22,000 gramin haats into full-fledged gramin agricultural markets.The fear that market yards will disappear is unfounded. If we continue to do things as before, we will continue to get the same results. We have been hearing of farmer suicides and distress.The prime minister is bringing in positive changes and trying to empower the under-privileged.

Punjab earns an annual revenue of about Rs 3,500 crore from mandi taxes and fee.The study, conducted by a team under SBIs group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh , has also found that apart from Haryana, in no other state do farmers, whose annual income is more than the national average, sell their crops in electronic national agriculture market (e-NAM) mandis.In the case of Punjab, where annual income of agricultural households is almost Rs 2.8 lakh, only 1% farmers are associated with e-NAM.With the government linking mandis under electronic national agriculture market, state taxes should become redundant, says the study.According to the National Sample Surveys 70th round survey on key indicators of situation of agricultural households in India, on an average only 19% of households are aware of MSP and 15% are aware of procurement agency. Only 7% households sell crops to procurement agency and only 10% of total crops are sold at MSP. This indicates that almost 93% of households sell goods in open market and face market imperfections, says the study. None of the new agri-laws directly impinge upon the MSP regime, it adds.According to the study, key challenges such as lack of advanced processing technologies, market disconnects and absence of supply chain infrastructure have led to sub-optimal agri-exports from India. The freedom of choice that these new agri Acts give is a step in the right direction. But, this has to be supported with building infrastructure and educating the farmers about potential income they can generate by moving to other agri-produce, reads the study.India follows a legacy and lopsided system of procurement of primarily cereals that was implemented in the 1960s to benefit from the cereal granary states in north India, primarily Punjab and Haryana, and a large part of edifice of food grain procurement infrastructure is built around such states, says the study. While Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are at first and second number in rice production, food grain procurement is only 18% by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from such states, but in Punjab and Haryana (number 10) which are lower in rice production, the average procurement is still a staggering 90% by FCI. Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of wheat also, but again a laggard in wheat procurement.Therefore, the study says, such lopsided procurement has resulted in significantly skewed income of agricultural households with average income in Punjab at Rs 2.8 lakh being 3-3.5 times higher than states like UP and WB. It has also resulted in disproportionately higher number of farmers on e-NAM from states like UP and minimal from Punjab thus distorting market pricing. Also, uneven procurement across select states resulting in significant burden on exchequer with FCI total outstanding loans from the National Small Saving Fund (NSSF) estimated at Rs 3.22 lakh crore by March 2021.The research team has concluded, FCI is an organisation of grave inefficiencies. It is neither able to manage stock of food grains nor its finances. As of July 1, 2020, the grain stock in the central pool was 822 lakh tonne against the buffer norm of 411 lakh tonne, almost double than the required. This is an example of economic inefficiency.It has also come to the fore that the godown capacity utilisation in some states is unsatisfactory. This is unfortunate that states like UP and WB, which are top producers of rice and wheat, are using only 61% of the godown capacity. This may be due to the fact that these states are unable to procure wheat and rice in appropriate quantities. The trend of mandi prices of wheat and rice indicate that in these states prices are so much less than the annual average and even less than the MSP, reads the study.The study also says that the value of cereals per hectare is 12 times less than fruits and vegetables, but we keep eulogising cereal production. Fruits and vegetables have the highest value of output per hectare followed by condiments and spices. So the country should quickly move up the agri value chain to ensure farm income gets broad-based.","only 19% households aware of msplopsided procurementinefficiencies of fcicereal productionchandigarh: a research study conducted by the state bank of india (sbi) research team has found that the ongoing farmers agitation is not due to the minimum support price (msp) but vested political interests, as some states are concerned about the loss of revenue from mandi taxes and fees.it currently ranges from 8.5% (6% mandi tax and 2.5% fee for handling central procurement) in punjab to less than 1% in some other states. punjab earns an annual revenue of about rs 3,500 crore from mandi taxes and fee.the study, conducted by a team under sbis group chief economic adviser soumya kanti ghosh , has also found that apart from haryana, in no other state do farmers, whose annual income is more than the national average, sell their crops in electronic national agriculture market (e-nam) mandis.in the case of punjab, where annual income of agricultural households is almost rs 2.8 lakh, only 1% farmers are associated with e-nam.with the government linking mandis under electronic national agriculture market, state taxes should become redundant, says the study.according to the national sample surveys 70th round survey on key indicators of situation of agricultural households in india, on an average only 19% of households are aware of msp and 15% are aware of procurement agency. only 7% households sell crops to procurement agency and only 10% of total crops are sold at msp. this indicates that almost 93% of households sell goods in open market and face market imperfections, says the study. none of the new agri-laws directly impinge upon the msp regime, it adds.according to the study, key challenges such as lack of advanced processing technologies, market disconnects and absence of supply chain infrastructure have led to sub-optimal agri-exports from india. the freedom of choice that these new agri acts give is a step in the right direction. but, this has to be supported with building infrastructure and educating the farmers about potential income they can generate by moving to other agri-produce, reads the study.india follows a legacy and lopsided system of procurement of primarily cereals that was implemented in the 1960s to benefit from the cereal granary states in north india, primarily punjab and haryana, and a large part of edifice of food grain procurement infrastructure is built around such states, says the study. while uttar pradesh and west bengal are at first and second number in rice production, food grain procurement is only 18% by the food corporation of india (fci) from such states, but in punjab and haryana (number 10) which are lower in rice production, the average procurement is still a staggering 90% by fci. uttar pradesh is the largest producer of wheat also, but again a laggard in wheat procurement.therefore, the study says, such lopsided procurement has resulted in significantly skewed income of agricultural households with average income in punjab at rs 2.8 lakh being 3-3.5 times higher than states like up and wb. it has also resulted in disproportionately higher number of farmers on e-nam from states like up and minimal from punjab thus distorting market pricing. also, uneven procurement across select states resulting in significant burden on exchequer with fci total outstanding loans from the national small saving fund (nssf) estimated at rs 3.22 lakh crore by march 2021.the research team has concluded, fci is an organisation of grave inefficiencies. it is neither able to manage stock of food grains nor its finances. as of july 1, 2020, the grain stock in the central pool was 822 lakh tonne against the buffer norm of 411 lakh tonne, almost double than the required. this is an example of economic inefficiency.it has also come to the fore that the godown capacity utilisation in some states is unsatisfactory. this is unfortunate that states like up and wb, which are top producers of rice and wheat, are using only 61% of the godown capacity. this may be due to the fact that these states are unable to procure wheat and rice in appropriate quantities. the trend of mandi prices of wheat and rice indicate that in these states prices are so much less than the annual average and even less than the msp, reads the study.the study also says that the value of cereals per hectare is 12 times less than fruits and vegetables, but we keep eulogising cereal production. fruits and vegetables have the highest value of output per hectare followed by condiments and spices. so the country should quickly move up the agri value chain to ensure farm income gets broad-based."

(Photo credit: Windows Production House/Facebook)When Debanjana Sarkar got married last year, she had deviated from several Bengali traditions even before her wedding day. For starters, she had chosen December 28 for her wedding date, which according to the Hindu lunar calendar, is not considered auspicious. Traditionalists will say that Bengalis dont get married during this month, but we wanted all our relatives and friends to come and this was a convenient date. That was just the start of all the rigid wedding traditions that the 28-year-old was going to break.Approximately a decade ago, when Sarkar was a college student, she had first seen a woman priest conduct wedding rituals, a profession that has traditionally been the domain of men, when her college professor Nandini Bhowmik sat down to conduct her own daughters wedding rituals.The Shubhamastu quartet at Debanjana Sarkars wedding in 2019. (Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar) The Shubhamastu quartet at Debanjana Sarkars wedding in 2019. (Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar)I had never seen a mother observe her daughters wedding, let alone perform the wedding rituals as a priest, says Sarkar. Deeply inspired, Sarkar knew then that when she got married, she wanted a woman to conduct the ceremony. 60-year-old Bhowmik heads Shubhamastu, a four-member team of women priests in West Bengal who have been working for close to a decade, conducting rituals for everything from weddings to funerals and other religious festivals in between.While women priests in India are not unusual, they are not the norm either. Now, the re-release of the Bengali film Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti scheduled for October 21, during Durga Puja, has put the spotlight back on the roles of women in religious ceremonies. The film starring Ritabhari Chakrabarty and Soham Majumdar had originally released on March 6 this year, but screenings were abruptly halted when the Indian government initiated a nationwide lockdown two weeks later to curb the coronavirus outbreak.The film, inspired by Bhowmiks life and work, tells the story of Chakrabortys character Shabari, a woman priest and Sanskrit lecturer, who tries to navigate the challenges that life throws at her after her marriage into a conservative family that does not subscribe to her views on womens roles and participation in religious practices. Priesthood is a work of devotion. Contact with God can be established only if youre pure in body and mind. But a womans body can never be pure, and so women do not have the right to work as a priest, says one character in the film, referring to menstruation. It is really this dialogue that forms the premise of the film.A still from Bengali film Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti where Ritabhari Chakraborty plays Shabari, a woman priest, who faces opposition for her participation in religious practices.

(Photo credit: Windows Production House/ FacebookMenstrual untouchability and the Sabarimala temple controversy are some issues addressed in the film, but these are just the more visible examples. Ancient scriptures dont ban menstruating women from performing religious rituals, explains Bhowmick, a guest lecturer at Jadavpur Universitys department of Sanskrit. But over the centuries, the interpretation of the Vedas, the large body of ancient religious texts that form the basis of Hinduism, has been adulterated to such an extent that much of the interpretation of the original teachings and rituals have been completely altered, she says.There are no curbs on women from becoming priests either. On the contrary, a closer reading of these ancient texts first written in the 15th century, indicate their presence and involvement in several rituals. Women philosophers and priests like Ghosha Kakshivati, Vak Ambhrini and Vishvavara Atreyi have also composed and contributed hymns pertaining to marriage in the Rigveda that continue to be used in rituals today.It is not clear when the roles of women in Hindu religious practices changed, but researchers believe the change coincided with the imposition of the caste system and the introduction of the concept of purity based on this. Freedoms were severely curbed and womens roles were relegated indoors, under the supervision and control of patriarchal institutions.Nandini Bhowmick during a ritual at Debanjana Sarkars wedding. (Photo credit: Debanja Sarkar) Nandini Bhowmick during a ritual at Debanjana Sarkars wedding. (Photo credit: Debanja Sarkar)In the film, Shabari is not given away by her father in marriage. We dont find traces of kanyadaan in the Rigveda. Women were not commodities to be given away, explains Bhowmickk, who was consulted by the filmmakers during the films production.Sarkars father did not give her away in marriage. Unlike the character of Shabari whose in-laws initially refuse to accept her because she hasnt been given away in marriage, Sarkars husband and his family had no such reservations. A girl is not a commodity to be given away, she says. I will remain my fathers daughter after marriage. After When I learned about what kanyadaan meant, I found the ritual insulting, she says.When Sarkar had expressed her desire to do things differently in her wedding, including replacing male priests with women, and altering many rituals to ensure that she was equal to her then-fiance in every way, nobody objected, not even the traditionalists in the family. But it wasnt that there were no questions from people in the extended family distant relatives. Women priests at weddings are not commonplace in India and for many, they remain a novel sight. My grandmother rationalised it this way: she prays at home, so why cant women do it after learning and training on a larger platform? says Sarkar.Debanjana applies vermillion to her husbands forehead on their wedding day, diverging from customary practices. (Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar) Debanjana applies vermillion to her husbands forehead on their wedding day, diverging from customary practices. (Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar)Sarkar says her husbands family also accepted these changes and was respectful of the couples desires. One of the changes that Bhowmik and her group have introduced to wedding ceremonies is when the groom fills the brides forehead with vermillion. Traditionally the woman only accepts the vermillion, but in Bhowmiks interpretation of the rituals, she becomes an equal participant by putting some on the grooms forehead in return.Many rituals in Hindu marriages are patriarchal in form in part because the brides used to be very young, as old as five or six years in age, when they would get married, researchers explain. In Bengali weddings, the bride is carried to the groom on a pidhi (wooden seat) because the girls were too young to do it themselves, says Bhowmik. During the saptapadi, the groom leads the bride and helps her put khoi (puffed rice) into the fire because the boys were usually older back then. Although these days the bride and groom are adults, the rituals have rigidly remained the same.Debanja Sarkar and her husband during the bhaat-kapor ritual where he promises to take responsibility for her food and clothing for the rest of his life.

(Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar)At her in-laws home, Sarkar amended a post-marriage ritual too. In Bengali tradition, during the bhaat-kapor ritual, the husband holds a plate of rice and a few clothes, touching it to his wifes head, promising to take responsibility for her food and clothing for the rest of his life. Since we are both independent professionals, we both participated in the ritual. In fact, it was my mother-in-law who suggested that we do this.Debanja Sarkar and her husband during the bhaat-kapor ritual where she promises to take responsibility for his food and clothing for the rest of her life, in a divergence from tradition. (Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar) Debanja Sarkar and her husband during the bhaat-kapor ritual where she promises to take responsibility for his food and clothing for the rest of her life, in a divergence from tradition. (Photo credit: Debanjana Sarkar)Nobody wants to accept unnecessary rituals. Back then, women didnt have avenues for achieving independence. Now, so many women are earning more than men, so (the bhaat-kapor ritual) has no relevance. Neither the film and nor Bhowmik say rituals need to be completely done away with; it is really about encouraging people to make small changes to religious practices and beliefs to make them more equal and unbiased, she explains. Shabaris character in the film puts it more succinctly: My goal is to emancipate priesthood from the clutches of patriarchy.There are about a dozen formal institutions in India and many more informal schools scattered across the country that train women to become priests, but there is no data on the number of practising women priests. The Jnana Prabodhini in Pune is among the oldest, and has an entire department dedicated to training men and women in the profession. Dr. Manisha Shete, 51, who works as a priest and is the coordinator at the institutes Sanskrit Sanskruti Sangshodhika department, established in 1975, that teaches purohitya as a subject, says the institution sets itself apart from the others because it takes in students regardless of caste  unusual because only Brahmins traditionally work in this profession.When Shete had first started her training at Jnana Prabodhini in 2006, approximately 50 percent of the students were women. But over the past five years that has changed and more women have been coming in to learn, with 35 women presently studying at the institution. Usually we have seen that unmarried women, widows, divorcees and infertile women were told that they couldnt become priests. Traditionally women priests arent accepted, but these women are even less accepted. We encourage them to come to learn, she says.In a Maharashtrian thread ceremony, a woman priest, a former student of Jnana Prabodhini, is seen explaining the five vows to the batu, the child whose ceremony is being conducted, in a process called deeksha grahan. The vows focus on the dos and donts which the child needs to follow after the completion of the thread ceremony to become a sincere student. Usually, this thread ceremony is performed only for boys but at Jnana Prabodhini, the priests perform it for girls as well, irrespective of caste.

(Photo credit: Dr. Manisha Shete)A woman priest can do everything a man can. If we say women can do everything today, why cant she pray during periods, questions Shete. People claim (menstrual untouchability) was for the womans benefit when they didnt have access to privacy inside homes and facilities for hygiene, but periods dont mean the woman is impure. Why cant women engage in rituals during periods?The singling out of womens bodies as the reason why they cant become priests has been attributed and whittled down to their biological functions for decades, but Shete considers that to be a misinterpretation of the very texts that are cited in defence of these arguments. We have prayers that say the body can be impure but if the individual remembers God, then they are pure inside and out.A woman priest is explaining pinda dana, an offering to ancestors. Ceremonies like shradh or pind dana that are conducted for ancestors are done only by men, but here the priest and the host are both female. The priest is a former student of Jnana Prabodhini.

(Photo credit: Dr. Manisha Shete)In 2000, when Professor Netai Chakraborty started a tol  an informal Sanskrit school  in Kolkata, he began encouraging women to come in to learn along with men. Back then, it was uncommon to see women undertake this training and Chakraborty had to turn to the women in his own family. I started with recruiting my wife and other women in the neighbourhood, saying it was to teach them how to do their everyday prayers well. From there it expanded to other rituals and I tried to find ways to involve women in various religious practises to make it commonplace in peoples eyes.In the two decades that he has run the tol, some 30 to 35 women have studied under his tutelage. Many male purohit cannot accept women priests and so women are hesitant to pursue it. Even my wife doesnt have the courage to go out and practice. Hopefully this will change, says Chakraborty.Perhaps the change is already happening. Bhowmiks colleague Ruma Roy, 59, has been noticing how more women have been asking for Shubhamastu to conduct their weddings. While Bhowmik and Roy, having had studied Sanskrit in college, chant hymns and mantras, the other two group members, Seymanti Banerjee and Paulomi Chakraborty, sing Rabindra Sangeet songs, selections from Rabindranath Tagores socially progressive compositions that are appropriate in the context of weddings. We arent trained priests, admits Roy, but she says the group gets more bookings than they can accommodate for various kinds of religious ceremonies, from births to funerals, because they dont simply recite the hymns, but explain what each means in a relatable way.Sometimes we (women) have to take the first step. You cant change a 1,000-year-old tradition in one day, says Shete. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(photo credit: debanja sarkar)in the film, shabari is not given away by her father in marriage. we dont find traces of kanyadaan in the rigveda. women were not commodities to be given away, explains bhowmickk, who was consulted by the filmmakers during the films production.sarkars father did not give her away in marriage. unlike the character of shabari whose in-laws initially refuse to accept her because she hasnt been given away in marriage, sarkars husband and his family had no such reservations. a girl is not a commodity to be given away, she says. i will remain my fathers daughter after marriage. after when i learned about what kanyadaan meant, i found the ritual insulting, she says.when sarkar had expressed her desire to do things differently in her wedding, including replacing male priests with women, and altering many rituals to ensure that she was equal to her then-fiance in every way, nobody objected, not even the traditionalists in the family. but it wasnt that there were no questions from people in the extended family distant relatives. women priests at weddings are not commonplace in india and for many, they remain a novel sight. my grandmother rationalised it this way: she prays at home, so why cant women do it after learning and training on a larger platform? says sarkar.debanjana applies vermillion to her husbands forehead on their wedding day, diverging from customary practices. (photo credit: debanjana sarkar) debanjana applies vermillion to her husbands forehead on their wedding day, diverging from customary practices. (photo credit: debanjana sarkar)sarkar says her husbands family also accepted these changes and was respectful of the couples desires. one of the changes that bhowmik and her group have introduced to wedding ceremonies is when the groom fills the brides forehead with vermillion. traditionally the woman only accepts the vermillion, but in bhowmiks interpretation of the rituals, she becomes an equal participant by putting some on the grooms forehead in return.many rituals in hindu marriages are patriarchal in form in part because the brides used to be very young, as old as five or six years in age, when they would get married, researchers explain. in bengali weddings, the bride is carried to the groom on a pidhi (wooden seat) because the girls were too young to do it themselves, says bhowmik. during the saptapadi, the groom leads the bride and helps her put khoi (puffed rice) into the fire because the boys were usually older back then. although these days the bride and groom are adults, the rituals have rigidly remained the same.debanja sarkar and her husband during the bhaat-kapor ritual where he promises to take responsibility for her food and clothing for the rest of his life.

(photo credit: debanjana sarkar)at her in-laws home, sarkar amended a post-marriage ritual too. in bengali tradition, during the bhaat-kapor ritual, the husband holds a plate of rice and a few clothes, touching it to his wifes head, promising to take responsibility for her food and clothing for the rest of his life. since we are both independent professionals, we both participated in the ritual. in fact, it was my mother-in-law who suggested that we do this.debanja sarkar and her husband during the bhaat-kapor ritual where she promises to take responsibility for his food and clothing for the rest of her life, in a divergence from tradition. (photo credit: debanjana sarkar) debanja sarkar and her husband during the bhaat-kapor ritual where she promises to take responsibility for his food and clothing for the rest of her life, in a divergence from tradition. (photo credit: debanjana sarkar)nobody wants to accept unnecessary rituals. back then, women didnt have avenues for achieving independence. now, so many women are earning more than men, so (the bhaat-kapor ritual) has no relevance. neither the film and nor bhowmik say rituals need to be completely done away with; it is really about encouraging people to make small changes to religious practices and beliefs to make them more equal and unbiased, she explains. shabaris character in the film puts it more succinctly: my goal is to emancipate priesthood from the clutches of patriarchy.there are about a dozen formal institutions in india and many more informal schools scattered across the country that train women to become priests, but there is no data on the number of practising women priests. the jnana prabodhini in pune is among the oldest, and has an entire department dedicated to training men and women in the profession. dr. manisha shete, 51, who works as a priest and is the coordinator at the institutes sanskrit sanskruti sangshodhika department, established in 1975, that teaches purohitya as a subject, says the institution sets itself apart from the others because it takes in students regardless of caste  unusual because only brahmins traditionally work in this profession.when shete had first started her training at jnana prabodhini in 2006, approximately 50 percent of the students were women. but over the past five years that has changed and more women have been coming in to learn, with 35 women presently studying at the institution. usually we have seen that unmarried women, widows, divorcees and infertile women were told that they couldnt become priests. traditionally women priests arent accepted, but these women are even less accepted. we encourage them to come to learn, she says.in a maharashtrian thread ceremony, a woman priest, a former student of jnana prabodhini, is seen explaining the five vows to the batu, the child whose ceremony is being conducted, in a process called deeksha grahan. the vows focus on the dos and donts which the child needs to follow after the completion of the thread ceremony to become a sincere student. usually, this thread ceremony is performed only for boys but at jnana prabodhini, the priests perform it for girls as well, irrespective of caste.

(photo credit: dr. manisha shete)a woman priest can do everything a man can. if we say women can do everything today, why cant she pray during periods, questions shete. people claim (menstrual untouchability) was for the womans benefit when they didnt have access to privacy inside homes and facilities for hygiene, but periods dont mean the woman is impure. why cant women engage in rituals during periods?the singling out of womens bodies as the reason why they cant become priests has been attributed and whittled down to their biological functions for decades, but shete considers that to be a misinterpretation of the very texts that are cited in defence of these arguments. we have prayers that say the body can be impure but if the individual remembers god, then they are pure inside and out.a woman priest is explaining pinda dana, an offering to ancestors. ceremonies like shradh or pind dana that are conducted for ancestors are done only by men, but here the priest and the host are both female. the priest is a former student of jnana prabodhini.

(photo credit: dr. manisha shete)in 2000, when professor netai chakraborty started a tol  an informal sanskrit school  in kolkata, he began encouraging women to come in to learn along with men. back then, it was uncommon to see women undertake this training and chakraborty had to turn to the women in his own family. i started with recruiting my wife and other women in the neighbourhood, saying it was to teach them how to do their everyday prayers well. from there it expanded to other rituals and i tried to find ways to involve women in various religious practises to make it commonplace in peoples eyes.in the two decades that he has run the tol, some 30 to 35 women have studied under his tutelage. many male purohit cannot accept women priests and so women are hesitant to pursue it. even my wife doesnt have the courage to go out and practice. hopefully this will change, says chakraborty.perhaps the change is already happening. bhowmiks colleague ruma roy, 59, has been noticing how more women have been asking for shubhamastu to conduct their weddings. while bhowmik and roy, having had studied sanskrit in college, chant hymns and mantras, the other two group members, seymanti banerjee and paulomi chakraborty, sing rabindra sangeet songs, selections from rabindranath tagores socially progressive compositions that are appropriate in the context of weddings. we arent trained priests, admits roy, but she says the group gets more bookings than they can accommodate for various kinds of religious ceremonies, from births to funerals, because they dont simply recite the hymns, but explain what each means in a relatable way.sometimes we (women) have to take the first step. you cant change a 1,000-year-old tradition in one day, says shete. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest kolkata news, download indian express app. ie online media services pvt ltd"

We could never see our grandmother again.I never got to attend school till after my teenage years. I still fail to understand what our fault was.Yin Marsh was 13-years-old when her father was suddenly taken away from her. With her mother away in Nepal in search of business, the teenager had to care for her ageing grandmother and her eight-year-old brother all by herself in Darjeeling. As she struggled, she wondered why her otherwise cordial neighbours never reached out to her. And even before the girl could make sense of what she described as a traumatic situation, she was reunited with her father  in the prison.Marsh wasnt the only one. Eight-year-old Monica Liu and her family were all packed and ready in Shillong when the police came for them. They understood the signs and were sure they were going to be away for long.As a war broke out between India and China, several Chinese people of Indian origin were rounded up under the Defence of India Act, 1962. Suspected of being spies or Chinese sympathisers, more than 3,000 Indian Chinese living in Kalimpong, Shillong and Kolkata were put on a train and transported thousands of miles away from their homes to an internment camp in Rajasthans Deoli.When the war broke out, my father was more concerned about the welfare of the Indian soldiers. He felt they were not suitably clad for the warfare in the cold mountains and were supplied poor weapons. Suddenly one afternoon, someone came to our house to speak to my father and asked him to go with him to the police station for questioning. He never returned home, recalled Marsh, who is now residing in California.Marsh, who was well-known because of the family restaurant in the locality, wondered why no one came forward to help. We didnt know where our father was and why he was taken away. Initially, I tried to seek help from our friends and even visited the convent school I used to attend. But everyone appeared to be scared. No one came forward. We were advised not to venture out. For a whole month, I felt clueless and worried about us being taken away as well, she added.Echoing similar sentiment, 67-year-old Liu recalled how as a kid, she first went to the Shillong jail with her kin before being pushed onto the train.The camp was divided into five wings and surrounded by watch towers on all sides.

Marsh has provided a detailed account of the Deoli camp in her book titled Doing Time with Nehru: The Story of an Indian Chinese Family.She also recalled how a majority of the deaths that took place during her stay in the camp for over five years were mainly due to heat stroke, besides diarrhoea. I had a friend from Assam in the camp itself. We used to play together. One afternoon, someone came running to our room to inform us that he had died. We later learnt that it was due to the heat, she said.Besides the living condition, the survivors also recalled the horrible food they were compelled to eat till they were allowed to cook on their own. In the beginning, the food was almost inedible. I dont think the staff ever had to cook for thousands of people. The rice and dal were always undercooked. At one time, we were even given camel meat which was tough and rubbery. We assumed that they must have found a dead camel and decided to cook it for us, Marsh said.It was not until the internees rebelled that each of them was handed over their own share of ration to prepare food. With time, the food improved. In the beginning, there was always rice, dal, chapati and some vegetable. On rare occasions, we used to get meat, she added.Joy Ma with her brothers Lynden [left] and William [right].After a week or so, the Indian government offered the detainees the choice of returning to China on repatriation ships. Initially, rumours made the rounds that only the men would be sent and women kept behind. Later, the government made it optional for those who wished to leave. While some agreed, others opted to stay in the camp and wait for their release.My brother and I were the first ones to be released after three months. We were picked up by the friends of my mother and taken to Delhi, where we were put on a plane to Nepal since she was already there. My grandmother was released after eight months due to poor health. She lived with my uncle and cousin in Kolkata and they left for Taiwan in 1964 when life in India became intolerable for them, Marsh said.On the other hand, Liu recollected how her parents remained divided over the issue.All that my mother wanted was an education for us. But my father said that we had no one in China. At one point, my mom even proposed to leave with three of her kids while keeping the remaining two with my father. After many fights, they dropped the idea and stayed together.Monica Liu, who spent over five years in the Deoli camp, now owns a chain of restaurants in Kolkata.

My parents were not allowed to return to Hasimara and were taken to Kolkata where there were given no resources to rebuild their lives. They had to start from the scratch, she said.It was around 1968 that the remaining internees were freed from the Rajasthan camp. But their ordeal was far from over. A few families spent nine months in an Assam jail until Liu wrote a letter to the then Assam Home Minister and was visited by an official. After a few days, the government decided to free us. They asked us where we wanted to go. My father chose Shillong since we were already living there before the war, she added.The photo shows a truck being dragged along the hilly terrain during Sino-Indian 1962 war.

(Express photo by Mayura Janwalkar)Their ghar is gone because the rent cannot be paid so the Baudh family has moved to their karkhana whose owner has given them some time to pay.Seated on its floor in a chawl near Juhu Gally, Anant (8), Arpit (6) and Anshika (2), watch a Marathi childrens rhyme on the only smartphone they have. This was where workers employed by their father Akash Baudh stitched garments until the lockdown in March. This has been the Baudh home through the months of the lockdown after he moved out of his rented house, unable to make the Rs 14,000 monthly rent. This room, its monthly rent of Rs 8000 pending for six months, has six industrial sewing machines and swathes of fabric wrapped in plastic. In a corner is a stove, a gas cylinder and some utensils.Since March, he has sold eight of his 15 sewing machines to pay his bills. Bought at Rs 17,000 per unit, he parted with the five-year-old machines for Rs 7,000 each. Aap sochiye agar mera yeh haal hai toh mere neeche ke karigar ka kya haal hoga (Imagine if this is my state, whats the plight of the workers I employ.) said Baudh.Baudhs is a story playing out across the city as the Covid lockdown winds down but small businesses dont know where the keys to demand are. Since he fled his Mau home in UP when he was 15, tormented by upper-caste schoolmates and teachers, he said, Baudh did odd tailoring jobs and stitched his own Mumbai story by growing his business to employ 15 workers. He sold garments to retailers selling mostly on footpaths. Every month, he made at least Rs 20,000 over and above salaries, rent and utility bills.After six months of the lockdown, however, Baudh has his back against the wall. He has over Rs 1 lakh in unpaid rent and the balance in his bank account is as good as zero.I had workers from UP, Bihar, West Bengal. As soon as Janata curfew was announced on March 22, I bought tickets for all of them, sent them home, but after that I was left with nothing. And there was no earning, said Baudh.His wife Seema and he are both skilled dressmakers and desperately looking for work. I am ready to do any kind of work. Stitch, drive or run somebodys shop but I need work immediately, said Baudh.The young father of three is among thousands in Mumbai yet to the see any glimmer at the end of the lockdown tunnel. Surviving on donated rations but unable to qualify for relief schemes, their informal business out of the safety nets announced by the government, they are struggling to stay afloat.Kabhi socha nahi tha kisi ke aage haath phailana padega (I had never thought I would have to beg someone for favours), said Syed Lateef Habib (52), a widower and a father of two daughters aged ten and seven. Habib earned Rs 15,000 a month. He said the family lived comfortably in their rented home in Naigaon, a distant suburb in the neighbouring Vasai-Virar belt where Habib worked as an autorickshaw driver.In April, days after the COVID-19 pandemic struck, work came to a standstill and he left his daughters with his sister in Khar and he, meanwhile, found a temporary home in a community kitchen-cum-training centre run by NGO Ghar Bachao, Ghar Banao Andolan in the Ambujwadi slum in Malad.I had to vacate my rented room because I hadnt made any money for rent. I sleep here, he said pointing to the community kitchen. Habib helps out with whatever is needed like carrying heavy jerry cans of water to cook the rice and odd plumbing jobs occasionally making a few hundred rupees.He is behind on repaying a loan of Rs 2.10 lakh he took to buy his autorickshaw, of which Rs 40,000 remain unpaid. I have made no money in over six months. How will I repay the loan? I have no money for fuel or maintenance of my rickshaw either, he said.In the pandemic scare, single parent Manju Raju Sable, had to give up her job as a housekeeper in Chembur as she feared using public transport would expose her and her two daughters to the virus. During the lockdown, she got her eldest 20-year old daughter married.I realised that I had to start my search for a living afresh, said Mankhurd resident Sable, recalling her struggle to dust herself up after her husband left her. She mortgaged her jewellery for Rs 15,000 to start a small business.With the money from her mortgage set aside for daily expenses, she travels to the APMC market in Vashi, Navi Mumbai, nearly 10 km away where, like many women, she buys garlic in sacks, carries them home. Since local trains are yet to resume service for all, very few of them come to buy the garlic. I end up selling most of it to locals here, Sable said. This fetches around Rs 8000 a month that she uses for living expenses.Raju Nadars Idli-Dosa stand on a footpath near the Income Tax Office at Churchgate was staple breakfast for officegoers for 35 years. For the last six months, however, Nadar had to wind up his business. He owes his landlord Rs 20,000 in rent for a room he shared with five in a Wadala chawl. His wife, back in their village Karaikudi in Tamil Nadu, has had to pawn a gold chain to a local jeweller for Rs 30,000, to help her husband tide over the lockdown months in Mumbai.We could make Rs 4,000 a day easily before the lockdown and after paying my assistants I would still make about Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000 a month and have about Rs 5,000 to send back to my family, said Nadar. With no income and unexpected expenses, Nadar said he has been tested like never before.Back home, we didnt have a phone for that but my son had to attend his B.Sc lectures. I had to ask my sister to buy him a phone worth Rs 9,000 so he could attend class, said Nadar.Its been a week since Nadar has been open for business again. The crowd is not even 20 percent of our usual customers. It is difficult to make even Rs 2,000 a day at this rate. We have to keep trying since we have nothing else to fall back on, says Nadar.In June, the Pradhan Mantri Street Vendors AtmaNirbhar Nidhi Yojana was announced to facilitate working capital loan up to Rs 10,000 for street vendors and hawkers. Hairder Imam, General Secretary of the All Indian Trade Union Congress ( AITUC) Hawkers Union, that has about 6,500 members, said so far none of their union members has benefited.The BMC had asked us and all our union members to fill forms for the scheme but most of us got a message from the bank stating our application was found ineligible. No reasons were given, the scheme seems like something done to contain the anger of the poor, he said.Across India, about 2 lakh street vendors have been given the interest-free loan so far of the over 20 lakh who applied.Pankaj Kumar, Development Commissioner (Unorganised Labour), said his office has got requests for help from several of about 300 occupations that come under unorganised labour. Whoever was self-employed has been affected the mostMany establishments have begun work but we cannot say that everyone who was working prior to the lockdown has found work again. We are working towards mitigating the problems they are facing, said Kumar.Thats not going to be easy given the lack of clear targeting mechanisms, said Amita Bhide, Dean, School of Habitat Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. The entire economy has faced losses and the formal and informal sectors are intertwined. So while the formal sector revives that may bring decent opportunities, but to fewer people. This may cause an increase in the proportion of destitution, she said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Shah reportedly told the leaders that they should be determined to achieve this target instead of making just an effort.The minister surprised everyone by not wearing a mask although other BJP leaders around him followed the safety protocol.Halfway through the meeting, Shah took a break and went to Chaturdihi village with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, national vice-president Mukul Roy and other leaders to have lunch at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a member of the local tribal community. Shah sat on the floor with others and had rice, chapati, dal and curry cooked in earthenware. He had all the items but stayed away from rosogolla, the traditional Bengali sweet, saying he had stopped taking sweet dishes.Significantly, former national secretary Rahul Sinha, who distanced himself from the party for more than two weeks after being dropped from the national committee, also attended the organisational meeting.About three hours before he had lunch at the tribal village, Shah said that the death knell of the Mamata Banerjee government has been sounded and the BJP will come to power with a two-third majority in the coming elections.The manner in which the Mamata Banerjee government has neglected the poor, the farmers, the backward classes and the tribal people and have oppressed people, especially BJP workers, I can clearly see that its death knell has been sounded. In the coming days, the BJP will come to power with two-third majority and form the government, Shah told the media shortly after garlanding the statue of Birsa Munda, the leader of the freedom movement carried out by tribal people in the region against the British Raj.I appeal to the people to overthrow this government and give the BJP the opportunity to build sonar Bangla (a golden Bengal), said Shah.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee reacted to this while addressing an administrative meeting at the state secretariat in Kolkata around the same time when Shah was having lunch more than 200 km away.We will not tolerate the politics of threat. People should stay within their limits. People of Bengal will not accept outsiders, Banerjee said without naming Shah.Without naming the BJP, she said, A party is spreading the pandemic while common people are following Covid-19 health restrictions.Shah arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night. He flew to Bankura in a chopper a little before noon on Thursday.You (Mamata Banerjee) are wrong if you think that you can stop the BJP by stopping Central schemes in West Bengal. If you let people enjoy the benefits of these schemes they may at least spare some thoughts for you, said Shah after the short garlanding ceremony of the Birsa Munda statue organised by the BJP.The BJP showed its best performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bankura district. It won two seats and stayed ahead of the TMC in almost all the assembly segments.Amit Shahs ambition of winning 200 assembly seats will remain a dream. Let BJP first find an acceptable face of its state leadership before contesting the polls, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said in Kolkata.","indiaupdated: nov 05, 2020, 17:12 istthe bharatiya janata party (bjp) should win more than 200 seats in the west bengal assembly elections in 2021, union home minister and the partys former national president amit shah told leaders from 13 districts at a meeting in bankura district on thursday afternoon.a district bjp leader who attended the closed-door meeting said shah asked the district and state leaders to strengthen the organization right down to the polling booth level to ensure that the bjp wins more than 200 of the states 294 assembly seats. shah reportedly told the leaders that they should be determined to achieve this target instead of making just an effort.the minister surprised everyone by not wearing a mask although other bjp leaders around him followed the safety protocol.halfway through the meeting, shah took a break and went to chaturdihi village with bjp state president dilip ghosh, national general secretary kailash vijayvargiya, national secretary arvind menon, national vice-president mukul roy and other leaders to have lunch at the home of bibhishan hansda, a member of the local tribal community. shah sat on the floor with others and had rice, chapati, dal and curry cooked in earthenware. he had all the items but stayed away from rosogolla, the traditional bengali sweet, saying he had stopped taking sweet dishes.significantly, former national secretary rahul sinha, who distanced himself from the party for more than two weeks after being dropped from the national committee, also attended the organisational meeting.about three hours before he had lunch at the tribal village, shah said that the death knell of the mamata banerjee government has been sounded and the bjp will come to power with a two-third majority in the coming elections.the manner in which the mamata banerjee government has neglected the poor, the farmers, the backward classes and the tribal people and have oppressed people, especially bjp workers, i can clearly see that its death knell has been sounded. in the coming days, the bjp will come to power with two-third majority and form the government, shah told the media shortly after garlanding the statue of birsa munda, the leader of the freedom movement carried out by tribal people in the region against the british raj.i appeal to the people to overthrow this government and give the bjp the opportunity to build sonar bangla (a golden bengal), said shah.chief minister mamata banerjee reacted to this while addressing an administrative meeting at the state secretariat in kolkata around the same time when shah was having lunch more than 200 km away.we will not tolerate the politics of threat. people should stay within their limits. people of bengal will not accept outsiders, banerjee said without naming shah.without naming the bjp, she said, a party is spreading the pandemic while common people are following covid-19 health restrictions.shah arrived in kolkata on wednesday night. he flew to bankura in a chopper a little before noon on thursday.you (mamata banerjee) are wrong if you think that you can stop the bjp by stopping central schemes in west bengal. if you let people enjoy the benefits of these schemes they may at least spare some thoughts for you, said shah after the short garlanding ceremony of the birsa munda statue organised by the bjp.the bjp showed its best performance in the 2019 lok sabha polls in bankura district. it won two seats and stayed ahead of the tmc in almost all the assembly segments.amit shahs ambition of winning 200 assembly seats will remain a dream. let bjp first find an acceptable face of its state leadership before contesting the polls, tmc lok sabha member and party spokesperson saugata roy said in kolkata."

We spoke to kids about life in the pandemicmore-lifestyleUpdated: Nov 06, 2020, 20:16 ISTTheyre worried; they miss the world. Yet, the growing hasnt stopped. And the world is still full of wonder. Yet, just how much of 2020 theyve really been able to bear. School, that half day of chatter, learning, unlearning and finding your place among your peers, has shrunk to a tinny-voiced screen. Playground friendships have unravelled. There are no scraped knees this year. No falling off bicycles, dusting yourself off and getting back on. No everyday adventures in the big bad world. No escape from the grown-ups.Its no wonder, then, that when we asked kids across India to tell us what they liked and what they missed most during this pandemic, the responses were as wide-ranging and they were heartbreaking.Of course theyre missing normalcy: I miss the rush and sound of horns of Hyderabad says one child. Another in Delhi misses Tuesday spring rolls at the school canteen.The child of a toddy tapper in Kerala is concerned about the familys finances. And one child in rural West Bengal is glad for afternoons because it means quiet time to paint.Indias children are missing school, teachers, a separated parent, a friend. But most of all, theyre missing the freedom to walk a few steps further, stay out half an hour longer, test newfound strengths and new autonomies upon the world beyond their home.Theyve lost one summer alreadyno cousins, no eating raw mangoes straight from the tree. Now, a very different festive season is here. As one child put it: My biggest worry is, when will the disease go away and when will I be able to go to school again?How will Indias children remember 2020? As a series of questions the grown-ups couldnt answer? As a blip along the path of growing up? A collective trauma they wont be able to articulate until later? Or a shared memory we adults may never understand? Here are some answers.Pencil on paper, Ria Chawda. Mumbai, 2020.IM WORKING ON AN ALBUMRia Chawda, 16; MumbaiJB Petit High School for GirlsThe lockdown has been rather hectic for me. Online schooling started a couple of weeks ago, and Ive had to adjust to this new way of learning. Its been tough, staring at the screen for eight hours a day. Having said that, it hasnt been all bad. The fact that I can eat and sleep at any time during the day (including during school) has been great.During the lockdown, I did not learn a new skill but instead tried to get better at the things I love. I love music and spent a lot of time on my guitar and at my keyboard. I worked on my song-writing and am trying to produce stuff on my laptop. I should have a full album soon.Ive also been working on my portfolio for university liberal arts and music. And Ive been reading a lot.I do miss the outdoors; its been nine months since I played badminton and the courts havent reopened yet, Chawda says.I do miss the outdoors; its been nine months since I played badminton and the courts havent reopened yet. I miss going to CCI [Cricket Club of India]; it used to be like a second home. And I miss human interaction. Of course I chat with my friends, but its not the same as being with them.My parents wouldnt let me meet people initially, so its been a relief being able to finally hang out with my best friends  Karthika and Zara  over the last few weeks. We still cant have sleepovers or go out for dinner as we used to. Its sad that we cant do that anymore.Im nervous about returning to school after all this. I wonder what school life is going to be like. Apart from my best friends, I havent been able to keep in touch with any other people. I feel like I have drifted out of most of my social circle, and now if I called them, it would be weird and awkward.Students Life in Lockdown. Darsh Gupta, Delhi; 2020.IM FINALLY READING THE HARRY POTTER BOOKSDarsh Gupta, 9; New DelhiSt Thomas SchoolI have discovered that I like art. I draw images of birds and little boats. I am drawn to boats because they dont pollute, and I dont like pollution. I found the air to be a little cleaner to breathe during the lockdown. My two cousins and I have spent a lot of time racing each other to the terrace and playing with ice and water. My older brother Sparsh, 14, taught me some coding. Together we programmed a circuit to make a small circle. I also got my parents to play Ludo with me and my grandparents to play snakes and ladders with us. Ive also upped my skating skills on the terrace.Its sad that I cant hang out with my friends. I used to love cycling around the colony with them. A bunch of us would also play kho-kho and cricket together. Now we cantIm worried about school not starting up again next year, Gupta says.Im at least glad I get to meet some of my friends over our online classes. Were allowed a few minutes of chatter before the teaching starts.I am worried about school not starting up again next year. Apart from meeting my friends and teachers, I really miss the Tuesday special spring rolls in the canteen. What I dont miss is the rock hard ice cream that they serve every day in summer. (Just to clarify, I love ice-cream otherwise.)What I did get to do was read Harry Potter (my brother finally agreed to let me have his set). I am now on book six. I am also reading the Geronimo Stilton series  its the adventures of a mouse whos scared of everything.Overall, I have found the lockdown has not been very good and I worry about when we will get to go to school again. But I am happy for all the people around me, with whom Ive got to spend so much time.Though we have to sacrifice many things, the background is serene and silent, says Sanal. ( Photo by Vivek R Nair )I NEVER LIKE TO CURSE A SITUATIONPranav Sanal, 14; Thiruvananthapuram, KeralaKaraikkakam government schoolI dont usually like hustle and bustle. Though we have to sacrifice many things, the background is serene and silent these days. The routine of the earlier life is missing. My father and mother [a toddy tapper and a part-time nursery teacher] have not had much work due to the pandemic, so we have stopped buying my pencils and paper. But I have turned to charcoal.I miss my school, friends and my favourite game, cricket. But it seems we have to live with the evil for some time and I never like to curse a situation. We have to readjust our life clock to each situation. The lockdown has affected the poor and daily-wage earners badly. When my father talks about tomorrow I also become little nervous, but life has to go on.Untitled by Sidrat ul Muntaha. Pulwama, Kashmir; 2020.WE TALK A LOT MORE NOWSidrat ul Muntaha, 14; Pulwama, KashmirHamdard Grammar SchoolMy life changed completely during the pandemic. Earlier everybody was busy. We were busy with school and our parents with their work. Now we converse a lot with each other. Our parents discuss all family matters with me and my brother. Now we are also part of the discussions. My father even talked to me about his new business partnership.But the team work of school is gone. There is a barrier between teachers and students, which is the screen. There are no practicals, no experiments.I miss that feeling of summer in a different state. Last year we went to Rajasthan, Sidrat ul Muntaha says.We used to visit new places every year. This year we couldnt do that. I miss that feeling of summer in a different state. Last year we went to Rajasthan!I used to come home and write about the places I had seen. This year I have stopped writing. I would write poems as well but this year I could only write a poem on Covid, nothing else.I loved visiting relatives. Now I am scared of visiting them.Janata Curfew by Zayan Rahman. Bhojpur, Bihar; 2020.I WANT MY DAD TO COME HOMEZayan Rahman, 9; Bhojpur, BiharJean Paul Public SchoolI have learnt the importance of cleanliness and of washing hands. Though washing hands is an old practice, I realised that it should be done regularly. Also, as I was not allowed to eat food from outside. I learnt to avoid junk food and enjoy home-cooked food. But the best part has been spending time with my mother and other family members. With no school, we spent hours together. It made me learn the value of family and togetherness.The best part has been spending time with my mother and other family members. I wish my father wasnt stuck in Dubai, Rahman says.The saddest thing is that I have not been able to meet my father since March. He is working in Dubai and he has got stuck there. I miss my father a lot and hope the things get normal so that my father will be able to get back home.I also miss my school, my class friends and the time spent with them at the school grounds. Though there is no lockdown in Bihar, my family follows the Covid-19 guidelines strictly and I am not allowed to go outside to play. Earlier we used to visit public parks or to the zoo or go to a mall on weekends.Stop Covid-19 by Asra Irsan.

Now I speak with my uncles and cousins over video call, says Israni.The thing I miss the most is going out to parks in the city. My father used to take us once every week. I also miss playing with my friends every day. Now we meet and play some games online but they are not that fun.I miss my uncles, who live in a village outside the city.

In the evenings, I love to play with my friends in the park. Earlier, online classes seemed a little boring, but now teachers have made them more lively and interesting. Also, I have started playing online games on my mothers mobile phone, which is becoming one of the best things in the day for me.

I also love to visit my dearest aunt, who lives in Solan [Himachal Pradesh]. Being a hill station, time spent there has always been memorable for me, but we have not visited the place since the lockdown.

Kamrup, Assam; 2020.I MISS SCHOOL, AND I DONTMrigav Thakuria, 15; Kamrup, AssamSatpakhali High SchoolThe Covid-19 pandemic and the countrywide lockdown was something none of us expected or hoped to experience. But despite the hardships, there were some positives. One good thing was that there was respite from school. Most students loved that, at least initially. The lockdown brought good news for the environment as well since factories were shut for weeks and it helped improve air quality. The other thing I noticed was that there was reduction in consumption of intoxicants among people due to inability to procure them or move around. Use of masks also reduced the spread of other diseases commonly seen during summer months. Visits by doctors were common during summer, but this year that was not the case as few people suffered from severe fever and other seasonal diseases.Since I am appearing for my Class 10 board exams next year, attending physical classes where we can interact more closely with our teachers and get our doubts clarified I miss that a lot, Thakuria says.The pandemic and the initial lockdown brought lot of suffering for many. Thousands of people from Assam, mainly villagers, who had gone to other states for work, were stranded for weeks and had a very tough time getting back. Our classes were shut for weeks and finally they resumed only online. But many students in villages had a tough time as they either didnt have mobile phones or there was no proper internet network. I miss going to school, attending classes and interacting with my friends. Since I am appearing for my Class 10 board exams next year, attending physical classes where we can interact more closely with our teachers and get our doubts clarified I miss that a lot.Life in the Pandemic by Mahitha Allani.

In this pandemic situation, we got that, but I never imagined so many months of holidays. The first two months of lockdown were a lot of joy and happiness in my home. Later on it became so boring. I was a bit irritated but I like to stay home with mom and my brother.I like the time we spend together, playing games, watching movies, cooking and, of course, studying. I did not stop my hobbies due to this pandemic, I continued my Carnatic music classes. I love to sing.When the online classes started, I had a lot of anxiety about them.

2020-11-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/agriculture-gdp-growth-economy-7055240/,Spot the seeds of growth,"Clearly, agriculture, which contributes only 15-16 per cent of GDP, cannot overturn contraction in other sectors, but along with the rural sector, it could jump-start the economy, if we fixed its ills and transformed it. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)In the first quarter of this financial year, Indias GDP contracted by 23.9 per cent but agriculture grew by 3.4 per cent. Can agriculture make up for degrowth elsewhere? And can it do better than 3.4 per cent? To the first question, I would say  yes, up to a point; to the second  definitely.Clearly, agriculture, which contributes only 15-16 per cent of GDP, cannot overturn contraction in other sectors, but along with the rural sector, it could jump-start the economy, if we fixed its ills and transformed it.To begin with, we must reduce our preoccupation with prices and markets to first ensure that more farmers produce enough surplus to gain from higher prices and expanded markets. Despite green shoots, agriculture is ailing. Only 44 per cent of irrigable area is irrigated. Groundwater is fast depleting, soils are degraded, extension services barely function and climate change is speeding up.Consider water, the key to higher yields. Almost 90 per cent of Indias groundwater goes into irrigation and is grossly over-extracted. In Punjab, water tables have been falling by over 2.3 ft/year since 2000, propelled by free electricity and no meters (only West Bengal meters groundwater use). By 2030, 65 per cent of Indias blocks will be over-extracting groundwater (World Bank).Opinion | Yoginder K Alagh writes: Farm bills can achieve a lot, but in a crisis year government should exercise cautionMoreover, 86 per cent of our farmers cultivate two ha or less, often in fragments; 75-80 per cent borrow credit informally; 70 per cent provide only 4-5 per cent of marketed surplus in wheat and rice, even in surplus states; barely 6-12 per cent sell in mandis, and few gain from MSPs. Farm incomes are low and erratic. Millions have fallen into extreme poverty with COVID-19. In its current state, agriculture cannot lubricate our growth, let alone engine it.However, agriculture can do hugely better if we change the way we farm; focus more on allied sectors  livestock, fisheries and forests  and build strong growth links with the non-farm rural economy which, along with agriculture, contributes some 46 per cent of NDP.How do we change the way we farm? First, remodel irrigation by expanding rainwater harvesting (for both surface water and recharging groundwater); promoting micro-irrigation for efficient water use; and regulating groundwater extraction. Between 1999 and 2009, Gujarats agriculture grew at 9.6 per cent, attributed mainly to rainwater harvesting and BT cotton (T Shah et al, EPW). In 10-15 years, Gujarat built 0.5 million micro-structures: Check dams, bunds, etc. MGNREGA could be put to similar use in other states.On micro-irrigation, again, a 2014 government study for 13 states found it significantly reduced water and fertiliser use, while raising wheat yields by 25 per cent, and vegetable yields by 52 per cent. However, only 10 per cent of Indias cropland has micro-irrigation. Regulated irrigation expansion will increase yields, cropping intensity and high-value crops.Second, agroecological farming can save costs, employ more labour and rejuvenate soils. A survey of 286 experiments in sustainable farming across 57 countries found a mean yield increase of 79 per cent (J Pretty et al, 2006). Moving from cereals to multiple products, including poultry, fruits and vegetables, will also fit our changing dietary patterns.Opinion | K K Ragesh writes: Rules, precedent were ignored to push through anti-farmer Bills in Rajya SabhaThird, we need more research into heat-resistant crops and better extension. A study in Science (366, 2019) reported that agricultural information delivered via cell-phones increased yields by 4 per cent and the odds of adopting recommended inputs by 22 per cent, across several countries, including India.Fourth, and most essential, is institutional change. Our farms are too small for tapping scale economies or effectively exploiting markets. What we need is smallholders pooling resources and farming cooperatively in small groups. People often say: But cooperative farming failed in the 1960s. They forget that we misguidedly pushed large and small farmers into one cooperative. Today we know better. Cooperation works if groups are small, relatively homogenous, constituted by friends and neighbours, cemented by trust.Kerala is an obvious success story. It has 68,000 all-women group farms with 4-10 women jointly leasing land, pooling labour, sharing costs and returns. My in-depth research on a sample of group and individual farms in two districts showed that groups had 1.8 times the annual value of output/ha and five times the net returns/farm relative to individual family farms (95 per cent male-managed). Mean net return/group farm was Rs 1.2 lakh, thrice the national average of Rs 37,000/farm that year. Groups also enabled women to deliver on banana contracts. Notably, 87 per cent of the 50,000 groups cultivating under COVID survived economically, including vegetable farmers, whereas most individual vegetable farmers lost out due to lack of harvest labour and market outlets.Is group farming specific to Kerala? No. We have emerging examples in Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat and Telangana. In Bihar and Bengal, farmers have pooled their land into contiguous plots, and use electric pumps for drip irrigation, which was not possible with scattered plots and few power sources. These smallholder collectives also cooperate for input purchase and farm operations. Many have doubled their wheat and rice yields. And they, as also those in Gujarat, report being more food secure during the pandemic than their smallholder neighbours farming alone. Notably, these are not the Farmer Producers Organisations that market together but cultivate separately. The groups I mention do joint production and have adapted the SHG model. Many of Indias six million SHGs could run group enterprises.Opinion | Ashok Gulati writes: On farm bills, government must get its act together, but Opposition is misguidedFifth, livestock, fisheries and forests, which account for 26 per cent, 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent of GVP from agriculture, have huge underused potential. Livestock is much discussed, but what about fisheries? India is the worlds second-largest producer of aquaculture fish and employs 13.5 million people, 32 per cent being women (FAO). In 2017-18, our fisheries grew at 11.9 per cent.Similarly with forests. They provide an estimated 47 per cent of Indias GDP of the poor (TEEB). Since 1990, when we launched joint forest management with community cooperation, forest cover has risen to 21.5 per cent of geo-area. Our target is 33 per cent. Forest protection and plantation, biodiversity restoration and eco-tourism can create millions of jobs.Finally, we must strengthen farm and rural non-farm linkages: 61 per cent of rural incomes come from non-farm activities. A vast under-tapped potential lies in agro-processing (rural families purchase 80 per cent of the food they eat); machine tools and agro-machinery (consider Ludhiana in the 1980s); farm tourism; and health and education services. In turn, this will boost aggregate demand. Expenditure elasticities calculated by Maitreesh Ghatak et al using CMIE data indicate that a rise in incomes of the bottom 50 per cent of rural households would raise demand for many local products.Transforming agriculture and its allied sectors and creating synergy with the non-farm rural economy would energise growth and invigorate rural communities. This would also help more rural youth find local jobs, rather than be forced to live as aliens in inhospitable cities.This article first appeared in the print edition on November 17, 2020 under the title Spot the seeds of growth.

But the seizure of 2.50 kg of ganja hidden in a consignment of rice powder, turmeric, and coriander powder from a courier firm in the city has reinforced the suspicion of the excise officials of a potential shift in tactics by the traffickers.""It was meant for Dubai, whereas in the past all such consignments used to be sent to Malaysia, thanks to the slack enforcement there. Even different ingredients for making drugs used to be smuggled out separately before being combined in fly-by-night drug-making hubs.

I was doing a social media campaign at the time, cooking 74 new dishes, each from a different part of India. Id asked people to send me suggestions and this one came from the writer and columnist Sangeeta Khanna. Delicious! This dish can be steamed, fried or pan-fried.IngredientsFor the dough: 2 cups whole wheat flour; 2 tbsp fine semolina;  tsp salt;  tsp cumin powder;1 cup warm water for kneadingFor the stuffing: 2 cups chana dal; 2 inch ginger; 6-8 cloves garlic; pinch of hing; 2-3 green chillies; 1 tsp black pepper powder;  tsp garam masala; 1 tsp cumin; salt to taste.MethodTo prepare the stuffing, soak chana dal for 3-4 hours. Drain and grind with stuffing spices and ginger-garlic. Add minimal water  tsp at a time, making sure you dont overdo it; keep the stuffing thick (you shouldnt need more than 1 tbsp water at most).For the dough: Mix flour and semolina well in a bowl. Add salt, cumin and mix well again. Add warm water and gradually knead into a medium dough. Set aside for about half an hour. Now prepare the dumplings or gujiya-style fara. Take a small golf sized dough ball, roll it into a small thin circle, roughly the size of a poori. Place a couple of spoons of stuffing at the centre. Fold one side over the other, pressing the curved edges but leaving the two end corner sides slightly open to help the stuffing cook.Boil water in a pot. Season with salt, add 1 tsp oil and bring to boil as youd do for pasta.On medium flame, slide the dumplings in. Let the fara cook uncovered for12 minutes. To check whether theyre done, insert a knife. If it comes out clean, then the fara is cooked. Serve hot. For indulgent versions you can also stir-fry fara in ghee with kari patta and rai.(Goila set up and runs Goila Butter Chicken and is the author of India On My Platter)The Perfect Dosa by Anahita DhondyWhat I have most enjoyed tinkering with in the lockdown is the dosa. I first learnt how to make this precarious batter while I was training at the Taj in Aurangabad 12 years ago. We had to have the batter ready by 5 am for the breakfast service. As an 18-year-old just starting out, I never got it right. My batter always stuck to the hot plate and the senior chefs would have to come and help.All these years later, being a big fan of South Indian cuisine, I decided to try my hand at it again. I have a dear friend  pastry chef Vinesh Johny from Bengaluru  whos always making the perfect dosas on Instagram. So I asked him to help.Chef Anahita Dhondy got the dosa recipe from her friend, pastry chef Vinesh Johny from Bengaluru.He messaged me the ratios from his mothers heirloom recipe and voila! The next day I had the most gorgeous dosas Id ever made. I was so excited and proud  this is a dish so simple yet so complicated. I make it every week at home in Delhi.The secret is mixing urad dal and idli rice together with a few methi seeds and leaving it overnight. You get the most luscious batter.Chef Anahita Dhondy.So heres the recipe:Remember 3:1:1. Thats 3 parts idli rice to 1 part urad dal and 1 part poha or flat rice. Leave in water enough to cover it double. Let it soak overnight and grind it in the morning. Add salt and adjust water for consistency.When making your dosa, the trick is to heat the pan, grease with some fat and then wipe off the fat completely. Then, like the dosawallahs do, splash a little water on the pan (do it like you mean it and be a pro, but also stay far enough so you dont burn yourself).Now spread the mixture in an even circle, using a ladle or katori. Dribble a little oil or butter on top. And you should have a beautiful dosa, crisp at the bottom and super fluffy on top. Try it. Its life-changing.(Dhondy is chef partner at SodaBottleOpenerWala, Cyber Hub)Saada Aash soup by Amit ChowdhuryThe past couple of months have been a chance for me to rekindle my passion for cooking from scratch. A recipe I have had the opportunity to learn and perfect is Saada Aash  a soup inspired by a 150-year-old recipe from the kitchens of the Nizams of Hyderabad.This recipe was unearthed while the Falaknuma Palace was being restored. Its a grand soup with roots in Persia, that was traditionally garnished with gold leaf! There are also versions to be found in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Because its a hearty lamb broth, it is also eaten in these countries as part of the iftar spreads laid out during the month of Ramzan.This is a soup inspired by a 150-year-old recipe from the kitchens of the Nizams of Hyderabad.This soup is simmered for several hours, the broth enriched by lamb trotters and marrow. A baghar of ghee, garlic and black cardamom gives it hints of subtle spice. Saada Aash is usually served with small raviolis called lukmis, stuffed with minced lamb, along with shreds of lamb flavoured with pepper. Try it.Chef Amit Chowdhury.Heres the recipe:Ingredients: 1 kg nalli or lamb shank; 1 kg ginger; 1 kg onions; 6-7 green chillies.Cook together on slow flame in 1 litre of water for 4-5 hours. Strain the water and remove the meat when cooked. Add chopped ginger and mint to that meat and make a quenelle. Strain the soup and temper with chopped garlic and black cardamom. Repeat this tempering process seven times so the flavour is fully infused in the soup. Strain once more and adjust salt and lemon juice to taste. Put the meat back in the finished soup and serve hot.(Chowdhury is executive chef at the Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai)Urvika Kanois Ragi LoafI love sustainable eating and I think it should be our way of life. Our country has such incredible produce. During the lockdown I experimented quite a bit with one of my favourite ingredients  millets. Earthy, nourishing, tasty and satisfying is how I think of this indigenous grain. I hit upon a great bread recipe that is delicious and healthy.Here is the recipe:Ingredients: 1 cup ragi flour; 1 cup atta or all-purpose flour; 1 tbsp honey; 2 tsp dry yeast; 1 tbsp sugar; salt to taste; 3 tbsp almond flakes; 1 cup warm water; 2 tbsp warm milk; olive oil to grease.Method: Dissolve the sugar in the water completely. Add yeast and let it get activated. Once its frothy, add milk.In a separate bowl, mix the flours, salt and almond flakes. Now add the yeast mix and honey to the flours. Mix well, the dough will be sticky. Tip out onto a clean surface and knead for 5 - 10 mins. You will need a little extra flour to dust.Now take a bowl, grease with a little olive oil and put the dough in. Let it sit in a warm place for 1.5 hours or till the dough doubles in size. Punch the dough and knead till smooth. Put this into a greased loaf mould or shape and place it on a greased baking tray. Let this rise for 30 minutes.Bake in a preheated oven at 180C for 25-30 mins. Let cool, slice and serve with your favourite conserves or butter.(Kanoi is chef-owner of The Daily, Kolkata)Beans and Eggs by Atul KochharThis is something Ive cooked at home for my family many times in the pandemic. The pandemic has been especially difficult for the poor. My aim with this was to develop a dish that a person could cook for under 1 GBP (about Rs 99), that would be nourishing as well.For my Beans and Eggs, you can use any kind of beans. I often use mixed beans or chickpeas or even red kidney beans.In a pot, saut onions, cumin and garlic and add the beans. Then add either canned or fresh tomatoes, salt, a pinch of garam masala, turmeric and some chopped ginger.Sautee together. If you can get hold of some kale or spinach, add that to the mix. Let it all simmer. Once this mixture seems to be uniform, make four or six depressions in the chickpea curry and crack six eggs atop.Turn the heat down, put a lid on and let it cook. When the eggs are to your liking, whether soft yolk or hard yolk, which takes about 4 to 7 minutes, take it off the heat, garnish with coriander and serve hot.

the next day i had the most gorgeous dosas id ever made. i was so excited and proud  this is a dish so simple yet so complicated. i make it every week at home in delhi.the secret is mixing urad dal and idli rice together with a few methi seeds and leaving it overnight. you get the most luscious batter.chef anahita dhondy.so heres the recipe:remember 3:1:1. thats 3 parts idli rice to 1 part urad dal and 1 part poha or flat rice. leave in water enough to cover it double. let it soak overnight and grind it in the morning. add salt and adjust water for consistency.when making your dosa, the trick is to heat the pan, grease with some fat and then wipe off the fat completely. then, like the dosawallahs do, splash a little water on the pan (do it like you mean it and be a pro, but also stay far enough so you dont burn yourself).now spread the mixture in an even circle, using a ladle or katori. dribble a little oil or butter on top. and you should have a beautiful dosa, crisp at the bottom and super fluffy on top. try it. its life-changing.(dhondy is chef partner at sodabottleopenerwala, cyber hub)saada aash soup by amit chowdhurythe past couple of months have been a chance for me to rekindle my passion for cooking from scratch. a recipe i have had the opportunity to learn and perfect is saada aash  a soup inspired by a 150-year-old recipe from the kitchens of the nizams of hyderabad.this recipe was unearthed while the falaknuma palace was being restored. its a grand soup with roots in persia, that was traditionally garnished with gold leaf! there are also versions to be found in afghanistan, azerbaijan and turkey. because its a hearty lamb broth, it is also eaten in these countries as part of the iftar spreads laid out during the month of ramzan.this is a soup inspired by a 150-year-old recipe from the kitchens of the nizams of hyderabad.this soup is simmered for several hours, the broth enriched by lamb trotters and marrow. a baghar of ghee, garlic and black cardamom gives it hints of subtle spice. saada aash is usually served with small raviolis called lukmis, stuffed with minced lamb, along with shreds of lamb flavoured with pepper. try it.chef amit chowdhury.heres the recipe:ingredients: 1 kg nalli or lamb shank; 1 kg ginger; 1 kg onions; 6-7 green chillies.cook together on slow flame in 1 litre of water for 4-5 hours. strain the water and remove the meat when cooked. add chopped ginger and mint to that meat and make a quenelle. strain the soup and temper with chopped garlic and black cardamom. repeat this tempering process seven times so the flavour is fully infused in the soup. strain once more and adjust salt and lemon juice to taste. put the meat back in the finished soup and serve hot.(chowdhury is executive chef at the taj mahal palace, mumbai)urvika kanois ragi loafi love sustainable eating and i think it should be our way of life. our country has such incredible produce. during the lockdown i experimented quite a bit with one of my favourite ingredients  millets. earthy, nourishing, tasty and satisfying is how i think of this indigenous grain. i hit upon a great bread recipe that is delicious and healthy.here is the recipe:ingredients: 1 cup ragi flour; 1 cup atta or all-purpose flour; 1 tbsp honey; 2 tsp dry yeast; 1 tbsp sugar; salt to taste; 3 tbsp almond flakes; 1 cup warm water; 2 tbsp warm milk; olive oil to grease.method: dissolve the sugar in the water completely. add yeast and let it get activated. once its frothy, add milk.in a separate bowl, mix the flours, salt and almond flakes. now add the yeast mix and honey to the flours. mix well, the dough will be sticky. tip out onto a clean surface and knead for 5 - 10 mins. you will need a little extra flour to dust.now take a bowl, grease with a little olive oil and put the dough in. let it sit in a warm place for 1.5 hours or till the dough doubles in size. punch the dough and knead till smooth. put this into a greased loaf mould or shape and place it on a greased baking tray. let this rise for 30 minutes.bake in a preheated oven at 180c for 25-30 mins. let cool, slice and serve with your favourite conserves or butter.(kanoi is chef-owner of the daily, kolkata)beans and eggs by atul kochharthis is something ive cooked at home for my family many times in the pandemic. the pandemic has been especially difficult for the poor. my aim with this was to develop a dish that a person could cook for under 1 gbp (about rs 99), that would be nourishing as well.for my beans and eggs, you can use any kind of beans. i often use mixed beans or chickpeas or even red kidney beans.in a pot, saut onions, cumin and garlic and add the beans. then add either canned or fresh tomatoes, salt, a pinch of garam masala, turmeric and some chopped ginger.sautee together. if you can get hold of some kale or spinach, add that to the mix. let it all simmer. once this mixture seems to be uniform, make four or six depressions in the chickpea curry and crack six eggs atop.turn the heat down, put a lid on and let it cook. when the eggs are to your liking, whether soft yolk or hard yolk, which takes about 4 to 7 minutes, take it off the heat, garnish with coriander and serve hot. its a dish that needs no accompaniments.(kochhar is a twice-michelin-starred chef who runs kanishka in london and vaasu in buckinghamshire)"

The scare prompted the state government to widen the rice procurement base among farmers. Agriculturists believe this will also help farmers improve rabi farming, stabilising the price of finer varieties of rice sold in urban markets.The government plans to impose a ceiling on the amount of paddy procured from each farmer, so that more of them can be brought under the ambit of the project. The maximum procurement was 90 quintals at an MSP of Rs 1,868 per quintal last year; the maximum procurement at MSP this year will be 45 quintals.The fear of declining prices has gripped farmers across the country following the Centres new farm laws that are non-committal on MSP.Paddy prices in the market are way below the MSP, hovering around Rs 1,200-Rs 1,300 a quintal. The kharif paddy scenario is in sharp contrast with potato prices that continue to rise, defying the logic that producers get better prices after commodities are removed from the Essential Commodities Act.For Bengal, the problem is more acute than other states, as it is the countrys rice bowl, with an estimated production of 25 crore quintals of paddy this year against last years 24.3 crore quintals.This has necessitated us reaching out to a maximum number of farmers. In Bengal, 90% farmers are marginal ones, said Bengals food and civil supplies minister, Jyotipriya Mallick. The minister pointed out that 800 to 900 farmers were enrolling with the procurement process daily. The paddy procurement will begin later this month.Altogether, 21 lakh farmers benefited during the last kharif season. We hope to expand the procurement net and include 35 lakh farmers worst hit by the pandemic, said Pradeep Mazumdar, agri-adviser to the Bengal government. Mazumdar complained that the Food Corporation of India procured only 7.1 lakh quintals against the 60-lakh quintal target for running the central scheme.With elections in 2021, the state government has set a target of procuring 520 lakh quintals of paddy. We may revise the target if the enrolment is very high,  the food minister said. The government is also setting up a special surveillance system to ensure that the enrolled farmer has actually sold his harvest to the government.","representative imagekolkata: around 12 lakh paddy farmers, of an estimated 72 lakh in bengal, have opted for a government scheme to procure kharif paddy for the public distribution system .the government plans to enrol another 23 lakh farmers into the scheme.this would not only help meet its procurement target for supply of free rice to nearly 19 crore people till june 2021, but also pre-empt distress sale by farmers and stabilise the price of rice in the market.a bumper kharif harvest, coupled with low demand for swarno masuri, lata, ir64, niranjan and others  coarser varieties of the grain  have been threatening to pull down paddy prices below the government-announced minimum support price ( msp ). the scare prompted the state government to widen the rice procurement base among farmers. agriculturists believe this will also help farmers improve rabi farming, stabilising the price of finer varieties of rice sold in urban markets.the government plans to impose a ceiling on the amount of paddy procured from each farmer, so that more of them can be brought under the ambit of the project. the maximum procurement was 90 quintals at an msp of rs 1,868 per quintal last year; the maximum procurement at msp this year will be 45 quintals.the fear of declining prices has gripped farmers across the country following the centres new farm laws that are non-committal on msp.paddy prices in the market are way below the msp, hovering around rs 1,200-rs 1,300 a quintal. the kharif paddy scenario is in sharp contrast with potato prices that continue to rise, defying the logic that producers get better prices after commodities are removed from the essential commodities act.for bengal, the problem is more acute than other states, as it is the countrys rice bowl, with an estimated production of 25 crore quintals of paddy this year against last years 24.3 crore quintals.this has necessitated us reaching out to a maximum number of farmers. in bengal, 90% farmers are marginal ones, said bengals food and civil supplies minister, jyotipriya mallick. the minister pointed out that 800 to 900 farmers were enrolling with the procurement process daily. the paddy procurement will begin later this month.altogether, 21 lakh farmers benefited during the last kharif season. we hope to expand the procurement net and include 35 lakh farmers worst hit by the pandemic, said pradeep mazumdar, agri-adviser to the bengal government. mazumdar complained that the food corporation of india procured only 7.1 lakh quintals against the 60-lakh quintal target for running the central scheme.with elections in 2021, the state government has set a target of procuring 520 lakh quintals of paddy. we may revise the target if the enrolment is very high,  the food minister said. the government is also setting up a special surveillance system to ensure that the enrolled farmer has actually sold his harvest to the government."
2020-12-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/date-sap-delights/article33334250.ece,It’s the season for date toddy,"The date palm bears many gifts this season. Its nectar is a popular drink, and is also used to make two kinds of jaggery, including the popular nolen gurBengalis, Odias and Biharis living outside their states will beam in delight at the mere mention of khejur/khajur gur or jaggery made from date sap. This winter speciality is so precious that a shopkeeper in Sainikpuri, Secunderabad, has been gifted a fridge by his regular Odia customer to prolong the shelf life of the seasonal product. Mohammed Ali, the 55-year-old shopkeeper says, Last year, I had to discard a lot of nolen gur as it has a very low shelf life. If not stored well, it soon gives out a fermented smell. So this year, before the season started, a regular customer gifted me his refrigerator, saying he hated seeing so much gur go waste last year.Soumyo Sengupta who works on sustainable agriculture practices in West Bengal, explains that date sap jaggery can be obtained in two forms. They are nolen gur and patali. Nolen means new. So nolen gur essentially means new/fresh gur made from date sap. Patali is solid gur that is commonly sold as a disc, and has a longer shelf life. It has a smoky, caramelised flavour because it is made over firewood; even though it is hard, it is actually fudgy when bit into.Date sap or date palm jaggery is a small scale industry product in West Bengal and Jharkhand.Drink or eat?Every winter, fans of date sap toddy make at least a few trips to toddy sellers on the outskirts of their respective city or village.As Bengal-based Sayantani Mahapatra, a food blogger, says, The colder it gets, the sweeter is the toddy. I love the nolen gur made from date sap. This extremely prized seasonal produce, occupies a special spot in the hearts of those who dig in anything and everything that is authentically mishti (sweet). Payesh (kheer), sandesh and rosogolla made from nolen gur are seasonal delicacies in Bengali homes.Down South in Telangana, the date sap itself is a prized natural winter drink, not only among villagers but also among urban picnickers who head to toddy outlets just for this. Distinctly sweet with a definite zing, the diluted milk-like toddy, if drunk fresh or within an hour of it being brought down the tree, does not leave the drinker intoxicated even when consumed in fairly large quantities. Raju Goud, a 40-year-old date toddy tapper in Siddipet, Telangana, says the trees are prepared every year before the season, by cleaning the old dried palms, cleaning the surroundings of the sap from where the toddy is to be extracted and by checking the health of the tree.Says Raju, Only an experienced toddy tapper can tell the health of a tree. There are male and female trees; female trees give better and more toddy. The demand is so high during this season that some people even adulterate it with sweeteners. So its always advisable to drink toddy from a tapper you know and trust.  Another toddy tapper, Akhil Goud says, Extracting the sap is a dangerous task and requires talent. If there is a lot of dew on the tree: tappers can slip and fall. We have to take care and precautions.Telanganas villagers dont cook with the sap toddy. Why waste a natural drink by mixing it with food, when you can drink it straight up? asks Raju.And he suggests an ideal food combination to go with it: We call it Susheela. It is a combination of puffed rice and spicy nattu kozhi [country chicken] curry. No one knows why the locals call it Susheela. I feel it is because it compliments the sweet toddy.In parts of South India, date sap is not used to make jaggery, but instead finds its way into the recipes of staples like appams and chicken curry.Play with itExecutive Chef Thimma Reddy of The Park in Hyderabad, however, insists that there is no need to restrict its use to just those dishes. Fresh toddy can be used to make the batter for pancakes, he says, adding, A sorbet with date toddy and Himalayan salt would be a winner at a Christmas lunch or dinner.Soumyo points out that traditionally, Bengalis make it a part of their winter diet. Soumyo explains, Date jaggery or date palm jaggery is an ideal sugar substitute and can be used as a natural sweetener. This jaggery is believed to contain far more nutrients which are beneficial for the body than white sugar.","the date palm bears many gifts this season. its nectar is a popular drink, and is also used to make two kinds of jaggery, including the popular nolen gurbengalis, odias and biharis living outside their states will beam in delight at the mere mention of khejur/khajur gur or jaggery made from date sap. this winter speciality is so precious that a shopkeeper in sainikpuri, secunderabad, has been gifted a fridge by his regular odia customer to prolong the shelf life of the seasonal product. mohammed ali, the 55-year-old shopkeeper says, last year, i had to discard a lot of nolen gur as it has a very low shelf life. if not stored well, it soon gives out a fermented smell. so this year, before the season started, a regular customer gifted me his refrigerator, saying he hated seeing so much gur go waste last year.soumyo sengupta who works on sustainable agriculture practices in west bengal, explains that date sap jaggery can be obtained in two forms. they are nolen gur and patali. nolen means new. so nolen gur essentially means new/fresh gur made from date sap. patali is solid gur that is commonly sold as a disc, and has a longer shelf life. it has a smoky, caramelised flavour because it is made over firewood; even though it is hard, it is actually fudgy when bit into.date sap or date palm jaggery is a small scale industry product in west bengal and jharkhand.drink or eat?every winter, fans of date sap toddy make at least a few trips to toddy sellers on the outskirts of their respective city or village.as bengal-based sayantani mahapatra, a food blogger, says, the colder it gets, the sweeter is the toddy. i love the nolen gur made from date sap. this extremely prized seasonal produce, occupies a special spot in the hearts of those who dig in anything and everything that is authentically mishti (sweet). payesh (kheer), sandesh and rosogolla made from nolen gur are seasonal delicacies in bengali homes.down south in telangana, the date sap itself is a prized natural winter drink, not only among villagers but also among urban picnickers who head to toddy outlets just for this. distinctly sweet with a definite zing, the diluted milk-like toddy, if drunk fresh or within an hour of it being brought down the tree, does not leave the drinker intoxicated even when consumed in fairly large quantities. raju goud, a 40-year-old date toddy tapper in siddipet, telangana, says the trees are prepared every year before the season, by cleaning the old dried palms, cleaning the surroundings of the sap from where the toddy is to be extracted and by checking the health of the tree.says raju, only an experienced toddy tapper can tell the health of a tree. there are male and female trees; female trees give better and more toddy. the demand is so high during this season that some people even adulterate it with sweeteners. so its always advisable to drink toddy from a tapper you know and trust.  another toddy tapper, akhil goud says, extracting the sap is a dangerous task and requires talent. if there is a lot of dew on the tree: tappers can slip and fall. we have to take care and precautions.telanganas villagers dont cook with the sap toddy. why waste a natural drink by mixing it with food, when you can drink it straight up? asks raju.and he suggests an ideal food combination to go with it: we call it susheela. it is a combination of puffed rice and spicy nattu kozhi [country chicken] curry. no one knows why the locals call it susheela. i feel it is because it compliments the sweet toddy.in parts of south india, date sap is not used to make jaggery, but instead finds its way into the recipes of staples like appams and chicken curry.play with itexecutive chef thimma reddy of the park in hyderabad, however, insists that there is no need to restrict its use to just those dishes. fresh toddy can be used to make the batter for pancakes, he says, adding, a sorbet with date toddy and himalayan salt would be a winner at a christmas lunch or dinner.soumyo points out that traditionally, bengalis make it a part of their winter diet. soumyo explains, date jaggery or date palm jaggery is an ideal sugar substitute and can be used as a natural sweetener. this jaggery is believed to contain far more nutrients which are beneficial for the body than white sugar."

2020-12-22,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attempts-being-made-to-create-false-narrative-about-bengal-tmc/articleshow/79862262.cms,Attempts being made to create false narrative about Bengal: TMC,"KOLKATA: Rejecting Union home minister Amit Shah 's accusation that West Bengal had fared abysmally on development indices under the present dispensation, the ruling Trinamool Congress said on Tuesday that attempts are being made to create a false narrative about the state.Ruling out the charges levelled by the Union minister, senior TMC leader Saugata Roy mentioned the state's impressive performance in GDP, industrial output, per capita income, construction of rural roads among others.At a press conference in Bolpur on Sunday, Shah had accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the state of failing to deliver, claiming that West Bengal lags behind most states in the country on various parameters, except on corruption and extortion.Countering the charge levelled by Shah that TMC workers had misused funds meant for Amphan relief, Roy said, the state was yet to receive Rs 32,310 crore earmarked for the SDRF (State Disaster Relief Force) from the Centre .Claiming that election strategist Prashant Kishor has so far helped politicial parties win polls in five states, Roy said, the TMC believes, the figures predicted by the poll consultant in his tweets on Monday that the BJP will not cross the two-digit figure in the West Bengal assembly elections are correct.Kishor has been roped in by TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee to boost her party's prospects in the state assembly polls likely in April-May next year.""We support his tweets, he is the election strategist of our party,"" Roy told reporters at the TMC headquarters here.Asked whether Kishor was taking

The laws will allow farmers to trade freely without any license or stock limit and lead to increase in availability of buyers for the produce, the report states. However, the farmers fear the laws will lead to the end of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and want them to be withdrawn.The SBI Ecowrap report suggests five ways that could end the impasse over the new laws:The report suggests that the government can insert a quantity guarantee clause for a minimum period of 5 years instead of MSP as a price guarantee. This would ensure that procurement to production percentage of crops is at least equal to last years' percentage except in events like droughts, floods, etc.""Historical procurement trends indicate that only 25 to 35 per cent of total wheat production has been procured over the years, with largest procurement happening through Punjab and Haryana. While, in case of rice, procurement has been in range of 30 to 40 per cent with significant procurement by Telangana, Punjab, Haryana and Kerala,"" the report noted.In the recent kharif procurement regime, Punjab has witnessed a staggering procurement of 55 per cent even though it ranks third in paddy production. While, procurement from top paddy producing states of West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh has been nil and 8 per cent, respectively.However, most government procurement centres in Punjab, Haryana and a few other states are located within the notified APMC mandis. Farmers fear that encouraging tax-free private trade outside these mandis will make these markets unviable and thereby lead to reduction in government procurement.The SBI report further suggested that MSP regime be converted to floor price of auction on National Agriculture Market (eNAM) portal.eNAM is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. These were formed to provide a common online market platform to facilitate trade and provide better price discovery through transparent auction process based on quality of produce.At present, there are about 1,000 APMC mandis, 1.45 lakh traders and 1.67 crore farmers registered on eNAM.However, the report admits that converting MSP to a floor price of auction on the eNAM portal will not completely solve the problem as the current data shows that average modal prices in e-NAM mandis is lower than the minimum support price in all commodities except urad.Efforts must also continue to strengthen APMC market infrastructure, the report said. As per estimates, the monetary loss for cereals is almost Rs 27,000 crore due to harvest and post-harvest losses. While the losses for oilseeds and pulses are Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, respectively.After production, the produce undergoes multiple rounds of post-harvest operations, handling stages and storage before finally reaching the consumer. Each stage results into some losses which in turn leads to decrease in food availability.A 2015 report showed that 4.6-6 per cent cereals, 6.4-8.4 per cent pulses, 3.1-10 per cent oilseeds, 6.7-15.9 per cent fruits, and 4.6-12.4 per cent vegetables are lost during harvest, post-harvest operations, handling and storage.Contract farming involves an agreement between a farmer and a buyer which outline conditions for production, quality or grade of product required, terms and timeline for delivery at a pre-determined price.Establishing a contract farming institution in India that will give the exclusive right to oversee price discovery will prove beneficial, especially for small and marginal farmers as they often tend to get crowded out from the growth process, the report suggests. It will enable them to deal with large buyers as large firms often attract small growers with favourable conditions and later tightens them.Contract farming has been instrumental in providing growers access to supply chains with market and price stability, as well as technical assistance. For example, Thailand had the most extensive and widest range of crops by early 1990s. Its market certainty (52 per cent) and price stability (46 per cent) were prime factors due to which farmers participated in contract farming.The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for issue of KCC to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks.The KCC enables farmers to obtain short term loans at an interest rate of 4 per cent. On timely payment of the loan, the limit can be extended up to an amount of Rs 3 lakh. The card holder also get the facility of insurance which can provide protection to the notified crops.As of March, about Rs 7,09,500 crore KCC loans were given to 6.7 crore active KCC card users, which constitute about 40 per cent of the total agricultural loans given by them. During February-April, banks received 75 lakh KCC applications out of which 36 lakh have been issued.However, the KCC portfolio of banks has come under increasing stress due to a variety of factors like crop losses, unremunerated prices, debt waivers and the rigidity of the KCC product. Therefore, SBI Ecowrap suggests that RBI, in conjunction with the government, must introduce an operational flexibility in the structure and direct the banks to allocate a specific percentage of their loans to particularly agri start-ups to give a boost to agri supply chains in India.As per the model calculations, the SBI believes that income of farmers will rise by a sharp 35 per cent by revisiting the current scheme.","1) provide quantity guarantee instead of price2) convert msp into floor price on enam3) strengthen apmc market infrastructure4) establish contract farming

As the pandemic put us through the most unprecedented experiences, innovators in the food industry across the world came up with clever ideas to help restaurants survive. Even as dine-in sales staggered, restaurants launched DIY meal kits, touch-free menus and their own range of sauces and marinades to keep businesses afloat.Converting dine-in menu into single-serve takeout option is another interesting trend that helped restaurants widen their customer base in the downturn.When ITC Hotels launched its first ever Biryani & Pulao takeout collection, COO, Anil Chadha did diligent brainstorming with executive chef Madhu Krishnans R & D team and corporate chef Manisha Bhasin. The pricing had to be game-changing. The idea was to reach out to those who do not come to our restaurant. So we came up with a pocket friendly menu, says Bhasin.The hotel has been doing a variety of biryanis for its banquets. These were our hidden gems - well researched recipes by our master chefs, the flavours perfected over a long period of time, says the chef. It wouldnt have been practical to do an only biryanis dine-in menu earlier. But an exclusive biryani and pulao takeaway menu gave an opportunity to showcase vibrant preparations from across India. One can order a single portion, priced between 625 to 825. We felt there was a potential for take aways, biryani being the most sought after comfort food. It has travelled across the length and breadth of India and evolved in the journey. We put together the most delightful preparations from various regions, she says.Along with the biryani, one can either opt for a mirch baingan ka salan or a choice of raita. You also get a complimentary gulab jamun from the Dum Pukht kitchen, the signature Shahed-E-Jaam.A celebration of age old flavoursFrom the North, the chef has picked up Nimona Pulao, a delicate rice preparation from Old Delhi. Nimona means mattar. Large salan mirch is filled with peas puree and cooked along with aged basmati rice. This one pairs wonderfully with kheera and anar raita, says the chef.From South, there is Konaseema Kodi Pulao, a robust chicken and rice preparation, best enjoyed with onion pachdi.Among the options from East, the collection features Metiabruz Biryani, a rice and mutton combination, cooked in onion and spices with potato and boiled eggs. It derives its name from the historic Metiabruz locality (implying Mud Tower) in Kolkata, where Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh had created his own miniature version of Lucknow after being deposed by the British.Another preparation that stands out is Bibi Ka pulao from undivided Punjab. This is bebes recipe  the elderly lady in the Punjabi household who would her sit in front of a slow fire and gently simmer chicken along with rice and brown onion, says the chef.Manisha Bhasin, corporate chef, ITC HotelsReviving heritageThe preparations celebrate our diverse culture, with each dish retaining age old culinary wisdom. One seeks comfort in the past in times like these. We are witnessing a revival of heritage recipes across the world, says chef Bhasin. She suggests using the term heritage judiciously. Its not like ones family recipe would qualify as heritage cuisine. Heritage cuisine should have stood the test of time, followed by a substantial group of people belonging to the same origin, she says.It is to be studied on the basis of crops and spices grown in a region, the vessels used for cooking, their shape, the cooking processes that were prevalent and how they evolved, the eating traditions and the impact of a particular food when it was eaten in a certain weather, says the chef.Healthy, local, sustainableAlong with heritage, the focus has been on sustainably sourced local products. Underrated ingredients have become the stars. India has a great millet culture India or a range of immunity boosting foods. Chefs have made these ingredients exciting, she says.Holed up in ones home, there was the fear of taking refuge in junk, but thankfully that hasnt happened. Young people are talking about natural sweeteners and alternate flours. Its heartening that they prefer natural, minimally processed ingredients, says the chef.It seems that the pandemic had taught us to value simplicity over showiness. The crisis hasnt gone to waste.","lifestyleupdated: dec 24, 2020, 15:54 istadversity is a powerful trigger of creativity. it inspires to think freely, take risks and do what hasnt been done before. as the pandemic put us through the most unprecedented experiences, innovators in the food industry across the world came up with clever ideas for restaurants to survive. these innovations were not just limited to fixing problems -

2020-12-23,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/flavours-of-christmas-feasts-from-across-india/article33402065.ece,Tastes like Christmas,"In India, the lavish spread on Christmas is as diverse and unique as the country. Even within the same State, the feast is influenced by history, seasoned with flavours of the tradewinds that brought diverse communities to India, and made with local ingredients and spices. Join us as we pull up a chair at dining tables across the countryWhere rose cookies bloomSoft white appam surrounded by lacy, browned crisp edges, and stew are the staples for a typical Christmas breakfast in Kerala, along with rich plum cake and homemade wine.However, depending on the region and the church one belongs to, breakfast, brunch and lunch vary widely from appam and duck curry or stew in Kuttanad and Kottayam to a seafood fiesta in Kollam.Renu Philip says that in the old days, a cook used to stay at her husbands ancestral home in Kottayam to prepare food for the extended family. Chicken roast or duck roast was a must along with a wide range of meats.Jaikumari Rajenesh serves steaming hot puttu, pork cooked in the Mavadi style and plum cake, a typical breakfast staple on the day of Christmas in many homes in Nagercoil | Photo Credit: Jaikumari RajeneshVeteran plantation owners in their eighties and nineties remember the game meat that used to be a speciality during the season: when venison, wild boar and more were roasted and curried.My late mother, Annie Mathappan, used to make several ethnic dishes for the festival; snacks such as cheepappam, rose cookies, kul kul, cakes and homemade wine  recalls Jessie Ignatius, a resident of Kollam.Towards the South, especially among families with roots in Kanyakumari, which was once a part of erstwhile Travancore, breakfast is incomplete without pork and puttu. After church, we have breakfast at my mothers place in Nagercoil, and then we go visiting our relatives. The pork, cooked with roasted masala and tamarind, is almost a shade of ebony. We cant have enough of it, says interior decorator Jaikumari Rajenesh. Another season special is orappan, which is cooked with rice flour, coconut milk and jaggery. After it is cooked into a halwa, it is baked for a crust on the top, explains Jaikumari.Pork cooked in the Mavadi style and puttu is a popular breakfast on the day of Christmas in many places in Nagercoil | Photo Credit: Jaikumari RajeneshIn Thrissur, no celebration is complete without pork cooked with Chinese potatoes and served with appam, rice and everything else.In Puthenthope, a fishing village in Thiruvananthapuram, families head straight to the beach after midnight mass. The revelry on the beach includes games and music. Many of them head to the sea at daybreak with packed food to eat on the boat.Dining with the choir(Clockwise) Pork innards, chutney, bitter orange, rice, rice porridge,palm nut, smoked pork with Axone (fermented soyabean) and pork in bamboo shoot comprises a typical feast in Dimapur, Nagaland | Photo Credit: LidangAt the Manipur Evangelical Lutheran Church in the village of Singngat, Manipur, to which Langchinthang Taithul, a member of the Zou tribe, belongs to, Christmas is a period of music, worship and community. At around 10 am on Christmas Day, all of us go to church. After prayers, we assemble outside the church for tea and sing together. Meanwhile, a select group of men and women would be busy cooking and arranging the dinner for that evening. By 3 pm, everyone is called to the church by ringing the bell, and all of us (about 300 to 350) would have dinner together in the church compound, he says.No feast is complete without pork and sticky rice, and usually there are different kinds of beef and fish dishes. Mepoh is a pork dish that is flavoured with shijou, which is gathered from the jungles; banana stem is curried. We have many herbs, roots and leaves that are used in our cooking. Paaknam is a spicy pancake made of besan, vegetables, and dried, fermented fish wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed, he explains. By 6 pm, the Christmas choir and worship begins, and around 8 pm, most families go home to continue the celebrations while some might remain, cracking jokes and enjoying the banter.A typical Naga feast on Christmas Day in Dimapur, Nagaland | Photo Credit: Thsope MedoMeziwang Zeliang, a member of the Zeliang tribe in Nagaland, says community feasts are a common feature of churches in the North-east. Volunteers are selected from among the men and women to do the cooking and chopping for the feast, which is invariably different kinds of pork dishes such as pork innards, smoked pork with axone (fermented soyabean) and pork in bamboo, rice, chutney made of fermented mustard leaves and endless cups of Phika cha (black tea). Dessert is usually fresh fruits; cakes and wine are not part of traditional feasts though many are adapting it now into the Christmas day celebrations, she explains.At her church, Zeliangrong Baptist Church in Dimapur, the feast is after the morning service. After the feast, most of them stay on as there are music competitions, stand-up comedy and other entertainment. We go home after the evening service and then go to meet relatives, she adds.A Portuguese thaliEast Indian Catholics are natives of Mumbai, Palghar and Thane. The community has a Portuguese influence, and so their cuisine overlaps with that of Catholics from Goa and Mangaluru. But there are a few dishes that are unique to the East Indian community. For instance, only East Indians make thali sweets, a white cake that gets its name because it is baked in a tray. Made from coconut, semolina, egg whites and ground almonds or cashews, this Christmas treat is also made during traditional East Indian weddings, says Vellani Sequeria, a baker based in Mumbais western suburb, Vasai.Christmas Day is a hectic time for Valeni as she makes an elaborate lunch that consists of roast chicken stuffed with cooked vegetables, vindaloo and sarapatel  two dishes that they share with the Goan Catholics. Mutton stew is eaten with fugias, a deep-fried bread that is slightly sweet and specific to the community.Another must at the Christmas spread is the duck moilee. Traditionally, Moilee is made with duck meat but nowadays people prefer chicken as it is easily available and easier to cook. The most important ingredient for this dish is bottle masala, which is found only in the kitchens of East Indians. It is made with over 30 to 32 ingredients that include red chillies, poppy seeds and a range of whole spices, Vellani adds. The day ends with a glass of khimad, a spiced liquor whose base is a concoction made with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, turmeric powder and tea powder, all boiled in water.Armenian wood-fired cakesFor Christmas eve, there are all kinds of meats and roasts at the home of Brunnel Arathoon and Anthony Khatchaturian in Kolkata. Once the family returns from midnight mass, they get together for a brunch that would also have plenty of leftovers from the previous evenings dinner. We make sandwiches with the different roasts. There are cakes, homemade wines and a must is a pie made with minced beef, says Brunnel, a well-known home chef in Kolkata. While the Armenian Christians, one of the oldest denominations in India, celebrate Christmas on December 25, the official celebrations happen on January 6 at the Church of Holy Nazareth in Armenian Street.Brunnel Arathoons Armenian cakes bakes on wood-fired stoves and seasoned with cinnamon and nutmeg have buyers from all over India. Unlike plum cakes, these cakes no fruits | Photo Credit: Anthony KhatchaturianThen I cook the Armenian dishes that have been passed on to me by my mother and grandmother. Rice pilaf, harrissa and dolmades are made then, says Brunnel. Anthony remarks that the Armenian cakes that she makes in wood-fired ovens, which are made without any fruits, are much in demand all over India. They are seasoned with cinnamon and nutmeg, he adds.Heirloom recipesIf you were to drop in at an Anglo-Indian home during Christmas, chances are that you would be served homemade Old Temperance (OT), says Chennai-based Harry MacLure, editor of the magazine Anglos in the Wind. OT, he explains, is an alcohol-free, ginger-based drink that used to be made in most Anglo-Indian homes with hand-medown recipes.A vintage snap of Christmas celebrations of the Anglo-Indian community in Chennai | Photo Credit: Anglos In The WindHowever, you are free to have something stronger or wine but OT used to be standard fare in most homes along with plum cake and seed cake, which was flavoured with aniseed. In addition, there would be kul kuls, rose cookies and Dhol-Dhol, a halwa-like sweet made of puttu rice powder, coconut, jaggery, ghee. It used to be made on firewood stoves outside the house, he says, adding, It was a Portuguese favourite that has been adapted by Anglo-Indians and is a Christmas favourite.The Anglo-Indians usually attend midnight mass and like to have a late brunch on December 25, consisting of eggs, bacon, sausages, ham, salami, breads, cheese and so on. So lunch is usually after 3 pm when families and friends get together for a leisurely feast with several kinds of meat roasts and pies. We used to have coconut rice, ball curry (made of minced meat), devils chutney, pork vindaloo, sweets, cakes and roasted chicken, he recalls. He remembers that turkey roast and duck roast were common when he was growing up in the Railway Colony in Tiruchi, but nowadays it has been replaced by chicken as turkey is harder to cook and needed a lot of space. Lunch was a grand affair with friends from all communities and families gathering together. This time, the gatherings might be smaller but the spirit of Christmas will be the same, he asserts.(With inputs from Aishwarya Upadhye)","in india, the lavish spread on christmas is as diverse and
