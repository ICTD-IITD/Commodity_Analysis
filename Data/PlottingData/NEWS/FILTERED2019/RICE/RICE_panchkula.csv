2020-02-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/coronavirus-outbreak-kerala-india-china-wuhan-6258175/,"The Flu: How Kerala, China are tackling coronavirus","For Kerala, the virus is a fresh challenge after the deadly Nipah outbreak of 2018 and 2019 that had claimed 17 lives, all in 2018. For Kerala, the virus is a fresh challenge after the deadly Nipah outbreak of 2018 and 2019 that had claimed 17 lives, all in 2018.Kerala: Three positive cases in country, all from state; 3,144 people under observationThe 22-year-old, a medical student at a university in Wuhan, China, is home in Malappuram and, as usual, the focus of everyones attention. Only, this time, its edgy. Twice a day he gets a call from the local government hospital, inquiring if he has fever or sore throat. A few times in the day, his mother serves him food wearing a mask. The rest of the time he is on his smartphone.The 22-year-old has been under a 28-day quarantine at his home in Keralas Malappuram district ever since he came back on January 22 from Wuhan, the capital of Chinas Hubei province and the epicentre of a virulent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that has, as of February 8, claimed at least 723 lives and infected 34,600 people in China.The 22-year-old is one of the 3,144 people under observation in Kerala, which has reported three positive cases of coronavirus, so far the only confirmed cases of the virus in India. I am feeling perfectly fine. But the person who calls from the hospital says that if I develop any symptoms, the local primary health centre will send an ambulance over. The health inspector has told me that I should not voluntarily move out, he says over the phone.I watch the news on my mobile phone. I am also in touch with friends from Wuhan who are under observation, he says, adding, I recently got a message from the state health department calling me a hero for surrendering my freedom for the safety of society.For Kerala, the virus is a fresh challenge after the deadly Nipah outbreak of 2018 and 2019 that had claimed 17 lives, all in 2018. The state has been on vigil since January 17, when the Centre sounded an alert for coronavirus. By January 30, the figure of those under observation had touched 1,053. Within the next five days, with the three positive cases being reported, Kerala declared a state calamity. At 418, Malappuram district has the highest number of persons under observation for suspected exposure to the virus.To tackle the challenge, the state health department has fallen back on its past experience in managing the Nipah outbreak and put in place a multi-level mechanism for surveillance and control of the infection.Outside an isolation unit at the Government Medical College, Thrissur, where one of the three positive coronavirus cases has been reported.

Express Photo by Anoop K VenuWe have an excellent system at various levels to monitor those exposed to the infection. We have activated the emergency system which was in operation during the Nipah days, says Dr Mohanan Kunnummal, vice chancellor of Kerala University of Health Sciences.By the third week of January, when the Union government sounded a nCoV alert, the health department set up a state-level control room and a rapid response team which were directly linked to the 14 district medical offices.Isolation units were prepared in all the six medical colleges and 14 district government hospitals. The most critical aspect of reining in the virus was zeroing in on persons with suspected exposure to the virus in China and isolating them, says Dr Amar Fettle, the state health departments nodal officer for Public Health Emergency of International Concern.Explained: Remdesivir, the drug a China college wants to patent to fight coronavirusThe control room started by first obtaining a list of passengers from China who had deboarded at the states international airports, and tracked them down. Initially, only passengers at Kochi International Airport were screened, but the exercise was soon extended to the other three international airports  Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur  in the state. Even domestic passengers  who had landed at international terminals in other states and moved to Kerala  were screened.Simultaneously, a screening exercise was initiated at the grassroots level. Junior public health inspectors, public health nurses and ASHA workers kept a tab on those who had returned from abroad. A list of those suspected to have caught the flu was sent to the control room, which, in turn, sent a list of people to be monitored to all district medical officers. Thereafter, each person on the list was assigned to a primary or family health centre.At the primary health centre, the medical superintendent and the staff ensure that the patients are strictly following the quarantine guidelines. These centres also have to mail two reports, one in the morning and another in the evening, to the state control room everyday via the district medical officer, explains Dr V Jayasree, the medical officer in Kozhikode district, where 378 persons are under observation (as on February 8).Since those who left China before the Indian governments evacuation exercise came to Kerala via Kolkata, it was fairly straightforward for the state health department officials to prepare a list of those with Chinese travel history. As the list was compiled quickly, all of them were put under instant observation. While many of these people voluntarily reported to the department and went into isolation at homes, we had to track down another section of people who had returned from China but were unsure about what to do next, says Dr Fettle.After the health department received information about the positive tests, the next step was to prepare a list of those who had come in contact with infected patients. These people were categorised into two sections  high- and low-risk. Those in the high risk were persons who had spent long hours with the confirmed cases, or those who had had any fluid contact with them.The Nipah virus was confined to Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. This time, while the three confirmed cases are from Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasaragod, those under observation hail from districts across the state, said an official.So far, Kerala has deployed over 100 experts and officials, including doctors, at the state-level control room. The team has been further split into 18 committees, each with a specific task  managing the treatment of the positive cases, collecting samples and their dispatch, community-level volunteers for supporting those in isolation, and a psychological support team for those under home quarantine, among other duties. Apart from a state-level medical board, three separate medical boards have been instituted in the three districts that has reported the positive cases of coronavirus.Read | 61 coronavirus cases on ship, Indian crew in quarantineWe have also set up a call centre to address the publics doubts about the infection. We have received 9,000 calls so far, said an official. Also, 7,515 elected representatives in local self-governing bodies and 14,177 Kudumbashree (the poverty eradication and women empowerment programme of the state government) volunteers have been trained on public health issues as part of a capacity-building exercise by the state health department.Since February 3, the control room has also been helping those in quarantine with tele-counselling. So far, we have not received any complaints of mental trauma. Most people in quarantine only had doubts about the infection, says Dr Maya Peethambaran, nodal officer for tele-counselling in Alappuzha district.China: 723 deaths, over 34,000 infectionsPatients at an exhibition centre that has been converted into a temporary hospital in Wuhan. (AP Photo) Patients at an exhibition centre that has been converted into a temporary hospital in Wuhan. (AP Photo)Ningning thinks of them as DIY slogans. From 8 am to 5 pm, a loudspeaker outside her parents home in a closely packed apartment compound in Shiyan in northwestern Hubei hollers at the community: If you have one peck of rice, dont go anywhere crowded; if you have one sprig of onion, dont hang at the market; if you have one piece of meat, dont show your face at the supermarket; if you have a breath of air, stay home and guard the ranch.Like the rest of Hubei province, Shiyan, a prefecture-level city about a seven-hour drive from Wuhan, is under lockdown. For the 300 families confined to their apartments, these slogans sound like cheesy poems on a loop, says Ningning, a 26-year-old who studies in Beijing. Like millions of people in China, she too was part of what is seen as the worlds largest annual migration  a trip home for the Chinese New Year. But from 1 am on January 25, Shiyan went quiet.The lockdown has brought life to a halt for the over 50 million residents of Hubei, who are now following a series of instructions  stay indoors, wash hands with soap regularly, wear a mask while stepping out, and nominate family members for grocery runs, among others. With authorities racing against time to build two hospitals, gyms and exhibition centres in the region are being converted into make-shift isolation wards.Read | Why Kerala could have a lesson on how to contain coronavirusAccording to Chinese health authorities, as of February 8, the virus has claimed at least 723 lives and infected 34,600 people in China. Twenty-four other countries have confirmed at least 266 infections in all. On January 30, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global emergency.Among those forced to stay indoors in Wuhan is Monika Sethuraman, a PhD scholar in international relations at the Central China Normal University in Wuhan. From late December, the 31-year-old had been poring over virus-related articles, after first reading about it in a Chinese blog. By the last week of January, I still saw very little news about it in the Indian media. I was worried, lots of Indians had left the town before the lockdown, she says.As the virus outbreak grew, the first batch of 324 Indian students were evacuated from Wuhan on February 1. One of the evacuees captured the journey in a five-minute video titled Indians evacuation on silent roads of China, set to the soundtrack of Miss Everything by Mindme and uploaded it on YouTube. The next day, a video of students wearing masks and dancing to Punjabi music from their quarantine camp in Manesar, Haryana, went viral.For weeks, says Sethuraman, she remained confused over whether to stay or leave. I was sniffling a bit and felt confused over what to do, whether it was safe to travel There were reports that the virus could be transmitted through faecal material, what if the public toilets are unclean? I just decided to stay, she says over WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app, from Wuhan.Among those who, as Sethuraman says, left just before the lockdown was a 25-year-old medical student from Delhi. He travelled with two of the three students from Kerala who tested positive for the coronavirus. We were doing our internship at a hospital in Wuhan in January when a patient with coronavirus was admitted. All foreign students were told to stay away though it wasnt certain at the time if human-to-human transmission was confirmed, he says over the phone from South Delhi.When word got out that a lockdown was imminent on January 24, he and a group of 12 students left town immediately. We took a train from Wuhan to Kunming, and then from there we flew to Kolkata. I then took a train to Delhi, he says. A journey of roughly 48 hours in all.Back in China, as the virus rapidly spread out of Wuhan, many kept a watch on those coming from Hubei  a Chinese identity card starting with the digits 42 indicates Hubei residency. In the weeks following the outbreak, many residents of the province have been subjected to unsolicited phone calls from strangers inquiring if they are running a fever.At Roshchino Airport outside Tyumen, Russia, medical teams prepare to receive passengers arriving from Wuhan. Reuters Photo At Roshchino Airport outside Tyumen, Russia, medical teams prepare to receive passengers arriving from Wuhan. Reuters PhotoEarlier this week, four Chinese cities, including Hangzhou and Taizhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang (about 800 km from Wuhan), restricted movement of its residents. The AFP reported that landlords in some parts of the province were also forbidden from renting property to people from severely affected areas such as Hubei if they had travelled to their hometowns recently.In Zhengzhou in Henan province, over 500 km from Wuhan, an Indian doctor explains the restrictions on residents. People in my apartment block are allowed to step out for only five hours each morning: 6 am to 11 am. We border Hubei province and we are under red alert, he says. Everywhere they check our temperature, when we leave the apartment, at the supermarket, on our way back. When I come back home, I have to show the apartment security team my passport and briefly pass through a room that sprays disinfectant on me to kill any germs on my clothes, he adds.Also Read | At key testing centre in Pune, 604 samples checked so farSince January 31, the 25-year-old doctor, who has been in China for seven years, has not been allowed to visit the hospital he works at. I step out of my room to use the toilet or cook some food. There is no fresh air here, he says.Across China, danwei or work units have been asked to monitor every employee. Every danwei across the country has been instructed to keep health details of its employees updated, including information such as temperature, health problems in the family, and if they have travelled to Wuhan, says Shanghai University Assistant Professor Rajiv Ranjan, adding, In Shanghai, there is a rationing system for masks, to avoid hoarding. The first batch of masks will be handed out from February 2 to 11. A household can register in their society using their hukou (household registration) or passport, and five masks per family for 2.5 kuai will be handed out.A British national who was visiting a friend in Hubei for the Chinese New Year says smaller towns have been dealing with the health crisis in a much calmer manner, unlike big cities which have been alarmed with real-time news reports. In villages, local authorities have been using gongs and loudspeakers to disseminate information because people may not read the news.While most Chinese cities wear dystopian looks, online, people seem to have found ways to amuse themselves. Videos of bored people reading books on statistics to their cats, making masks out of orange peels, dressing up as dragons, and playing indoor badminton have flooded the Internet.A Chinese man went to a public square in France wearing a mask and held a placard that read I am a human, I am not a virus. And then French people are seen hugging him, says Ranjan, recalling a video shared on a WeChat group to address the prejudice against Chinese people abroad after the outbreak.While most took to the Internet to kill time, Cui Xiaohui, a professor at Wuhan Universitys Big Data and Cloud Computing Lab, decided to use it to build an online platform to connect hospitals in need of medical supplies and those wanting to donate them. Using WeChat to organise 40 students, who sat alone in their apartments plugged into their laptops, Cui built Luoying Shanlian that connected donors to 800 hospitals across China. It is designed for smart phones. We send you a link and both donors and hospitals can submit contact information and details of what they have or need, he says. In the first two hours of its launch on February 1, the platform saw 1,00,000 clicks.For the Chinese, the year of the rat was meant to be auspicious, and as the country struggles to deal with the public health emergency, Lin Yin, a 35-year-old university professor from Foshan city in Guangdong province, is hopeful. This Spring festival, my father suffered a stroke and now there is misfortune for my country But we shall overcome this and help each other out, she says.Back in Wuhan, Sethuraman now spends her days volunteering at her universitys disease control centre, serving food and sharing information and reminders in various dormitory groups. During nights I do my term papers, she says. Apart from that I am trying to stay updated about the virus. I have no idea how this is going to end. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(Express Photo) The Atal Kisan-Mazdoor Canteen at New Grain market, Sector 20, Panchkula. (Express Photo)Haryana Vidhan Sabha Speaker Gian Chand Gupta on Thursday launched the Atal Kisan-Mazdoor Canteen in New Grain Market, Panchkula.Addressing the farmers and labourers present during the function, he said that the Haryana government is committed to the welfare of farmers and labourers. Schemes for the welfare of the farmers are being run that bring them a fair price for crops as well as a post-harvest compensation for vegetables. Farmers are being provided many facilities in the mandis. Under this link, the Haryana government has started the work of providing quality food at very subsidised rates to farmers and labourers who come to sell their crops in the mandis, he said.The canteen will be run by women of self-help groups in collaboration with the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board and Haryana State Rural Livelihood Mission. The highest quality food will be available at the rate of Rs 10 per plate. In this canteen, food will be provided from 11 am to 3 pm. Tawa chapati, rice, lentils, seasonal vegetables, and pure drinking water will be provided in the meal, Gupta added.He further added, More than 300 farmers and labourers will be provided food every day.

2020-02-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/pesticide-free-food-healthy-life-gunbir-singh-6272081/,"Grow pesticide-free food for a healthy life, says Gunbir Singh","There is tremendous interest among the farmers for organic production. (Representational Image) There is tremendous interest among the farmers for organic production. (Representational Image)Gunbir Singh, the president of Dilbir Foundation, is an environmentalist and has been working with farmers in Punjab, for about 12 years, to reduce the use of chemicals and produce a harvest in the natural way. He speaks to Chandigarh Newsline about his plans to promote the use of millets, which he claims are healthier than rice and wheat, in the Tricity.What made you launch this voyage to promote organic food?I first started eating organic myself and then cultivating it at home. Later, I took the initiative to other people. I have been working with farmers primarily in Punjab for almost 12 years now. The chemical cultivation was ushered in with the green revolution in the 1960s, before which farmers practiced natural cultivation. My aim is to promote natural cultivation. We ask farmers to practice natural cultivation in at least one part of their land. It has turned out that if a meeting is supposed to be for five farmers, 35 come.I first started eating organic myself and then cultivating it at home, says Gunbir Singh. I first started eating organic myself and then cultivating it at home, says Gunbir Singh.How do pesticides affect the soil?When chemicals are used for plants, they kill at least 95 per cent of friendly pests that enriches it. But when we stop using pesticides on our soil, it is enriched again with friendly pests coming back to the soil. The stubble we are burning today needs to be mulched into the soil itself to produce nutrients for it. Our work is to ask a farmer with five acres of land to start producing organic food for his family so that he makes a beginning. Once he gets to know the importance of organic food, we tell him how others also need to benefit from the organic food.What motivates the farmers to listen to you and introduce organic cultivation in their farms?There is tremendous interest among the farmers for organic production. One, they know the adverse affect of the chemicals they are putting in. Two, their own families are suffering from toxic fallouts such as tumors, cancers or other health issues. Our aim is to address the bigger farmers of the the Tricity, provide them with some incentives, so they come here and sell their food directly to the consumers. As a foundation, our effort is to streamline this process. As long as they are with us, we examine their produce and soil randomly without letting them know. If we find that any chemical has been used, we blacklist their products from our platform.What problems does a farmer face while growing natural food?If the farmer produces large amounts of wheat and rice, they will get a minimum support price from the government, but if they switch to natural cultivation, they will not get the support price. There is no ready buyer or government support, which is why he is unable to even risk one crop.The seeds are supplied on credit, the inputs are supplied on credit, and even the machineries are supplied on credit by the people who will normally pick up the produce also. Therefore, it is a vicious circle he is unable to come out of. Moreover, they are afraid of the fact that there is no ready market for organic food.How are you helping to get the farmers battle this problem?We provide a platform where the farmers know that if a normal product is being sold at Rs 30, the organic will be sold at Rs 40. We set up the weekly farmers market, one of which we are running in Amritsar since 2016. We put up the market every Sunday in Amritsar. Every Friday we run it at Rakh Bagh in Ludhiana and now we have started one in the Tricity.Over time, we have established contacts in other states as well. Our purist natural form of spices are sourced from a farm at Mundakayam in Kerala, for pulses we contact Andra Pradesh farmers and for fruits we engage with those growing fruits in Himachal Pradesh. There are four women farmers from Himachal Pradesh whose entire family, from generations, has not allowed chemicals to touch their farms and we get seasonal fruit from them.How is your foundation engaging with different kinds of people that too from other states?It is a melting pot of people, who will produce as well as make things which are sustainable, and thus create a model for sustainable lifestyle. Since we have been getting things from outside, we had to create a store called the Earth Store, an initiative of the Dilbir foundation. The store stocks merchandise from farmers and puts them on display at market places, on behalf of the farmers.How are millets produced and will these not be expensive for the common people?Millets do not need to be expensive, in fact, no natural products need to be expensive. My belief is that farmers must be paid for the additional effort he puts in to grow organic food. Compare it with the cost of healthcare in this country. Moreover, millets survive climate change, are pest-proof and can grow on their own. They require minimum water and urja (energy) from the sun.How has the Tricity responded to your initiative?We are in our third week here and the response of the local people has been very nice. In the Tricity, we have collaborated with Bella Vista in Sector 5, Panchkula. They provide us with the space and a place to stock the produce of the week besides running a food court for us. The food court uses the organic produce of farmers. They cook delicious meals to showcase to the people about the difference between the taste of the nutritious food and the normal chemical food. There are people who came here once and have continued coming. New products like millets and ragi malt are also being offered here. We also schedule master classes so that people can see how they can substitute their wheat and rice staples with millet, which is way more healthier and nutritious.Do you think residents of the Tricity can grow organic food at home?When one wants to grow things at home, vegetables are an easy bet. For example, in our kitchen garden we grow spinach, mustard, cauliflower, broccoli and mint. We get excited when people come to us and take our advice on kitchen gardening, because they love the soil and their children love to touch the soil and relish the joy of plucking carrots and radish, washing it and using it. Such practices take our children away from fast food to slow foods, which is the real nutritious diet. It also binds people to the good food produced. Only 18 inch of soil is required to grow veggies and we can also grow them in pots.Do you think the government is providing required support to farmers?The lack of the government support is one of the factors contributing to resistance to change. We also know that Punjabs underground water reservoirs have been in the red zone for decades now. We have to stop rice production here. Ample rice is produced in other parts of the country. Also, if you look at the other side, European Union has stopped rice trade from Punjab because of the chemical content. The writing is on the wall, change has to take place.

soil?when chemicals are used for plants, they kill at least 95 per cent of friendly pests that enriches it. but when we stop using pesticides on our soil, it is enriched again with friendly pests coming back to the soil. the stubble we are burning today needs to be mulched into the soil itself to produce nutrients for it. our work is to ask a farmer with five acres of land to start producing organic food for his family so that he makes a beginning. once he gets to know the importance of organic food, we tell him how others also need to benefit from the organic food.what motivates the farmers to listen to you and introduce organic cultivation in their farms?there is tremendous interest among the farmers for organic production. one, they know the adverse affect of the chemicals they are putting in. two, their own families are suffering from toxic fallouts such as tumors, cancers or other health issues. our aim is to address the bigger farmers of the the tricity, provide them with some incentives, so they come here and sell their food directly to the consumers. as a foundation, our effort is to streamline this process. as long as they are with us, we examine their produce and soil randomly without letting them know. if we find that any chemical has been used, we blacklist their products from our platform.what problems does a farmer face while growing natural food?if the farmer produces large amounts of wheat and rice, they will get a minimum support price from the government, but if they switch to natural cultivation, they will not get the support price. there is no ready buyer or government support, which is why he is unable to even risk one crop.the seeds are supplied on credit, the inputs are supplied on credit, and even the machineries are supplied on credit by the people who will normally pick up the produce also. therefore, it is a vicious circle he is unable to come out of. moreover, they are afraid of the fact that there is no ready market for organic food.how are you helping to get the farmers battle this problem?we provide a platform where the farmers know that if a normal product is being sold at rs 30, the organic will be sold at rs 40. we set up the weekly farmers market, one of which we are running in amritsar since 2016. we put up the market every sunday in amritsar. every friday we run it at rakh bagh in ludhiana and now we have started one in the tricity.over time, we have established contacts in other states as well. our purist natural form of spices are sourced from a farm at mundakayam in kerala, for pulses we contact andra pradesh farmers and for fruits we engage with those growing fruits in himachal pradesh. there are four women farmers from himachal pradesh whose entire family, from generations, has not allowed chemicals to touch their farms and we get seasonal fruit from them.how is your foundation engaging with different kinds of people that too from other states?it is a melting pot of people, who will produce as well as make things which are sustainable, and thus create a model for sustainable lifestyle. since we have been getting things from outside, we had to create a store called the earth store, an initiative of the dilbir foundation. the store stocks merchandise from farmers and puts them on display at market places, on behalf of the farmers.how are millets produced and will these not be expensive for the common people?millets do not need to be expensive, in fact, no natural products need to be expensive. my belief is that farmers must be paid for the additional effort he puts in to grow organic food. compare it with the cost of healthcare in this country. moreover, millets survive climate change, are pest-proof and can grow on their own. they require minimum water and urja (energy) from the sun.how has the tricity responded to your initiative?we are in our third week here and the response of the local people has been very nice. in the tricity, we have collaborated with bella vista in sector 5, panchkula. they provide us with the space and a place to stock the produce of the week besides running a food court for us. the food court uses the organic produce of farmers. they cook delicious meals to showcase to the people about the difference between the taste of the nutritious food and the normal chemical food. there are people who came here once and have continued coming. new products like millets and ragi malt are also being offered here. we also schedule master classes so that people can see how they can substitute their wheat and rice staples with millet, which is way more healthier and nutritious.do you think residents of the tricity can grow organic food at home?when one wants to grow things at home, vegetables are an easy bet. for example, in our kitchen garden we grow spinach, mustard, cauliflower, broccoli and mint. we get excited when people come to us and take our advice on kitchen gardening, because they love the soil and their children love to touch the soil and relish the joy of plucking carrots and radish, washing it and using it. such practices take our children away from fast food to slow foods, which is the real nutritious diet. it also binds people to the good food produced. only 18 inch of soil is required to grow veggies and we can also grow them in pots.do you think the government is providing required support to farmers?the lack of the government support is one of the factors contributing to resistance to change. we also know that punjabs underground water reservoirs have been in the red zone for decades now. we have to stop rice production here. ample rice is produced in other parts of the country. also, if you look at the other side, european union has stopped rice trade from punjab because of the chemical content. the writing is on the wall, change has to take place. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest

They were part of his personal army and were called Chaush. Their residential quarters were made in barracks in outskirts of the city.As time went by, the word perhaps stretched, corrupted and became Barkas, now famous for its Mandi Laham, a fragrant dish of long-grained rice, succulent lamb pieces and dry fruits eaten with cabbage shreds and walnut chutney.Its not just the Yemenis settled in Barkas, who are known to prepare this sumptuous dish among others, at Tarnaka and Sitaphalmandi live several citizens from Yemen, mostly pursuing their Masters or doctorate from Osmania University and English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) located in the area.Thats how the last weekend at the premises of Osmania University (OU) as part of Food and Culture Exhibition - 2020 organised by Telangana Foreign Students Association and ICCR, one saw cultural events and food stalls by students of several countries from Asia and Africa.But it was the food from Yemen which disappeared first given its unique taste and texture.There was, of course, Khabsa Laham and Mandi.Other than these two typical Yemeni dishes there was Bent Alsahn, a layered bread prepared with wheat and eggs, baked in clay pits with a generous dash of poppy and sesame seeds on the top.It is dipped in honey and then eaten. Another dish was Fahsah made with vegetables, fenugreek seeds and then mixed with lamb chunks and cooked on low fire.And students prepared several of these items at their home in the surrounding areas. Says a Yemeni citizen Ahmed Fuad Musawa, 31, whos a doctoral student in post-colonial studies at (OU), I have been living in Hyderabad for more than five years and have celebrated several Eids here because this city gives a home-like feel. But because of the fee hike after 2014, many students have chosen to study in other parts of the country like Jaipur or Punjab.There are 30-35 Yemeni families living in the city most of them involved in higher studies. But its Hyderabad which gives them access to several food items if not all.Says Mohammed Zabeer, 24, an undergraduate from Yemen studying English Literature from EFLU, Though we are away and dont get everything what we used to get at home, fests like these bring us together sharing food stories with one another.A look at their platter tells you that most of the bread varieties are similar to tandoori rotis. There was Rashbosh, Malbooj, Rateb all made from wheat flour.The delicacy Lahuh was almost similar to that of dosa prepared with wheat and jawar eaten with curd or dipped in a chutney named Sahawek prepared with tomatoes, green chillies, coriander, garlic and cheese.A close observation of the ingredients used in the cuisine tells you the similarities between Indian delicacies and the use of tandoor.

Restaurants are increasingly aware of why at-home diners prefer cloud kitchens over them. A large part of it has to do with serving size. First movers in Indias cloud kitchen scene  like Rebel Foods, the Pune-based entity that owns Faasos, Lunch Box, Behrouz, The Good Bowl and Oven Story among others  tend to have menus featuring either single-person dishes and combos, or party sizes fit for at least four to five people. Both tailored for a night in, be it social or solitary.Restaurants and cafs, on the other hand, serve items that are either meant to be shared by two people, or that come with their share of frills in terms of sides, sauces and platings. Attractive when eating out, cumbersome when dining in.So a few of them have started changing things around. Take, for instance, the 11-year-old chain Smoke House Deli, which has branches in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and Kolkata. The brand has started relaunching its restaurants as Smoke House Deli 2.0, the fourth and most recent one unveiled in Delhi this week.In a company statement, Smoke House Deli 2.0 boasts healthier options in its menu, a more airy, open, and modern ambience, and more importantly, a grab-and-go counter which has its own, separate presence on food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato. The latter is called Goodness To Go by Smoke House Deli, and features a menu curated by brand head and head chef Jaydeep Mukherjee.According to Jaydeep, the idea is to provide a station where patrons can step in to grab quick meals, healthy smoothies, salads, sandwiches etc. Easy and convenient, it allows patrons to keep up with their busy lifestyle on-the-go, while still eating mindfully. The packaging keeps that in mind, making the food easy to grab not only for rushing customers, but also for delivery personnel.Meanwhile, Chennai-based Ciclo Cafe, which expanded its presence to Bengaluru and Delhi, has now scaled back into its hometown and is working on regrouping, says marketing head Amrutha Anandanathan. The caf has launched a health-based delivery vertical called Ciclo Life, which features a salad bowl and meals, with plenty of quinoa, millets and cauliflower rice making their presence felt. Says Amrutha, We dont want to call it health food completely, but rather delicious food with a healthy leaning. The menu also includes popular staples that we have taken from Ciclo Cafe, and given healthier variations, including multigrain and keto-friendly options. The service has three successfully running branches in Chennai alone  RA Puram, Anna Nagar and OMR  and is now confident of expanding well in other cities. We have experienced chefs, and a team that knows how to run things. We are strengthening our home base first, adds Amrutha.In terms of operations, this system seems to be working out to the restaurants advantage, with the basic infrastructure already built in and a whole new clientle to reach out to. With the same team and kitchen staff handling these new verticals, restaurants can retain the image and branding that provided them loyal customers over the years, instead of depending on the outsourced kitchens and infrastructure provided by delivery platforms, that many cloud-only kitchens tend to depend on.Swiggy, for instance, is reportedly tying-up with Bengaluru-based restobar chain Gillys, for the operation of two new delivery-only brands. One is called Kitchens of Punjab, and the other is Kitchens of China. These outfits operate out of infrastructure that are already existent at Gillys outlets, and be run by the existing Gillys staff. Swiggy does not offer any infrastructure in this case; it only helps with delivery, according to Swiggy. Only the menu and the online presence will be separate from the motherbrand, and will be focussed entirely on delivery, according to Swiggy.Similarly, Goodness To Go by Smoke House Deli operates out of a central kitchen that is otherwise used for coordination between its various Mumbai branches. While Goodness To Go is mainly present as a counter within each Smoke House Deli 2.0, a standalone outpost operates inside a Crossword bookstore in Mumbais Kemps Corner, and depends entirely on this central kitchen. On delivery apps, too, this vertical stands on its own with a full menu. More are to follow, in other bookstores and unexpected hangouts. The idea, as chef Jaydeep puts it, is for it to metamorphose into an artfully imaginative, wholesome and evolved version of itself.","we all have our favourite restaurants, that we walk into for the familiar comfort of it, for the ambience, for the dj who gets it just right, for the waiter who knows our go-to order, or for memories shared with friends, families or dates.and then we have our favourite order-at-home options, which may or may not be (and usually are not) the same as our walk-in haunts.often, the latter is not a full-fledged restaurant but a cloud kitchen  one that focusses on how to portion and package a meal for one, indulgent or guilt-free, ideal for solitary binge sessions at the end of a long, hard day that leaves us too drained to cook. restaurants are increasingly aware of why at-home diners prefer cloud kitchens over them. a large part of it has to do with serving size. first movers in indias cloud kitchen scene  like rebel foods, the pune-based entity that owns faasos, lunch box, behrouz, the good bowl and oven story among others  tend to have menus featuring either single-person dishes and combos, or party sizes fit for at least four to five people. both tailored for a night in, be it social or solitary.restaurants and cafs, on the other hand, serve items that are either meant to be shared by two people, or that come with their share of frills in terms of sides, sauces and platings. attractive when eating out, cumbersome when dining in.so a few of them have started changing things around. take, for instance, the 11-year-old chain smoke house deli, which has branches in mumbai, bengaluru, delhi and kolkata. the brand has started relaunching its restaurants as smoke house deli 2.0, the fourth and most recent one unveiled in delhi this week.in a company statement, smoke house deli 2.0 boasts healthier options in its menu, a more airy, open, and modern ambience, and more importantly, a grab-and-go counter which has its own, separate presence on food delivery platforms swiggy and zomato. the latter is called goodness to go by smoke house deli, and features a menu curated by brand head and head chef jaydeep mukherjee.according to jaydeep, the idea is to provide a station where patrons can step in to grab quick meals, healthy smoothies, salads, sandwiches etc. easy and convenient, it allows patrons to keep up with their busy lifestyle on-the-go, while still eating mindfully. the packaging keeps that in mind, making the food easy to grab not only for rushing customers, but also for delivery personnel.meanwhile, chennai-based ciclo cafe, which expanded its presence to bengaluru and delhi, has now scaled back into its hometown and is working on regrouping, says marketing head amrutha anandanathan. the caf has launched a health-based delivery vertical called ciclo life, which features a salad bowl and meals, with plenty of quinoa, millets and cauliflower rice making their presence felt. says amrutha, we dont want to call it health food completely, but rather delicious food with a healthy leaning. the menu also includes popular staples that we have taken from ciclo cafe, and given healthier variations, including multigrain and keto-friendly options. the service has three successfully running branches in chennai alone  ra puram, anna nagar and omr  and is now confident of expanding well in other cities. we have experienced chefs, and a team that knows how to run things. we are strengthening our home base first, adds amrutha.in terms of operations, this system seems to be working out to the restaurants advantage, with the basic infrastructure already built in and a whole new clientle to reach out to. with the same team and kitchen staff handling these new verticals, restaurants can retain the image and branding that provided them loyal customers over the years, instead of depending on the outsourced kitchens and infrastructure provided by delivery platforms, that many cloud-only kitchens tend to depend on.swiggy, for instance, is reportedly tying-up with bengaluru-based restobar chain gillys, for the operation of two new delivery-only brands. one is called kitchens of punjab, and the other is kitchens of china. these outfits operate out of infrastructure that are already existent at gillys outlets, and be run by the existing gillys staff. swiggy does not offer any infrastructure in this case;

All the contractors fled once PM announced the lockdown on March 24, leaving all daily wage labourers jobless. Their condition was very bad. They had no food to eat and were packing their stuff to walk back to their villages in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Sidhu said.Watching children who had not eaten a proper meal for the day strengthened the resolve of Sidhu to bring smiles back on these faces.From the next day, we started making a ration bag having 5 kg each of flour and rice, 1 kg Chana daal (pulses), a packet each of salt, tea, turmeric and red chilli powder, said Sidhu, a seven-time desert storm rally winner. However, distribution was a challenge.There was panic among people and getting them to stay in queues was difficult. On top of it, we had to maintain social distancing. We had to cancel our plan on March 25 because of the threat of a stampede, Sidhu said.On March 26, with the help of Punjab Police , we started distributing the ration following all the guidelines. Till now, we have distributed rations to 1,000 families living in the slums, he said.Sidhu has spent Rs 4.5 lakh from his own pocket for the cause. Its all my money. I have not taken a single penny from others.

2020-04-07,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/farmers-are-at-their-wits-end/article31273857.ece,Farmers are at their wits’ end,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to global concerns on the state of agriculture and food security. On the one hand, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned of a food crisis if countries do not protect vulnerable people from hunger and malnourishment. On the other, farmers face a stalemate as they are unable to work on their land, earn remunerative prices and gain access to markets. We can try to understand the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture with three questions. One, does the world have enough food to feed its people? Two, is food available at affordable prices? Three, how are farmers coping with the lockdown?Also read: Coronavirus | Rabi harvest to be affected for want of farm workersFood stocks and pricesAccording to the FAO, as on April 2, 2020, the total stock of cereals in the world was about 861 million tonnes. This translates to a stocks-to-use ratio (SUR)  i.e., proportion of consumption available as stocks  of 30.7%. The FAO considers this comfortable. The SURs for wheat, rice and coarse grains were 35.3%, 35.1% and 26.9%, respectively. But world stocks are different from national stocks. About 52% of the global wheat stocks is held by China, and about 20% of the global rice stocks is held by India. If the major holders of global stocks decide to turn precautionary and stop exporting, and if the lockdown is prolonged, countries dependent on rice imports will suffer.Kazakhstan, a major wheat exporter, has banned exports. Russia, the largest wheat exporter, is expected to restrict its exports. Vietnam, the third largest rice exporter, has stopped its exports, which will reduce the global rice exports by 15%. If India and Thailand too ban exports, world supply of rice will sharply fall. In March 2020, the Philippines and the European Union, major rice importers, had inventories of rice enough to feed their populations for about three months. Others, however, had inventories to hold on for about one month only. If the lockdown continues beyond a month, these countries will face food shortages.Indias foodgrain output is projected to be about 292 MMT in 2019-20. On March 1, 2020, the total stock of wheat and rice with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was 77.5 MT. The buffer norms for foodgrain stocks  i.e., operational stock plus strategic reserves  is 21.04 MT. Similarly, for pulses, India had a stock of 2.25 MT in mid-March 2020. In both cases, the rabi harvest is slated to arrive in April 2020, and the situation is expected to ease further.There is always an element of uncertainty on how prices will behave if both demand and supply fall together. Prices in different markets fluctuate considerably given differences in the extent of production, stocks, arrivals and supply disruptions. According to the FAO, the world food price index fell by 4.3% and world cereal price index fell by 1.9% between February and March 2020 due to the weakening demand for food and the sharp fall in maize prices owing to poor demand for biofuels. However, retail prices of rice and wheat have been rising in the Western economies in March 2020. The major reasons identified are panic buying by households, export restrictions by countries and continuing supply chain disruptions. Retail prices of beef and eggs have also been rising.In India, wholsesale and consumer price indices (WPI and CPI) for March 2020 have not been published yet. WPI and CPI for food in India were rising from mid-2019 onwards, reflecting a rise in vegetable prices, especially onion prices. January and February 2020 saw a moderate fall in these indices, but vegetable prices have remained high. If food prices rise due to the lockdown, it will be on top of an already rising price curve.However, unlike in the West, food prices in India have not risen after the lockdown. While supplies have declined, demand has fallen too. In the APMC mandi in Mumbais Vashi, if about 600 to 700 trucks arrived per day before the lockdown, only about 200 trucks arrive per day after the lockdown. Yet, wholesale prices of foodgrains and vegetables in the mandi have been stable, with only the prices of pulses showing a tendency to rise. This is because there has been a sharp fall in the consumption of foodgrains and vegetables. Similarly, the consumption of milk has fallen by 10-12%.The crisis in farmingHarvesting and marketing of crops are in crisis across India, because of (a) disruptions in the procurement of foodgrains by government agencies; (b) disruptions in the collection of harvests from the farms by traders; (c) shortage of workers to harvest the rabi crops; (d) shortage of truck drivers; (e) blockades in the transport of commodities; (f) limited operations of APMC mandis; and (g) shutdowns in the retail markets.Second, these supply bottlenecks have led to a fall in farmgate prices. According to media reports, tomato growers in Maharashtra were receiving only 2 per kg. Wheat prices in Madhya Pradesh fell from 2200/Q to about 1,600/Q. In Punjab, vegetable prices fell from 15/kg to 1/kg. In Delhi, the price of broiler chicken fell from 55/kg in January to 24/kg in March. In Tamil Nadu, egg prices fell from 4/egg in January to 1.95/egg in March.Third, the large-scale return of migrant workers to their homes has disrupted harvest operations, and farmers are being forced to leave the crop in the fields. While mechanical harvesters can be used, there is a shortage of drivers/operators. Most rice mills work with migrant workers, and their return home has meant that these mills are not buying paddy from farmers. There are also severe labour shortages in milk processing plants, cold storage units and warehouses.Fourth, supply chains remain disrupted across India. Agricultural goods have been notified as essential goods. But about 5,00,000 trucks are reportedly stranded in the highways and State borders. Milk trucks are able to unload at the destination but unable to return empty, which has upset supply schedules. Trucks are in shortage as drivers have gone home. Imports of vegetable oils are not being lifted from ports due to shortage of trucks. Most APMC mandis are functioning only twice or thrice a week. Livestock feeds are in short supply, and this is breaking the back of livestock growers.The world and India have adequate food stocks. But as global trade shrinks and supply disruptions persist, a prolonged lockdown will adversely affect food security in many countries. In the Western world, food prices are rising due to panic buying and stockpiling. Food prices are not yet rising in India. What has kept Indian food prices low is the severe decline in food consumption, especially among the poor, after the lockdown. That is, hunger may keep the food inflation in March 2020 low. Concurrently, farmers face acute labour shortages, falling farmgate prices and lack of access to input/output markets. It is unclear who is benefiting, but farmers, workers and the poor are at their wits end.R.

2020-04-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/after-harvesting-the-next-farm-challenge-seeds-for-kharif-6367226/,"After harvesting, the next farm challenge: seeds for kharif","A cotton seed growers in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh (Express Photo by Harish Damodaran) A cotton seed growers in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh (Express Photo by Harish Damodaran)While the governments focus is now on harvesting and marketing of the rabi crop, there is a no-less-immediate challenge ahead amidst the lockdown: Ensuring adequate seed availability in the ensuing kharif planting season, even as the India Meteorological Department has forecast a 100% normal monsoon.Nursery sowing of paddy in Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh starts after mid-May, while from June in the rest of India. Farmers either use new seeds or plant the grain saved from previous years production. Given the 15-20% yield loss from the latter, the preference is for planting new seeds even in the case of open-pollinated varieties (OPVs), as against hybrids.Roughly 40% of Indias paddy area is sown with fresh certified or truthfully-labeled seeds, with this replacement ratio over 70% in Punjab and Haryana. Also, farmers want specific varieties  for example, Pusa-1509, 1121 and 1718 in basmati and PR-126 and HKR-147 in non-basmati paddy  whose seeds they stock 15-20 days before nursery preparation, said A.K. Singh, director, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi.Read| Amid lockdown, we need action plan to manage our agriculture, livestock sectorsIn North-West India, there are enough local suppliers to meet demand. IARI alone has 50-odd licensed growers of its basmati variety seeds, who supply 5,000-10,000 quintals each. Basmati rice exporter KRBL Ltd produces 22,000-22,500 quintals through its own contract seed cultivation programme, which can cover up to 3.75 lakh acres at 6 kg per acre.The problem is really in eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, where the new seed requirements for high-yielding OPVs is largely met by South-based companies such as Nuziveedu Seeds, Kaveri Seeds and assorted smaller players. They do contract seed production mainly in Telangana (Karimnagar, Warangal, Khammam, Nalgonda and Medak districts) and Andhra Pradesh (West and East Godavari, Krishna and Nellore). This seed has to be processed, packaged and transported to the user states, well in time for nursery planting.That urgency is even more in hybrid seeds, which, unlike OPVs, lose their vigour on re-planting and have to be bought afresh every season. Out of the countrys about 108 million acres of paddy area, an estimated 7.5 million is covered under hybrids. Hybrid seed penetration is, interestingly, more in poorer states such as Jharkhand (25-30% of paddy acreage), UP and Bihar (15-20%), and Chhattisgarh and Odisha (10%). Even there, the penetration is higher in the adivasi belts, ranging from 35-40% in southwest Odisha to 60-70% in north Chhattisgarh and west & south Jharkhand (60-70%). The reason: In rainfed conditions, per-acre paddy yields are only 7-8 quintals from traditional varieties and 13-14 quintals from improved OPVs, while 20 quintals-plus from hybrids. That yield advantage is less in assured irrigated areas such as Punjab, where farmers get 30 quintals even with OPVs.Around 70% of hybrid paddy seeds  the market size is 45,000 tonnes; farmers sow 6 kg per acre at Rs 200-250/kg  are produced in Telangana, that too, during the rabi season. Harvesting of this crop, from April 10-15 till the month-end, is currently on. The raw grains have to first be cleaned of impurities and then sent for quality control, grading, treatment against stored grain pests, packaging and labeling. The packed seeds are dispatched to warehouses in different states and from there to district-level distributors and local retailers.Packing and dispatches happen from April and till May 15-20. This time, there is shortage of both trucks and labour at our plants. While our transport is normally by 20-25 tonne trucks, we are now also exploring movement by 800-900 tonnes rail rakes, a spokesperson of Bayer CropScience told The Indian Express. The German multinational  it has the worlds biggest hybrid paddy seed processing plant at Pragnapur, near Hyderabad  is the market leader in this segment, followed by Corteva Agriscience (earlier part of DowDuPont), Rallis India, SeedWorks International, Syngenta India and VNR Seeds.Seed availability is also a concern in maize, where hybrid penetration is above 80%. Again, 80% of the annual seed production of 120,000-130,000 tonnes (farmers plant 8 kg per acre at Rs 170-180/kg) is during the rabi season, despite two-thirds of the consumption taking place in kharif. The relatively dry weather in rabi (reducing pest and disease incidence) and uniform crop growth possible through irrigation (the male and female plants must flower at the same time for better pollination) is most conducive for seed cultivation.Like in hybrid paddy, 70-80% of maize seed production is in one state (AP), and the rest in Telangana and Karnataka. And with all of it  from harvesting the cobs to drying, cleaning, grading for quality, seed treatment and packing  going on right now, companies are struggling to complete dispatches by mid-May. The major players here are Corteva, Bayer, Syngenta, Rallis, Nuziveedu, Kaveri and Advanta Seeds.Both the Telangana and AP governments have been very supportive in overcoming challenges relating to transportation and labour availability. Seed production is a big industry for them, similar to what IT is for Bengaluru or Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) for pharma, the Bayer spokesperson added.The situation is no less serious in other kharif crops, especially cotton and soyabean. Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan start planting cotton from April 15. The irrigated regions seed requirement is 90 lakh packets (out of 450 lakh for all-India). Due to the lockdown, nothing could be moved by trucks from the producing states of Telangana, AP, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Only 50 lakh packets have arrived by goods trains. The only breather we have is a 15-day delay in wheat harvesting, which should enable the remaining quantities to also come, noted Ram Kaundinya, director-general, Federation of Seed Industry of India.In cotton and soyabean, seed production happens during kharif. While companies procure raw grain from growers during October-January, the processing is only from February and peaking in March. For soyabean, that includes certification for physical/genetic purity and minimum germination by government testing laboratories. These certification tags are also stuck on the packets dispatched to distributors by early-May.Lockdown came in the peak processing period. Although all activities pertaining to seed production have been deemed essential services, issuance of passes for labour and permission for plants to operate by district administrations has been slow. Transportation, too, has been affected with truck drivers unwilling for long drives without roadside dhabas and repair shops. On top of it, certification laboratories have been non-functional, stated an Indore-based soyabean processor.Out of the 12 lakh tonnes or so soyabean seeds planted by farmers, 25-30% is certified. This time, it could be 100% farm-saved. Maharashtras agriculture department has already advised farmers to reuse last years grain rather than buy seeds. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

farmers sow 6 kg per acre at rs 200-250/kg  are produced in telangana, that too, during the rabi season. harvesting of this crop, from april 10-15 till the month-end, is currently on. the raw grains have to first be cleaned of impurities and then sent for quality control, grading, treatment against stored grain pests, packaging and labeling. the packed seeds are dispatched to warehouses in different states and from there to district-level distributors and local retailers.packing and dispatches happen from april and till may 15-20. this time, there is shortage of both trucks and labour at our plants. while our transport is normally by 20-25 tonne trucks, we are now also exploring movement by 800-900 tonnes rail rakes, a spokesperson of bayer cropscience told the indian express. the german multinational  it has the worlds biggest hybrid paddy seed processing plant at pragnapur, near hyderabad  is the market leader in this segment, followed by corteva agriscience (earlier part of dowdupont), rallis india, seedworks international, syngenta india and vnr seeds.seed availability is also a concern in maize, where hybrid penetration is above 80%. again, 80% of the annual seed production of 120,000-130,000 tonnes (farmers plant 8 kg per acre at rs 170-180/kg) is during the rabi season, despite two-thirds of the consumption taking place in kharif. the relatively dry weather in rabi (reducing pest and disease incidence) and uniform crop growth possible through irrigation (the male and female plants must flower at the same time for better pollination) is most conducive for seed cultivation.like in hybrid paddy, 70-80% of maize seed production is in one state (ap), and the rest in telangana and karnataka. and with all of it  from harvesting the cobs to drying, cleaning, grading for quality, seed treatment and packing  going on right now, companies are struggling to complete dispatches by mid-may. the major players here are corteva, bayer, syngenta, rallis, nuziveedu, kaveri and advanta seeds.both the telangana and ap governments have been very supportive in overcoming challenges relating to transportation and labour availability. seed production is a big industry for them, similar to what it is for bengaluru or baddi (himachal pradesh) for pharma, the bayer spokesperson added.the situation is no less serious in other kharif crops, especially cotton and soyabean. farmers in punjab, haryana and rajasthan start planting cotton from april 15. the irrigated regions seed requirement is 90 lakh packets (out of 450 lakh for all-india). due to the lockdown, nothing could be moved by trucks from the producing states of telangana, ap, maharashtra and gujarat. only 50 lakh packets have arrived by goods trains. the only breather we have is a 15-day delay in wheat harvesting, which should enable the remaining quantities to also come, noted ram kaundinya, director-general, federation of seed industry of india.in cotton and soyabean, seed production happens during kharif. while companies procure raw grain from growers during october-january, the processing is only from february and peaking in march. for soyabean, that includes certification for physical/genetic purity and minimum germination by government testing laboratories. these certification tags are also stuck on the packets dispatched to distributors by early-may.lockdown came in the peak processing period. although all activities pertaining to seed production have been deemed essential services, issuance of passes for labour and permission for plants to operate by district administrations has been slow. transportation, too, has been affected with truck drivers unwilling for long drives without roadside dhabas and repair shops. on top of it, certification laboratories have been non-functional, stated an indore-based soyabean processor.out of the 12 lakh tonnes or so soyabean seeds planted by farmers, 25-30% is certified. this time, it could be 100% farm-saved. maharashtras agriculture department has already advised farmers to reuse last years grain rather than buy seeds. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest india news, download indian express app. ie online media services pvt ltd"

(Express photo/Anil Sharma)Coronavirus India Updates: With the biggest single-day spike in the number of Covid-19 cases within a span of 24 hours, India on Monday recorded 17,265 cases even as some easing of lockdown measures came into force. The death toll stood at 543. The total number of cases included 2,546 patients who have been discharged and one who has migrated.Meanwhile, in a communication to chief secretaries of state governments and Union Territory administrations, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said some states and UTs were issuing orders allowing activities that have not been allowed as per the guidelines issued by the Home Ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.I would again urge you to ensure compliance of the revised consolidated guidelines, and direct all authorities concerned for their strict implementation in letter and spirit without any dilution and to ensure strict compliance of lockdown measures, he said.Here is a look at all the latest Covid-19 developments:With a view to provide counselling and care for those suffering mental health problems or emotional distress due to the prolonged lockdown and deepening economic hardships, the state tribal development department on Sunday launched a helpline number especially for rural and tribal regions. The helpline is being operated by non-profits Prafulta and Project Mumbai.Already, 30 trained counsellors have been appointed and work has begun to spread awareness about the helpline. The counsellors, who are trained to speak in Marathi, Hindi and English, fielded over 100 calls on Sunday and an equal number on Monday. All 30 were continuously on the phones during their shift, with callers keeping the helpline busy throughout.The central government on Monday decided to convert surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) into ethanol for use in making alcohol-based hand-sanitizers.The decision was taken during a National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) meeting headed by Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan.A meeting of NBCC was held today under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, wherein it was approved that the surplus rice available with Food Corporation of India (FCI) may be converted to ethanol for utilization in making alcohol-based hand-sanitizers and in blending for Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme, the government said in a press release.As revised guidelines for the nationwide coronavirus lockdown came into effect from Monday, leading to easing of restrictions to mitigate economic hardships, several states permitted industrial activity, MNREGA work and government office functioning outside the containment zones. However, Karnataka joined Delhi, Telangana and Punjab in opting not to ease the lockdown restrictions till May 3 on a day India reported 1,553 fresh cases  the biggest single-day spike.As of Monday, the total number of positive cases stood at 17,265, including 543 deaths. The Centre has also allowed movement of migrant labour between districts within a state.Doubling rate now 7.5 days; 80 of 100 patients have no or mild symptoms, says ICMRAbout 80 out of 100 COVID-19 patients have no or mild symptoms of the disease, the ICMR, Delhi, said on Monday. Stating that infection prevention management is an important part of the disease management, Health Ministry said the doubling rate of the cases have gone down from 3.4 days before lockdown to 7.5 days now.Home Ministry said it has written letters to state governments pointing out lockdown violations in some areas in their respective states. States have been told that they can make the lockdown guidelines more stringent depending on the need in specific areas, but cant dilute them.

A report prepared by Punjabs State Covid Control Room (SCCR) shows that out of 12.22 lakh total migrant labourers in the state, 1.64 lakh were provided shelter and food by the industry during this period. This comes to 13 per cent of the total migrant labour in the entire state.While industry in districts of Amritsar, Sangrur, Hoshiarpur, Moga and Pathankot came forward in good numbers in providing food and shelter to the migrant labourers, migrant workforce in industrial hub of Ludhiana was largely taken care of by the state government and the NGOs, the report revealed.As per statistics compiled by the SCCR, four out of 22 districts in the state  Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar and Sangrur  account for close to 84 per cent of the migrant labour in Punjab currently.Punjab Additional Chief Secretary (Industries and Commerce) Vini Mahajan told The Indian Express, We believe that government, administration in districts and the industry everyone put together played a strong and positive role to ameliorate the distress by providing relief in the form of food or anything else to the migrant labour.

It provides newsprint to the leading newspapers and employs a huge workforce which it takes care of. Amritsar district is hub of Basmati rice export from Punjab. (Rice) shellers are open and functioning. The pharmaceutical industry is open. Also, the government has also allowed activities in rural areas which also have sizeable migrant population. All such labour is being catered to by the employer and the industry, said Dhillon.By providing shelter and food to workforce in the district, industries in Hoshiarpur district catered to almost all the migrant workforce. Hoshiarpur Deputy Commissioner Apneet Riyait said, We have big industries like Sonalika, Vardhman, Reliance, JCT, Century Plywood, Ludhiana Beverages, Quantum Papers and Hawkins etc. We ensured that they provide food and shelter and the wages to the migrant labour and ensure that they do not go back to their states like UP and Bihar amid the curfew and lockdown.As per the statistics, another district where employers ensured food and shelter for almost all migrant labour is Moga with 14,500 migrant labourers are being looked after by the employers. Moga Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Hans said the migrant labour in the district was working in rice shellers, brick kilns, focal points and other industries. Moga Additional Deputy Commissioner (Development) Subhash Chander said that there were 326 rice shellers and more than 100 brick kilns. Each brick kiln has around 100 labourers. The employer wants to retain such workforce, so they have ensured food and shelter to them. Also, it is the peak time in brick kilns and would last till the end of June when the rainy season starts. Brick kiln labour does not generally move out, so a brick kiln is also acting as sort of quarantine place, said Chander.Efforts by state and NGOsWhile employers are retaining and feeding the labour in several districts in good numbers, another chunk of migrant labour in the state is being provided food and ration by the state government, the NGOs and through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Over 30,000 ration kits, accounting for 17 per cent of total ration kits distributed in the state from March 31 to April 21, and nearly 4 lakh food packets  43 per cent of the total food cooked food distributed in the state, were distributed to migrant labour in varying proportions by the Punjab government, the NGOs and through SDRF.In Pathankot, which does not house any large number of migrant labourers as compared to some other districts, 12,861 were provided shelter and food. In addition to the labour working in places like brick kilns and crushers, there were migrants from Jammu and Kashmir who were in the district for around 22 days and for whom nine relief camps were set up, said Pathankot Deputy Commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira.Khaira said: Sects like Radha Soami Dera Beas and Nangli Wale Baba ji have been providing food to the labour in good numbers.

Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.Indias farm output has grown consistently, helping it reach food self-suffiency. Up from barely 50 million tonnes in 1950-51 to over 257 million tonnes in 2018-19, increasing foodgrain output has helped India avoid a situation in which the pace of growth in food output lags behind population.Yet, according to economists such as Amartya Sen, it is not the lack of food output, but bad distribution that has caused previous crises in India such as the last major famine of 1943 that killed an estimated 3 million people.Indian Railways has proved to be a lifeline during the coronavirus crisis, filling the large gap left by frayed private sector supply chains and a near-collapse of the wholesale markets.Maintaining continuity in supply chain was stiffer on account of tough working conditions due to lockdown. A constant coordination for terminal release/labour availability with DMs {district magistrates} at district level, state coordinating officers, and at apex level with MHA {ministry of home affairs} is being done by operating officers of Indian Railways, a railway ministry spokesperson said.Meticulous prior planning with FCI on destinations to which the foodgrains must be carried had also paid off, the spokesperson said.To be sure, Indian Railways has suffered considerable losses because of the suspension of passenger trains during the lockdown as well as a decline in transport of commodities like coal and coke, the primary commodities it ferries, earnings from which dropped 48.91% to Rs 2,336.4 crore in April from a year ago.Earnings from transport of foodgrains, flour and pulses shot up by more than 90% during the same period Rs 817.96 crore, according to railway ministry data reviewed by Hindustan Times.The first task for us was to identify surplus depots. Some depots already had railheads. Those were the first ones to be serviced, said a food ministry official, requesting anonymity.Punjab and Haryana account for 80% of outbound freight for wheat while 60% of rice reserves came from Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, according to official data.Interestingly, with no passenger trains plying on its network, Indian Railways has for the first time in decades found the tracks decongested enough to run its freight trains at record speeds; it has also begun joining two goods trains for the transportation of foodgrains. Under this concept, two freight trains loaded from two different originating stations are clubbed at the nearest junction point and proceed to a common destination.Over 1,000 train trips have been undertaken to carry grains, pulses and horticulture produce from state to state since the lockdown. On April 22, the network saw total cargo traffic of 102 trainloads carrying about 280,000 tonnes of grains, the highest single-day movement so far.The FCI moved 158 trainloads carrying 442,000 tonnes of foodgrains (22,000 tonne of wheat and 420,000 tonnes of rice) during the first 25-day period of the countrywide lockdown to the mountainous northeastern states, double its normal average of about 80 trainloads per month.One of the landmarks was to reach over 22,000 grains to the farthest depot on the Indian side in Manipurs Ukrul, which borders Myanmar. The northeasts hilly terrain means states in the region have few railheads.To ferry food to Arunchal Pradesh, which shares a boundary with China, food trains have been chugging on a meter-gauge track till Mukukchaleng in Assams Dhemaji district, an outback from where trucks make an onward journey to the higher reaches of Pasighat, a tribal town in Arunchal.These truck movements were undertaken in extremely challenging conditions,said Lalrothang, an FCI official in Nagaland, who goes by one name.","indiaupdated: apr 27, 2020 03:59 istindian railways has transported 5.2 million tonnes of foodgrains in the month since the country went under a lockdown on march 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, more than double the quantity the national transporter carried in the same time a year ago, as the centre tried to avert the spectre of hunger by making sure every region had plentiful food stock.with barely seven of indias 2,067 large wholesale food markets functioning in the initial days of the lockdown, the food corporation of india (fci) and indian railways went into overdrive to ferry grain stocks from food-surplus states to deficient ones.the railways transportation of food stocks has played the single most important role in combating hunger during the lockdown, acknowledged k. mani, an economist with the tamil nadu agricultural university.indias farm output has grown consistently, helping it reach food self-suffiency. up from barely 50 million tonnes in 1950-51 to over 257 million tonnes in 2018-19, increasing foodgrain output has helped india avoid a situation in which the pace of growth in food output lags behind population.yet, according to economists such as amartya sen, it is not the lack of food output, but bad distribution that has caused previous crises in india such as the last major famine of 1943 that killed an estimated 3 million people.indian railways has proved to be a lifeline during the coronavirus crisis, filling the large gap left by frayed private sector supply chains and a near-collapse of the wholesale markets.maintaining continuity in supply chain was stiffer on account of tough working conditions due to lockdown. a constant coordination for terminal release/labour availability with dms {district magistrates} at district level, state coordinating officers, and at apex level with mha {ministry of home affairs} is being done by operating officers of indian railways, a railway ministry spokesperson said.meticulous prior planning with fci on destinations to which the foodgrains must be carried had also paid off, the spokesperson said.to be sure, indian railways has suffered considerable losses because of the suspension of passenger trains during the lockdown as well as a decline in transport of commodities like coal and coke, the primary commodities it ferries, earnings from which dropped 48.91% to rs 2,336.4 crore in april from a year ago.earnings from transport of foodgrains, flour and pulses shot up by more than 90% during the same period rs 817.96 crore, according to railway ministry data reviewed by hindustan times.the first task for us was to identify surplus depots. some depots already had railheads. those were the first ones to be serviced, said a food ministry official, requesting anonymity.punjab and haryana account for 80% of outbound freight for wheat while 60% of rice reserves came from chhattisgarh, punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh and tamil nadu, according to official data.interestingly, with no passenger trains plying on its network, indian railways has for the first time in decades found the tracks decongested enough to run its freight trains at record speeds;

2020-04-28,https://www.news18.com/news/india/diminished-agricultural-selling-may-now-impact-indias-ability-to-feed-after-coronavirus-pandemic-2596237.html,Plummeting Sale of Agricultural Produce May Hit India's Ability to Feed after Coronavirus Pandemic,"New Delhi: More than a week after the Centre relaxed norms on agriculture and allied activities, farmers have been unable to sell their produce. Lack of harvesters, labour shortage, lacklustre storage facilities, untimely rains and a dying demand are now starting to point towards a supply constraint that may eventually manifest itself much after India expectedly emerges out of the coronavirus pandemic.With the non-availability of machines and agricultural labour, Ramesh Prasad and his son took half-a-month to harvest their wheat farm and another three days in storing and transporting it to the 'mandi'. They have hardly been able to sell anything for the past two days.""There is hardly any demand. There are no takers in mandis. Prices have come crashing down,"" said Prasad, a wheat farmer from Madhya Pradesh.Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh's Khairpur village in West Greater Noida, farmers had to either return home with their produce or sell them at negligible costs.Santu Singh, a local farmer in the area, was forced to strike a deal at a quarter of the usual costs.I sold chilli at Rs 10 per kilo. Normally, the selling price ranges from Rs 40 to Rs 45 a kilo when you sell on a quintal basis, he said.Singh was forced to sell his produce because the cost of transportation is too much to handle for small landholding farmers like him.There have also been several reports of farmers either setting their crops on fire or using it as animal fodder. Government buying is also yet to gather steam. The lockdown has impacted the pace of procurement, driving prices below the MSP (minimum support price) across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra even as costs incurred due to transport and harvesting have increased.The lack of procurement is worrisome because it determines what India eats in the year to come. Conceptually, grain stocks consist of three components: operational stocks, buffer stocks, and reserve stocks. Operational stocks are the stocks from current year production meant for the consumption in the year following the harvest. Buffer stocks are meant for price stabilisation, and reserve stocks are held for meeting shortage in supply over normal demand arising due to fall in production during an agriculturally bad year.India is, however, well off in terms of the food grain it has for this year in case a severe shortage arises. Against the requirement of 214 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice at the beginning of the year on January 1, 2020, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had 565.11 lakh tonnes, which means roughly two-and-a-half times more than the essential requirement for public distribution. With the new wheat arrivals expected from the first week of April, India has certainly nothing to worry about on the foodgrain front.In addition, India already has a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes of sugar, which the government is planning to raise to 40 lakh tonnes this fiscal. In the case of pulses, the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs has been trying since December to offload 8.47 lakh tonnes from its buffer stock of pulses.To understand the seriousness of the demand dearth, consider this: a farmer in Karnataka committed suicide last week after being unable to sell his harvest because of the lockdown. Rambhavan Shukla, another farmer from Jari village in UP, committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree over the non-availability of labour for harvesting his wheat crop.Just as farmers were dealing with the perils of the coronavirus-induced lockdown at a time when harvesting of the Rabi crop is supposed to be at its peak, untimely rains last week across most parts of north India exponentially increased their fears of a crop failure.Hailstorms hit fields in Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP exactly when wheat and Rabi crops were starting to be harvested.Immediately after the sudden announcement of the lockdown, migrant labourers had set off for their homes. While some reached, others are still stuck at various camps set up for their stay. As a result, there is shortage of agricultural labour in villages, which has delayed the harvest at a time when the temperature has already started to soar.According to the International Labour Organizations estimates, based on the Census 2011 figures, around 24 lakh migrants work in fields across India.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday said migrant labourers will be allowed to travel for work within the state with certain conditions, but they will not be able to cross borders.We have permission to harvest during the lockdown, but theres no labour available. My entire family has been manually harvesting the crop since last week,"" said Raju Singh, a wheat farmer in MP.Added to this is the delay in arrival of combine harvester machines that are responsible for more than 85% of the harvesting activities in the country. On an average, farmers said harvesting takes three days using machines. The same activity is performed in a week when agricultural labourers use their bare hands. In the absence of both now, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.The lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. As a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.Several farmers' organisations have requested their respective state governments to ensure the availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. They have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.Harvester operators from north India usually go to central and western parts of the country during winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. During this time, they return to states like Punjab, Haryana and UP to help harvest the rabi crop. Farmers in Haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP and Rajasthan due to the lockdown curbs.Those farmers who are somehow able to harvest their crops and transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. With most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.To understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: the price per quintal of gram in Maharashtra's Latur has dipped to Rs 3,650 whereas the MSP for the crop is Rs 4,875. Similarly in Rajasthan's Alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at Rs 3,600 per quintal, almost Rs 1,000 less than its MSP.In Karnataka, tomato prices crashed by over 50%, from Rs 1,290 a quintal last year to Rs 560 now.The price of ladies fingers are also down by nearly 40%. In Punjab, green chillies, cucumber, capsicum and cabbage are lying dumped at mandis for lack of buyers.Farmers across Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana said there are hardly any buyers in mandis.""I have hired carriers by spending double the amount to transport my crops to the mandis but to no use. It has been three days since I found a sizeable buyer,"" said Mahesh Kumar Singh, a farmer in Haryana.Support the daily wage earners who have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 crisis.

Two goods trains were joined together to form an 84-wagon train that transported 5,200 tonnes of rice and wheat.TWO GOODS trains were joined together to form an 84-wagon train that transported 5,200 tonnes of rice and wheat from Ludhiana to Assam on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. This was the first time that one of the 84-wagon trains two engines was operated remotely.This was the 107th Annapurna train operated by the Northern Railways since the lockdown began (between March 24 and April 27). All of them were of 84 wagons, while a few had 116 wagons as well, said Sudhir Kumar Singh. From Ferozepur division, nearly 450 goods trains went in total.84-wagon goods trains have been sent by Northern Railways earlier as well amid the outbreak. However, the train that went from Ludhiana to Assam driven by a loco pilot and co-pilot sitting in the front engine, while the second engine in the middle was managed by staff sitting in the first engine, using radio frequency. Hence, the second engine was remotely managed by the pilot of the first engine. This has been done for the first time for an 84-wagon train by Northern Railways, Sudhir Kumar Singh, senior divisional operations manager, told The Indian Express.Northern Railways has Ferozepur, Ambala, Delhi, Moradabad and Lucknow divisions under it, of which food grain supplies are in majority done by Ferozepur, Ambala and Delhi divisions only. Hence this particular single pilot operated the double goods train operated for the first time by the Ferozepur division, said Sudhir Kumar Singh.A 42-wagon was to go from Ajitwal (Moga) to Haibergaanv, Assam, while another was to go from Phillaur, Jalandhar, to Bindupuri, Assam. Hence both were loaded and brought to Ludhiana railway station, where they were joined and sent to Assam, said Manish Narwal, senior divisional electric engineer of Ferozepur railways division.The maximum distance covered by any Annapurna train was 1,671 km, carrying enough food grain to feed 80 crore public distribution beneficiaries. These trains carried food grains from Punjab and Haryana.Punjabs record dispatchAnandita Mitra, director, Food and Civil Supplies, Punjab told The Indian Express, From March 24-26 we have done a record dispatch of 22,22,500 MT from Punjab via freight trains.

2020-04-29,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yogi-adityanath-government-misleading-people-on-covid-19-numbers-says-up-congress-chief/article31463031.ece,"Coronavirus | Yogi Adityanath government misleading people on COVID-19 numbers, says U.P. Congress chief","Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu, an MLA from Tamkuhi Raj in Kushinagar, Purvanchal, accuses the BJP government of hiding the real figures of COVID-19. The Yogi Adityanath government is misleading people through illusion of numbers, he says.You have criticised the Agra model of containment, which is being much publicised by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. What is lacking in the Agra model, according to you?The model they have unceasingly presented before the country, its reality has been exposed. So far, 401 COVID-19 infected patients (till Tuesday evening) have been found in Agra. And the way in which the people have been kept in quarantine centres  the video of one such incident was viral  has shamed humanity and whole of U.P. Other than Agra, we find a large number of positive cases in Firozabad and Kanpur as well. There seems to be a big lack in the way treatment is being provided. Testing is not being done at a large scale. The result is that today U.P. is fully engulfed by the infection. The Chief Minister is only misleading the people and not working in the manner he should.The U.P. government has decided to bring back its migrants stranded in the other States. They have already brought back people from Haryana. Do you feel this could have been done earlier or is the timing apt?The workers the government has decided to bring back are only those who were kept in the quarantine centres. I have received a large number of calls from our working-class brothers from Telangana and Himachal Pradesh, who are from my constituency. Twentyeight days have passed but till date the government has not made any preparation to being them back. Apart from those already in quarantine, workers in large numbers are stranded in Gujarat, Telangana, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. The government should come up with a policy for them. The workers are desperate and weeping, their videos are going viral, their families are low on morale and are daily pleading to the CM. We have written many letters, even Priyanka Gandhiji has written many letters but the government is still not giving us a clear answer on bringing such workers back.But is U.P. prepared to handle a large number of migrants? Does it have the facilities and enough quarantine centres?The workers stranded in other States obviously must be staying inside their homes as part of the lockdown. While planning how to bring them back, then of course they should be properly examined and you can come up with temporary quarantine centres at various places, on the sides of highways or use schools, colleges and other institutions. Since this is not the winter season, they can also come up with tents at various places to arrange for their stay. And those who are found positive should be treated while others should be dropped home.The U.P. government has been declaring some districts as corona free, that they dont have any remaining active cases, but then a few days later, fresh positive cases were reported in these districts like Prayagraj, Bareilly, Pratapgarh and Pilibhit.The Centre has issued some figures about U.P. Of the 75 districts, 53 have less than 100 isolation beds. Thirtyone such districts have positive cases and 34 districts dont have ICU facility. Nineteen of 34 districts have positive cases. The State government had declared 11 districts as corona mukt including Prayagraj, Bareilly, Pilibhit and Pratapgarh. All four have now reported fresh cases. What was the preparation? What was the parameter? It has not set any parameter or made facilities for screening. Not arranged for random testing.Also read: Data | 96% migrant workers did not get rations from the government, 90% did not receive wages during lockdown: surveyI feel this BJP government is continuously misleading the people. On average only 400-450 tests are being done daily. They are claiming it is 3,000 but not more than 450 tests are being done. And if you look closely, only those in quarantine centres and some special types of people in the hospots are being tested. They can express a strong desire to combat this disease if they conduct screenings and random testing at a large scale.You are saying that the government is hiding the real figures?Of course. This is the illusion of numbers. They are trying to entangle people of U.P. in numbers.The actual number of people infected could be much higher, as per you?Yes, of course. I cannot indicate any figure without the full examination. But still somewhere, this illness has spread in a big way. If we test people, the reality will come before us. I feel many districts, which the government claims has no cases at all, if there is random testing conducted, cases will come up in large numbers. The speed of testing is slow and is only at some marked places.Many migrants who arrived in U.P. from other States have been escaping from quarantine centres. FIRs have also been lodged against them. Is this due to some miscommunication, lack of awareness or are they not being provided basic facilities or assurances?Quarantine centres are in a bad shape. If NGOs and locals dont chip in the government had claimed it would allot funds for such centres in all tehsils and districts. And I can say with full confidence that it is the various NGOs and local leaders who are providing food to people in quarantine centres. In Fatehpur, Congress people are supplying food. The government is not working the way it should. This is the apathy of the government. Even if those under quarantine want to stay, they cant. There are no facilities, no power or fan or arrangement to stay. I watched a video from Bhadohi where a dog was seen loitering around the place where food was being prepared for such people. The food was unhygienic. People are being compelled to leave the quarantine centres.The lockdown will go on till May 3. This has caused a lot of economic hardship and strained the rural economy in a State like UP. Do you feel the lockdown should be extended beyond this?As of now, the government has no arrangement. The government has fully failed in terms of preparation. Apart form lockdown, increased testing and treatment of those infected, there is no other solution to this illness. The way rural economy has been shattered...small industries, small traders, street hawkers, vendors and such people are badly affected. The shopkeepers have not received any rebate in three months. They announced they would provide labourers with three months of ration. But they only gave rice free. Only those under Antyodaya got them free of cost. The rest had to pay 3 per kg for rice and 2 per kg for wheat. The government has only made a large number of announcements but not done anything to implement it on the ground.If the lockdown is further extended, how should we look at it? A step needed to control COVID-19 or a further setback to the economy?It doesnt appear from the intentions and policies of this government that the economy will improve. Apart from the lockdown they dont have any alternative. I feel that till they dont test on a large scale, there is no alternative. Till random testing is done, a proper strategy is formed.... The government is yet to come up with a plan on how to re-open shops. It is the result of the States lack of preparedness that many policemen, health workers, doctors, nurses and journalists have tested positive. The government promised but has not given a single penny to the kin of the safai karmacharis who died.","uttar pradesh congress president ajay kumar lallu, an mla from tamkuhi raj in kushinagar, purvanchal, accuses the bjp government of hiding the real figures of covid-19. the yogi adityanath government is misleading people through illusion of numbers, he says.you have criticised the agra model of containment, which is being much publicised by the bjp government in uttar pradesh. what is lacking in the agra model, according to you?the model they have unceasingly presented before the country, its reality has been exposed. so far, 401 covid-19 infected patients (till tuesday evening) have been found in agra. and the way in which the people have been kept in quarantine centres  the video of one such incident was viral  has shamed humanity and whole of u.p. other than agra, we find a large number of positive cases in firozabad and kanpur as well. there seems to be a big lack in the way treatment is being provided. testing is not being done at a large scale. the result is that today u.p. is fully engulfed by the infection. the chief minister is only misleading the people and not working in the manner he should.the u.p. government has decided to bring back its migrants stranded in the other states. they have already brought back people from haryana. do you feel this could have been done earlier or is the timing apt?the workers the government has decided to bring back are only those who were kept in the quarantine centres. i have received a large number of calls from our working-class brothers from telangana and himachal pradesh, who are from my constituency. twentyeight days have passed but till date the government has not made any preparation to being them back. apart from those already in quarantine, workers in large numbers are stranded in gujarat, telangana, maharashtra, punjab, gujarat and andhra pradesh. the government should come up with a policy for them. the workers are desperate and weeping, their videos are going viral, their families are low on morale and are daily pleading to the cm. we have written many letters, even priyanka gandhiji has written many letters but the government is still not giving us a clear answer on bringing such workers back.but is u.p. prepared to handle a large number of migrants? does it have the facilities and enough quarantine centres?the workers stranded in other states obviously must be staying inside their homes as part of the lockdown. while planning how to bring them back, then of course they should be properly examined and you can come up with temporary quarantine centres at various places, on the sides of highways or use schools, colleges and other institutions. since this is not the winter season, they can also come up with tents at various places to arrange for their stay. and those who are found positive should be treated while others should be dropped home.the u.p. government has been declaring some districts as corona free, that they dont have any remaining active cases, but then a few days later, fresh positive cases were reported in these districts like prayagraj, bareilly, pratapgarh and pilibhit.the centre has issued some figures about u.p. of the 75 districts, 53 have less than 100 isolation beds. thirtyone such districts have positive cases and 34 districts dont have icu facility. nineteen of 34 districts have positive cases. the state government had declared 11 districts as corona mukt including prayagraj, bareilly, pilibhit and pratapgarh. all four have now reported fresh cases. what was the preparation? what was the parameter? it has not set any parameter or made facilities for screening. not arranged for random testing.also read: data | 96% migrant workers did not get rations from the government, 90% did not receive wages during lockdown: surveyi feel this bjp government is continuously misleading the people. on average only 400-450 tests are being done daily. they are claiming it is 3,000 but not more than 450 tests are being done. and if you look closely, only those in quarantine centres and some special types of people in the hospots are being tested. they can express a strong desire to combat this disease if they conduct screenings and random testing at a large scale.you are saying that the government is hiding the real figures?of course. this is the illusion of numbers. they are trying to entangle people of u.p. in numbers.the actual number of people infected could be much higher, as per you?yes, of course. i cannot indicate any figure without the full examination. but still somewhere, this illness has spread in a big way. if we test people, the reality will come before us. i feel many districts, which the government claims has no cases at all, if there is random testing conducted, cases will come up in large numbers. the speed of testing is slow and is only at some marked places.many migrants who arrived in u.p. from other states have been escaping from quarantine centres. firs have also been lodged against them. is this due to some miscommunication, lack of awareness or are they not being provided basic facilities or assurances?quarantine centres are in a bad shape. if ngos and locals dont chip in the government had claimed it would allot funds for such centres in all tehsils and districts. and i can say with full confidence that it is the various ngos and local leaders who are providing food to people in quarantine centres. in fatehpur, congress people are supplying food. the government is not working the way it should. this is the apathy of the government. even if those under quarantine want to stay, they cant. there are no facilities, no power or fan or arrangement to stay. i watched a video from bhadohi where a dog was seen loitering around the place where food was being prepared for such people. the food was unhygienic. people are being compelled to leave the quarantine centres.the lockdown will go on till may 3. this has caused a lot of economic hardship and strained the rural economy in a state like up. do you feel the lockdown should be extended beyond this?as of now, the government has no arrangement. the government has fully failed in terms of preparation. apart form lockdown, increased testing and treatment of those infected, there is no other solution to this illness. the way rural economy has been shattered...small industries, small traders, street hawkers, vendors and such people are badly affected. the shopkeepers have not received any rebate in three months. they announced they would provide labourers with three months of ration. but they only gave rice free. only those under antyodaya got them free of cost. the rest had to pay 3 per kg for rice and 2 per kg for wheat. the government has only made a large number of announcements but not done anything to implement it on the ground.if the lockdown is further extended, how should we look at it? a step needed to control covid-19 or a further setback to the economy?it doesnt appear from the intentions and policies of this government that the economy will improve. apart from the lockdown they dont have any alternative. i feel that till they dont test on a large scale, there is no alternative. till random testing is done, a proper strategy is formed.... the government is yet to come up with a plan on how to re-open shops. it is the result of the states lack of preparedness that many policemen, health workers, doctors, nurses and journalists have tested positive. the government promised but has not given a single penny to the kin of the safai karmacharis who died."

2020-04-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/covid-19-punjab-haryana-farmers-paddy-cotton-6385600/,"The Covid nudge: Labour shortage makes Punjab, Haryana farmers switch from paddy to cotton","Sowing cotton in a field in Sirsa, Haryana. (Express photo) Sowing cotton in a field in Sirsa, Haryana. (Express photo)COVID-19 has opened a window of opportunity to wean away farmers in Punjab and Haryana from growing rice to less water-guzzling crops such as cotton and maize.The driver: Uncertainty over the availability of an estimated 1 million labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who undertake the bulk of the paddy transplanting that begins from mid-June. That, plus the lack of mechanical transplanting options, in contrast to the ubiquitous combines used for both paddy and wheat harvesting, means fewer farmers are likely to take up rice cultivation in the coming kharif season.Manjit Singh Sidhu has, for over a decade, been farming paddy on his 13 acres at Uddat Bhagat Ram village in Punjabs Mansa district. But this time he has decided to sow cotton on 11 acres, limit paddy to 2 acres, that too, subject to getting enough local labour. I finished harvesting wheat on April 20, and I am waiting for water from the Kotla Branch of the Sirhind Canal (on the Sutlej River). They (government) normally release it around April 30, which will enable me to plant cotton, says the 43-year-old.Shamsher Singh, from the same village, also plans to only grow cotton on his 8-acre holding, which was entirely under paddy until the 2019 kharif season. Jagsir Singh from Jhumba village of Bathinda district is going for cotton on four of his nine acres, again previously fully planted to paddy.The people who transplant paddy are from Bihar and UP. Nobody knows if they will come. Even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3, train services are unlikely to resume soon and I cannot take a risk. While local labourers can be used, they will demand Rs 4,500-5,000 per acre, whereas the migrant workers charge only Rs 2,500, he points out.Southwest Punjab  mainly the districts of Mansa, Bathinda, Muktsar and Fazilka  was traditionally a cotton belt. Many farmers in recent times, however, switched to paddy, thanks to assured minimum support price-based procurement and free power supply for groundwater irrigation during the cropping season.This was further supported by the availability of migrant labour for transplanting paddy seedlings, which are first raised in nursery beds for 25-30 days before being uprooted and replanted in the main field.It is a very labour-intensive operation. The plant population in paddy is about 33 per square metre, or 133,550 per acre. This is more than thrice the 40,000-odd plants per acre for cotton. Also, since paddy transplanting is in puddled (muddy standing water) conditions, there is both drudgery and difficultly in movement. A single labourer typically does around 10 acres from mid-June to mid-July, explains A K Singh, director of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi.The roughly 43 lakh hectares (106 lakh acres) under paddy in Punjab and Haryana, translates into a requirement of 1 million-1.1 million labourers, an estimated 90 per cent-plus of them being seasonal migrants from UP and Bihar. With a question mark over their availability  they normally come by train in early June  transplanting could well be impacted.While mechanical transplanting is possible in theory, it needs raising the seedlings in special mat nurseries or trays. Farmers have gone in for mechanisation only in harvesting, where the combines are also manufactured indigenously and adapted to our conditions. The machines used in transplanting are largely imported and farmers havent felt the need for them when they could rely on migrant labourers. Necessity is the mother of invention, adds Singh.But labour shortage might this time prompt farmers to plant more area under cotton or maize. Crop diversification  weaning farmers away from paddy, with all its associated problems of groundwater depletion and pollution due to burning of the leftover stubble from harvesting by combines  is a strategy the Punjab and Haryana governments have for long tried to implement in vain.It stands a chance now, at least in the old cotton belts of southwest Punjab and east Haryana (Sirsa, Fatehabad, Jind, Hisar and Bhiwani). In cotton, planting can be done by farmers themselves, employing family labour.We have set a target of 5.50 lakh hectares (lh) under cotton this kharif, against last years 3.92 lh. For maize, it is 3 lh, up from 1.6 lh. The overall paddy area should fall from 29.2 lh to 26.2. Within that, basmati acreage is to rise from 6.29 lh to 7 lh, while dropping from 22.91 lh to 19.21 lh for non-basmati varieties, Sutantar Kumar Airy, director of Punjabs agriculture department, told The Indian Express.Basmati paddy consumes less water (it can be transplanted after June-end by when the monsoon sets in fully), is mostly manually harvested (entailing no burning of standing stubble) and is a source of foreign exchange ($ 4.71 billion exports in 2018-19). IARIs Singh feels there is a strong case for arranging special trains to transport migrant labour for transplanting basmati over 18-19 lh: 7-8 lh in Haryana, 6-6.5 lh in Punjab, and 4-4.5 lh in West UP.At Sukhchain village of Sirsa districts Baragudha tehsil, Prithpal Singh Gill has already completed sowing cotton on 8 out of his 10 acres.

(express photo) sowing cotton in a field in sirsa, haryana. (express photo)covid-19 has opened a window of opportunity to wean away farmers in punjab and haryana from growing rice to less water-guzzling crops such as cotton and maize.the driver: uncertainty over the availability of an estimated 1 million labourers from uttar pradesh and bihar who undertake the bulk of the paddy transplanting that begins from mid-june. that, plus the lack of mechanical transplanting options, in contrast to the ubiquitous combines used for both paddy and wheat harvesting, means fewer farmers are likely to take up rice cultivation in the coming kharif season.manjit singh sidhu has, for over a decade, been farming paddy on his 13 acres at uddat bhagat ram village in punjabs mansa district. but this time he has decided to sow cotton on 11 acres, limit paddy to 2 acres, that too, subject to getting enough local labour. i finished harvesting wheat on april 20, and i am waiting for water from the kotla branch of the sirhind canal (on the sutlej river). they (government) normally release it around april 30, which will enable me to plant cotton, says the 43-year-old.shamsher singh, from the same village, also plans to only grow cotton on his 8-acre holding, which was entirely under paddy until the 2019 kharif season. jagsir singh from jhumba village of bathinda district is going for cotton on four of his nine acres, again previously fully planted to paddy.the people who transplant paddy are from bihar and up. nobody knows if they will come. even if the lockdown is lifted on may 3, train services are unlikely to resume soon and i cannot take a risk. while local labourers can be used, they will demand rs 4,500-5,000 per acre, whereas the migrant workers charge only rs 2,500, he points out.southwest punjab  mainly the districts of mansa, bathinda, muktsar and fazilka  was traditionally a cotton belt. many farmers in recent times, however, switched to paddy, thanks to assured minimum support price-based procurement and free power supply for groundwater irrigation during the cropping season.this was further supported by the availability of migrant labour for transplanting paddy seedlings, which are first raised in nursery beds for 25-30 days before being uprooted and replanted in the main field.it is a very labour-intensive operation. the plant population in paddy is about 33 per square metre, or 133,550 per acre. this is more than thrice the 40,000-odd plants per acre for cotton. also, since paddy transplanting is in puddled (muddy standing water) conditions, there is both drudgery and difficultly in movement. a single labourer typically does around 10 acres from mid-june to mid-july, explains a k singh, director of the indian agricultural research institute (iari) in new delhi.the roughly 43 lakh hectares (106 lakh acres) under paddy in punjab and haryana, translates into a requirement of 1 million-1.1 million labourers, an estimated 90 per cent-plus of them being seasonal migrants from up and bihar. with a question mark over their availability  they normally come by train in early june  transplanting could well be impacted.while mechanical transplanting is possible in theory, it needs raising the seedlings in special mat nurseries or trays. farmers have gone in for mechanisation only in harvesting, where the combines are also manufactured indigenously and adapted to our conditions. the machines used in transplanting are largely imported and farmers havent felt the need for them when they could rely on migrant labourers. necessity is the mother of invention, adds singh.but labour shortage might this time prompt farmers to plant more area under cotton or maize. crop diversification  weaning farmers away from paddy, with all its associated problems of groundwater depletion and pollution due to burning of the leftover stubble from harvesting by combines  is a strategy the punjab and haryana governments have for long tried to implement in vain.it stands a chance now, at least in the old cotton belts of southwest punjab and east haryana (sirsa, fatehabad, jind, hisar and bhiwani). in cotton, planting can be done by farmers themselves, employing family labour.we have set a target of 5.50 lakh hectares (lh) under cotton this kharif, against last years 3.92 lh. for maize, it is 3 lh, up from 1.6 lh. the overall paddy area should fall from 29.2 lh to 26.2. within that, basmati acreage is to rise from 6.29 lh to 7 lh, while dropping from 22.91 lh to 19.21 lh for non-basmati varieties, sutantar kumar airy, director of punjabs agriculture department, told the indian express.basmati paddy consumes less water (it can be transplanted after june-end by when the monsoon sets in fully), is mostly manually harvested (entailing no burning of standing stubble) and is a

Even state governments can take foodgrains under the OMSS to meet the food demand of the poor, he said.A nationwide lockdown has been in place since March 24 to contain the spread of COVID-19 disease.Stating that the government has enough food supplies in its godowns to meet the demand of the poor, Paswan said the state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) was having total 605.7 lakh tonne of foodgrains as on May 1, which include 275.7 lakh tonne of rice and 330 lakh tonne of wheat.The monthly foodgrains requirement for PDS distribution under the NFSA and other welfare schemes is about 60 lakh tonne, he said.Paswan said that the FCI has transported about 192 lakh tonne of foodgrains since lockdown imposed on March 24. Out of which, 126.12 lakh tonne was transported via road and sea route, the rest 65.4 lakh tonne via rail in 2334 rakes. About 5.63 lakh tonne was transported to the north eastern region in this period.On free distribution of foodgrains and pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Anna Yojana (PMGAY), Paswan said the requirement of foodgrains under this scheme is about 104.4 lakh tonne of rice and 15.6 lakh tonne of wheat.Out of which, 56.7 lakh tonne of rice and 7.7 lakh tonne of wheat have been lifted by different states and union territories so far.Six states such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Delhi and Gujarat have distributed wheat, while other states have distributed rice under the PMGAY, he said.

(Representational) Though the lockdown has delivered a blow to the livelihood of all those employed in the informal economy, female domestic workers have always been an exploited and vulnerable workforce leading a financially unstable life. (Representational)For Shridevi, 35, who worked as a domestic help at three houses until the imposition of the lockdown, the most distressing part of her day is hearing her three children groan in hunger till 2 pm, when she and her family stand in line under the merciless afternoon sun for half kg cooked dal-chawal. As soon as we finish that meal, my children are hungry again because it is not nearly enough to curb their hunger. So we wait until late evening, when we get the same cooked rice and chana dal in the form of khichdi, says Shridevi, who lives in a single room with her family of five in the Sector 52 Rehabilitation colony, close to where a COVID-19 case was reported a few days ago.Though the lockdown has delivered a blow to the livelihood of all those employed in the informal economy, female domestic workers have always been an exploited and vulnerable workforce leading a financially unstable life. They are an extremely marginalised and invisible workforce, both due to the nature of their work and their gender. There are so many of them, each ready to work for incredibly low pay, hence they have always been disposable and exploited, says Dr Seepana Prakasam, an economics professor from DAV college, who authored a book titled Domestic Women Workers in India: With Special Reference to Chandigarh in 2012.During the lockdown, the lack of social security and benefits such as paid leave will take a severe toll on these workers, since they are left at the mercy of their employers for money, adds Dr Prakasam. Indeed, since most of these workers have lost their jobs due to the lockdown, with employers hesitant to let them into their house, they have been without pay since the past month. Many of us were paid for March, but our memsahabs arent sympathetic enough to pay us for April. My employer called in once and asked if we were ok, but didnt offer any help financial help, says Kiran, another domestic worker and resident of Sector 52, who used to earn Rs 5,000 a month cooking for a household.Domestic workers say that their employers have refused to provide payment for April and give no guarantee that they will be rehired post the lockdown. I dont know if I will be hired back and receive payment after this ends. My employer said she will call me in June. There is no certainty, says Shridevi, whose husband, a daily wage labourer, is also bereft of employment since mid-March. Her three school going children, are hungry and listless, spending crucial developmental years without proper education. Their school is sending some coursework via phone, but the screen is so small, they are unable to learn anything, adds Shridevi.Residents laying off domestic workersA Panchkula resident explains that even if the lockdown ends soon, she will hesitate to immediately hire back domestic help. I paid her for the month of April, but since I dont know when I will need her back again, I wont pay her for May. I have decided to let her go because we have learnt to manage household chores ourselves and I am worried of the infection she might bring to the house, since these people live in such unsanitary spaces, she says.According to a sociologist from a Panjab University college, who has done extensive work in class and caste relations in India, the spread of COVID-19 will further propagate anxieties around sanitation and hygiene standards among the working-class population, stealing employment opportunities from them even after the lockdown ends. Caste and class are inextricably intertwined and the myth of the working class being unhygienic is tied to age old caste discrimination, where Dalits were believed to be unhygienic and unsanitary. COVID-19 will propagate that myth even further, as working-class employees are seen as super spreaders, their colonies seen as cesspools of infection, says the sociologist, who wishes to remain anonymous.Dr Prakasams statistical research affirms the relation between caste and class amidst the population of domestic workers in Chandigarh. Out of the total population of female domestic workers, almost seventy per cent belong to scheduled castes in Chandigarh. They belong to sub castes such as Valmikis and Chamars, and most of them are migrants from Uttar Pradesh, says Dr Prakasam.Workers without ration cardOn top of the hardships faced by these female domestic workers due to a loss of livelihood, many of them do not even have ration cards, which would have enabled them to avail the benefit of receiving five kg grain under the National Food Security Act. According to data collected by Dr Prakasam in 2013, about 50 per cent of these women did not possess ration cards, since it required residency proofs and documentation which are often hard to figure out by the mostly illiterate population.

2020-05-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lockdown-bengal-paddy-late-harvest-labour-wages-up-6405549/,"In Bengal paddy bowl, yield of late harvesting: wages up","Lockdown, lack of cheap migrant labour mean harvest has spilled over from April. (Express Photo: Partha Paul) Lockdown, lack of cheap migrant labour mean harvest has spilled over from April. (Express Photo: Partha Paul)Yadav Ghorui has rarely been this busy during harvest season. He is one of eight farm labourers called in to work on a one-bigha field in his Ajapur village in Burdwan, about 100 km from Kolkata.Last year, I got Rs 200 and 2 kg of rice every day that I worked; this year I am getting Rs 350 and 2 kg rice. Our group of eight is booked for the entire month. Work began a week ago and we have to harvest, bundle the paddy and dehusk the grains in two days. We work at night too, said Ghorui, who lives with his wife and two children.The rabi crop, known as Boro Dhan in Bengal, is sown in November and usually harvested by April. But this year, the lockdown has delayed the harvest by over a month, and now, farmers are racing against time to finish before the rains at the end of June.The lockdown has also meant farm owners havent been able to bring in cheaper migrant workers from states such as Bihar and Jharkhand, or from Birbhum, Bankura and Purulia districts in the state. While the state government has allowed combine harvesting machines to move, most of the operators of these machines are from Punjab and Haryana. So, cultivators and owners have had to depend on local hands, thus pushing up demand and daily wages.Ghoruis co-worker, Sandhya Malik, her face and head covered with a cloth, said, Within a couple of weeks of the lockdown, we had exhausted all cash. But all that has changed. Now I can buy anything for the family  biscuits, milk and vegetables. God has been kind.Pradip Majumder, the advisor on agriculture to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said harvesting of paddy was happening on a war footing, with social distancing norms in place.Out of over 3,000 harvester machines in the state, around 800 have chain wheels (which work better in fields rendered wet after the rains). They are on their way to the fields, said Majumder.The sporadic rains since last week have added to the farmers worries. If there is more water, the paddy will germinate in the field and will be useless. If the grains have moisture content less than 12%, they can be stored. But anything more than 15% will mean pest infestation. And if the moisture content is over 20%, the rice will have to be discarded, said Jagannath Chatterjee, Deputy Director, Agriculture, Purba Burdwan.This year, paddy has been cultivated on 1.7 lakh hectares in the district, up from 1.2 lakh hectares last year.About 60 km from Ajapur, in Dharampur village, Sheikh Ashraf, 35, who owns 16 bighas, has only been able to harvest nine using machines, and is unsure if he can finish before the rains. His input costs have also gone up, he adds, listing how harvester machines are charging Rs 2,500 to 3,000 per hour, those with chain wheels around Rs 4,000 an hour, and the rise in wages from Rs 220 to Rs 360.On the road behind him, labourers use their feet to spread paddy grains on the tarmac. Since theres hardly any traffic, we leave the grain here to dry, said Ashraf.About 50 feet away, Kalyan Mondol stood by the harvester machine he owns, along with his driver Abesh Malas. They are here from neighbouring Bankura district; a month ago, they were in Murshidabad.I usually get the drivers from Punjab or Haryana. Now our boys here have learnt to operate the machine. I pay Abesh about Rs 900 a day. I have two drivers here, they take turns to operate the machine. I keep getting calls from farmers asking for the harvester, said Mondol, adding that his machine can lift paddy from 2.5 to 3 bighas of land in one hour.In neighbouring Eroar village, Mangobindo Adhikari, panchayat member and local Trinamool leader, said more is needed to generate employment. There was some talk of including harvesting under the MNREGS, but it has not been done yet, he said.In Golsi village, Sheikh Ajijur Rehman, 50, is waiting for the harvester to reach his 30-bigha land. On fields nearby, chain-wheel harvester machines can be seen cutting, de-husking and then emptying the grains into mini-vans along the road.Two days ago, I tried to get 12 labourers from Jharkhand, but police stopped them at the border near Dubrajpur (Birbhum district). The government is allowing labourers from other districts, but arranging transport for them is expensive, said Ajijur.He said he was 15th in the queue for a harvester. It will be around midnight when my turn comes, he said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(express photo: partha paul)yadav ghorui has rarely been this busy during harvest season. he is one of eight farm labourers called in to work on a one-bigha field in his ajapur village in burdwan, about 100 km from kolkata.last year, i got rs 200 and 2 kg of rice every day that i worked; this year i am getting rs 350 and 2 kg rice. our group of eight is booked for the entire month. work began a week ago and we have to harvest, bundle the paddy and dehusk the grains in two days. we work at night too, said ghorui, who lives with his wife and two children.the rabi crop, known as boro dhan in bengal, is sown in november and usually harvested by april. but this year, the lockdown has delayed the harvest by over a month, and now, farmers are racing against time to finish before the rains at the end of june.the lockdown has also meant farm owners havent been able to bring in cheaper migrant workers from states such as bihar and jharkhand, or from birbhum, bankura and purulia districts in the state. while the state government has allowed combine harvesting machines to move, most of the operators of these machines are from punjab and haryana. so, cultivators and owners have had to depend on local hands, thus pushing up demand and daily wages.ghoruis co-worker, sandhya malik, her face and head covered with a cloth, said, within a couple of weeks of the lockdown, we had exhausted all cash. but all that has changed. now i can buy anything for the family  biscuits, milk and vegetables. god has been kind.pradip majumder, the advisor on agriculture to chief minister mamata banerjee, said harvesting of paddy was happening on a war footing, with social distancing norms in place.out of over 3,000 harvester machines in the state, around 800 have chain wheels (which work better in fields rendered wet after the rains). they are on their way to the fields, said majumder.the sporadic rains since last week have added to the farmers worries. if there is more water, the paddy will germinate in the field and will be useless. if the grains have moisture content less than 12%, they can be stored. but anything more than 15% will mean pest infestation. and if the moisture content is over 20%, the rice will have to be discarded, said jagannath chatterjee, deputy director, agriculture, purba burdwan.this year, paddy has been cultivated on 1.7 lakh hectares in the district, up from 1.2 lakh hectares last year.about 60 km from ajapur, in dharampur village, sheikh ashraf, 35, who owns 16 bighas, has only been able to harvest nine using machines, and is unsure if he can finish before the rains. his input costs have also gone up, he adds, listing how harvester machines are charging rs 2,500 to 3,000 per hour, those with chain wheels around rs 4,000 an hour, and the rise in wages from rs 220 to rs 360.on the road behind him, labourers use their feet to spread paddy grains on the tarmac. since theres hardly any traffic, we leave the grain here to dry, said ashraf.about 50 feet away, kalyan mondol stood by the harvester machine he owns, along with his driver abesh malas. they are here from neighbouring bankura district; a month ago, they were in murshidabad.i usually get the drivers from punjab or haryana. now our boys here have learnt to operate the machine. i pay abesh about rs 900 a day. i have two drivers here, they take turns to operate the machine. i keep getting calls from farmers asking for the harvester, said mondol, adding that his machine can lift paddy from 2.5 to 3 bighas of land in one hour.in neighbouring eroar village, mangobindo adhikari, panchayat member and local trinamool leader, said more is needed to generate employment. there was some talk of including harvesting under the mnregs, but it has not been done yet, he said.in golsi village, sheikh ajijur rehman, 50, is waiting for the harvester to reach his 30-bigha land. on fields nearby, chain-wheel harvester machines can be seen cutting, de-husking and then emptying the grains into mini-vans along the road.two days ago, i tried to get 12 labourers from jharkhand, but police stopped them at the border near dubrajpur (birbhum district). the government is allowing labourers from other districts, but arranging transport for them is expensive, said ajijur.he said he was 15th in the queue for a harvester. it will be around midnight when my turn comes, he said. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest india news, download indian express app. the indian express (p) ltd"

We have asked farmers to increase area under cultivation and would purchase the entire basmati crop at a good remunerative price, says Ashok Sethi, president, Punjab Rice Exporters Association.He added countries around the world were securing buffer stocks, leading to the orders. He added exports of basmati from the country were expected to touch Rs 40,000 crore this year, an increase of 15% over Rs 35,000 crore last year. Punjab is expected to contribute around 40% of the exports, at around Rs 15,000 crore.Sethi added the association has asked basmati growers to grow 1718, 1509 and 1121 varieties as these were in huge demand, both in national and international markets.Sethi added that the market was buoyant despite the fact that Iran was not importing (its share in Indias total export was around 33% till two years ago) due to trade sanctions. Despite the fact that there is no change is the sanctions scenario there is buoyancy in basmati export from India, said Sethi.The export market has also come alive as rice exporters and state agriculture department learnt from the challenge the industry faced three years ago, when European countries rejected basmati consignments on traces of insecticides.The impact of the state-wide campaign we ran then has shown results, as farmers have saved Rs 400 crore by cutting down on usage of pesticides, said Punjab agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu, adding that his department was in touch with basmati farmers and the state was committed to growing the aromatic variety over 17-18 lack acre. The total crop output is expected at 30 lakh tonne, and with the yield at 18 quintal per acre, a farmer can earn more the traditional paddy.Basmati is grown over large tracts in Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Muktsar, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala districts. Last year, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of basmati was Rs 1,840 per quintal, which is expected to cross Rs 1,900 in the current season, though Punjab government has demanded Rs 2,900 from the Centre.","chandigarhupdated: may 17, 2020 23:52 istbasmati exporters have asked the growers of this aromatic variety in the state to increase area under cultivation, saying that they have orders in hand, despite the covid-19 pandemic affecting most other sectors of the economy.we are flush with orders from west asia, arabian countries, europe, canada and the us. we have asked farmers to increase area under cultivation and would purchase the entire basmati crop at a good remunerative price, says ashok sethi, president, punjab rice exporters association.he added countries around the world were securing buffer stocks, leading to the orders. he added exports of basmati from the country were expected to touch rs 40,000 crore this year, an increase of 15% over rs 35,000 crore last year. punjab is expected to contribute around 40% of the exports, at around rs 15,000 crore.sethi added the association has asked basmati growers to grow 1718, 1509 and 1121 varieties as these were in huge demand, both in national and international markets.sethi added that the market was buoyant despite the fact that iran was not importing (its share in indias total export was around 33% till two years ago) due to trade sanctions. despite the fact that there is no change is the sanctions scenario there is buoyancy in basmati export from india, said sethi.the export market has also come alive as rice exporters and state agriculture department learnt from the challenge the industry faced three years ago, when european countries rejected basmati consignments on traces of insecticides.the impact of the state-wide campaign we ran then has shown results, as farmers have saved rs 400 crore by cutting down on usage of pesticides, said punjab agriculture secretary kahan singh pannu, adding that his department was in touch with basmati farmers and the state was committed to growing the aromatic variety over 17-18 lack acre. the total crop output is expected at 30 lakh tonne, and with the yield at 18 quintal per acre, a farmer can earn more the traditional paddy.basmati is grown over large tracts in tarn taran, amritsar, gurdaspur, ferozepur, fazilka, muktsar, hoshiarpur and kapurthala districts. last year, the minimum support price (msp) of basmati was rs 1,840 per quintal, which is expected to cross rs 1,900 in the current season, though punjab government has demanded rs 2,900 from the centre."

Read MoreInitial effortsChallengesGURUGRAM: Having hit several hurdles in the past 25 days, Haryana has been able to procure around 65% of the wheat from mandis but facilitated only 29% of payments to middlemen and farmers . This is in sharp contrast to the situation in Punjab , where wheat procurement is almost double that of Haryana despite the hurdles being similar.Both Haryana and Punjab had been battling the same set of challenges in the procurement process  shortage of workers , restrictions on transportation and limited entry of farmers to mandis. Though the plan of response was similar, too, Punjab managed to iron out differences much faster than its neighbour.The difference in approach lay in the coordination with middlemen, management of workers and the resultant support from agents, said farmers unions. Its (Haryanas) a clear case of mismanagement and lack of planning. Tussle with commission agents, lifting issues, shortage of labourers and non-payment, among others, have been major failures this season. Also, many of the mandis are not functional, said Rajiv Godra of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Despite a staggered start amid challenges brought in by the lockdown, Punjab was relatively quicker in addressing its issues. With social distancing and other safety protocols in place, Punjab increased the number of procurement centres  around 280 for mustard and close to 1,800 for wheat. This made it easier for farmers to visit the mandis and the footfall, too, was divided evenly. School grounds, stadiums, rice mills and other such public places were converted into procurement centres. Helplines were activated for updates on timing and the location of procurement and token system introduced for farmers.It is only now that the Haryana government has picked up pace in its procurement process. Wheat procurement has been happening under extremely challenging circumstances. We had been preparing for this. First, the meri fasal, mera bora scheme helped us in mapping the farmers in the state. After that, the number of procurement centres was increased four times. Through helpline numbers, our officials ensured the proper arrival of farmers, quick auctioning, lifting and payment to the arhtiyas. Yes, there were some initial challenges but we overcame all of that. Today, we are in a position where 6.6 million metric tonnes of wheat has been procured, Haryana additional chief secretary (agriculture and farmers welfare and cooperation) Sanjeev Kaushal said.Despite these efforts, the procurement exercise left many a farmers and arhtiyas disgruntled in the state. Differences in the approach of the Punjab and Haryana governments were evident from the beginning itself. While Punjab began procurement from April 15, Haryana started it five days later.Only a few days into the exercise, procurement came to a halt in Haryana. From shortage of labourers to repeated strikes by arhtiyas, and from tardy lifting of produce from the mandis to the failure of the government in keeping its promise of a 72-hour payment window, procurement hit several hurdles.The process hit the first roadblock when the government sought to bring in transparency in the minimum support price. The move was strongly opposed by the commission agents, who feared losing control over the farmers. In Punjab, however, the government used the network of the arhtiyas to fix issues of shortage of labourers and ensure farmers arrived at the mandis in a systematic manner.In Haryana, wheat purchase had to be stopped for several days until the government bowed down and went for a compromise with the middlemen. The state government wanted to tweak the system of paying the middlemen first and then the farmers. It, instead, wanted to pay the farmers directly and sought to settle the dues of the middlemen later. The decision triggered a three-day strike by the middlemen and the entire procurement had to be stopped.A sudden spell of rain coupled with staggered lifting of produce from the mandis also hit farmers hard. A portion of the wheat that got drenched in the rain affected the weighing process as moisture content in the grain had increased.Those who had good connections with officials didnt suffer, but marginal farmers had to let go 3-4kg from every 50kg sack. It was mismanagement on the part of the administration, but it is the farmers who had to pay the penalty, said Dharambir Singh of All India Kisan Sabha.Lifting of crop from the mandis is managed by Hafed and Haryana Warehousing Corporation (HWC). They, in turn, have over 450 contractors to take the produce to warehouses. This time, however, the contractors have pleaded helplessness in providing timely services due to the shortage of labourers.Moreover, despite the Haryana governments promise of paying arthiyas and farmers within 72 hours of procurment, only 29% of the payments have been processed so far. The 23,000 registered arhtiyas in the state have raised a demand of Rs 12, 372 crore, but only Rs 3, 709 crore has been made so far to over 12,500 middlemen.PK Das, additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs), said, We wanted to bring transparency and give greater control to farmer over the price of their produce. Arhtiyas took it the other way round and feared disruption of their networking with farmers. We negotiated with them as transparency cannot be done away with. Also, lifting was an issue due to shortage of workers. But we have fixed that now. About 40-45 lakh tonnes of wheat had been lifted till Wednesday.Asked about the delay in payments, Das said, We have come up with hybrid system to make payments. All payments till April 25 have been cleared. Payments for the produce purchased between April 26 and May 5 is being facilitated and will be completed in couple of days.","both haryana and punajb had to battle shortage of workers, restrictions on

In 2019, farmers had cultivated only 50,000 hectares through the DSR method.Confirming the imminent shortage, a Chandigarh-based senior official in the agriculture department, on condition of anonymity, said, the state has around 4 lakh litres of Pendimethalin in stock, which is sufficient for only 1.5 lakh hectares.Experts in the agriculture department agree that as there is high growth of weeds in the DSR method of cultivation, using Pendimethalin within 24-hours of seeding was a must.INGREDIENTS NEED TO BE IMPORTEDA production head at a weedicide manufacturing company said some of the ingredients used in Pendimethalin are imported and thus production of the chemical was suffering due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Moreover, no one had anticipated that the demand for Pendimethalin would increase to this extent in the initial months of the year, he added.A Patiala-based seller, Balwinder Kapoor, who possesses a stock of the chemical, says,  Retailers are also not placing bulk orders as the product may not sell if the farmers find the method too difficult. Companies, too, are wary of producing the chemical in bulk. The uncertainty is hampering production and supply.Nowadays, companies are demanding advance payments. Earlier, they would allow a 90-day credit period.

We are seeking permission from different states to send back their citizens stranded in Delhi.However, the consent of destination states is not required for running Shramik special trains to ferry migrant workers, the ministry of railways said Tuesday, revising an earlier order that made it mandatory for both states to mutually agree to run the trains.Senior officials in the chief ministers office said the government had received online applications from around 400,000 migrant workers in the city wanting to go back home. The highest number of them belong to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.They said that so far, 59 special trains and over 200 buses had left Delhi in the past one week. The states and union territories covered include Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Assam.The government now plans to scale up the process and schedule trains on an hourly basis one after another if more trains are granted at the earliest. We are talking to more states, an official said.AAP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh criticised the BJP-ruled Central government for its deliberate reluctance to send the poor back to their homes.To send these four lakh migrants, we need 350 trains, but the BJP government is running 100 trains across the country, which shows their apathy towards solving this issue. The BJP sent luxury flights for those stuck in other countries, but they do not care for the poor people who are walking hundreds and thousands of kilometres barefoot. This shows the BJP is an anti-poor political party, Singh said.The Delhi BJP, on the other hand, said the AAP government was responsible for the exodus of migrant workers from the Capital.Leader of opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the Central government had given 8kg wheat, 2kg rice and one kg pulses free to 72 lakh people of Delhi, but the AAP government failed to distribute the ration to all of the poor people.Only 6.5 crore was spent by the Delhi government on ration distribution. Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan has already said only 1% of the ration issued by the Centre for the month of April was given by the Delhi government to the poor people. The central government has been providing free ration to 72 lakh people of Delhi for three months, he said.The BJPs allegation is completely baseless. The Delhi government had first announced increasing the ration quota of card holders in March, whereas the Centre announced its scheme in April. By then, we had already completed one round of extra and free ration distribution in the Capital.

BJP is doing politics over the migrant crisis instead of actually solving it, said a media advisor to the chief minister.","delhiupdated: may 20, 2020 03:49 istchief minister arvind kejriwal has urged the central government to provide 100 shramik special trains to the delhi government for sending back thousands of stranded migrant workers to their home states, senior officials in the chief ministers office said on tuesday.the chief ministers demand came amid the ongoing blame game on the matter between the aam aadmi party (aap) and the bharatiya janata party (bjp).deputy chief minister manish sisodia said, till now, around 65,000 migrants from delhi have been sent to their home states by trains. we are seeking permission from different states to send back their citizens stranded in delhi.however, the consent of destination states is not required for running shramik special trains to ferry migrant workers, the ministry of railways said tuesday, revising an earlier order that made it mandatory for both states to mutually agree to run the trains.senior officials in the chief ministers office said the government had received online applications from around 400,000 migrant workers in the city wanting to go back home. the highest number of them belong to bihar and uttar pradesh.they said that so far, 59 special trains and over 200 buses had left delhi in the past one week. the states and union territories covered include bihar, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, rajasthan and assam.the government now plans to scale up the process and schedule trains on an hourly basis one after another if more trains are granted at the earliest. we are talking to more states, an official said.aap spokesperson and rajya sabha mp sanjay singh criticised the bjp-ruled central government for its deliberate reluctance to send the poor back to their homes.to send these four lakh migrants, we need 350 trains, but the bjp government is running 100 trains across the country, which shows their apathy towards solving this issue. the bjp sent luxury flights for those stuck in other countries, but they do not care for the poor people who are walking hundreds and thousands of kilometres barefoot. this shows the bjp is an anti-poor political party, singh said.the delhi bjp, on the other hand, said the aap government was responsible for the exodus of migrant workers from the capital.leader of opposition in the delhi assembly ramvir singh bidhuri said the central government had given 8kg wheat, 2kg rice and one kg pulses free to 72 lakh people of delhi, but the aap government failed to distribute the ration to all of the poor people.only 6.5 crore was spent by the delhi government on ration distribution. union food minister ram vilas paswan has already said only 1% of the ration issued by the centre for the month of april was given by the delhi government to the poor people. the central government has been providing free ration to 72 lakh people of delhi for three months, he said.the bjps allegation is completely baseless. the delhi government had first announced increasing the ration quota of card holders in march, whereas the centre announced its scheme in april. by then, we had already completed one round of extra and free ration distribution in the capital. delhi government had announced its ration scheme even before the centre, or any other state for that matter. bjp is doing politics over the migrant crisis instead of actually solving it, said a media advisor to the chief minister."

Set up in 1884, IJMA is the apex business chamber for Indias jute industry.Bengal is the highest producer of jute in the country. The fresh crisis comes at a time when mills in Bengal were under pressure from other states to produce bags on an emergency basis for transportation of Boro rice and relief materials being supplied to people during lockdown.Although there is no report of any damage to machinery, structures of the mills and stored raw jute suffered damage. We are yet to calculate the extent of loss but supplies of jute products will be definitely hit. All the 60 operational jute mills in the state had started production (with limited manpower) during the lockdown, said Gupta.Incidentally, last week IJMA said that during the lockdown the industry suffered a nationwide loss of Rs 1250 crore.The jute Industry is grappling for survival after being in lockdown for over one and a half months now. Already 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of production of jute goods has been lost estimated to be valued at Rs.1,250 crore. With the cash flows drying up, jute mill companies are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet, IJMA said in a statement on May 19.On April 3, the Centre urged the Bengal government to direct jute mills to resume operation in view of shortage in supply of packaging materials. In a letter, the Centre said, Procurement operations of foodgrain, for which availability of packaging material like jute bales are immensely required by major procuring states like Punjab, Harayana, Uttar Pradesh and Madya Pradesh where procurement operations will begin from April and peak season is for only two-three weeks only, the letter said.On April 5, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to open jute bag manufacturing units in Bengal and ensure transportation of jute bags through special goods trains to his state. Rao told Modi that there was a severe scarcity of bags and Telangana needed 20 crore jute bags to procure paddy.The Bengal government, however, issued permission to the jute mills to resume operation with limited manpower. Initially, permission was given to deploy only 15 per cent people which was later increased to 50 per cent in phases.Gupta told HT last week that the future of over three lakhs jute mill workers and 40 lakhs jute farmers hang in balance and if the situation persists it may result in permanent sickness and closure of mills.Jute industrys loss has been plastic industrys gain. Continuous dilutions under the provisions of the Jute Packaging Act has taken place over the lockdown period. Already about 3 lakh bales of orders for jute bags have been diverted to PP/ HDPE industry. If the lockdown situation continues any longer, further dilutions cannot be ruled out, IJMA said in a recent statement.The damage done by Amphan is going to hit relief work. This is a new crisis, said a senior state food and supplies department official who did not want to be named. The departments minister Jyotipriyo Mullick could not be contacted despite repeated attempts because of failure in mobile network.According to IJMA, the carryover of raw jute at the end of the jute crop year 2019-20 is expected to be over 22 lakh bales. With reports of normal sowing this year, across all jute growing areas, the prices of jute fibre has fallen below the Minimum Support Price of Rs. 4,225 per quintal for TDN3 grade, said IJMA in a statement.","indiaupdated: may 24, 2020 18:58 istalready reeling under the ongoing lockdown, many jute mills in bengal have suffered structural and material losses during cyclone amphan that hit kolkata and surrounding districts on may 20.among the worst-hit mills are a few the states oldest ones located in south 24 parganas and howrah districts, raghavendra gupta, chairman indian jute mills association (ijma), told ht on sunday. set up in 1884, ijma is the apex business chamber for indias jute industry.bengal is the highest producer of jute in the country. the fresh crisis comes at a time when mills in bengal were under pressure from other states to produce bags on an emergency basis for transportation of boro rice and relief materials being supplied to people during lockdown.although there is no report of any damage to machinery, structures of the mills and stored raw jute suffered damage. we are yet to calculate the extent of loss but supplies of jute products will be definitely hit. all the 60 operational jute mills in the state had started production (with limited manpower) during the lockdown, said gupta.incidentally, last week ijma said that during the lockdown the industry suffered a nationwide loss of rs 1250 crore.the jute industry is grappling for survival after being in lockdown for over one and a half months now. already 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of production of jute goods has been lost estimated to be valued at rs.1,250 crore. with the cash flows drying up, jute mill companies are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet, ijma said in a statement on may 19.on april 3, the centre urged the bengal government to direct jute mills to resume operation in view of shortage in supply of packaging materials. in a letter, the centre said, procurement operations of foodgrain, for which availability of packaging material like jute bales are immensely required by major procuring states like punjab, harayana, uttar pradesh and madya pradesh where procurement operations will begin from april and peak season is for only two-three weeks only, the letter said.on april 5, telangana chief minister k chandrasekhar rao requested prime minister narendra modi to open jute bag manufacturing units in bengal and ensure transportation of jute bags through special goods trains to his state. rao told modi that there was a severe scarcity of bags and telangana needed 20 crore jute bags to procure paddy.the bengal government, however, issued permission to the jute mills to resume operation with limited manpower. initially, permission was given to deploy only 15 per cent people which was later increased to 50 per cent in phases.gupta told ht last week that the future of over three lakhs jute mill workers and 40 lakhs jute farmers hang in balance and if the situation persists it may result in permanent sickness and closure of mills.jute industrys loss has been plastic industrys gain. continuous dilutions under the provisions of the jute packaging act has taken place over the lockdown period. already about 3 lakh bales of orders for jute bags have been diverted to pp/ hdpe industry. if the lockdown situation continues any longer, further dilutions cannot be ruled out, ijma said in a recent statement.the damage done by amphan is going to hit relief work. this is a new crisis, said a senior state food and supplies department official who did not want to be named. the departments minister jyotipriyo mullick could not be contacted despite repeated attempts because of failure in mobile network.according to ijma, the carryover of raw jute at the end of the jute crop year 2019-20 is expected to be over 22 lakh bales. with reports of normal sowing this year, across all jute growing areas, the prices of jute fibre has fallen below the minimum support price of rs. 4,225 per quintal for tdn3 grade, said ijma in a statement."

2020-05-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/paddy-farming-how-migrant-crisis-has-spurred-a-shift-to-direct-seeding-method-6427059/,Paddy farming: How migrant crisis has spurred a shift to direct seeding method,"Paddy sowing is slated to begin from June 10 Paddy sowing is slated to begin from June 10Though paddy sowing is slated to begin from June 10, farmers organisations in Punjab have started protesting against the state government and Power State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), demanding 16 hours uninterrupted power supply with immediate effect.Transplanting consists of preparing seedlings in a nursery and then planting these seedlings in the fields. The Punjab government provides farmers 8 hours uninterrupted power supply to run tubewell motors to irrigate paddy fields from the official date of sowing every year.The Indian Express explains the reason behind the farmers demands:Why farmers are demanding uninterrupted power supply with immediate effect?Farmers say that this time, a large number of them are adopting the direct seeding rice (DSR) method, which is done much before normal paddy translating starting from June 10, and for which the power supply is needed to irrigate fields.This time, due to the lockdown, there is a huge shortage of skilled migrant labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states who come to Punjab for transplanting paddy in June. Locally available labour is not as fast as migrant labour when it comes to paddy translating  a backward walking transplanting process in the puddle fields. Many migrant labourers have also returned to their home states. In such a situation, a large number of farmers have been left with no option but to opt for DSR, which does not need paddy nursery to transplant but simply sows rice seed in the filed directly with the help of several types of machines including DSR machine, Lucky Seeder and with the help of some other modified machines, said farmers and agriculture experts.As this technique does not need puddling (flood irrigation of field) before sowing but just a simple good moistured land.How far is the farmers demand valid?Some farmers in Punjab have already started the DSR process from May 10 and said it should be done May 20  25 days before normal paddy translating. It can be started anywhere between May 15 and May 20 and DSR sowing needs a rauni (pre-sowing irrigation). One field needs five hours water supply from a tubewell to get it filled, said farmer Gurvinder Singh Bajwa, who has been using the DSR method for the past decade in of Sarchur village of Batala sub-division under Gurdaspur district, adding that they are getting four hours power supply and after tripping, the supply lasts only three hours, which is inadequate.Also, the number of DSR machines is very low in Punjab and most farmers are hiring these from each other. Uninterrupted water supply can ensure irrigation of 4-5 acres fields in two days. A small farmer with 5 acres can hire a DSR machine for a day to sow rice in all his fields in one day but if it takes one day to irrigate one acre then he cannot get a DSR machine for five days to his field, added Bajwa, who is also a member of several progressive farmers groups of Punjab. A DSR can sow 7-8 acres land in a day.Why is uninterrupted power supply needed for DSR?Though DSR does not need puddling of the field before paddy sowing, after wheat harvesting, farmers need to prepare the field for DSR. After wheat harvesting, the stubble is used for making fodder while leftover stubble is either burnt ploughed into the fields by rotavator or cultivator or disk harroes  all tractor mounted machines. Before running rotavator or cultivator, a rauni is required which lets leftover stubble roots get mixed in soil when a cultivator is run to prepare the field for DSR, said farmer Sukhjit Singh of Diwal village in Ludhiana, who has been doing DSR on around 30 acres of land for the past several years.Also if a farmer is sowing rice with simple DSR machine, which does not have weedicide spray pump like Lucky seeder machine which sows and sprays weedicide simultaneously, then more water is required for the field after spraying of weedicide, which is done within 24 hours of sowing with DSR. This watering is needed to make a layer of weedicide, which is done with separate pumps, on the land, said Bajwa, adding that is sowing done May 15, after which first watering is required by June 5, while the government will provide uninterrupted power supply only on June 10.What is the farmer organisations argument regarding uninterrupted power supply?Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda General Secretary Jagmohan Singh said not providing uninterrupted power supply before June 10 means the government is promoting the traditional puddle method of paddy transplanting, which is highly water consuming and will also lead to delay in paddy sowing in light of labour shortage this time. If the government really wants to cover all proposed 27 lakh hectare under DSR, it needs to supply uninterrupted power supply with immediate effect to cover more and more area under DSR, which can be done only within the next week or 10 days otherwise a huge area will be left for traditional paddy transplanting, which would be a big challenge in the absence of skilled labour, stressed Jagmohan.He also said that the number of DSR and Lucky seeder machines is very low in Punjab in comparison to the area under rice.Jagmohan also said that the government might be fearing that if uninterrupted power supply is given now, farmers may opt for puddling transplantation, but the government must understand that it is not possible because for puddling translation a farmer needs a 30-35 days nursery which is not available because they have either sown nursery on May 10 or after, which will not be transplanted before June 10 in any case.

slated to begin from june 10 paddy sowing is slated to begin from june 10though paddy sowing is slated to begin from june 10, farmers organisations in punjab have started protesting against the state government and power state power corporation limited (pspcl), demanding 16 hours uninterrupted power supply with immediate effect.transplanting consists of preparing seedlings in a nursery and then planting these seedlings in the fields. the punjab government provides farmers 8 hours uninterrupted power supply to run tubewell motors to irrigate paddy fields from the official date of sowing every year.the indian express explains the reason behind the farmers demands:why farmers are demanding uninterrupted power supply with immediate effect?farmers say that this time, a large number of them are adopting the direct seeding rice (dsr) method, which is done much before normal paddy translating starting from june 10, and for which the power supply is needed to irrigate fields.this time, due to the lockdown, there is a huge shortage of skilled migrant labourers from uttar pradesh and bihar states who come to punjab for transplanting paddy in june. locally available labour is not as fast as migrant labour when it comes to paddy translating  a backward walking transplanting process in the puddle fields. many migrant labourers have also returned to their home states. in such a situation, a large number of farmers have been left with no option but to opt for dsr, which does not need paddy nursery to transplant but simply sows rice seed in the filed directly with the help of several types of machines including dsr machine, lucky seeder and with the help of some other modified machines, said farmers and agriculture experts.as this technique does not need puddling (flood irrigation of field) before sowing but just a simple good moistured land.how far is the farmers demand valid?some farmers in punjab have already started the dsr process from may 10 and said it should be done may 20  25 days before normal paddy translating. it can be started anywhere between may 15 and may 20 and dsr sowing needs a rauni (pre-sowing irrigation). one field needs five hours water supply from a tubewell to get it filled, said farmer gurvinder singh bajwa, who has been using the dsr method for the past decade in of sarchur village of batala sub-division under gurdaspur district, adding that

Maharashtras joint director (agriculture) Ravi Bhonsale said a team was rushed to Bhandara on Thursday to spray pesticides in the affected areas. Timely action averted any major loss to crops, he said.A locust swarm entered Ghorawal in Uttar Pradeshs Sonbhadra from Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday afternoon and damaged crops across several villages in the district , which borders Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. The damage was not much as most of the vegetables and other crops have been harvested, said district agriculture officer Piyush Rai.Farmers in Agra heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday as locusts from Dausa in Rajasthan moved towards Bhangarh in Rajasthan. Three locust swarms have moved away from Agra and the one nearest moved towards Madhya Pradesh due to the wind flow, said district plant protection officer Ram Pravesh Verma. He added the threat continued from the locust swarm traced to Dausa, around 140 km away. Verma said on Thursday a swarm was within 30 km of Agra but due to sudden change in wind directionm it got diverted towards Gwalior. We are keeping a constant watch, Verma said.Plant protection division joint director Suwa Lal Jat said the locust threat has been controlled in an area spread over 73,000 hectares in Rajasthan. He added 95,000 hectares was earlier affected across 24 districts in the state. ... Barmer, Jodhpur, Ganganagar, Dausa, Bikaner and Hanumangarh are badly affected, he said. Jat said a swarm was present between Jaipur and Dausa and may either settle in Alwar or Dausa. Alwar is 100 km from Delhi.Officials have increased the vigil to counter a possible locust attack in Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand. Punjab is highly vulnerable as swarms of locusts were seen in Rajasthans Hanumanagrh district for a third day on Thursday.Punjab agriculture secretary KS Pannu said authorities in Fazilka, Bathinda and Muktsar districts that border Rajasthan have been equipped with ample stock of pesticides to deal with the locust attack.Farmers are not being able to sow new crops. We have not seen such an invasion before, said Raminder Uppal, a locust control official in Punjabs Fazilka.Haryana and Uttarakhand governments have set up district control rooms to coordinate locust control operations. Officials in these states said that drones have also been procured to spray chemicals and fire tenders and trackers with chemicals were on standby for pest control operations.Farmers maintained vigil hundreds of kilometers away in Karnatakas Bidar as locusts were expected from western Maharashtra, where they reached on Tuesday. State agriculture minister B C Patil said the wind direction suggested the locust swarm was unlikely to reach Karnataka. There is a 99.99% chance that it [the swarm] will not come to Karnataka. So, farmers need not worry, he saidIn Delhi, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reviewed the mitigation measures on Thursday. In a statement, Tomars office said the government was taking the invasion very seriously as it could afflict damages in the crucial rice-planting Kharif season beginning next month.India is in the process of importing new equipment to deal fight the infestation. Currently, locust control offices have 21 Micronair and 26 Ulvamast sprayers to kill the pests. They are specialised sprayers that use malathion and other agents to contain the pests.The agriculture minister has approved the import of 60 sprayers from the Micron Group of the UK, which is a manufacturer of specialist spraying equipment. The ministry also floated bids for drones for aerial spraying of insecticides for effective control over tall trees and inaccessible areas. Helicopters are being readied for deployment, an official said.These pests have to be controlled before farmers begin sowing summer-sown, or kharif, crops during the June-to-September monsoon season.The ministry of civil aviation has approved conditional exemption to government entity for use of remotely piloted aircraft systems for anti-locust operations. The equipment being imported from the UK will begin arriving in the next 15 days, another official said.Usually, locust swarms enter the Scheduled Desert Areas of India through Pakistan for summer breeding in the month of June and July with the advent of monsoon. This year, however, the incursions of locust hoppers and pink swarms have been reported much earlier because of the presence of a residual population of locust in Pakistan which they couldnt control last season, an agriculture ministry statement said.A surge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa. India, China and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia, according to the UN. Pakistan has already declared an agricultural emergency.Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output.

Other states and Union territories have completed the distribution, fully or partially, he said.Many beneficiaries are still waiting for the May month quota in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala and Manipur where up to 80 per cent distribution has been done, according to the official data.On distribution of one kg free pulses per household under the PMGAY, Paswan said states have lifted 1.68 lakh tonnes of pulses and are yet to provide month-wise distribution of the same. The progress report is awaited.To ensure no poor goes hungry, the Centre has allocated 5 kg rice or wheat per beneficiary and 1 kg pulses per family for free under the PMGAY for April-June as part of the Rs 20-lakh crore economic package announced to help those affected due to the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of Covid-19.""Delhi and West Bengal have distributed April month quota of foodgrains under the PMGAY.

Barring West Bengal, other states have either lifted pulses fully or partially for distribution, he said.On a report about distribution of poor-quality pulses, the minister said the government had initially received complaints about the quality especially from Delhi and Jharkhand. However, pulses have been replaced there. Now, there are no such complaints from any states.""We can tolerate delay in milling raw pulses but not poor quality. The issue has been addressed. A standard operating procedure has been issued in this regard,"" Paswan said.Paswan also mentioned that the government has enough stock to feed the poor people in the country and appealed to state governments to ensure timely distribution of free foodgrains under the PMGAY in this Covid-19 crisis.Currently, state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) has more than 76.3 million tonnes of foodgrains stock, much more than the monthly requirement under PDS and other welfare schemes.","union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution ram vilas paswan (file photo)new delhi: union food minister ram vilas paswan on friday said delhi and west bengal governments have not yet distributed the may month quota of 5 kg free foodgrains under the pradhan mantri garib anna yojana (pmgay) to ration card holders. other states and union territories have completed the distribution, fully or partially, he said.many beneficiaries are still waiting for the may month quota in states such as madhya pradesh, punjab, maharashtra, himachal pradesh, gujarat, kerala and manipur where up to 80 per cent distribution has been done, according to the official data.on distribution of one kg free pulses per household under the pmgay, paswan said states have lifted 1.68 lakh tonnes of pulses and are yet to provide month-wise distribution of the same. the progress report is awaited.to ensure no poor goes hungry, the centre has allocated 5 kg rice or wheat per beneficiary and 1 kg pulses per family for free under the pmgay for april-june as part of the rs 20-lakh crore economic package announced to help those affected due to the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of covid-19.""delhi and west bengal have distributed april month quota of foodgrains under the pmgay. delhi achieved 96 per cent distribution in april, while west bengal 93 per cent. however in the month of may, the two states have achieved zero,"" paswan said via digital press conference.barring delhi and west bengal, other states and union territories have distributed fully or partially the may month quota of free grains under the pmgay, he said.""we have written several letters to delhi and west bengal governments on this issue,"" he added.according to the latest data, arunachal pradesh and nagaland have distributed fully the may month quota to ration card holders through public distribution system (pds).more than a dozen states/uts like andhra pradesh, assam , telangana, tripura, uttarakhand, jammu and kashmir, jharkhand , karnataka, megalaya, odisha, and rajasthan have completed over 90 per cent distribution of grains for the current month.free quota of grains given under the pmgay to 81 crore ration card holders is over and above subsidised grains distributed under the national food security act (nfsa).on pulses distribution under pmgay, paswan said his ministry has not received data on month-wise distribution progress but states have reported distribution of 1.68 lakh tonnes of dals to beneficiaries so far.so far, about 3.70 lakh tonnes of pulses have reached states out of the total quantity of 4.7 lakh tonnes dispatched by the central government. barring west bengal, other states have either lifted pulses fully or partially for distribution, he said.on a report about distribution of poor-quality pulses, the minister said the government had initially received complaints about the quality especially from delhi and jharkhand. however, pulses have been replaced there. now, there are no such complaints from any states.""we can tolerate delay in milling raw pulses but not poor quality. the issue has been addressed. a standard operating procedure has been issued in this regard,"" paswan said.paswan also mentioned that the government has enough stock to feed the poor people in the country and appealed to state governments to ensure timely distribution of free foodgrains under the pmgay in this covid-19 crisis.currently, state-run food corporation of india (fci) has more than 76.3 million tonnes of foodgrains stock, much more than the monthly requirement under pds and other welfare schemes."

(Representational Photo) PAU experts also said that in June the temperature rises from 42 to 45 degrees in Punjab and water in the fields gets evaporated soon. (Representational Photo)While the Punjab CM has advanced paddy transplantation date by three days from June 13 last year to June 10 this year, the actual shift in the date since 2018 has been 10 days. The date before that used to be June 20. While last year it was moved due to Lok Sabha polls, this years shift is due to labour shortage because of Covid-19. While farmers want it to begin from June 1, experts feel that even already advanced transplantation date means that around 30-40 per cent more groundwater will be extracted to compensate for the heatwave condition prevailing in June every year. It also means 30 per cent more increase in power usage to run tubewells longer.Farmers, however, claim that delay in sowing leads to less yield and leaves less time to manage paddy stubble before sowing wheat from November 1.Paddy, which is sown in 21-22 lakh hectares in the state, is transplanted in a puddled field and requires half feet standing water for the next three weeks, which farmers extend to 4 to 6 weeks. The load, therefore, on the states groundwater table is immense.Basmati consumes less water and is sown after arrival of monsoons. It also covers only 7 lakh hectares in the state.With the starting of paddy transplanting from June 10, and if the state is able to tap available rural labour (in the absence of migrant labourers largely) including MNREGA workers for paddy sowing even then 25 to 30% (5.50 to 6 lakh hectares) paddy transplanting would be completed by June 20, said a senior officer in Punjab Agriculture Department, adding that it is a huge burden on groundwater when 116 agricultural blocks out of total 141 are under dark zone in the state.According to the governments own estimate, one day delay can save 4.80-lakh million litres of groundwater during paddy season when 15.50 lakhs electricity operated tube wells including 1.5 lakh diesel operated are supposed to run in the state.Dr G S Mangat, senior rice breeder at Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, said: We recommend paddy sowing by June 25 at the onset of monsoon, which hits state by June end, and have developed short duration paddy varieties which take just 123 to 130 days including nursery period against 155 to 160 days long varieties, which PAU does not recommend, but due to unprecedented conditions of coronavirus and shortage of labour, the advancement of paddy was required. But it should not be a regular feature to save the groundwater of the state. He also added that short varieties can be harvested in the first week of October providing 25 to 30 days to the farmers for managing the paddy stubble.PAU experts also said that in June the temperature rises from 42 to 45 degrees in Punjab and water in the fields gets evaporated soon.Say if paddy is transplanted 20 days ahead of the monsoon then 200 mm (around 8 inches) water will be wasted in the evaporation only on lakhs of hectares of paddy fields which means millions of litres more water to be required to pump out to irrigate the same crop, which can be irrigated in less water if sown a little late, and ultimately a big set back to the groundwater, said another senior scientist at PAU.Experts in the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) also said that it will also lead 30 per cent more power consumption.On June 20, 2018 on the first day of paddy sowing the power demand was 1363 MW as several pre-monsoon showers had hit the state by June 16. On June 13 last year, the power demand was 1900 MW which was around 28 per cent more than the previous years first daydemand, said one of the Superintendent Engineers in PSPCL.Farmers, however, pointed out that when the date was June 20 in 2018 to begin transplantation, around five lakh tonnes less paddy had arrived in state mandis compared to the previous year.BKU (Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said that late sowing creates panic among farmers and they run all 15 lakh tubewell simultaneously, while early sowing gives them time to sow gradually.

(Representational image) This year only 5 to 7 per cent of the required migrants are available for this work in the state due to the Covid-19 outbreak. (Representational image)As Punjab fast approaches the date to begin paddy transplantation on lakhs of hectares, the states farmers are caught between missing migrant labour from UP and Bihar and those available locally demanding much higher than usual wages for the skilled operation.For paddy sowing, Punjab needs nearly 6 lakh migrant labourers to complete the task. This year only 5 to 7 per cent of the required migrants are available for this work in the state due to the Covid-19 outbreak.In such conditions, Punjabs local khet mazdoor (farm labourers), who are over 15 lakh in number, have been demanding between Rs 4,500 to 5,500 per acre for the job (the amount is split between number of workers who complete the task per acre), which is a hike of 25 per cent to 53 per cent compared last years rate.In Punjab, the usual rate for paddy transplantation ranged between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,600 per acre depending upon the region till last year.This has led to hundreds of panchayats, particularly in the Malwa region of Punjab, pass resolutions to cap rates for paddy transplantation in their respective villages between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 per acre. Some of these panchayat resolutions also mandate imposing a fine of up to Rs 50,000 on farmers not abiding by the diktat and paying more.The move comes even as farmers have been mulling over bringing labour from UP and Bihar after easing of transport restrictions. But that too poses a challenge as due to involvement of multiple state governments for requisite permissions and the rise in cost of transportation due to travel norms like social distancing on vehicles in place which would entail engaging more vehicles.Paddy sowing starts on June 10. Punjab is expected to sow paddy on around 28-29 lakh hectares (71 lakh acres), including around 7 lakh hectares of Basmati rice this year. The paddy transplanting operation lasts for 20 to 25 days in Punjab and after that Basmati sowing starts which wraps up by July end or early August.Local khet mazdoors, meanwhile, are confident that they can fill the labour gap. We are 15.50 lakh in number in Punjab and will handle paddy transplanting very well here, said Lachman Singh Sewewala, president, Kheti Mazdoor Union, Punjab, adding that sowing may get delayed by some time, but it will be completed.But his confidence is not shared by farmers on the ground. Instead of depending on local farm hands, a large number of farmers have already gone for the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR), a technique which was available to them for over a decade but was not preferred much due to easy availability of migrant labourers.The reason for opting for DSR over using local labour this year, most farmers argue, is that while one half of available khet mazdoors do not know proper paddy transplantation technique, the other half is unlikely to match the speed of skilled migrant labour in the field to complete the job on time.Prof Kesar Singh Bhangu, Economics professor at Punjabi University, Patiala and an expert on farm issues, said: Local labour can do normal farm activities but when it comes to peak farming activities like harvesting and paddy translating then they are not able to work.About the tussle over wages, he said:Farmers should pay what they have been paying in previous years and the gap amount should be paid by the government either from NREGA funds or from labour welfare board funds.Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda, said:As per our initial estimate around 35 to 40 per cent, farmers will go for the DSR. We need labour for transplanting paddy on around 45 lakh acres, which can be done by our khet mazdoors.But for even this labour gap to be filled farmers and the khet mazdoors have to find common ground on wages.In our area, a large number of village panchayats have already passed resolutions capping the per acre rate. An increase of Rs 200 to Rs 300 per acre is acceptable, but local khet mazdoors are demanding a hike of Rs 900 to Rs 1800 per acre, said BKU Ugrahan leader Jagsir Singh from Bathinda.Lachhman Singh Sewewala, who heads the Kheti Mazdoor Union in the state, however, justified the higher rates being demanded. Every year the rates are increased and if we are increasing them this year, they why are some farmers making it an issue and involving panchayats? At least 6 persons are required to transplant paddy on one acre in one day and if they will get just Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 then each one among them gets only Rs 400 to Rs 500 as their share. However, if the same work is done by three migrants in one day on one acre, then they earn Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 as their per person share.He added: Panchayats have no legal right to pass such resolutions, they are only provoking labourers. Let farmers and labourers decide rate between themselves.Farmer leaders also want the regulations for transporting labourers from outside the state eased.The government should simplify the process of bringing in migrantsFirst the transportation cost will go up as more vehicles will be involved due to social distancing, then they will be off work till June third weak because of two-week quarantine. By the time this ends, almost half of the paddy sowing period would be gone, said Jagmohan.Migrants who work in paddy fields are ready to come too, but want farmers to facilitate the transportation.Suman Kumar, a labour contractor from Bihars Supaul district who supplies labour to Sangrur district of Punjab every year, said: In the absence of regular trains, it will Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 to bring a single migrant to Punjab depending upon the distance. But if vehicles are sent by farmers to bring them here, they will come immediately.Putting the entire problem in perspective, farmer Gurbakhshish Singh from Patiala, said: Punjab khet mazdoors have been available here for decades, but still farmers preferred migrants because of their expertise.

at least 6 persons are required to transplant paddy on one acre in one day and if they will get just rs 2,500 to rs 3,000 then each one among them gets only rs 400 to rs 500 as their share. however, if the same work is done by three migrants in one day on one acre, then they earn rs 800 to rs 1,000 as their per person share.he added: panchayats have no legal right to pass such resolutions, they are only provoking labourers. let farmers and labourers decide rate between themselves.farmer leaders also want the regulations for transporting labourers from outside the state eased.the government should simplify the process of bringing in migrantsfirst the transportation cost will go up as more vehicles will be involved due to social distancing, then they will be off work till june third weak because of two-week quarantine. by the time this ends, almost half of the paddy sowing period would be gone, said jagmohan.migrants who work in paddy fields are ready to come too, but want farmers to facilitate the transportation.suman kumar, a labour contractor from bihars supaul district who supplies labour to sangrur district of punjab every year, said: in the absence of regular trains, it will rs 3,000 to rs 4,000 to bring a single migrant to punjab depending upon the distance. but if vehicles are sent by farmers to bring them here, they will come immediately.putting the entire problem in perspective, farmer gurbakhshish singh from patiala, said: punjab khet mazdoors have been available here for decades, but still farmers preferred migrants because of their expertise. but this time we have to depend on local mazdoors. everyone argues that if wheat procurement was done successfully in the absence of migrants, then paddy sowing will also be done without any trouble. but you have to understand, both operations are different and require different skills. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest india news, download indian express app. the indian express (p) ltd"

(Express photo) Farmer Jagdeep Singh (second from right) with the DSR machine at Sangrurs Kanoi village. (Express photo)The acute shortage of migrant labour to transplant paddy has helped Punjab achieve what the state government has been unsuccessfully trying to do for over a decade. For the first time ever this year, the area under Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) is set to be the highest ever from the year the technology was introduced in the state in 2009-10. The increase in area under DSR, even according to initial trends, is already 8.60 times higher than last year, and paddy sowing will continue till the end of this month. Experts estimate that by the time sowing ends around 22 per cent to 26 per cent of the total targeted area of paddy will be brought under DSR technique  a method that saves water and is not labour intensive.While paddy transplantation using the traditional way  the puddle method  only begins from June 10, DSR sowing can start around 2-3 weeks before. So, Punjab has already completed paddy sowing with DSR on around 2 lakh hectares of the total targeted paddy area before its traditional method transplantation even begins.Even if the state combines DSR area of past five years then this years area is higher. In the last five years from 2015 to 2019 Punjab in total could bring less than 2 lakh hectares under DSR, while this year alone it has already crossed the 2 lakh hectares mark till date with three weeks of sowing left. For instance in 2018, the area under DSR was only 5,000 hectares and it was only 23,300 hectares in 2019. Compared to last year alone, the increase is 8.60 times.Director, Punjab Agriculture Department, Dr Sutantra Airi told The Indian Express that they are surprised that the farmers are running after DSR this year while earlier they used to run away from it.Due to the migrant labour shortage and high rates demanded by the local labour around Rs 5,000 to 6,000 per acre, they are doing it. We have been educating them to use DSR on medium to heavy soil only and telling them laser leveller is also must so that entire field gets equal water, he said, adding that already over 2 lakh hectares area has been covered under DSR and there are expectations of covering around 6 lakh hectares under it this year. Punjab has targeted to sow paddy on around 27-28 lakh hectares, including around 7 lakh under Basmati rice (fine aromatic rice), this year.Traditional method vs DSRIn normal transplanting, farmers prepare nurseries where the paddy seeds are first sown and raised into young plants. These seedlings are then uprooted and replanted 25-35 days later in the main field.In DSR, there is no nursery preparation or transplantation. The paddy seeds are, instead, directly drilled into the field by a tractor-powered machine. The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) at Ludhiana has developed Lucky Seed Drill which can sow seeds and simultaneously also spray herbicides to control weed growth.Punjab needs at least 6 lakh migrant labours to transplant paddy on 27-28 lakh hectares with traditional method which is highly labour intensive. DSR requires neither nursery sowing nor transplanting, which itself entails minimum labour requirement.Also, in traditional method, plants are transplanted in 6-inches deep water and have to be irrigated almost daily (if there are no rains) to ensure water depth of 4-5 cm, but in DSR, water is replaced by herbicides.The trend this yearAlmost all districts of Punjab have shown a shift towards DSR according to data sourced from the district agricultural offices across Punjab.While Fatehgarh Sahib, Bathinda, Ropar and Pathankot districts which had not gone for DSR last year at all, these districts this year have sown 4,500 hectares, 2000, 1100 and 100 hectares using DSR, respectively.Kapurthala till date has seen 275 times increase in DSR usage this year. From total 100 hectares under DSR last year, this year it has gone up to 27,500 hectares till date.In Gurdaspur, there has been 60-time rise in the area from 100 hectares last year to 6,000 hectares this year. Ludhiana has recorded 26 times increase in area under DSR.In Sangrur there has been 44 times increase from 700 hectares last year to 29,000 hectares this year till date.The trend is reflected in Amritsar and Ferozepur too.In Amritsar, there has been 16 times increase (from 500 hectares to 8020 hectares) and in Ferozepur, it is a 25 times upward swing from 700 hectares last year to 12,000 hectares this year so far.In Mukatsar Sahib, where last year 12,900 hectares was under DSR, this year the district has already completed sowing with DSR on 26,000 hectares (64,220 acres).We are expecting that our district will touch 50,000 to 55,000 hectares (1,23,500 to 1,35,850 acres) as our parmal rice sowing will be continue till June 15 and then basmati varieties like will be sown with DSR, said Chief Agriculture Officer, Mukatsar Sahib, Dr Jalour Singh, adding that they had never expected such a huge jump in the area under DSR. The district has 475 machines for sowing rice directly.In Jalandhar, where only 1,300 hectares was under DSR last year, this has increased to 12,000 hectares till date, said Dr Naresh Gulati, Agriculture officer, Jalandhar, adding that farmers, who never wanted to go for this earlier, are not shying away this time from adopting DSR.Barnala district has seen a 20 times increase in the DSR area. It has gone up from 1,000 hectares last year to 20,000 hectares this year so far, said CAO Baldev Singh.This year farmers have even gone the extra mile and modified their Happy Seeders, used for directly sowing wheat, for direct sowing of rice, said the Director Agriculture, Punjab.With DSR sowing, we are not even spending one-fourth of what the labourers are demanding for transplanting and it needs around 30-40 per cent less water as it is not sown in the standing water but only a wet field and needs first water after three weeks, said farmer Jagdeep Singh from Sangrurs Kanoi village, who has sown paddy with DSR on his entire farm, adding that in his village majority farmers are going for DSR technique this year.In Kanoi, farmers have sown around 30 per cent of the villages total of 1000 acres agricultural land with DSR.In Kheri and Ugranhan villages too farmers have sown paddy with DSR in a huge areas. Farmers Gurpal Singh and Kuldeep Singh of Kheri village in the Sangrur district had never tried DSR ever before, but this year they have tried it on 9 and 18 acres, respectively  a trend that is true for many farmers in Punjab amid Covid-induced labour shortage.

The Sikhs know,"Volunteers prepare meals at the Sikh Center of New York, in Queens Village. (Ryan Christopher Jones/The New Yo... Read MoreNEW YORK: Inside a low, brick-red building in Queens Village, a group of about 30 cooks has made and served more than 145,000 free meals in just 10 weeks. They arrive at 4 a.m. three days a week to methodically assemble vast quantities of basmati rice, dal, beans and vibrantly flavored sabzis for New York City hospital workers, people in poverty and anyone else in search of a hot meal.This isn't a soup kitchen or a food bank. It's a gurdwara, the place of worship for Sikhs, members of the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with about 25 million adherents. Providing for people in need is built into their faith.An essential part of Sikhism is langar, the practice of preparing and serving a free meal to promote the Sikh tenet of seva, or selfless service. Anyone, Sikh or not, can visit a gurdwara and partake in langar, with the biggest ones  like the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India  serving more than 100,000 people every day.Since the coronavirus pandemic has halted religious gatherings in most of the country, including langar, gurdwaras like the Sikh Center of New York, in Queens Village, are mobilizing their large-scale cooking resources to meet the skyrocketing need for food aid outside their places of worship.Some are feeding the protesters marching in outrage over the killings of George Floyd and other black Americans by police. Last week, a dozen or so volunteers from the Queens center served 500 portions of matar paneer, rice and rajma, a creamy, comforting dish of red beans stewed with tomatoes, and 1,000 bottles of water and cans of soda to demonstrators in Sunnyside. They also offered dessert: kheer, a sweetened rice pudding.""Where we see peaceful protest, we are going,"" said Himmat Singh, a coordinator at the World Sikh Parliament , an advocacy group providing volunteers for the Queens Village efforts. ""We are looking for justice. We support this.""Since the pandemic began, soup kitchens have had difficulty keeping up with demand. Shuttered schools and even fine-dining restaurants are using their kitchens to prepare and serve hot meals. But few other places are as well positioned to handle the sheer scale of assistance required right now as the gurdwaras. Most have large, well-equipped kitchens, a steady stream of volunteers and no shortage of ingredients, thanks to regular donations from community members.During the last annual Sikh Day Parade in New York, in April 2019, the Queens Village kitchen  which has a walk-in cooler, multiple freezers, 50-liter stockpots and a huge grill that can cook dozens of rotis at once  produced 15,000 meals in a single day.The Sikhs' biggest challenge isn't keeping up with demand. It's letting people know that they're here  without making a big show of it or proselytizing, which is forbidden.Founded in the 15th century in Punjab, India, by the spiritual leader Guru Nanak, Sikhism has an estimated 500,000 followers in the United States and 280 gurdwaras, according to the Sikh Coalition, a civil-rights organization in New York City. One of the most visibly distinctive features of the Sikh practice is the turban  a symbol of the religion's belief in equality  though not everyone chooses to wear one.Sikhs in America have often been prey to bigotry, hate crimes and Islamophobia, particularly since 9/11. A few volunteers said in interviews that before going out to distribute meals, they worried that they might hear ignorant comments. But Santokh Dillon, president of the Guru Nanak Mission Society of Atlanta, said the people he serves are often more puzzled than prejudiced. Most have never even heard of Sikhism, he said.When some find out that the meals are free, ""They look at us and say, You are kidding, right?' ""At least 80 gurdwaras in the United States are now providing food assistance. For many, the transition has been quick and seamless.This is not just because the infrastructure is already there, said Satjeet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition. ""The call to action and the responsibility"" for helping others is deeply entrenched in the Sikh way of life. Sikhs are expected to donate at least 10% of their time or income toward community service.It took the Gurdwara Sahib of Fremont, California, just a few days after suspending religious services in March to set up a meal and grocery delivery program, and a drive-through meal pickup system outside the gurdwara.Cooks wear gloves and masks, and the kitchen is big enough for workers to stand more than six feet from one another. As at most gurdwaras, the menu changes regularly, but is typically Indian and always vegetarian. (Meat is not permitted in gurdwaras.)While these Sikh volunteers, known as sevadars, are experts in mass-meal preparation, they aren't as accustomed to spreading the word. The Fremont kitchen has produced 15,000 to 20,000 meals a day on holidays like New Year's Eve, said Dr. Pritpal Singh, a member of the gurdwara. But now, the gurdwara is serving just 100 to 150 people each day.Pritpal Singh said he hoped that more people in need would come pick up food. ""We could do hundreds of thousands of meals if given the task,"" he said.But with the demonstrations unfolding around the country, Sikhs aren't waiting for people to come to them any longer. On Tuesday, volunteers from the Gurdwara Sahib attended a protest in Fremont and handed out several hundred bottles of water as a show of solidarity.On a recent Friday, Gurjiv Kaur and Kiren Singh asked the volunteers at their gurdwara, the Khalsa Care Foundation, in the Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles, to prepare meals in the community kitchen that they could take to the protest. The next morning, they and others picked up about 700 containers of pasta with a garlic- and onion-laden tomato sauce and 500 bottles of water from the gurdwara, and set up a tent in Pan Pacific Park. Soon, protesters started arriving at the tent with other donations, like medical supplies, snacks and hand sanitizer.""It is our duty to stand up with others to fight for justice,"" said Kaur, a graduating senior at the University of California, Irvine. ""Langar at its core is a revolution  against inequality and the caste system,"" the antiquated hereditary class structure in South Asia, which Sikhism has always rejected.In Norwich, Connecticut, volunteers from five gurdwaras handed out a few hundred bottles of water to protesters last Tuesday, and on Friday, distributed as many containers of rajma, or kidney beans, and rice on a Main Street sidewalk, a block from City Hall.Swaranjit Singh Khalsa, a volunteer and a member of the Norwich Board of Education, noted that historically, many Sikhs in India have been killed by the police while fighting for their civil rights.At many gurdwaras in the United States, most of those who show up for langar meals are Sikhs. Now that they are catering to a broader population, menus have changed to suit different tastes. In the Seattle area, volunteers at the Gurudwara Sacha Marag Sahib are making pasta and tacos in addition to rice and dal.At the Hacienda de Guru Ram Das in Espaola, New Mexico, meals have included enchiladas and burritos. Still, Harimandir Khalsa, a volunteer, said the community kitchen is operating at less than 10% of its capacity.""I think it is about convenience,"" Khalsa said, as the gurdwara isn't centrally located. ""If we had a food truck parked in front of Walmart that said, Free food,' we could get more takers. But for people to get in their cars and drive over to this place  people aren't that desperate yet.""Location is also an issue for the Guru Ramdas Gurdwara Sahib in Vancouver, Washington, as the neighborhood doesn't have much foot traffic, said Mohan Grewal, the gurdwara secretary. So every other Sunday, volunteers pack up 300 to 400 meals made in the gurdwara and drive them to the Living Hope Church, a Christian congregation six miles away, in a more urban part of the city.One of the biggest challenges for gurdwaras is that many hospitals, shelters and other charitable organizations they would like to help don't take cooked food because of hygienic concerns, or accept it only if it meets certain health codes. Many Sikhs have started collecting and distributing pantry items in addition to making meals.Still, some gurdwaras are bustling. In Riverside, California, a hub for the Sikh population, volunteers from the United Sikh Mission , an American nonprofit aid group, and the Khalsa School Riverside, a children's program, serve 3,000 to 5,000 meals every day at the Riverside Gurdwara. People line up in the drive-through as early as 9:30 a.m., even though it doesn't open until 11:30.The process is highly systematized. The cooking team shows up at 5:30 a.m. to prepare meals based on previous days' numbers, as well as requests from senior centers, hospitals and nursing homes; another team packs the meals into microwave-safe boxes; and the third distributes them at the drive-through and other locations. The gurdwara shares information about the free meals through regular posts on large Facebook groups for local residents.""We didn't just sit there and say we are going to cook and wait for people to come,"" said Gurpreet Singh, a volunteer for the United Sikh Mission.Since the protests, Gurpreet Singh and others have been reaching out to black organizations, like churches, offering to drop off meals or groceries. They expect to see an increase in people showing up for meals, as thousands have been attending protests in the area.Groups like United Sikhs, an international nonprofit, are helping to get the word out. They have stepped up efforts to identify areas of need, connect gurdwaras with organizations seeking assistance, provide best practices for food preparation during the pandemic and mobilize Sikhs to help feed protesters.While the pandemic continues, a few gurdwaras aren't using their kitchens. Tejkiran Singh, a spokesman for the Singh Sabha of Michigan, west of Detroit, said the gurdwara committee decided it was too risky to start a meal distribution service, especially since Michigan has become a hot spot for the coronavirus.When the Sikh Society of Central Florida, in Oviedo, reopens on June 14, services will be limited to fewer people, and food will be handed out in to-go containers as they leave.But Amit Pal Singh and Charanjit Singh, the chairman and the treasurer of the Sikh Society of Central Florida, also want to continue the drive-through and delivery services they developed during the pandemic.""The concept of langar is to serve the needy,"" Pal Singh said. Before the pandemic, he said, most people participating in langar were local Sikhs coming more for social and religious reasons than out of need. The drive-through and deliveries will allow them to put meals into the hands of people who struggle to afford to eat.That will mean a lot of extra food for volunteers to prepare, in a city where the Sikh population is still small. But none of that seemed to worry Pal Singh.""We would love to be in that situation,"" he said, his optimism vibrating through the phone. ""We will handle it.""","volunteers prepare meals at the sikh center of new york, in queens village. (ryan christopher jones/the new yo... read morenew york: inside a low, brick-red building in queens village, a group of about 30 cooks has made and served more than 145,000 free meals in just 10 weeks. they arrive at 4 a.m. three days a week to methodically assemble vast quantities of basmati rice, dal, beans and vibrantly flavored sabzis for new york city hospital workers, people in poverty and anyone else in search of a hot meal.this isn't a soup kitchen or a food bank. it's a gurdwara, the place of worship for sikhs, members of the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with about 25 million adherents. providing for people in need is built into their faith.an essential part of sikhism is langar, the practice of preparing and serving a free meal to promote the sikh tenet of seva, or selfless service. anyone, sikh or not, can visit a gurdwara and partake in langar, with the biggest ones  like the golden temple in amritsar, india  serving more than 100,000 people every day.since the coronavirus pandemic has halted religious gatherings in most of the country, including langar, gurdwaras like the sikh center of new york, in queens village, are mobilizing their large-scale cooking resources to meet the skyrocketing need for food aid outside their places of worship.some are feeding the protesters marching in outrage over the killings of george floyd and other black americans by police. last week, a dozen or so volunteers from the queens center served 500 portions of matar paneer, rice and rajma, a creamy, comforting dish of red beans stewed with tomatoes, and 1,000 bottles of water and cans of soda to demonstrators in sunnyside. they also offered dessert: kheer, a sweetened rice pudding.""where we see peaceful protest, we are going,"" said himmat singh, a coordinator at the world sikh parliament , an advocacy group providing volunteers for the queens village efforts. ""we are looking for justice. we support this.""since the pandemic began, soup kitchens have had difficulty keeping up with demand. shuttered schools and even fine-dining restaurants are using their kitchens to prepare and serve hot meals. but few other places are as well positioned to handle the sheer scale of assistance required right now as the gurdwaras. most have large, well-equipped kitchens, a steady stream of volunteers and no shortage of ingredients, thanks to regular donations from community members.during the last annual sikh day parade in new york, in april 2019, the queens village kitchen  which has a walk-in cooler, multiple freezers, 50-liter stockpots and a huge grill that can cook dozens of rotis at once  produced 15,000 meals in a single day.the sikhs' biggest challenge isn't keeping up with demand. it's letting people know that they're here  without making a big show of it or proselytizing, which is forbidden.founded in the 15th century in punjab, india, by the spiritual leader guru nanak, sikhism has an estimated 500,000 followers in the united states and 280 gurdwaras, according to the sikh coalition, a civil-rights organization in new york city. one of the most visibly distinctive features of the sikh practice is the turban  a symbol of the religion's belief in equality  though not everyone chooses to wear one.sikhs in america have often been prey to bigotry, hate crimes and islamophobia, particularly since 9/11. a few volunteers said in interviews that before going out to distribute meals, they worried that they might hear ignorant comments. but santokh dillon, president of the guru nanak mission society of atlanta, said the people he serves are often more puzzled than prejudiced. most have never even heard of sikhism, he said.when some find out that the meals are free, ""they look at us and say, you are kidding, right?' ""at least 80 gurdwaras in the united states are now providing food assistance. for many, the transition has been quick and seamless.this is not just because the infrastructure is already there, said satjeet kaur, executive director of the sikh coalition.

Now, the state has only 1 lakh of them engaged in potato harvest in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, SBS Nagar and Kapurthala districts. But we will manage the operations comfortably and as did with wheat procurement even as we are facing acute shortage of labour.There is no doubt that paddy will be sown within the stipulated time, i.e. up to July 31, but the cost will go up for the farmers. Who will compensate for that? asked Balbir Singh Rajewal, head of a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).The DSR method of paddy sowing was recommended by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, due to labour shortage. The state agriculture department has proposed to bring 12 lakh acres under the DSR system. PAU has also suggested PR 126 as a DSR variety.The farmers have welcomed the new method which will help save time, money and groundwater, Pannu said.Also, the number of mechanised paddy transplantation machines has doubled to about 1,200 this year, said director (agriculture) Sutantar Kumar Airi.Also, the farmers are opting for crop diversification due to the shortage of labour.

Sinha and secretaries of food and civil supplies, agriculture, oil, non-conventional energy, and MSME, on Wednesday.Presently our ethanol production is  20,000 crore and imports are  6-7 lakh crore. So now we are planning to make ethanol economy of  1 lakh crore, he said adding there are 200 closed sugar factories which can be converted for bio-ethanol production.He added that in states like Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, there is a need to change the crop pattern and reduce the acreage of wheat and rice.In Punjab and Haryana, we do not have a place for storage also...So this a bad situation for the country. On one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage, Mr. Gadkari said.Further, he said that India imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth  90,000 crore as Indias oilseed production is not up to the mark.He said that soybean production per acre in the US and Brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in India, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre.There is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added.Talking about PPE kits, which are in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in India has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day.I have requested (Commerce and Industry Minister) Piyush Goyal ji that please give us permission to export PPE kits because we have got tremendous capacity now, he said.Similarly, Mr. Gadkari said, India has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders.On developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the World Bank to make Delhi -Mathura-Agra-Itawah-Allahabad-Varanasi waterway and though this Delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to Myanmar and southeast Asia.Further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata and develop smart cities and villages.He added that India needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here.My target for two years is for making roads of  15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me.

So this is now going to create a big economic crisis for the country.We need to find out some options, alternatives for that, and without resolving that issue in agriculture, we cannot accelerate our economy because maximum purchasing power where we need to increase the potential in agriculture, Gadkari said in a webinar.He said that the country has surplus rice and wheat and there is a problem of storage of these grains.Also, the government provided Rs 6,000 crore subsidy to export 60 lakh tonnes of sugar as the country is surplus in the sweetener, he said.The MSME and transport minister said: In the agriculture area, there are some serious problems we are facing, we have surplus rice and wheat....we do not have a place for storage. It is totally full. We are surplus in rice and wheat for three years.Gadkari also said that he has suggested for the formulation of a policy on converting rice into ethanol or bio-ethanol.He suggested this in a meeting with top officials, including principal advisor to Prime Minister P K Sinha and secretaries of food and civil supplies, agriculture, oil, non-conventional energy, and MSME, on Wednesday.Presently our ethanol production is Rs 20,000 crore and imports are Rs 6-7 lakh crore. So now we are planning to make ethanol economy of Rs 1 lakh crore, he said adding there are 200 closed sugar factories which can be converted for bio-ethanol production.He added that in states like Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, there is a need to change the crop pattern and reduce the acreage of wheat and rice.In Punjab and Haryana, we do not have a place for storage also...So this a bad situation for the country. On one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage, Gadkari said.Further, he said that India imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth Rs 90,000 crore as Indias oilseed production is not up to the mark.He said that soybean production per acre in the US and Brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in India, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre.There is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added.Talking about PPE kits, which are in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in India has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day.I have requested (Commerce and Industry Minister) Piyush Goyal ji that please give us permission to export PPE kits because we have got tremendous capacity now, he said.Similarly, Gadkari said, India has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders.On developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the World Bank to make Delhi -Mathura-Agra-Itawah-Allahabad-Varanasi waterway and though this Delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to Myanmar and southeast Asia.Further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata and develop smart cities and villages.He added that India needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here.My target for two years is for making roads of Rs 15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me. M toll income is Rs 28000 crore per year. By the end of March, I am expecting Rs 40,000 crore and within five years, my toll income of NHAI will be Rs one lakh crore, he added.FDI can be allowed in NBFCs and I feel that can be a good route. We need to go to RBI and finance to find out the way to give permission for that, he said.","indiaupdated: jun 11, 2020 15:38 istthe governments minimum support prices for agriculture crops are way higher then domestic market prices and international rates, union minister nitin gadkari said on thursday as he stressed on finding alternative solutions before an economic crisis is created.while the government fixes the rate, called minimum support price or msp, at which it buys crops such as wheat and paddy from farmers, it also provides a subsidy to help export sugar.the most important problem in this sector is that (among) the international price for agriculture commodities and the market price and the msp, there is a vast difference. now there are a lot of problems, some political problems are also there. it is very difficult for the government to take decisions.but the ground reality is that our msp is higher than the market price and international price. so this is now going to create a big economic crisis for the country.we need to find out some options, alternatives for that, and without resolving that issue in agriculture, we cannot accelerate our economy because maximum purchasing power where we need to increase the potential in agriculture, gadkari said in a webinar.he said that the country has surplus rice and wheat and there is a problem of storage of these grains.also, the government provided rs 6,000 crore subsidy to export 60 lakh tonnes of sugar as the country is surplus in the sweetener, he said.the msme and transport minister said: in the agriculture area, there are some serious problems we are facing, we have surplus rice and wheat....we do not have a place for storage. it is totally full. we are surplus in rice and wheat for three years.gadkari also said that he has suggested for the formulation of a policy on converting rice into ethanol or bio-ethanol.he suggested this in a meeting with top officials, including principal advisor to prime minister p k sinha and secretaries of food and civil supplies, agriculture, oil, non-conventional energy, and msme, on wednesday.presently our ethanol production is rs 20,000 crore and imports are rs 6-7 lakh crore. so now we are planning to make ethanol economy of rs 1 lakh crore, he said adding there are 200 closed sugar factories which can be converted for bio-ethanol production.he added that in states like punjab, haryana and some parts of uttar pradesh, there is a need to change the crop pattern and reduce the acreage of wheat and rice.in punjab and haryana, we do not have a place for storage also...so this a bad situation for the country. on one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage, gadkari said.further, he said that india imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth rs 90,000 crore as indias oilseed production is not up to the mark.he said that soybean production per acre in the us and brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in india, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre.there is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added.talking about ppe kits, which are in demand due to the covid-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in india has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day.i have requested (commerce and industry minister) piyush goyal ji that please give us permission to export ppe kits because we have got tremendous capacity now, he said.similarly, gadkari said, india has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders.on developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the world bank to make delhi -mathura-agra-itawah-allahabad-varanasi waterway and though this delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to myanmar and southeast asia.further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like delhi, mumbai, chennai, bengaluru, and kolkata and develop smart cities and villages.he added that india needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here.my target for two years is for making roads of rs 15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me. m toll income is rs 28000 crore per year. by the end of march, i am expecting rs 40,000 crore and within five years, my toll income of nhai will be rs one lakh crore, he added.fdi can be allowed in nbfcs and i feel that can be a good route. we need to go to rbi and finance to find out the way to give permission for that, he said."
2020-06-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/paddy-sowing-begins-in-punjab-amid-labour-shortage-6454431/,Paddy sowing begins in Punjab amid labour shortage,"Farm workers sowing paddy in a field in cloudy weather at a village in Jalandhar on Wednesday. (Express Photo) Farm workers sowing paddy in a field in cloudy weather at a village in Jalandhar on Wednesday. (Express Photo)Amid scarcity of workers, farmers began transplantation of paddy, the popular conventional and highly labour intensive method of paddy sowing in Punjab on Wednesday. Though the state government is also encouraging them to opt for direct seeding of rice (DSR), a less labour-intensive method but large number of farmers in Punjab go for transplantation method.There was a 40-50 per cent increase in rates of transplantation per acre, which witnessed an increase from Rs. 3000 per acre to between Rs. 5000 to 6000 this year because of the shot supply of labour. Majority of the fields remained vacant and in most villages, only a couple of farmers could start transplantation due to non-availability of labourers due to the Covid-19 pandemic.After seeing the situation on day 1, several farmers were forced to send vehicles to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on Wednesday to bring labour from there or offer them advance payment.Paddy transplantation is a labour intensive exercise in which at least two-three workers per acre are required. In several villages, local khet mazdoor refused to take up the work.In villages of Jalandhar district like Nangal Shama, Dhilwan, Muzzafarpur, Patara, Johal, Bolina, Dakoha, Puranpur, Talhan, Sinkanderpur, Alawalpur, Chandpur, Jandhushinga, Kapur and Chuharwalia, majority farmers complained of shortage of labour despite availability of khet mazdoor.Farmer Jaspal Singh of Nangal Shama said there is no labourer available in their village and thus he approached the local khet mazdoor to take up his work, but they refused to take up transplantation.In Semi village, transplantation took place in only one area where nine persons from Bihars Araria district were working under their leader Mukesh Kumar.We all had come to Punjab in February before lockdown for potato harvesting. Since we also have the expertise of paddy transplantation our landlord requested us to stay back till paddy sowing, said Mukesh, adding that they had got registered to return to Bihar by Shramik trains but did not get seats.But now we feel that it had happened for good as we are now earning Rs 1,000 each daily as we got work to transplant paddy in 70 acres at the rate of Rs 5,000 per acre while it was only Rs 3,000 rate per acre last year, he added.Mukesh said that this time there is no labour, because of which they are getting an all-time high rate of paddy transplantation.Sunil Paswan, another labourer from Saharsa district of Bihar, was transplanting paddy in the fields of farmer Jaskaran Singh of Salempur village along with his entire family including wife, her parents and other relatives and was happy that he will earn a good amount this year.We are 10 people and will rope paddy plants on 50 acres of land at a rate of Rs 4,500 to Rs 5,000 per acre, said he, adding that last year they got Rs 2,700 per acre.We had also got registered to go back to our native places by train but then these trains stopped and we also stayed back, he said.Same was the opinion of labourer Vipin Yadav who was busy in transplanting in Talhan Village.Farmers are however quite worried. Talwinder Singh of Nauli village has to sow 55 acres including 45 acres under paddy and 10 acres under basmati, but no labour was available while local khet mazdoor are demanding Rs 7,000 per acre.After seeing the situation, I sent two Innova vehicles to Uttar Pradesh to bring 12 labourers which will cost Rs 35,000 and I will share 50 per cent of the cost, he said, adding that local labour is not ready to work in their village.There is no doubt about the shortage of labour in Punjab but farmers are managing on their own with the help of local khet mazdoor, some migrant labourers and by DSR method, said Director, Punjab Agriculture Department, Dr Sutantra Airi.In Punjab, 27 lakh hectares under paddy is the target, including 7 lakh under basmati, out of which direct sowing has already taken place on 2 lakh hectares.In Punjab, PAU-invented short duration paddy varieties like PR-126, PR 127, PR 121, PR 122, PR 127 and PR 114 varieties are primarily being sown as these are 123 to 130 days duration varieties including the nursery period of 25 to 30 days.

While the supply of milk and bread seems to have been restored, it was items necessary for cooking, including wheat flour, pulses and rice, that were not available at the stores.The supply is nil with the demand at an all-time high. People are scared that everything will get over and have started hoarding rations. Our stocks of 100 kgs of pulses have flown off the shelves within the last three days. A maximum of 5 kg is only left. People have been buying in bulk. While earlier they used to take 1 kg, they now took 10, said Purshottam Aggarwal, owner of a small grocery shop at Haripur village.Another grocery shop owner, Sudesh Gupta, has been facing a severe problem in procuring grains and flour from the market. She said, Earlier we used to buy all our grains and grocery from Sector 26 in Chandigarh but since the curfew, nobody is being let in or out. We have made arrangements with a firm in Panchkulas Sector 20 which is the only agency supplying right now. We just got a few kilos of wheat from there. We had run out of everything. We still do not have any pulses or rice.No packaged items availableIt is not just the grains that have been emptied out by the residents of the city but also the pre-packaged food items. Maggi, chocolates, Lays, cold drinks, pasta & easy-cook meals, including soups, have been sold out.The current generation is much used to fast food and will go into withdrawal if they dont get it. They have been buying Lays and other products in huge quantities. People bring their cars and fill the vehicles to the brink, said the owner of a department store in Sector 7.Meanwhile, the owners of these groceries have claimed that no supply from these big brands is coming into the city yet. Products of Nestle and other such brands have stopped supply, said Ajit Bansal, owner of a store in Sector 4.Vegetable prices still soarThe prices of fruits and vegetables continued to soar on the third day of the lockdown in the district. Several residents of the city claimed that amid confusion over approved list by the district administration, nothing was made available to them.The administration has failed to make anything available to us. Grocery shops have run out of basic raw material required to cook. The vegetables earlier priced at Rs 20 per kg are available at Rs 40 per kg by the administration. The vendors are further selling it at more than double that cost with the prices touching Rs 100 for anything easily, said RWA of Sector 25, Panchkula.In another list prepared by the district administration, Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja had claimed on Thursday that about 160 street vendors and vegetable vendors would provide essential items at standard prices. It was further claimed that any person can call over the telephone and also get the items sitting at home. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

They were hoping free and subsidised ration supplies would ease their worries emerging out of the lockdown.FOLLOW CORONAVIRUS LIVE UPDATES HEREIn most parts of the country, local flour millers and chakki shops are not allowed to operate, while some are not willing to function due to fear of action by the police, which is enforcing strictly the lockdown rules to stop the spread of the disease as the confirmed cases in the country rise to 1,071.""What do I do with wheat? Nearby chakkis (flour mills) are shut. Where do I convert wheat into flour? What is the point of buying wheat when we cannot consume?"" Mustafa (25), a factory worker, told PTI after getting the ration supply from a fair price shop at Sarai Kale Khan in the national capital on Sunday.Mustafa received 6 kg wheat and 1.5 kg rice for free on Monday and did not get his monthly quota of foodgrains at a subsidised rate in the absence of stock at the depot.Like Mustafa, many ration card holders -- some were working in nearby factories, some as servants, security guards and rickshaw pullers before the lockdown announced on March 24 -- who got wheat from the ration shop were disappointed.This was the situation reported in wheat-consuming states of North India even though the central government has given permission to states and Union Territories to supply 'wheat flour' if they wish at their expense.""Under the PDS, we basically deliver wheat. It is logistically not possible to intervene at a local level by the Government of India. However, necessary advisory will be issued to the state governments to look into the matter,"" Food Secretary Ravi Kant said. Except for Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana, most states distribute a mix of rice and wheat through PDS.However under the PMGKY, mostly rice will be distributed for free, he said. ""It is difficult suddenly to convert wheat into atta (wheat flour) and distribute via PDS. If at all to be done and can be managed, it has to be done at the state level,"" Kant said.However, some states like Telangana have taken measures to distribute wheat flour along with rice and some cash to ration card holders who have become jobless owing to the lockdown.Uttar Pradesh Roller Flour Millers Association President Pramod Kumar Vaish said, ""The Centre is distributing wheat at a cheaper rate of Rs 2 per kg, while the cost of converting it into flour and packaging is over Rs 3 per kg"".The Association has sent a proposal to the Uttar Pradesh government that they are ready to provide their service for PDS purpose.""But, the state administration has not shown interest due to the financial implications it would have on the state exchequer in the absence of a clear central policy,"" he said.Vaish said, ""There is a problem in distributing wheat in the current situation. How can poor go and get it grinded when chakkis are not opened?"" The association cannot intervene as it has big flour millers as its members and not small chakkis at local level, he added.The only way out now is to allow one or two local chakkis in each locality to operate during the lockdown or install at least one portable chakki near ration depot for converting wheat into flour.It may be noted that there are over 81 crore poor people registered under the PDS, which comprise two-thirds of the country's population.","by ptinew delhi: distribution of free wheat grain in place of flour is causing tremendous hardship to beneficiaries registered under the public distribution system (pds) with no way to grind it as local chakkis being shut, owing to a countrywide covid-19 lockdown.to ensure enough food to the poor during the lockdown, the government last week started distributing free 5 kg of rice or wheat per person and 1 kg pulse per household under the pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana (pmgky) to over 81 crore pds beneficiaries.this is over and above the monthly quota of 5 kg grains per person being given at subsidised rate of rs 2 kg for wheat and rs 3 kg for rice.with no way to grind wheat, many people do know what to do. they were hoping free and subsidised ration supplies would ease their worries emerging out of the lockdown.follow coronavirus live updates herein most parts of the country, local flour millers and chakki shops are not allowed to operate, while some are not willing to function due to fear of action by the police, which is enforcing strictly the lockdown rules to stop the spread of the disease as the confirmed cases in the country rise to 1,071.""what do i do with wheat? nearby chakkis (flour mills) are shut. where do i convert wheat into flour? what is the point of buying wheat when we cannot consume?"" mustafa (25), a factory worker, told pti after getting the ration supply from a fair price shop at sarai kale khan in the national capital on sunday.mustafa received 6 kg wheat and 1.5 kg rice for free on monday and did not get his monthly quota of foodgrains at a subsidised rate in the absence of stock at the depot.like mustafa, many ration card holders -- some were working in nearby factories, some as servants, security guards and rickshaw pullers before the lockdown announced on march 24 -- who got wheat from the ration shop were disappointed.this was the situation reported in wheat-consuming states of north india even though the central government has given permission to states and union territories to supply 'wheat flour' if they wish at their expense.""under the pds, we basically deliver wheat. it is logistically not possible to intervene at a local level by the government of india. however, necessary advisory will be issued to the state governments to look into the matter,"" food secretary ravi kant said. except for punjab, rajasthan and haryana, most states distribute a mix of rice and wheat through pds.however under the pmgky, mostly rice will be distributed for free, he said.

However, the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to almost half the total districts in the country  from 284 to 354 districts over the past week  is likely to weigh on the mind of the Central government in crafting a graded approach.Also, the number of cases is still rising. In the highest single-day spike so far, 918 cases and 31 deaths were reported across the country on Sunday. The total has now gone up to 8,447 cases, of which 273 have died while 764 recovered.According to the Health Ministrys latest data, there has been a substantial rise in the number of districts with over 10 cases  from 86 to 126 over the past week. Of these, the number of districts with 11-100 cases has gone up from 81 to 116; and those with over 100 cases has doubled from five to 10 districts. In the same period, the number of districts with up to 10 cases has increased from 199 to 228.Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus pandemicThe 70 new districts where COVID-19 cases have been reported are spread across 17 states: Uttar Pradesh (13 new districts), Punjab (8), Maharashtra (7), Rajasthan (6), Telangana (6), Gujarat (5) and Haryana (5) are among the states where at least five new districts have been affected.At Prime Minister Narendra Modis video conference with chief ministers on Saturday, several states had pushed for resumption of some economic activities in regions with no COVID-19 cases. Some like Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh), Pinarayi Vijayan (Kerala) and YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy (Andhra Pradesh) had sought the freedom and authority to decide and allow economic activities, be it farming or industry.In BJP-ruled Haryana, where the number of affected districts has increased from 12 to 17 over the past week, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has already announced that the state will be divided into three zones, on the basis of the number of cases, indicating that restrictions will be eased in the less-affected areas.West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab, Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka have already announced extension till April 30 in a bid to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. (Express photo: Prashant Nadkar) West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab, Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka have already announced extension till April 30 in a bid to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. (Express photo: Prashant Nadkar)After the three-week lockdown is over (on April 14), it is clear that some things will have to be done. Production will have to open enough to maintain supply of essential goods. There are also thoughts on allowing relaxations in the very safe areas. But if that is done, the onus of identifying those areas will be on the states, because they are the ones doing the containment on the ground, and they know which are those areas. Also, the numbers and spread are changing every day; more than a top-down effort is required (so) that the states are given more room, said a top government source.Read | Three weeks and counting: Stranded and hungry at shut gatewayThere is a sense in the government that giving states more room may not actually make a big difference on the ground as no state, at this point, can afford to opt for a thoughtless relaxation and then bear the burden of a spike in cases.Mumbai Police gets vigilant after Dharavi became a hotspot after cases surged in the area.

The Home Ministry has already issued directions to allow goods movement, regardless of whether they are covered in the essential list or not.Any substantive change in terms of allowing people to move around does not seem to be a good idea at this time.

(Photo: Anju Agnihotri Chaba) A labourer spreads a farmers maize produce at a mandi. (Photo: Anju Agnihotri Chaba)At a time when the Punjab government is pushing for crop diversification and bring the farmers out of the paddy-wheat cycle, its own agencies have failed those who took to farming sunflowers and maize with farmers being forced to sell the oilseed at rates that are upto 30 per cent less than the promised Minimum Support Price (MSP). Maize too is being procured by private traders, sometimes, at half the MSP announced.The Centre had recently announced the enhanced MSP for 24 summer/Kharif crops, including that of sunflower and maize. For the oilseed, it announced MSP of Rs 5885 per quintal, an increase of Rs 235 over last years rates, while MSP for maize was hiked by Rs 90 and was fixed at Rs 1850 per quintal. The MSP was recommended by the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).Narinder Singh, a farmer from Agol village in Patialas Nabha, has grown maize and sunflower on 50 acres of land. He has already sold a major part of his produce. I got Rs 4,000 per quintal for the sunflower, which Rs 1885 or more than 32 per cent less that the promised MSP. For maize, I got between Rs 850 to Rs 1,100 per quintal, which is also 40 to 55 per cent less than the MSP, he said.Farmers have cultivated sunflower and maize, both spring season crops, on nearly 35 per cent of the agricultural land at his village, said Narinder Singh, asking, How will a farmer not fall in the debt trap if he is not offered the justified price for his produce?.Nirbhair Singh of Fatehpur village, also in Patiala, too got the same price for his maize crop, which he had taken to the mandi Friday.As per the farmers, the government agencies only procure paddy and wheat at the MSP. Punjab government has six grain procurement agencies but none of them entered the market to purchase oilseeds, maize or pulses at the MSP in the past over a decade.These crops are purchased by the private players who decide the rates depending on the produce quality. Farmers in the Doaba region, where over 20,000 hectare area is dedicated to the spring maize, said private players are paying low prices for the produce citing high moisture in the crop.I took my maize crop harvested from 10 acres of land to the mandi. The arhtiya (commission agent) told me that he will not pay me more than Rs 900 per quintal saying that my produce was not dry enough. The rate is less than half the MSP that was announced by the government, said Amrik Singh, a farmer from Alawalpur village.Amrik Singh said he had no option but to sell the produce at a loss because government never steps in to procure maize crop.Faced with a massive groundwater crisis, the Punjab government has increasingly focused on crop diversification, especially as move away from the water-guzzling paddy. Last year, the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana had pushed to strengthen maize as the closest alternative to the paddy by narrowing the gap in economic returns between the two crops. On paper, the move looked good, but the ground reality speaks for itself.Recent inclement weather affected tye sunflower crop bringing down its yield from an evarage of 8-10 quintals per acre to 6-7 quintals. It is a double whammy for us. First, the yield went down and now the rates being offered are so less that after deducting the input cost, farmers are not making more than Rs. 8,000-10,000 per acre from sunflowers, a three-month crop, said Chamkour Singh, a farmer.As per the farmers, they invest minimum Rs 10,000 per acre to grow maize and Rs 6,000 to 7,000 per acre for sunflower. This excludes the cost of labour put in by the family members, which as as per the recommendations of MS Swaminathan report, should be included. Going by this rate and yield they are earning Rs 15,000 to 18,000 per acre from sunflower and Rs 20,000 to 25,000 from maize, instead of nearly Rs 50,000 and Rs 60,000 that they should get for the two crops if procured at the MSP, respectively. The average yield of spring maize yield is between 35 to 45 quintals per acre.There is no point in announcing the MSP every year when the government is not going to procure the produce. Leave alone procuring the produce, the government has not even regulated the market so that the farmers could get rates that are close to the MSP, said Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Ekta, Dakaunda general secretary Jagmohan Singh.The BKU leader also termed as rubbing salt on the wounds of farmers the recent statement of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari where he said that the MSP in India is higher than market and international price because of which there is an excess production of wheat, rice and sugar.Gadkari, addressing a webinar, while terming the excessive production of wheat and rice a major problem, had also called for changing crop patterns in states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Jagmohan Singh said the Centre and the State should pay the difference of the rate at a time when the farmers are getting less than the MSP announced by the government itself.Director, Punjab Agriculture Department, Dr Sutantra Kumar Airi while advocating that the crops such as maize and sunflower should be procured at the MSP, said that the Centre should should help the state government by releasing grant to pay the difference.

India is the world's second-largest producer and consumer of wheat behind China.For Sukrampal, the matter is urgent. He risks spoiling the whole lot if he does not move his produce within the next few days, before the next round of wet weather, as he struggles to keep the moisture content in the wheat below 13% to 14%. Above that, grain is less attractive to buyers and will fetch a lower price. If it gets too wet, it will be worthless.The lockdown has severely hit India's more than 7,000 wholesale food markets, which are the only channel for getting food supplies to India's 1.3 billion inhabitants.""Nearly 90% of labourers aren't around. Last season, there were about 5,000 labourers, and this season there are only 500,"" said Radhe Shyam, a commission agent at the Gharaunda Grains Market. ""We haven't seen anything like this before.""farmerIndia's wheat farmers sell their grain exclusively by law at these wholesale markets to commission agents, which sell it on to state buyers and private traders. The commission agents usually employ armies of labourers to unload, clean, weigh, pack and re-load millions of wheat sacks onto tractor trolleys that then ferry it to government and private warehouses.This year, those bustling bourses have emptied, severing the food supply chain in the world's second-most populous country and slashing earnings for millions of migrant labourers who have had to sit out one of the most lucrative periods on the crop calendar when they normally would make up to half their annual income.STAGGERED SALESTo accommodate the dearth of workers, marketing agents have been forced to stretch out their wheat procurement period from the usual 20 to 30 days to more than two and a half months.That has cut the daily flow of farmers bringing crops to wholesale markets to about a tenth of normal, commission agents said, raising the risk of spoilage.It also means delayed payments for growers, who say that will stop them from buying seeds and fertilizers for the next planting window that begins in June.Restrictions on movement have also delayed purchases by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) - India's state grain stockpiler and top buyer - and kept private traders away altogether, causing a purchasing bottleneck.That is generating an ever-growing pile of unsold, poorly stored grain that will spoil quickly.At 106.21 million tonnes, this year's Indian winter wheat crop is second only to China's projected 133.5 million-tonne wheat haul in 2019-2020, which is split between spring and winter wheat varieties and is gathered in two separate harvests.India's growers are ill-equipped to hold on to such volumes for long, as unlike their western peers most have no on-site storage facilities.""We don't have any means to store wheat. After a recent spell of rains and hails, I'm worried about the quality of my crop,"" said Sukrampal, who has left a pile of wheat in the open air on his five-acre plot.Nearly 85% of India's farmers own less than five acres of land, so even relatively small crop losses, or any delay in payments, can affect their livelihoods.In addition, farmers say this year's staggered sales schedule to marketing agents means they will have difficulties repaying bank loans, which are also due at this time of year and tied to the annual preparations for summer sowing.LOST LABOURLast month, in the Karnal district of Haryana, Reuters witnessed three wholesale markets which appeared almost deserted because of the absence of migrant workers, who come mainly from poverty-stricken states such as Bihar and Jharkhand in India's east. But the lockdown, which took effect from March 25, prevented them from making their annual trips to the Haryana-Punjab wheat belt for harvest.Migrant workers can earn about half their annual income of roughly 30,000 rupees ($394.72) during the wheat harvest, which normally tides them over until they return to the crop belts for the rice harvest in October, commission agents and market officials say.Missing out on that payday means rural spending will likely dip in the coming months.""Since there's hardly any sale, I've started working as a labourer to compensate for my losses,"" said Rakesh Kumar, a tea stall owner at a grains market.BUYER BREAKDOWNWith private traders largely absent from the market due to the lockdown, industry experts say they expect the FCI to buy a large proportion of the wheat crop, adding to India's already-bloated multi-billion dollar food subsidy spending.The FCI is already saddled with massive crop mounds from last season and will not have enough room to store much new season wheat, according to industry experts. That raises the prospect of rotting crops even as thousands die from malnutrition-related illnesses each year in India.Wheat stocks at FCI warehouses on April 1, when the new marketing year began, totalled 24.7 million tonnes, according to government data, more than three times the government-fixed target, and roughly a quarter of India's annual demand.The FCI buys wheat from farmers at a guaranteed price to give them an assured return and meet any shortfall due to unfavourable weather conditions.If the FCI ends up buying more than 37 to 40 million tonnes of wheat this year, its granaries will overflow by June, said Amit Takkar, chief of brokerage Conifer Commodities.The government will struggle to export much of that, as the fixed domestic prices have pushed Indian wheat prices about $35 a tonne above the world market, according to industry experts.","late last month, sukrampal had to beg and borrow farmhands from nearby villages to gather his part of the country's largest-ever wheat harvest in haryana state near new delhi.now the 50-year-old indian farmer has a bigger problem: how to sell his crops when the three wholesale grain markets serving growers in his hometown of gharaunda, near the heart of what is known as india's breadbasket, are operating with a skeleton staff.the country-wide lockdown, introduced in late march to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, has led to a labour shortage across rural india, crimping the harvest and preventing the bagging and movement of it.the largest crop gathered globally during the pandemic, which is worth more than $26 billion (21.3 billion pounds), according to traders, may serve as a test case for other harvests coming up around the world, including brazil's main sugarcane and coffee harvests and southeast asia's second rice harvests. india is the world's second-largest producer and consumer of wheat behind china.for sukrampal, the matter is urgent. he risks spoiling the whole lot if he does not move his produce within the next few days, before the next round of wet weather, as he struggles to keep the moisture content in the wheat below 13% to 14%. above that, grain is less attractive to buyers and will fetch a lower price. if it gets too wet, it will be worthless.the lockdown has severely hit india's more than 7,000 wholesale food markets, which are the only channel for getting food supplies to india's 1.3 billion inhabitants.""nearly 90% of labourers aren't around. last season, there were about 5,000 labourers, and this season there are only 500,"" said radhe shyam, a commission agent at the gharaunda grains market.

After a recent spell of rains and hails, I'm worried about the quality of my crop,"" said Sukrampal, who has left a pile of wheat in the open air on his five-acre plot.Nearly 85% of India's farmers own less than five acres of land, so even relatively small crop losses, or any delay in payments, can affect their livelihoods.In addition, farmers say this year's staggered sales schedule to marketing agents means they will have difficulties repaying bank loans, which are also due at this time of year and tied to the annual preparations for summer sowing.LOST LABOURLast month, in the Karnal district of Haryana, Reuters witnessed three wholesale markets which appeared almost deserted because of the absence of migrant workers, who come mainly from poverty-stricken states such as Bihar and Jharkhand in India's east. But the lockdown, which took effect from March 25, prevented them from making their annual trips to the Haryana-Punjab wheat belt for harvest.Migrant workers can earn about half their annual income of roughly 30,000 rupees ($394.72) during the wheat harvest, which normally tides them over until they return to the crop belts for the rice harvest in October, commission agents and market officials say.Missing out on that payday means rural spending will likely dip in the coming months.""Since there's hardly any sale, I've started working as a labourer to compensate for my losses,"" said Rakesh Kumar, a tea stall owner at a grains market.BUYER BREAKDOWNWith private traders largely absent from the market due to the lockdown, industry experts say they expect the FCI to buy a large proportion of the wheat crop, adding to India's already-bloated multi-billion dollar food subsidy spending.The FCI is already saddled with massive crop mounds from last season and will not have enough room to store much new season wheat, according to industry experts. That raises the prospect of rotting crops even as thousands die from malnutrition-related illnesses each year in India.Wheat stocks at FCI warehouses on April 1, when the new marketing year began, totalled 24.7 million tonnes, according to government data, more than three times the government-fixed target, and roughly a quarter of India's annual demand.The FCI buys wheat from farmers at a guaranteed price to give them an assured return and meet any shortfall due to unfavourable weather conditions.If the FCI ends up buying more than 37 to 40 million tonnes of wheat this year, its granaries will overflow by June, said Amit Takkar, chief of brokerage Conifer Commodities.The government will struggle to export much of that, as the fixed domestic prices have pushed Indian wheat prices about $35 a tonne above the world market, according to industry experts.","late last month, sukrampal had to beg and borrow farmhands from nearby villages to gather his part of the country's largest-ever wheat harvest in haryana.now the 50-year-old indian farmer has a bigger problem: how to sell his crops when the three wholesale grain markets serving growers in his hometown of gharaunda, near the heart of what is known as india's breadbasket, are operating with a skeleton staff.the country-wide lockdown, introduced in late march to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, has led to a labour shortage across rural india, crimping the harvest and preventing the bagging and movement of it.the largest crop gathered globally during the pandemic, which is worth more than $26 billion, according to traders, may serve as a test case for other harvests coming up around the world, including brazil's main sugarcane and coffee harvests and southeast asia's second rice harvests. india is the world's second-largest producer and consumer of wheat behind china.for sukrampal, the matter is urgent. he risks spoiling the whole lot if he does not move his produce within the next few days, before the next round of wet weather, as he struggles to keep the moisture content in the wheat below 13% to 14%. above that, grain is less attractive to buyers and will fetch a lower price. if it gets too wet, it will be worthless.the lockdown has severely hit india's more than 7,000 wholesale food markets, which are the only channel for getting food supplies to india's 1.3 billion inhabitants.""nearly 90% of labourers aren't around. last season, there were about 5,000 labourers, and this season there are only 500,"" said radhe shyam, a commission agent at the gharaunda grains market.

About 30-40 feet away from Rudri, Maulik who weighed a hefty 164 kg, was unable to climb the slope of the hill quickly enough to rescue and comfort her. Spurred by the incident, in which his eight-yearold daughter escaped injuring her eye, Maulik resolved to get in shape as soon as the family returned toOn May 23 this year, on the birthday of his twin daughters Rudri and Rutu, Maulik gave them the best gift of their life  a leaner and healthier papa at 90-kg weight.Till Class 10, Maulik ate only home-cooked food. In Class 10, he started getting pocket money which he usually spent on sandwiches available outside his tuition class. Gradually, he developed a taste for dosa, pizza, Punjabi food, bhaji-pav etc. By the time he came to college, he already weighed 120 kg.Once he entered into professional life, his appetite for outside food increased. In 2002, his sister-in-law introduced him to her cousin Neha, who was well-endowed physically but not obese like him. The courtship lasted more than a year and they got married in 2003.Marital bliss and success in the transport business only added to his weight.Talking to Mirror, he said, All the waiters in different restaurants of the city and vendors at Manek Chowk know me because I am a frequent visitor. At some places I dont even have to place any order. The food arrives after I sit down at the table. Such was my affinity for outside food. Maulik even tried joining the gym on two occasions but gave up midway.The Shah family went to Ooty in November last year. While visiting the Shooting Point over there, which is photographers delight, Rudri slipped and got entangled in the spikes of a fence along the route. Maulik, who was further down the slope from her, could not run quickly enough to reach a bleeding Rudri. He even had difficulty in lifting and taking her to a dispensary. The incident opened his eyes and he resolved to shed weight.Maulik said, Upon returning to ourhome, I started researching on the subject of weight loss. I decided to do it on my own without joining any gym, going foror trying fad medicines. I consulted my friends before embarking on a regimen.Explaining how he did it, Maulik said, I realised my body needed only 1,500 calories per day. All I needed to do was increase my calorie output (by exercising) and reduce intake (by controlled diet).On the first day, he walked three km and his entire body became sore.It seemed I had walked 100 km. Gradually, my stamina started to build up and I increased my capacity to walk. Today, I walk 18- 20 km per day without losing breath, he said.Maulik prepared a diet chart which would not exhaust him by the end of day. He started taking a bowl of sprouts and a glass of milk for breakfast.His lunch comprised boiled daal, low-oil or boiled sabji and buttermilk. He avoided fried and spicy food and moderated his portions at weddings and social dos.For dinner, he depended on sprouts and avoided oil-laden Gujarati curries, bhakriand puri.A weight-reduction regimen, without diet control, can prove to be an uphill task. In most cases, it is not successful. The trick is to reduce calories to 1,500 per day and increase physical exertion gradually to burn more calories than consumed. One size does not fit all. So, anyone planning to reduce weight should chart their own course keeping their comfort in mind, he said.Today, Maulik satisfies his taste buds once or twice a month while strictly adhering to diet and exercise plan. He has also started doing weight exercises to improve his muscle mass. I had to change my entire wardrobe. The old clothes do not fit me anymore.

2020-06-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/the-taste-with-vir-go-manchurian-go/story-do7ZTLzu4D7NXOnJxDmMPJ.html,The Taste With Vir:&thinsp;Go Manchurian Go,"more-lifestyleUpdated: Jun 19, 2020 11:37 ISTI am sure you are familiar with the golden words of the Minister for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale. My suggestion is that restaurants and hotels that sell Chinese food should be shut down. I also request those who eat Chinese food to stop eating at them, boycott them. Warming to his theme, the Union Minister added, My request is that everyone should stop eating Chinese food. All the states must give an order to ban Chinese restaurants and hotels.My first thought when I read the Honourable Ministers statements was that he should not be using food to promote hatred among communities. The community that had invented these dishes would now be the subject of public ire and anger.I refer, of course, to Punjabis.As we all know, the Chinese food served at restaurants in India (the ones Mr. Athawale would have shut down) is not even remotely Chinese. No Chinese person would recognize it as Chinese.When you tell the Chinese about Chicken Manchurian, they wonder if it is a cousin of Chicken Makhani. If you make them taste our desi Chow Mein, they are puzzled. And if you served them Chicken Lollipops, they would probably scream in terror and run out of the room.Almost all of these dishes were created in the late 1970s and the 1980s and most were invented by Punjabis who still own a majority of North Indias Chinese restaurants.In fact, just as Peking Duck comes from Peking (Beijing now), our Chinese food also has a capital.Ludhiana.Long ago, I called the cuisine Sino-Ludhianvi, because of the Punjabi influence in the food, and the name has stuck. An alternative name is Chinjabi, combining Chinese and Punjabi. Nobody at any Sino-Ludhianvi restaurant pretends that the food is authentically Chinese.We have got to the stage where we proudly claim it as a cuisine of Indian origin. We are no longer apologetic about it and we regard it as a matter of pride that thelawalas and small, unpretentious dhabha-type restaurants offer Fried Rice or noodles on their menus.When an Indian sees Chinese Dosa on a menu, he is no longer very surprised and knows what to expect: a filling that includes noodles, chilli and soya, usually. Same with Chinese Pizza. And how about Chinese Bhel?The problem with ministers is that they dont get out much. So Mr. Athawale probably has no idea of how many street vendors and small restaurateurs, most of whom are broke anyway because of the lockdown, will be completely ruined and be thrown out on the streets along with their families, if his nasty little advice is taken.Is this the kind of social justice his ministry advocates?It may be wrong to generalise about government policy as a whole on the basis of what one minister says. After all, Mr. Athawale is the chap who kept shouting Go Corona Go way back in February. At first I thought it was some kind of rah-rah sports cheer (Go India Go!) meant to encourage the virus. But later it was explained to me that it meant that the virus should leave India.But presumably, the virus misunderstood the cheer too because in the four months since the minister shouted his little slogan, Corona has not only made itself at home in India but has been emboldened enough to spread to every corner of our country.That ultimately, is the danger with every ministerial remark, no matter how silly it may seem at first.It can always be misunderstood.A campaign against Chinese restaurants can soon be twisted to target anyone who looks Chinese to the mob. That includes the many Nepalis who slave in the kitchens of Indian Chinese restaurants and the North Easterners who often work in the front of the house.Our record in these matters is not very good. During the 1962 war with China, Chinese restaurants were attacked by violent mobs. The Indian Chinese community was targeted and many were detained though they had Indian passports, had lived in India for decades and hated the Communist regime in Peking as much as we did.It got to the stage where the Japanese embassy had to paint signs declaring that Japan and India were friends on the sides of its cars to avoid attacks from mobs who could not tell the difference between the Chinese and Japanese.In those days, India was much less of a melting pot than it is today. Cities and towns tended to be dominated by one community. There were not so many Nepalis. The people of the North East had not yet spread out beyond their own region. And yet, there was so much unpleasantness and violence.Think what a campaign against Chinese restaurants would do today. It wouldnt affect the Chinese at all. I dont think a single Indian Chinese restaurant is owned by anybody from the PRC; they dont even identify with the food and would refuse to eat it.The campaign would harm Indians and turn us against each other. It would be predicated on the ignorant notion that Chinese food in India has something to do with the PRC or mainland China, when any moderately intelligent person could have explained the reality to the minister.And where would it end? If Chinese restaurants are to be boycotted what about the Chinese food we make at home. Would we have to abandon that too? For years, we have been told that the instant noodles we all make at home are Chinese. Do we boycott them too?Do we stop frying left over rice? Are momos Chinese? (The Chinese would argue that they are because Tibet has now been annexed by the PRC.)In fact, the origins of food are too complex for the tiny brains of some politicians. The so-called Chinese instant noodles we make are not Chinese at all. The best known brand in India, Maggi, is owned by Nestle, a Swiss multinational. The technology is Japanese --- instant noodles were invented by a man called Momofuku Ando. And the flavourings we use are often Indian masalas.So it is with momos. They are of Tibetan origin. They were given a makeover by the Nepalis and have now been adapted all over the East. It started with Darjeeling and Kalimpong but now most North Eastern states have their own kinds of momos.And how far do you take food boycotts anyway? The Chinese conflict had been simmering for months, after the Chinese came and occupied our territory. The government denied the intrusion till a violent clash erupted.Nepal has now also claimed a part of Indian territory. If that situation escalates, are we going to call for a boycott of all Nepalis working in the food sector? Mr. Athawales logic suggests we should.I am not against the idea of boycotts. For many years I did not touch anything made in South Africa or Rhodesia because of my objections to their racial policies. I broke with the liberal consensus to support a sporting boycott of Pakistan when tensions were high. And, if I can be persuaded that a boycott of Chinese goods would harm China and help India, I would support that too.But there is an important difference. You can boycott goods or sporting events. But once you start boycotting people and extend the boycott to the insides of your own country, you are treading on dangerous ground.Assume for a moment that our Chinese restaurants served real Chinese food and not a Punjabi version. Would I support a boycott? No, I wouldnt because it would do China no harm and would hurt lakhs of Indians who were employed by Chinese restaurants or who supplied the products that the kitchen used. And thats even before considering the social consequences this would entail in a multi-ethnic country like ours.Mr. Athawales call for a boycott of Chinese restaurants demonstrates all the subtle and sophisticated thinking that went into his unintentionally encouraging cheer of Go Corona Go. It makes no sense because Indian Chinese food is not Chinese, anyway. But it fails also because it would end up doing no harm to China at all. Instead it would tear apart the lives of lakhs of Indians.Follow his advice and you do Chinas work.

they dont even identify with the food and would refuse to eat it.the campaign would harm indians and turn us against each other. it would be predicated on the ignorant notion that chinese food in india has something to do with the prc or mainland china, when any moderately intelligent person could have explained the reality to the minister.and where would it end? if chinese restaurants are to be boycotted what about the chinese food we make at home. would we have to abandon that too? for years, we have been told that the instant noodles we all make at home are chinese. do we boycott them too?do we stop frying left over rice? are momos chinese?

(Representational) The plantation of Basmati is about to start in both Punjab and Haryana states. (Representational)Basmati exporters in the country have started reaping a rich dividends with the rate of the crop going up by 15 to 20 per cent recently. Good demand for Basmati from the Middle East has also led to the rates surging suddenly.The rate of the crop has increased post lockdown as a single container which was being exported at the rate of Rs 10 to 11 lakh during the lockdown period, now it is being exported art the rate of Rs. 12-13 lakh, said Arvinder Pal Singh, president of PRMEA (Punjab Rice Millers Exporters Association), adding that several new orders are also coming, but due to shortage of labour the exporters are even struggling to meet old orders first.If the export to Iran, which is the major importer of Indian Basmati, was less this year, it has been compensated by Iraq and Saudi Arabia, said, exporters.Due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, several Basmati importing countries have been placing more orders so as to keep some food buffer in their respective countries due to which the rates are going up, said Vijay Setia, former president of the All India Rice Exporters Association, one of the leading exporter himself.A container carries around 20 tonnes (20,000 kg) of Basmati rice as these containers are sent to destination countries from India in the ships.The labour is required to empty the containers, which brings imported items and take export materials and loading the export material in it. Also, the labour is required for unloading the export material from the trucks which carry material to the ports from various states.But due to returning of a large number of labourers to their respective home states the Basmati export also facing the heat of labour shortage, said Nathi Ram Gupta, president of All India Rice Exporters Association.Earlier there was not much shortage of the labourers at the port during the lockdown period even, but when the Special Shramik trains were launched in the month of May to send the labourers back to their respective home states, the labour strength came down to half, said Ashok Sethi, Director, PRMEA.Due to good demand from the import countries even Basmati varieties with depressed rates since the beginning of this year, have also seen an increase of 20 to 25 per cent in the past few weeks.Setia said: India has been exporting 44 lakh tonnes of Basmati annually and on an average 3.75 lakh tonnes of rice is exported from here. Due to shortage of labour at the ports, the export has also been taking place at a bit slower pace because labour strength has gone down but now they are coming back and nearly 70 to 75 per cent labour is available now.He added: Rates have gone up and even 1401 variety which was quite depressed this year has seen 20 per cent increase in rates.India has been exporting Basmati to 80-90 countries including EU, USA, Middle East, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.Punjab and Haryana states are the major Basmati growers and exporters and both the states have been a share of around 80 per cent of the total export of Basmati crop from India. Punjab alone grows over 20 lakh tonnes of Basmati every year out of which major portion is exported.Meanwhile, the farmers had sold the Basmati varieties at the rate of Rs 2,500 to 3,300 per quintal last year and going by this years export rate the area under the crop would certainly increase. The plantation of Basmati is about to start in both Punjab and Haryana states. Punjab has fixed a target of bringing around 7-Lakh hectares under Basmati crop this year against 6.29 Lakh hectares last year. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

It will be declared after the rainfall between 8.30 am Wednesday and 8:30 am Thursday is measured.On Wednesday, Delhis Safdarjung Observatory had received 14.6 mm of rain, which is in the moderate category.Monsoon has reached Delhi-NCR. It has already covered several parts of western Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday night. We will officially declare monsoon over Delhi on Thursday based on rainfall data collected from 8.30 am on Wednesday to 8.30 am on Thursday, said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of Indias annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people in India are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.In the past 20 years, the monsoon has arrived earlier in the capital than its expected date five times. In 2001, it arrived on June 24; in 2008 on June 15 ; in 2011 on June 26 ; in 2013 on June 16 and in 2015 on June 25 .The normal arrival date of the monsoon over Delhi is June 27. It was June 29 until last year but was revised by the IMD this year based on monsoon data from 1961 to 2019.Till last year, historical rainfall data from 1901-1940 from 149 weather stations was considered for calculating the monsoon arrival and withdrawal dates. New monsoon onset and withdrawal dates were announced by IMD in April as the old dates did not represent the actual monsoon trends.We are expecting very good rains over north-west India this monsoon. Monsoon is setting in in Delhi, but it can be declared on Thursday after collating the 24-hour rainfall data, said Mrutunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.IMD, in its long-range monsoon forecast, has predicted good rains in north-west India this monsoon at 107% of the long-period average (LPA) of 61.5 cm.LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010.In recent decades our data has shown that monsoon arrives earlier than normal in many parts of northwest India. Monsoon is also covering the entire country by July 8 compared to July 15 considered to be normal earlier. But monsoon arrival is slightly delayed in some parts of central India in recent years. Based on all these trends we have released new onset and withdrawal dates this year, said D S Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune. This year, however, monsoon progression is near normal in almost all parts of the country, he added.A trough of low pressure is running from northwest Rajasthan to south Bihar at lower tropospheric levels. It is very likely to be close to the Himalayan foothills from Thursday onwards.Hence, conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into some more parts of Rajasthan, remaining parts of Uttar Pradesh, entire Chandigarh and Delhi, most parts of Haryana and Punjab during next 24 hours, IMD said in its bulletin on Wednesday.","indiaupdated: jun 25, 2020 04:34 istthe south-west monsoon arrived in the delhi-national capital region (ncr) on wednesday, marking only thesixth early onsetof the season in 20 years, heralding an intense spell of rain in the next couple of days and, in the medium term, holding out the promise of a bountiful summer harvest.weather scientists held off on a declaration of the monsoon in the capital until thursday because there had been no rain until 8:30 am on wednesday, the threshold time for measurement of the precipitation. it will be declared after the rainfall between 8.30 am wednesday and 8:30 am thursday is measured.on wednesday, delhis safdarjung observatory had received 14.6 mm of rain, which is in the moderate category.monsoon has reached delhi-ncr. it has already covered several parts of western uttar pradesh on tuesday night. we will officially declare monsoon over delhi on thursday based on rainfall data collected from 8.30 am on wednesday to 8.30 am on thursday, said kuldeep shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre of the india meteorological department (imd).a good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of indias annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people in india are dependent for a livelihood. the monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.in the past 20 years, the monsoon has arrived earlier in the capital than its expected date five times. in 2001, it arrived on june 24; in 2008 on june 15 ; in 2011 on june 26 ; in 2013 on june 16 and in 2015 on june 25 .the normal arrival date of the monsoon over delhi is june 27. it was june 29 until last year but was revised by the imd this year based on monsoon data from 1961 to 2019.till last year, historical rainfall data from 1901-1940 from 149 weather stations was considered for calculating the monsoon arrival and withdrawal dates. new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates were announced by imd in april as the old dates did not represent the actual monsoon trends.we are expecting very good rains over north-west india this monsoon. monsoon is setting in in delhi, but it can be declared on thursday after collating the 24-hour rainfall data, said mrutunjay mohapatra, director general, imd.imd, in its long-range monsoon forecast, has predicted good rains in north-west india this monsoon at 107% of the long-period average (lpa) of 61.5 cm.lpa is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010.in recent decades our data has shown that monsoon arrives earlier than normal in many parts of northwest india. monsoon is also covering the entire country by july 8 compared to july 15 considered to be normal earlier. but monsoon arrival is slightly delayed in some parts of central india in recent years. based on all these trends we have released new onset and withdrawal dates this year, said d s pai, senior scientist at imd pune. this year, however, monsoon progression is near normal in almost all parts of the country, he added.a trough of low pressure is running from northwest rajasthan to south bihar at lower tropospheric levels. it is very likely to be close to the himalayan foothills from thursday onwards.hence, conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into some more parts of rajasthan, remaining parts of uttar pradesh, entire chandigarh and delhi, most parts of haryana and punjab during next 24 hours, imd said in its bulletin on wednesday."

Sitting in buildings, they don't allow for touching bamboos for cutting for 25 years,"" Gadkari said, speaking at an online seminar organized by Konkan Bamboo and Cane Development Center.Recounting his interactions with the officials, Gadkari said he once asked someone if bamboo is a tree or a grass.When told that it is the latter, he sought to know the reasons as to why the same cannot be cut.""The attitude and approach of the forest and environment ministry is wrong. We are not able to protect the environment, nor are we able to develop the economy because of it,"" Gadkari said, stressing that he has also told Prime Minister Narendra Modi about this impediment.The Union Government in 2017 amended the Indian Forest Act through which bamboo was classified as a grass and it ceased to be a tree.However, bamboo grown in forest areas continues to be under the provision of forest laws.On the highways front, Gadkari said the ministry of environment and forests does not allow cutting of trees for road expansion activities, which acts as a disincentive for planting those.""Our people are not willing to plant trees at all. They say planting trees creates problems with the forest department. This is 'murkhata' (foolishnesss)! Once we acquire land, we plant trees and then we plan to raze those for widening, the permission should be given,"" Gadkari said.He said there is no attention paid if the land is kept barren next to the highway, but the moment bamboo or some tree is planted, it is declared as a forest which makes road widening difficult.In the comments that come amidst trouble in relations with China, Gadkari said India's northern neighbour has been able to create a success story out of bamboo and rued that we have not been able to do the same despite having the Rs 1,300-crore bamboo mission.A senior government official, however, said that despite the announcement of the mission, budgetary allocations have not been sufficient over the last three years and specified that FY2019 budget had a provision of Rs 300 crore for the mission, which halved to Rs 150 crore in FY2020 and has been brought down further to Rs 110 crore in FY2021.Gadkari conceded that efforts to popularise bamboo have not been met with the desired success, and added that the grass holds great potential for upliftment of farmers who can switch to it from a commercial perspective.He said the grass can also be helpful from a socio-economic upliftment perspective in the 115 aspirational districts of the country.Meanwhile, Gadkari reiterated that there are problems with excess foodstocks and godowns are full with stuff which will last for three years and specified that stock is lying in the open in Haryana and Punjab which risks getting rotten.The minister also reiterated his concerns with minimum support prices, stating that the prices are way above the local and international market prices in the case of wheat, sugar and rice.How many items will the government buy? Where will it store? Rather than that, we can do diversification of agriculture towards energy and power which has marketability, he said, hinting at the process of producing ethanol from food grains.","by ptimumbai: union msme minister nitin gadkari on friday said the environment and forest ministry's policies are ""outdated"" and ""should be thrown away"" as they inhibit the growth of the bamboo industry in india.gadkari, who also handles the road transport and highways portfolio, blamed the policies of the forest and environment ministry for the lack of desire among the national highways authority of india (nhai) for not planting trees along the highways because felling those for road widening becomes very difficult.""the policies of forest and environment ministry are totally outdated and should be thrown away. sitting in buildings, they don't allow for touching bamboos for cutting for 25 years,"" gadkari said, speaking at an online seminar organized by konkan bamboo and cane development center.recounting his interactions with the officials, gadkari said he once asked someone if bamboo is a tree or a grass.when told that it is the latter, he sought to know the reasons as to why the same cannot be cut.""the attitude and approach of the forest and environment ministry is wrong. we are not able to protect the environment, nor are we able to develop the economy because of it,"" gadkari said, stressing that he has also told prime minister narendra modi about this impediment.the union government in 2017 amended the indian forest act through which bamboo was classified as a grass and it ceased to be a tree.however, bamboo grown in forest areas continues to be under the provision of forest laws.on the highways front, gadkari said the ministry of environment and forests does not allow cutting of trees for road expansion activities, which acts as a disincentive for planting those.""our people are not willing to plant trees at all. they say planting trees creates problems with the forest department. this is 'murkhata' (foolishnesss)! once we acquire land, we plant trees and then we plan to raze those for widening, the permission should be given,"" gadkari said.he said there is no attention paid if the land is kept barren next to the highway, but the moment bamboo or some tree is planted, it is declared as a forest which makes road widening difficult.in the comments that come amidst trouble in relations with china, gadkari said india's northern neighbour has been able to create a success story out of bamboo and rued that we have not been able to do the same despite having the rs 1,300-crore bamboo mission.a senior government official, however, said that despite the announcement of the mission, budgetary allocations have not been sufficient over the last three years and specified that fy2019 budget had a provision of rs 300 crore for the mission, which halved to rs 150 crore in fy2020 and has been brought down further to rs 110 crore in fy2021.gadkari conceded that efforts to popularise bamboo have not been met with the desired success, and added that the grass holds great potential for upliftment of farmers who can switch to it from a commercial perspective.he said the grass can also be helpful from a socio-economic upliftment perspective in the 115 aspirational districts of the country.meanwhile, gadkari reiterated that there are problems with excess foodstocks and godowns are full with stuff which will last for three years and specified that stock is lying in the open in haryana and punjab which risks getting rotten.the minister also reiterated his concerns with minimum support prices, stating that the prices are way above the local and international market prices in the case of wheat, sugar and rice.how many items will the government buy? where will it store? rather than that, we can do diversification of agriculture towards energy and power which has marketability, he said, hinting at the process of producing ethanol from food grains."

The founder director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center (CMASC) at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana alumnus spoke to Manraj Grewal Sharma via Skype. Excerpts:Tell us a bit about your early years.I am originally from Ghariyal village in Gujjaranwala district in Pakistan. After Partition, we settled in a village near Kaithal, Haryana called Rajaund. I came to Ludhiana to study at Punjab Agricultural University, from 1959 to 1963. My family is today spread across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.Your citation says you helped 500 million small farmers.The research I did was focused on improving the soil health of small farmers, who number 500 million to 700 million. I undertook projects in Africa, Asia, South East Asia, South America  Columbia, Brazil, Thailand, Vietnam and many other countries.What would you recommend for the success of small farmers?Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh have a large number of small farmers. For one, I would urge them not to burn the crop residue. Burning of rice straw is not good for the soil, environment, or the human health.Second, all the crop residue should be returned to the soil. The soils in northern states are depleted of organic matter present in the top layer. This matter should comprise around 2-3 per cent of the top soil but in the highly depleted Indian soils, its percentage is about 0.1-0.2 per cent. We practice extractive farming, take away everything, and dont use cow dung manure.We have a rule of soil health management called the law of returns. It means whatever you take from land, you must return in some form or the other. If we remove nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic matter from it, we must return it too. Health of the soil is like the health of a human being. Soil is a bank account  you cant withdraw more than you put in. So look after your soil.Thirdly, dont use inputs such as fertilisers indiscriminately. Farmers often broadcast fertiliser in standing water in paddy fields. The temperature is high and most of this fertiliser will either volatilise, causing global warming, or leach into the ground, affecting our health. Inject fertiliser directly into the soil, dont broadcast on the surface.Fourthly, dont use top soil for brick making. The top layer of soil has been built by nature after millions of years. Sand mining is very bad for soil. Carve out specific mining sites, dont touch the rest of the land.I would also request farmers not to practice flood irrigation. Just like we cant breathe in water, nor can the organisms in the soil. Adopt drip irrigation, it saves water, and plants grow better as their roots dont get drowned. Flood irrigation must be banned.You believe soil is a living organism.Yes, soil is alive with 25 per cent of all biodiversity. Did you know that antibiotics like penicillin come from microorganisms living in the soil? But we use fertilisers and pesticides indiscriminately and the soil dies. Soil must never die. It should be protected, it should be restored. Our shastras say dharti is mata. Earth should be worshipped.Should the government help in implementing soil rights?Yes, the government should reward farmers for ecosystem services with an equivalent of $16 a year per acre. Farmers who follow good practices, grow a crop cover and let it mulch should be rewarded. Farmers not only produce healthy food but also mitigate climate change, and improve water quality.Health of the soil, plants, animals, environment and the humans is interconnected. If the soil health deteriorates, so does ours. The trinity of the air, water and soil make up the environment. Gurbani says pawan guru, paaani pita, and mata dharat mahat, but we dont practice it.What role can farmers play in mitigating climate change?Farmers are a big stakeholder in mitigating climate change. Soils are carbon sinks  if you increase the organic matter by photosynthesising CO2 from the atmosphere and build up the organic matter in India to 2 -3 per cent in the next 20-30 years, many problems related to climate change will be alleviated. A healthy soil will protect you from flooding in the monsoon and drought in the summers.Start the afforestation of the Shivaliks to replenish our rivers and groundwater besides putting an end to flooding and landslides.What are your thoughts on paddy?It should be directly seeded upland like wheat. This may bring down the yield by 5-10 per cent but farmers will save on water, puddling, and labour. There are special varieties of rice for this purpose. Also, we should find a substitute for rice in Punjab, Haryana, which are not conducive for it. Instead, grow fodder, vegetables, fruits, grapes, citrus, pistachios, almond, cotton, soyabean, chickpeas et al. Leave rice cultivation to Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and other places with humid climate.What can the govt do to discourage paddy farming and encourage other crops without an assured MSP?Instead of subsidy, pay eco-service charges to farmers who follow good practices. The government can help by setting up industries related to processing, storing and value-addition close to the fields. This will also generate employment for villagers who wont need to migrate to slums in big cities. Right now we are unable to store or process our fruits and vegetables. Prices crash and farmers dump their produce. This can be stopped. As more people get absorbed into industry, the farm unit size will also increase.Does Covid-19 present an opportunity for farming?Covid-19 has shown that nature can recover in a very short time if you stop polluting it and adopt sustainable practices. Dip in pollution has improved the quality of our air and water. Sustainable farming has a bright future, and Covid-19 has pointed a way to it.Farmers have always been used as an agent of food security. Shouldnt farmers earn for themselves?Farmers must grow things that profit them. That will improve their income. Farmers have provided food security to India, now they can look towards economic security. They should follow good agricultural practises and demand that the society compensate them. Pay them for improving water and fossil quality.Free electricity and water should be stopped. Saanjha baap na roye koyi. It is a tragedy of the common. Anything free is misused.What about corporatisation of agriculture?That is a good idea and will reduce wastage. I see so much wastage of grains in govt mandis. Minimise wastage, leave the residue in soil, promote mechanisation and improve farmer profitability. Rent machinery through cooperatives to make farming profitable.Any parting message?I feel honoured and privileged to be from India. Our mother country has many good things. The Sanskrit term vasudev kutumbakam has great significance in India. We must follow it in spirit. We must live in peace and harmony, and not discriminate against other on the basis of religion, caste, colour or creed. That is what our sacred Shastras decree. And that is how we must live.

2020-07-02,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-govt-3-lakh-hectares-diversification-6486623/,Punjab govt had targeted 3 lakh hectares for diversification,"Workers spread maize for drying at a grain market. Acres under maize in Punjab this year are among the highest in the last two decades. (Archive) Workers spread maize for drying at a grain market. Acres under maize in Punjab this year are among the highest in the last two decades. (Archive)Though spring maize (March to June) hasnt fetched good prices for farmers in the ongoing harvesting season, farmers in Punjab are still diversifying from paddy to maize (June to October) in the ongoing kharif season.Acreage under maize has already increased by 4 per cent as compared to the last kharif season while sowing is still underway and will continue till the end of this month.Acres under maize in Punjab this year are among the highest in the last two decades. Kharif season maize is always encouraged because it is one of the best alternatives to water guzzling paddy. The state government has set a target of 3 lakh hectares (LH) to be brought under maize.Last year, 1.59 LH area was under maize and this year till June 30, the total area touched over 1.65 LH  which is 6,000 hectares (14,820 acres) more than last year.In the past two decades since 2000-01, the state could touch 1.65 LH thrice in the year 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2014-15, but this year it has already gone a little above 1.65 LH, while sowing will continue all of July.We have already sown maize over 1.65 LH, which is great news for the state which has been trying hard to curtail area under paddy and diverting it to maize, cotton and Basmati crops, said Director of the state department of agriculture Dr Sutantra Kumar Airi, adding that they are hoping to inch close to their target of bringing 3 LH under maize.If the Centre supports farmers in getting the announced MSP of maize, the area under the crop will automatically increase, he added.In the ongoing spring maize harvesting season, farmers are getting Rs 700 to Rs 1,100 per quintal for their maize crop against the MSP announced by the Centre at the rate of Rs 1,850 per quintal.Hoshiarpur leads the wayCurrently, Hoshiarpur district is leading with 51,000 hectares under maize following by Ropar district with 23,000 hectares. Nawanshahr, Moga, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Bathinda, Mukatsar and Pathankot have already sown 12,000 hectares, 9,000 hectares, 8,000 hectares, 7,500 hectares, 7,400 hectares, 7,200 hectares, 6,500 hectares and 5,200 hectares respectively. The remaining 12 districts have also completed sowing between 1,600-3,000 hectares each.Kharif maize yield is almost half of the spring maize because spring maize mostly belongs to hybrid varieties, the yield of which is very high (even upto 40-50 quintals per acre). But kharif maize, which is sown during the monsoon season along with paddy, does not yield more than 25-26 quintals per acre.Farmers demand higher MSPIf the government wants us to divert from paddy to maize crop then its MSP must be higher than paddy because paddy MSP and yield both are on the higher side as compared to maize. The maize MSP is Rs 1,850 per quintal this year and the yield of maize is 25-26 quintals per acr, which is 5-7 quintals less than the paddy yield, said farmer Jugraj Singh of Madaran village, who cultivates both paddy and maize on around 100 acres.Punjab Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said it would be a great achievement of the department if it hits the target of area under maize or even comes close to it because more area under maize means less area under paddy. Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) is another achievement of the department under which highest-ever area was dedicated this year, added Pannu.Going by the data sourced from the Punjab Agriculture department, barring the above mentioned five years, in the remaining 15 years since 2000-01 to date, the area under maize was recorded at 1.52 LH in 2003, 1.54 LH (2004), 1.54 LH (2005), 1.51 LH (2006), 1.54 LH (2007), 1.54 LH (2008), 1.52 LH (2009), 1.40 LH (2010), 1.34 LH (2012), 1.34 LH (2013), 1.29 LH (2014), 1.30 LH (2015), 1.16 LH (2016), 1.23 LH (2017) and 1.09 LH (2018).Under the new diversification policy which was launched in 2013 for kharif season, the then SAD-BJP Punjab government had envisioned to bring around 5.50 LH under maize by 2017 across the state by decreasing paddy area from 30 LH to 25-26 LH including Basmati on around 7-8 LH. However, the maximum area under crop could be witnessed after this policy only in 2014-15, when 1.65 LH was brought under it otherwise there was continuously declined till 2019 when maize acreage was recorded 1.59 LH.Farmers go for paddy just because of its assured market and if the same happens with maize crop, farmers will automatically adopt it as no one wants to play with groundwater, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakuanda, adding that one can see the fate of spring maize which is being sold at a throwaway price.

Bharta with Ghee Roti.Im completely cosmo, declares Ms Adiraju, 36. The ladys a practising Muslim married to a practising Hindu. Shes from Gujarat, hes from Andhra Pradesh. They both live in Gurugram, in a lovely sunlit third-floor apartment on Sohna Road, with their two young daughters.My lifes a mix of many cultures, traditions and yes, cuisines, states Ms Adiraju. Speaking on WhatsApp video, she has sportingly agreed to cook a dish from her native Kutch region. You wont find Kutchi Dabeli in Delhi-Gurgaon, she informs.This sandwich-like dish is one of Ms Adirajus few links to her ancestral land. She no longer has close relatives in Kutch, and hasnt visited her village, Mandavi in Bhuj, for the past six years.Her true homeland actually is her birthplace, Mumbai. There she spent the first 25 years of her life. A dweller in the Delhi region for three years, Ms Adiraju has by now gained enough experience of both the cities to conclude that Bombay is far more cosmopolitan than Delhi. Looking back at her childhood spent with parents and siblings, she recalls the cosmo character of her Navi Mumbai neighbourhood. One friend was from Bhav Nagar in Gujarat, one was from Kasaragod in Kerala, and one was from Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh. Neighbours included a Sindhi as well as a Punjabi family. My Muslim parents are very liberal and we would celebrate both Muslim and Hindu festivals.Indeed, some of the go-to places Ms Adiraju visits every time she is in Mumbai include the trio of Haji Ali Sufi shrine in Worli, Siddhivinayak Mandir in Prabha Devi, and Mahalakshmi Temple on Bhulabai Desai Road.Sadly, Ms Adirajus dining table has strayed far from her origins. The Kutchi cuisine has a negligible presence in her present. One of the reasons is that Kutch is an arid region, and its cuisine consists of a great variety of grains and less of vegetables. In Gurugram, Ms Adiraju can get all the veggies, but she rarely gets access to the diversity of grains. In fact, she was originally planning to cook Khichdaa kind of Kutchi Khichdi made with six kinds of grainsbut couldnt get hold of Ghau Na Fada (broken wheat).Following her marriage to a Telugu man in 2008, whom she first met in her then office in Mumbai (I was in logistics and he was in products), she swiftly expanded her cooking cosmopolitanism, and learnt vegetarian Andhra cuisine from mother-in-law, Nagaratnam, in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. In fact, the lunch she rustles out every day at her home is essentially an assortment of spicy Andhra Pachadis and Kuras. Just last week one of her typical meals consisted of Palak Pappu (arhar dal cooked with spinach), Potlakaya (fried snakegourd) and Annam (white rice)you can see it on her Insta.Though this food instagrammar has never posted anything (yet) on the Kutch dish she is cooking today, it is very close to her heart. During her childhood, Ms Adirajus mother, Saira Mukadam, would make Kutchi Dabeli as an evening snack on Saturday evenings. The family would sit around the dining table, and Mummy would give each of us three kids a bowl of Doodhchai with a plate of Dabeli.This afternoon, however, Ms Adiraju is serving this snack as part of lunch to husband, Venkat, and girls, Anitra and Aahana. The photos were taken through the phone screen that connected her to this reporter.

Nothing can beat wandering off the beaten path and enjoying the many small things that make any journey memorable. Heres what six Btown actors have to say of their vacation wheels:Scottish surpriseManasi Joshi RoyScotland, 2011, 7 daysThe sound of bagpipe amid scenic beauty of Scottish highlands was sheer bliss for the RoysRohit (Roy, husband and actor) and I have done many road trips, but the one from Edinburgh to Glasgow is etched in our memories. Every night wed stop at charming little bed and breakfasts and then drive through the day. As we drove, we saw the topography change. We drove up Ratagan Pass to see Five Sisters of Kintail mountain range and spotted a man dressed in the traditional Scots costume, playing the bagpipes. We had to stop!Bad weather in the Scottish Highlands led us to discover the loveliest restaurant on the Loch LochyOne day, when the weather was pretty bad (in the Highlands, it rains 250 days out of 365), we were driving to the Island of Skye and spotted a charming lodge. Rohit insisted we stop and we were so glad we did. It had the loveliest restaurant on the Loch Lochy, serving excellent Scottish cuisine. Aah, the joy of a good, hot meal on a rainy day, gazing at a lake and mountains!Where next? We want to explore North-East India and the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to LA. The latter will happen next year, when we drop Kiara off at college.Babymoon in EuropeAshish ChowdhryItaly to Switzerland, 2008, 20 daysTo relive his childhood memories of family road trips, Ashish takes trips with his wife Samita nowSam (Samita Bangargi Chowdhry, wife) was five months pregnant; we were expecting Agastya. We were excited and I wanted to make her feel special. So, I planned a trip to Italy because she loves shopping, and Switzerland for the views and relaxation. We did Rome, Venice and so on like typical tourists and then moved to Weggis, a quaint, idyllic recreational spot on the shore of Lake Lucerne. Mark Twain called it the loveliest place he had ever visited and I second that.With my wife, five months pregnant, we found ourselves at Weggis. We later learnt Mark Twain called it the loveliest place he had visited.As a child, I travelled with my parents to Dalhousie, Dharamshala and Patnitop. I have fond memories of those road trips. Being able to do things at your own pace is what makes road trips most exciting.Where next? Whenever we can go, itll definitely be Denmark. I have already discussed our plans with my friend Satyadev Burman who lives there. We will stay with him and both our families are already looking forward to bonding over exciting road trips. Another most desired road trip is Leh-Ladakh. I would love to ride there.Northern delightsDivya DuttaChandigarh to Sanewal and Ludhiana, 2020, 3 daysDivya enjoyed the crisp, fresh air of the beautiful countryside of PunjabPunjab instantly takes you from rice and yellow mustard fields at daytime to courtyards filled with charpoys at night. It is home to people with large hearts and it was a longing to enjoy this with my pet dog Sakhi that drove me right into the heart of the state.Punjab instantly takes you from rice and yellow mustard fields at daytime to courtyards filled with charpoys at nightI explored and experienced the fields, the crisp, fresh air and the glorious countryside. Nature outspread its wonders with beautiful purple flowers and silence interrupted by birdsong. I enjoyed aloo parathas loaded with safed makhan. Absorbed entirely in rustic pleasures, we returned to Chandigarh after three days with the desire to do this again soon.Where next? I am eager to explore the route from Goa to Karnataka via the twin falls and the coastal road. I have heard the journey is beautiful and gives you captivating views of the sea from Ankola.American dreamEvelyn SharmaSan Francisco to LA, 2016, 7 daysEvelyn rented a red convertible Mustang for her road trip from San Francisco to LAI drove from San Francisco to Los Angeles with my best friend, Julie. We rented a red Mustang convertible and drove the scenic coastline through small, charming towns like Carmel Bay, stopping at all kinds of diners and cafs! The roads pleasantly soar up and the drive is exhilarating. It was amazing!Where next? Tushaan (Dr Bhindi, fiance) and I drive across Australia a lot. Considering that local tourism is picking up again, we have decided to visit the most beautiful spots across the country this year and skip overseas travel for as long as we can. Im super excited to see the Great Barrier Reef!Christmas cheerWaluscha De SousaAmsterdam, Netherlands, to Dusseldorf, Germany, 2018, 2 daysWaluscha drove around Europe to enjoy the Christmas vibeIn Europe, driving in winter, especially during the Christmas season is the most beautiful road trip you can do. Everything is beautiful, decorated, festive and lit up with Christmas trees. We decided to go to Germanys famous Christmas markets at various towns along the way. It was a drive of four- and-a-half hours, but far from taxing and totally worth it.Driving through Europe in winter during Christmas season is the most beautiful road trip you can doThe German Christmas markets are famous for mulled wine, stollen, Christmas cake handicrafts, glass-blowers, blacksmiths and woodworkers practising their trades. Its filled with Christmas cheer, carol singers and huge, beautifully lit up Christmas trees: its like the setting of a fairy tale. It was freezing, and it was a great Christmas vibe.Where next? We live in a beautiful country, but every time I travelled here, its always been on a shoot. One road trip I would like to do is in Ladakh, just north of Leh; its one of the most motorable roads in the world and is at an elevation of 5,359 metres. There is so much to see and learn from the country we live in.Mountain magicDeepti BhatnagarNorth-East India, 2019, 3 months (with stops)Deepti explored the North-East for three months on roadOn a work trip that we combined with pleasure, we drove through North-East India for three months. My favourite part of the trip was landing in Assam during the Bihu festival, dancing and eating with the locals. Thats the best part of a road trip: you can stop and soak in whatever you like without an agenda.As a wild life enthusiast, I absolutely loved Kaziranga, and I equally loved Mawlynnong, supposedly Asias cleanest village.Where next? I am in my Goa home currently so it would be perfect to travel within and around Goa. Goa has some incredible forests. I also want to explore the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary and the Dudhsagar Falls.Culture vultureDaisy ShahGujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, 15 years ago, 7 daysDaisy has fond memories of road trips with her dadI have had the best road trips with my dad, driving to places like Ahmedabad, Shrinathji (Rajasthan) and Shirdi. They were always exciting: planning the route, stopping at our own will, packing extra munchies and so on.I have vivid memories of visiting a renovated heritage haveli in Ahmedabads old city area, meeting itinerant tribes, and treating my palate to the delightful flavours of local cuisine.Where next?

To try and widen my choices, I invited anyone who had a delivery service whose food they wanted me to try to DM me on Instagram. If it seemed interesting, I said, I would try it.As it turned out, some of the food came from places I had never heard of before the lockdown. And some of it came from places I already knew. And some from completely new establishments that had just opened. Here in no particular order, is my list of the best.Best Pad Thai: I am always skeptical about Thai food in India because Indian chefs cook it as though it is just another branch of Indian curry cooking  which it isnt  and there are very few good expatriate Thai chefs in India.Imagine my surprise therefore when the best Pad Thai I have had in India came from a chef who did not  as far as I knew  cook Thai food.Jitendra KapoorsVikramjeet Roy is a superstar chef, well known and celebrated for his Japanese food (he started out at Wasabi) and his modern takes on Korean and Chinese food. Roy has joined hands with Anurodh Samal, in my view, the best restaurant manager in India to open Hello Panda in Gurgaon. This is a deeply personal venture. Both men are much in demand but have decided to do it alone, sinking their own savings into this restaurant.I know Vikrams food well so I was not surprised by his sushi rolls, his dim sum or his Chinese dishes. The surprise was the Thai food: a remarkably authentic green curry bursting with the umami flavour of Nam Pla and delicious Pad Thai rice noodles with a few tweaks to the original flavour.I will order again (and again) but the Pad Thai will remain a must try.Best Keema Samosa: I had been to the old Rustoms Parsi restaurant but ever since Kainaz Contractor moved her operation to a new location, I lost touch. When I heard they were doing delivery, I ordered a large meal on the very day I got the menu. Almost all of the food was sensational: Dhansak, Salli Boti, Vada Pav, Caramel Custard etc. The only duff dish was a Podi Idli. (I guess if you order Podi Idli from a restaurant that specialises in Mumbai food, you have only yourself to blame.)Keema and elements of chaat come together in theBut the dish that was so outstanding that I wished I had ordered two portions rather than one was the keema samosa. It was not your average Punjabi samosa but had a thin, crisp pastry and a deliciously-spiced keema filling. I am ordering it again tomorrow!Best Croissant: I have written at length about Sahil Mehta before so I wont repeat myself. His baking skills are outstanding and his croissants are so perfect, you could be eating in Paris.Best Gluten-free Cake: Caara is a brand that specialises in catering and produces high quality artisanal sauces and bread. What I did not realise was how good their gluten-free cakes were. I had an orange and almond gluten-free cake that was simply amazing.Best Gluten-free Bread: This one is a no-contest. It is hard to find a pastry chef with the skill and experience of the Hyatt Regencys Devendra Bungla. I had asked him to create a wheat and rice-free loaf and he came up with bread that was so wonderful that the Hyatt Regency now sells it as Bungla bread.I would find it hard to survive without it.Best Sandwich: It is tough to deliver a sandwich without it getting soggy so I was skeptical when Anand Kataria of Big Fat Sandwich contacted me on Instagram. But Kataria and his team have found a way around that. They deliver the components to you and let you make your own sandwich. They also delivered bagels and two kinds of sour dough, some pulled pork, oriental-style pork belly and a variety of dips/sauces. I loved the bacon jam and the kasundi mustard (all available from Bigfat.in) I made delicious sandwiches with their ingredients and thought that these guys had really cracked the sandwich delivery problem.Big Fat Sandwich delivers the components to you and lets you make your own sandwichBest Kebabs: Jitendra Kapoor who makes delicious shami kebabs (which you fry at home) has always refused to go commercial but all of his friends hit him for regular supplies.At some stage I hope we will persuade him to sell them to the general public; they are that good.Best Sausages: Artisan Meats contacted me a couple of years ago on Instagram and I wrote about their products. They have sustained me through the lockdown with bacon, pancetta, pork belly, pastrami and duck confit. My favourite of their products is the Spicy Italian Sausage. It is so tasty, that I have eaten it on its own, as part of a cassoulet (with their duck confit), roasted over vegetables, paired with lentils and as part of a home-made hot dog. Their other sausages are too smokey for me but this one is perfect.Best Burger1. Fast Food Burger: I dont think you can beat the Burger King Whopper, served with 9mm fries that taste of potato all the way through. The chain is super hygiene-conscious and delivery is efficient.2. Casual Burger: Akriti Malhotra is a former Diva chef who now runs two burger outlets, including one near my home. She does many kinds of burgers but my favourite is the Meister Burger, which has a mutton patty, egg, cheese and sauces, and becomes a gorgeous squishing mess that smears your face with goodness when you try to eat it. It is the sort of burger that trendy food trucks would serve in the West.3. Gourmet Burger: Every good steakhouse in America will serve a burger made from quality ground meat, an artisanal brioche and top-class fries. The closest we ever came to that in pre-2014 India was the burger at Qube at Delhis Leela Palace.Rustoms home delivery includes its highly addictive keema samosasBut I think we have a new winner now: the tenderloin burger at Tres, the Delhi restaurant run by chefs Julia DeSa and Jatin Mallick. Chef Jatin cant use beef so he flavours and treats his buffalo meat so well that it makes a nearly perfect burger patty. The bun is baked in-house and Jatin double fries red potatoes for the hand-cut chips.Julia is experimenting with a burger made with the same bun but with no patty. Instead she uses her own home made Goan Chorise. Its not on the delivery menu yet but I hope she starts delivering it soon.Best Dabeli: Sumit Gulati is part of the famous tandoori family but he and his Gujarati wife Chiquita run the Spice Market restaurant in Saket along with a cloud kitchen and cook all kinds of cuisine.They delivered a Western Indian meal to me packed with the authentic flavours of Gujarat and Maharashtra but the single best dish was one they invented themselves. All over Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kutch (and Indore, apparently) you get a vada-pav ancestor called the dabeli, which I dont like very much.Sette by Fratelli is a Super-Tuscan style red wine made with grapes from Akluj in MaharashtraBut Chiquita Gulati created her own version using spiced keema and combining it with the chaat-like elements of the normal dabeli (peanuts, sev etc.) It shouldnt have worked but it did  a sort of cross between keema-pav and a vada-pav. Mouth watering.Best Dim Sum: When Yauatcha first opened in London, I used to go there whenever I could to eat the venison puff. You cant serve venison in India but the Delhi Royal China does a light puff filled with roast pork that brings back memories of the original puff. Everything I have ordered from Royal China has been good but this is the dish I crave because of the excellence of the baking.Best Patty: A patty and a puff are cousins so my other favourite is the chicken patty from Yummies, which I wrote about a couple of weeks ago. Yummies has a well-deserved reputation for desserts. But nothing comes close to the perfection of their chicken patties.Best Indian Wine: Most food tastes better with wine and my choice for the duration of the lockdown has been Sette by Fratelli. It is a Super-Tuscan style red wine made with grapes from Akluj in Maharashtra. Fratelli makes a more expensive wine (JNoon) but Sette is the one thats kept me going in the last few months.From HT Brunch, July 5, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch","brunchupdated: jul 05, 2020 09:54 istas some of you may already know, i spent the lockdown checking out the delivery scene. to try and widen my choices, i invited anyone who had a delivery service whose food they wanted me to try to dm me on instagram. if it seemed interesting, i said, i would try it.as it turned out, some of the food came from places i had never heard of before the lockdown. and some of it came from places i already knew. and some from completely new establishments that had just opened. here in no particular order, is my list of the best.best pad thai: i am always skeptical about thai food in india because indian chefs cook it as though it is just another branch of indian curry cooking  which it isnt  and there are very few good expatriate thai chefs in india.imagine my surprise therefore when the best pad thai i have had in india came from a chef who did not  as far as i knew  cook thai food.jitendra kapoorsvikramjeet roy is a superstar chef, well known and celebrated for his japanese food (he started out at wasabi) and his modern takes on korean and chinese food. roy has joined hands with anurodh samal, in my view, the best restaurant manager in india to open hello panda in gurgaon. this is a deeply personal venture. both men are much in demand but have decided to do it alone, sinking their own savings into this restaurant.i know vikrams food well so i was not surprised by his sushi rolls, his dim sum or his chinese dishes. the surprise was the thai food: a remarkably authentic green curry bursting with the umami flavour of nam pla and delicious pad thai rice noodles with a few tweaks to the original flavour.i will order again (and again) but the pad thai will remain a must try.best keema samosa: i had been to the old rustoms parsi restaurant but ever since kainaz contractor moved her operation to a new location, i lost touch. when i heard they were doing delivery, i ordered a large meal on the very day i got the menu. almost all of the food was sensational: dhansak, salli boti, vada pav, caramel custard etc. the only duff dish was a podi idli. (i guess if you order podi idli from a restaurant that specialises in mumbai food, you have only yourself to blame.)keema and elements of chaat come together in thebut the dish that was so outstanding that i wished i had ordered two portions rather than one was the keema samosa. it was not your average punjabi samosa but had a thin, crisp pastry and a deliciously-spiced keema filling. i am ordering it again tomorrow!best croissant: i have written at length about sahil mehta before so i wont repeat myself. his baking skills are outstanding and his croissants are so perfect, you could be eating in paris.best gluten-free cake: caara is a brand that specialises in catering and produces high quality artisanal sauces and bread. what i did not realise was how good their gluten-free cakes were. i had an orange and almond gluten-free cake that was simply amazing.best gluten-free bread: this one is a no-contest. it is hard to find a pastry chef with the skill and experience of the hyatt regencys devendra bungla. i had asked him to create a wheat and rice-free loaf and he came up with bread that was so wonderful that the hyatt regency now sells it as bungla bread.i would find it hard to survive without it.best sandwich: it is tough to deliver a sandwich without it getting soggy so i was skeptical when anand kataria of big fat sandwich contacted me on instagram. but kataria and his team have found a way around that. they deliver the components to you and let you make your own sandwich. they also delivered bagels and two kinds of sour dough, some pulled pork, oriental-style pork belly and a variety of dips/sauces. i loved the bacon jam and the kasundi mustard (all available from bigfat.in) i made delicious sandwiches with their ingredients and thought that these guys had really cracked the sandwich delivery problem.big fat sandwich delivers the components to you and lets you make your own sandwichbest kebabs: jitendra kapoor who makes delicious shami kebabs (which you fry at home) has always refused to go commercial but all of his friends hit him for regular supplies.at some stage i hope we will persuade him to sell them to the general public; they are that good.best sausages: artisan meats contacted me a couple of years ago on instagram and i wrote about their products. they have sustained me through the lockdown with bacon, pancetta, pork belly, pastrami and duck confit. my favourite of their products is the spicy italian sausage. it is so tasty, that i have eaten it on its own, as part of a cassoulet (with their duck confit), roasted over vegetables, paired with lentils and as part of a home-made hot dog. their other sausages are too smokey for me but this one is perfect.best burger1. fast food burger: i dont think you can beat the burger king whopper, served with 9mm fries that taste of potato all the way through. the chain is super hygiene-conscious and delivery is efficient.2. casual burger: akriti malhotra is a former diva chef who now runs two burger outlets, including one near my home. she does many kinds of burgers but my favourite is the meister burger, which has a mutton patty, egg, cheese and sauces, and becomes a gorgeous squishing mess that smears your face with goodness when you try to eat it. it is the sort of burger that trendy food trucks would serve in the west.3. gourmet burger: every good steakhouse in america will serve a burger made from quality ground meat, an artisanal brioche and top-class fries. the closest we ever came to that in pre-2014 india was the burger at qube at delhis leela palace.rustoms home delivery includes its highly addictive keema samosasbut i think we have a new winner now: the tenderloin burger at tres, the delhi restaurant run by chefs julia desa and jatin mallick. chef jatin cant use beef so he flavours and treats his buffalo meat so well that it makes a nearly perfect burger patty. the bun is baked in-house and jatin double fries red potatoes for the hand-cut chips.julia is experimenting with a burger made with the same bun but with no patty. instead she uses her own home made goan chorise. its not on the delivery menu yet but i hope she starts delivering it soon.best dabeli: sumit gulati is part of the famous tandoori family but he and his gujarati wife chiquita run the spice market restaurant in saket along with a cloud kitchen and cook all kinds of cuisine.they delivered a western indian meal to me packed with the authentic flavours of gujarat and maharashtra but the single best dish was one they invented themselves. all over gujarat, maharashtra, kutch (and indore, apparently) you get a vada-pav ancestor called the dabeli, which i dont like very much.sette by fratelli is a super-tuscan style red wine made with grapes from akluj in maharashtrabut chiquita gulati created her own version using spiced keema and combining it with the chaat-like elements of the normal dabeli (peanuts, sev etc.) it shouldnt have worked but it did  a sort of cross between keema-pav and a vada-pav. mouth watering.best dim sum: when yauatcha first opened in london, i used to go there whenever i could to eat the venison puff. you cant serve venison in india but the delhi royal china does a light puff filled with roast pork that brings back memories of the original puff. everything i have ordered from royal china has been good but this is the dish i crave because of the excellence of the baking.best patty: a patty and a puff are cousins so my other favourite is the chicken patty from yummies, which i wrote about a couple of weeks ago. yummies has a well-deserved reputation for desserts. but nothing comes close to the perfection of their chicken patties.best indian wine: most food tastes better with wine and my choice for the duration of the lockdown has been sette by fratelli. it is a super-tuscan style red wine made with grapes from akluj in maharashtra. fratelli makes a more expensive wine (jnoon) but sette is the one thats kept me going in the last few months.from ht brunch, july 5, 2020follow us on twitter.com/htbrunchconnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch"

Diagnosed with oral cancer in 2016, he was operated upon at the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. Since then Mr. Dash has had to spend much of his earnings from renting out marquees on his treatment. However, the expense has become almost impossible for him after the pandemic-induced lockdown.Since March-end, I am yet to receive a single order as social functions have come to a halt due to lockdown. My earnings are almost nil. After the surgery in 2016, my follow-up treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been going on in Cuttack. I have already skipped my treatment scheduled for the first week of July. I dont know if I will survive this, said Mr. Dash, on a note of hopelessness.Punjabs cancer-afflicted hit hard after suspension of cancer trainWhile cancer patients all over the State are feeling the impact of the lockdown, the effect has been more visible in Bargarh district, dubbed the cancer capital of Odisha. Despite the high incidence of cancer in the district, no focused study has been conducted so far and residents have held several protests demanding better cancer care in the western Odisha district. In 2017, Subal Sahoo, MLA from Bijepur in Bargarh, died of cancer. Subash Chouhan, Chairman of Western Odisha Development Council, a leader from Bargarh, succumbed to the disease in May this year.Said to be the rice bowl of Odisha, Bargarh has seen a growing cancer cluster probably due to the overuse of pesticides and fertilisers for the paddy crop, though there has been no focused study as yet. Many patients from lower income groups in the district have been diagnosed with different types of cancers though oral and breast cancers are the most common.While Mr. Dash is worried about arranging funds for his cancer treatment, Mr. Prasanna Mishra, a veteran journalist of Bargarh district, is desperate for consultation about his daily medication for leukemia.Odisha youth pedals 1,700 km from Maharashtra to reach homeHis desperate calls to Tata Memorial Hospital have gone unanswered and two top government cancer care institutes in Odisha are affected by COVID-19 infection and have shut down their out patient departments (OPDs).The OPDs of Acharya Harihar Post Graduate Institute of Cancer (AHPGIC), Cuttack  eastern Indias leading cancer hospital  and AIIMS-Bhubaneswar shut down recently after detection of 150 COVID-19 cases from there.The tablet which is a lifeline for me, is not available in Bargarh. The cost of the medicine here is thrice the price as in Mumbai. But it is difficult for me to arrange to get the drug, said Mr. Mishra.Like him, Ms. Minati Pati, a senior State government official and a cancer survivor, is worried about availability of oncologists.No one can know the pain that the cancer patients undergo. They need regular check-ups and comforting words from doctors which would help provide temporary relief, said Ms. Pati, District Treasury Officer of Bargarh.One in 10 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime: WHO reportA few private hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have been charging huge fees which we cannot afford, said Mr. Dash.Fighters Group, a forum of cancer survivors, rued that the Odisha government had failed to even start construction despite Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announcing the setting up of a dedicated cancer hospital at Bargarh in 2019.Aswini Darjee, a cancer survivor and founder of the Fighters Group, said cancer patients of Bargarh can neither go to Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai nor can they go to AHPGIC due to the lockdown.Many hospitals are affected by COVID-19 infections. Ever since the virus outbreak, train services have been hit which has affected cancer patients who are deprived of regular follow-ups. Cancer patients cannot afford travelling distance by hiring own vehicles.

2020-07-12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ajit-doval-the-spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold/article32053422.ece,Ajit Doval | The spy who came in from the cold,"Earlier this year, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval walked through the narrow lanes of northeast Delhi that just witnessed one of the worst communal riots in more than three decades. With television cameras milling around, the 75-year-old Mr. Doval, a former Intelligence Bureau (IB) Director, marched and stopped to speak to residents, assuring them of peace and justice.On February 26, as TV channels beamed the visuals and social media was agog with praises for the septuagenarian, reporters were duly informed that it was Home Minister Amit Shahs idea to send Mr. Doval to the riot-hit areas. On March 11, Mr. Shah himself informed the Lok Sabha that it was on his request that the NSA visited northeast Delhi so that the latter could motivate Delhi Police. The police were criticised for being mute spectators as rioters burnt houses and went on a killing spree.Ever since Mr. Doval was reappointed NSA in the second Modi government and Mr. Shah moved to North Block, there has been discussion on the power equation at play. The question often asked: whose words on internal security weigh more to the Prime Minister? Both have responsibilities and roles that often overlap. Mr. Doval had an amiable working equation with Rajnath Singh, Mr. Shahs predecessor. After Article 370 was diluted last August and Jammu and Kashmir was placed under an unprecedented lockdown and a communication blockade, photos and videos of Mr. Doval eating chicken curry and rice with local people in southern Kashmirs Shopian emerged. With the local cable channels snapped and the phone and Internet lines down, the video was played on loop on Delhi-based satellite news channels, the only connect Kashmiris had with the outside world. Cooped in their homes, with concertinas ringed at every lane, Kashmiris watched as Mr. Doval spoke of the benefits (of reading down Article 370 and turning the State into a Union Territory) and the bright future that awaited them. Officials say Mr. Doval is heavily invested in the security affairs of Kashmir.Rise of a copBorn in 1945 at Pauri Garhwal in the erstwhile United Provinces, now in Uttarakhand, Mr. Doval grew up in Ajmer, Rajasthan. His father was an officer in the Indian Army. After graduating from Agra University, he joined the IPS in 1968 in the Kerala cadre. He cut his teeth in anti-insurgency operations in Mizoram and Punjab, including undercover missions. In 1999, Mr. Doval was one of those who negotiated the release of passengers from the hijacked Indian Airlines flight IC-814 in Kandahar. In July 2004, he was appointed Director of the IB. After retirement in 2005, Mr. Doval retreated to his private life, often contributing to the national security discussions through commentaries and talks. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, the former spymaster returned to the government, as the countrys fifth NSA.On June 3 last year, when Mr. Doval was reappointed, the NSAs post was upgraded from the rank of Minister of State to Cabinet Minister in the table of precedence, a first since the post was created in 1998. The decision was reportedly taken as Mr. Doval was also leading strategic dialogues with many countries. A case in point being the talks between Special Representatives of India and China on the Boundary Question.While China was represented by the State Councilor with a Cabinet rank, India was represented by the NSA with a Minister of State rank. The mismatch in hierarchy had raised protocol issues with the Chinese. The leg-up was also accelerated by the appointment of S. Jaishankar, a retired Foreign Secretary who was much junior in service to Mr. Doval, as the External Affairs Minister. In the first stint of the Modi government, the two differed on various foreign policy matters. Mr. Jaishankar, then Foreign Secretary, had shot off a terse letter to the Home Ministry and the NSA in 2016 after Chinese Uighur activist Dolkun Isa was granted a visa to attend a conference at Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh. In the letter, Mr. Jaishankar asked both to consult the Ministry of External Affairs to better manage the political and media fallout from such decisions.To address the ongoing Chinese troops build-up at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, Mr. Doval quietly revived the China Study Group (CSG). An informal group constituted in 1997, the CSG comprises the Cabinet Secretary, Secretaries of Defence and Home, Army chief and Director of Intelligence Bureau, among others. The group has met at least on three occasions since May. The government had initially denied any serious crisis on the LAC. The extent of the Chinese build-up was later established through satellite images. On July 5, Mr. Doval held talks with Chinas Special Representative Wang Yi on the disengagement plan at all the confrontation points, including the Galwan Valley where 20 Indian soldiers were killed in violent clashes with the Chinese on June 15.Before he sat for the talks on the phone, the ground commanders were sent again to check if the Chinese had indeed moved back 2 km as agreed during the June 30 Corps Commander level talks. As per the agreement, Indian troops also pulled back 1.5 km from Indias perception of the LAC with a 30-day moratorium on foot patrolling. Two days before the Doval-Wang meeting, Prime Minister Modi made a surprise visit to Ladakh. Mr. Doval did not accompany the Prime Minister as he was in self-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Advisory groupThough he has an office in South Block, in 2018, Mr. Doval ensured that the Sardar Patel Bhavan at Parliament Street in New Delhi was taken over exclusively for the functioning of the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS). The NSCS, headed by Mr. Doval, works as an advisory group, comprising various experts on security related matters. Several Ministries and departments were moved out of the five-storeyed building to make space for the NSCS.Last August, the Cabinet Secretariat amended the Allocation of Business Rules, 1961 to include the NSCS, granting it a constitutional authority. Through the order, the NSCS has been empowered to generate Cabinet notes, a role till now reserved for the concerned Ministries. The order said the Secretariat would assist the National Security Adviser, the Principal Adviser on National Security matters to the Prime Minister; and the National Security Council. The Hindu has learnt that the NSCS has so far not generated a single proposal for consideration of the Union Cabinet.The oft-repeated tales of his undercover operations in Pakistan have helped craft his image as a super spy among the common people. When the NSA enters a government building, security personnel and civilians stand in reverence, a gesture duly acknowledged by Mr. Doval.","earlier this year, national security adviser (nsa) ajit

Also, paddy arrives faster in the mandis (grain markets). An average 120 lakh tonnes of wheat arrives in mandis against 180 lakh tonne paddy, an additional director-rank official said.During the rabi season that ended on June 30, premises of 1,550 rice mills along with 1,870 mandis and procurement centres managed by mandi board were used for wheat procurement.Even if the entire paddy stock from the previous season is shelled by the beginning of the new season starting October 1, and handed over to the Food Corporation of India (FCI), we have to see if we can use rice mills as storage points. We dont want to take any chance, the official said.State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said procurement of paddy in rice mills is a tricky issue. We are working out a solution and may use other places for staggering procurement, he added.STATE ORDERS 5 LAKH GUNNY BALESThe department has placed orders for 5 lakh gunny bales (each bale contains 1,000 bags) with the Jute Corporation of India and has paid a sizeable amount in advance. The tentative cost of the gunny bags for the forthcoming season has been pegged at Rs 1,350 crore.If we do not place orders now, we would not get supply of gunny bags in the middle of procurement. The department raises funds from the banks and later adjusts the same when cash credit limit (CCL) for procurement is received, Ashu said.Secretary (agriculture) KS Pannu said sowing of the parmal variety of paddy in the current kharif season is almost over. Right now, the transplantation of aromatic premium basmati variety is going on. The parmal variety is likely to be sown over 60 lakh acres.

(Representational) A whopping increase in area of mechanical transplanting has been seen this season in Punjab. (Representational)At a time when Punjab is facing acute shortage of migrant labour specialising in conventional transplantation of paddy (hailing primarily from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) amid the pandemic, around a thousand rice/paddy transplanting machines  mostly made in China, Japan and Korea  are being used in agricultural fields.The technique saves time, labour and cuts cost by nearly Rs 4,000-5,000 per acre compared to manual transplanting, said agriculture officials.A whopping increase in area of mechanical transplanting has been seen this season in Punjab. But while this has been technique available to farmers for over a decade, it did not get a good response because farmers find paddy nursery raising for transplanters a cumbersome process.Collectively, these transplanters have cultivated 52,000 hectares (1,28,440 acres) in 40 days from June 10 to July 11  an 8-fold increase in area as compared to last year. Around 2,000-3000 hectares more may be covered under this system by the end of rice sowing this month.Since mechanical transplantation was introduced in Punjab in 2007-08, the state has never transplanted more than 3,000 to 4,000 hectares paddy per year with this method, barring last year when 6,500 hectares (16,055 acres) was brought under it, said a senior officer in the Punjab agriculture department, adding that this time there was a huge response from farmers, and labour shortage is the main reason.This year alone, 700 paddy transplanters (several of which reached farmers only in July) were purchased by farmers of Punjab while the number of these machines was just 313 till last year.How did demand for this method first arise?The need for rice transplanters was first felt in the state following the enactment of MG-NREGS Act in 2005, which led several migrant labourers, who were experts in paddy transplanting, to staying back in their home states  Bihar and UP  to avail the 100 days guaranteed employment at their native places rather than coming to Punjab for two months in the paddy sowing season.Then Punjab imported 171 Chinese and Japanese-made transplanters till 2018 and then 142 were more in 2019. In the ongoing season, 700 have been purchased.There are three types of these machines  the walk-behind (the person walks with it in the puddled field) having two models (4-row and 6-row), the single wheel ride on and four-wheeled ride on. While the walk-behind model costs around Rs 3-3.50 lakh each, the single wheel ride on and four wheel ride on machines cost Rs 2.5- 3.5 lakh and Rs 10-14 lakh respectively. While most of them are made in China or Japan, some Indian companies transplanters were also made available to farmers at 40-50 per cent subsidy. However, farmers are still waiting for the subsidy for the purchase they made last year.Walk-behind and single wheel machines sow 4-5 acres each a day and two persons are sufficient for it  one for running the machine and other to supply nursery for feeding in the machine. Four-wheeled ride on can sow 8-10 acres in a day, said Agricultural Engineering Manmohan Kalia, nodal officer, Farm Machinery, Punjab, and joint director (officiating), Agriculture Engineering.Farmers verdictFarmer Major Singh Bajwa of Bajwa Kalan village under Shahkot sub-division of Jalandhar district, who has done mechanical transplantation on his 60 acres field this time, said he had purchased a transplanter last year and the results were good, so he has increased the area this year.With this machine, I am tension-free as it saves huge labour cost too, he said, adding that training nursery is a little labour-intensive and technical but one needs to get used to it.I and my fellow farmer Rajinder Singh had developed a seedler for nursery growing for this method and it will make nursery growing simple, he said, adding that a trial was done this time but from next time it will be fully functional.Sukhjit Singh Diwala of Diwala village in Ludhiana has sown his 36 acres with a walk-behind machine this year and also provided his machine on rent. He raised a nursery for fellow farmers of his village and did mechanical transplanting on 100 acres in his village including his own fields.Finding labour was becoming difficult. I purchased a translator last year o experiment on my own field and it was so successful that I got 4-5 quintals more yield because of increasing of a number of plants in the fields with this method, said he, adding that to sort the nursery raising method, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, had invented a new machine to grow nursery for paddy transplanters and it ill come in the market from next season.This machine will sow nursery for 100 acres in a 3-4 days with the help of two persons while currently, it takes 20 days for seven persons to raise nursery for 100 acres.In Punjab, 27-30 lakh hectares area is under paddy crop including Basmati, for which around 6 to 6.5 lakh migrant labourers are required to transplant paddy nursery in the fields for 40-50 days. Punjab needs around 20,000 paddy transplanters to cover the entire area excluding DSR area. And with an increased number of machines, the rental rates of these machines would also come down for small and marginal farmers.Manual versus mechanical transplantingUnder mechanical technique, a nursery is raised on polythene sheets, each 20 feet long and 22 inches wide with a 1 inch layer of soil. As 80 feet long and 22 inches wide area is required to grow paddy for one acre. Around 7-8 kg seed is required for one acre and after sowing, it is covered with dry, fine earth. After proper watering, nursery gets ready in 25-30 days depending on the varieties of rice and is transplanted in puddle fields with the transplanter machine. The nursery is fed into machine-like cakes in 2211 inches pieces, which carries hundreds of plants, and machine transplants the same ensuring appropriate space between the plants and the rows. It takes around one and half hours to sow one acre. Using this method, around 33 plants are sown per sq. meters. Because of the specified distance from plant to plant and between rows, the airing is proper in the field and such fields are less prone to fungal and blight diseases. If a farmer owns this machine, the total cost of paddy sowing will come to around Rs 3,500-4,000 which includes preparation of nursery, diesel cost, preparation of field, which needs tilling and puddling before transplanting seeds.In manual transplanting, the per acre costs comes to Rs 8,000-9,000. As the expenses up to puddling are same i.e. Rs 2,000 per acre, while the cost of nursery growing is up to Rs 800-1,000 and labour cost is Rs 5,000-6,000 per acre. With this method, only 3 kg seed is required per acre because in manual transplanting, only 22-25 plants are sown per sq. mt by the labour.What is the cost of mechanical transplanting for farmers who have to rent it?Currently, there are only 1,000 machines and farmers who go for mechanical sowing hire it from fellow farmers who own them.

2020-07-23,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/signs-of-farm-revolution-in-india-as-coronavirus-prompts-change/articleshow/77119384.cms,Signs of farm 'revolution' as Covid prompts change,"(Representative image)No migrant labourMore on Covid-19RAIPUR JATTAN: For more than two decades, Ravindra Kajal (farmer) cultivated rice the way his forefathers had - every June he flooded his fields with water before hiring an army of farmhands to plant paddy seedlings.But a scarcity of workers this year because of the coronavirus forced Kajal to change. He irrigated the field just enough to moisten the soil and leased a drilling machine to directly sow seeds on his 9-acre (3.6-hectare) plot.""Since I was more than comfortable with the tried-and-tested way of growing rice, I opted for the new method with some trepidation,"" said Kajal, 46, looking over his field, green with rice saplings, in the Raipur Jattan village in Haryana state.""But I've already saved around Rs 7,500 ($100) per acre because I hardly spent on water and workers this year,"" he said.India is the world's biggest exporter of rice and the world's second-biggest producer after China. Across the country's grain bowl states of Haryana and neighbouring Punjab, thousands of farmers like Kajal have been forced by the coronavirus to mechanise planting.They are still wary of the technology and overturning the time-honoured use of manual labour.But Kahan Singh Pannu, Punjab's agriculture secretary, is convinced a historic change is underway that could dramatically increase India's rice output, which in turn could impact world markets.""It is no less than a revolution in Indian agriculture,"" he told Reuters.Government officials say the so-called direct seeding of rice (DSR) method could increase yields by about one-third and slash costs on workers and water.The DSR machines allow farmers to grow more than 30 saplings per square metre against the usual 15 to 18 seedlings, said Naresh Gulati, a state government farm official in Punjab.Punjab is the home of the 1960s Green Revolution that led to a spike in crop yields. This year, farmers there have used seed drilling machines to sow rice on more than half a million hectares, a big increase compared with less than 50,000 hectares in 2019, growers and government officials said.Pannu expects DSR use to jump again next year.""More and more farmers are using the DSR technology which seems to be so promising that the entire 2.7 million hectares of Punjab's rice area could come under it next year, which will be a watershed for India's rice production,"" he said.Avinash Kishore, a research fellow at the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), said if this year's crop was good, DSR would be the way forward.""The scale of this year's shift to the DSR is a momentous change in rice cultivation in India,"" he said.Sudhanshu Singh, a senior agronomist at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, said the shift to DSR was ""one of the rare positive fallouts from COVID .""None of the world's major rice exporting nations - India, Vietnam and Thailand - makes significant use of seeding machines.They have come into play in a big way in India this year because hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers from Bihar and Jharkhand states in the east did not arrive in the northern grain belt for the 2020 planting season due to the coronavirus lockdown.That pushed up the price of local workers and made it more economical for farmers to lease rice planting machines rather than pay for hired help, said Jaskaran Singh Mahal, a director at the Punjab Agricultural University.Farm wages have gone up by Rs 1,500 an acre to about Rs 4,500 this year, and growers need around half a dozen workers to transplant rice paddy on a one acre plot.In comparison, farmers can hire planting machines for Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per acre, which can cover 25 to 30 acres in a day, rice growers said.""Other than helping us save on major overheads such as water and labour, DSR is swift, unlike the old method which was tedious and time-consuming,"" said Devinder Singh Gill, a farmer in Punjab's Moga district, well known for its aromatic basmati rice.The conventional method requires farmers to sow seeds in nurseries and then wait for 20 to 30 days before manually transplanting the seedlings into plantation fields that are ankle-deep in water.Seeding machines allow farmers to bypass the nursery stage and plant straight into fields.Water conservation is another key attribute of DSR, which is crucial in a mostly dry, monsoon dependent country like India.Under the conventional method, 3,000 to 5,000 litres of water is used in India to produce 1 kg of rice - the most water-thirsty crop - and DSR allows growers to cut water use by at least 50% to 60%, farmers and government officials said.The main challenge for farmers using direct seeding machines is managing weeds, which require the spraying of herbicides through the season.Still, even factoring in the extra costs of these applications, the overall cost of cultivation is substantially lower under DSR, said Kajal, the farmer in Haryana.Another drawback will be that if the method is adopted across the farm belt, there will be huge unemployment in the eastern states next year.But farmers say they will wait to see the harvest in October before deciding whether to stick with the technology next year.""The new technology leads to a lot of saving on account of water and labour, but the real test lies in productivity and farmers will not be fully convinced unless they see some rise in their yields,"" said Ashok Singh, a rice farmer.In Video: Covid-19 prompts change, signs of farm 'revolution' in India","(representative image)no migrant labourmore on covid-19raipur jattan: for more than two decades, ravindra kajal (farmer) cultivated rice the way his forefathers had -

2020-07-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/water-crisis-is-becoming-a-problem-for-centre-6519541/,Water crisis is becoming a problem for Centre,"Indias 1.3 billion people have access to only about 4% of the worlds water resources, and farmers consume almost 90% of the groundwater water available. (Bloomberg) Indias 1.3 billion people have access to only about 4% of the worlds water resources, and farmers consume almost 90% of the groundwater water available. (Bloomberg)On a scorching summer day in northern India, Ajay Singh sat next to his water pump and scanned his 10 acres of farmland. He once used to grow rice each season to bring in about 150,000 rupees ($2,000) a year, well above the average income in the worlds second-most populous country.Now on six acres hes cultivating pearl millet, cow peas, bottle gourd and corn  crops that consume about 80% less water than rice, and also use less labor, fertilizer and electricity. While a water conservation program pays him 7,000 ($93) rupees per acre to plant them, its still a gamble: Unlike rice, which the government always buys at a set price, these crops have no guaranteed market.I am taking this risk because I have a passion to leave enough water for future generations, Singh said from his farm in Karnal, an area a few hours drive north of the capital, New Delhi.Indias 1.3 billion people have access to only about 4% of the worlds water resources, and farmers consume almost 90% of the groundwater water available. As global temperatures rise and overuse of water depletes existing resources, the threat to lives and businesses in Asias third-largest economy is projected to grow.Water shortages are already acute: nearly half the countrys population faces high-to-extreme water stress and about 200,000 die each year due to inadequate access to safe water. Stoked by climate change, the water crisis has forced Prime Minister Narendra Modis government to try and turn around decades of established farming practices and convince the countrys most powerful voting bloc to change the crops they plant. Water-guzzlers like rice and wheat are out, corn and pulses are in.This is just the beginning, Siraj Hussain, former secretary of agriculture and a visiting senior fellow at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in New Delhi, said of the program farmers like Singh have joined. Sooner or later, it will have to be replicated across the country. Ideally, the central government should finance part of the expenditure in providing incentives to the farmers for making the shift from paddy and sugarcane. States alone can not afford such an ambitious plan.Powerful BlocFor Modi, pushing farmers to change is risky business because of their sheer numbers and political power. Farm income is untaxed in the South Asian nation, and water and electricity are heavily subsidized. Lowering the minimum price at which the government buys food grains from farmers could also backfire at the polls.Although Modis Bharatiya Janata Party dominates parliament after a big win in last years election, he needs to tread a fine balance between shifting to less water-intensive crops and ensuring his government produces enough food to feed the poor. That makes incentives like those given to farmers like Singh an important test for whether India can reverse its chronic water problems.As global temperatures rise and overuse of water depletes existing resources, the threat to lives and businesses in Asias third-largest economy is projected to grow. (Bloomberg) As global temperatures rise and overuse of water depletes existing resources, the threat to lives and businesses in Asias third-largest economy is projected to grow. (Bloomberg)If the program in Karnal is any indicator, the task isnt going to be easy.Few farmers in the rice-growing district, where the water table has been declining by 0.7 meter every year, are keen to experiment with new crops. In its first year in Haryana the project anticipates around 100,000 hectares (247, 105 acres) would switch to alternate crops  but thats only about 7% of the land used for rice cultivation in the northern state.Farmers love rice and wheat primarily because of stable prices and assured state purchases. These two staples, along with another thirsty crop, sugar cane, are grown in 40% of the countrys gross farmed area but consume about 80% of its irrigation water. Corn and millets may use less water, but their price stability is unproven.Farming GambleIn the long run, experts say water shortages will make crop diversification an inevitability. Currently India is the worlds biggest extractor of groundwater  more than China and the U.S. combined  accounting for almost a quarter of the total extracted globally. Between 2000 and 2017 its groundwater depletion increased by as much as 23%.But the change needs to be carefully managed, said Aditya Pratap Dabas, deputy director agriculture and the officer managing the Karnal project. Changing the farmers mindset is the main challenge in implementing the program.Heavier tactics backfire. Protests erupted earlier this year when the provincial government tried to restrict rice cultivation to just half the farmed area in some parts of Haryana. The farmers, some backed by the opposition Congress party, said the government couldnt deprive farmers of the right to grow crops that fetched the best price.It will take time to change the mindset of farmers, said Rajinder Singh, 61, an activist with four decades of farming experience who is now urging others to join the program. The government should give assurance to procure these crops, more access to market and set up infrastructural facilities like cold storage, he said.The farmers, some backed by the opposition Congress party, said the government couldnt deprive farmers of the right to grow crops that fetched the best price. (Bloomberg) The farmers, some backed by the opposition Congress party, said the government couldnt deprive farmers of the right to grow crops that fetched the best price. (Bloomberg)Green RevolutionIndias food policy has remained focused on wheat and rice since the 1960s, when the Green Revolution changed the farming landscape and made the country food self-sufficient for the first time.The road to becoming the worlds second largest producer of those two staple grains was paved by federal and state subsidies for fertilizer, power and water. The crops are then purchased by governments  even in times of glut  at a minimum support price. For Indias farmers these are hard habits to break.Diversification incentives are not a bad idea, said Ila Patnaik, former principal economic adviser to the federal government and a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. Many of these reforms will have to be demonstrated to farmers before they gain faith in the government. We must also give time for reforms to play out.Besides Haryana, some other states have indirect programs to motivate farmers to move to less water intensive crops. Northern Punjab, a major producer of wheat and rice, is offering cash incentives to farmers who use less electricity to extract ground water. In Maharashtra, home to the financial hub Mumbai, farmers are encouraged to use drip irrigation for sugarcane cultivation.But for Mahavir Sharma, a 63-year-old farmer in Karnal, it was water scarcity in his part of Haryana that pushed him to start experimenting with corn on four of his 19 acres.I have seen in my own experience how rapidly the water level has fallen  its now our biggest problem, Sharma said.

2020-07-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/in-covid-times-punjab-leaves-midday-meal-scheme-beneficiaries-in-lurch-6522613/,"In Covid times, Punjab leaves midday meal scheme beneficiaries in lurch","Sarbati Devi with her grandchildren in Fazilka Sarbati Devi with her grandchildren in FazilkaSarbati Devi (80) from Fazilkas Chananwal village is saddled with bigger worries than her own health in the pandemic year. The 80-year-old is responsible for feeding five grandchildren that live with her after her daughter-in-law died and her son, Bablu, deserted them.While schools were open, Sarbati Devi was relieved that at least four of her school going grandkids were assured at least one meal a day as part of the Midday Meal Scheme for students from Class 1 to 8. For everything else, she banked on odd MNREGA jobs. But the last four months have seen even that minor assurance of one meal drift away.Since schools closed from March 23, she remembers receiving the Midday Meal ration just once (2-kg rice and 2-kg wheat) and cooking cost (Rs 200) that was credited into bank accounts of her two granddaughters. After that, neither the ration nor cooking cost reached the family.However, the local government primary schools head teacher Lavjeet Singh Grewal had been helping the family at his own level, during the lockdown.Her three granddaughters  Sohna (Class 4), Sapna (Class 5), Bhawna (Class 7) and a grandson Mohit (class 1)  study at a government school and are the beneficiaries of the ration and cooking cost under the mid day meal scheme. While teachers were assigned the duty to distribute ration packets door-to-door with schools being closed, cooking costs had to be transferred to their bank accounts.After my daughter-in-law died, my son left home. It has been two years now. I do not know where he is. He became a liquor addict and refused to take care of his kids. I do odd labour jobs to raise his five children. When schools were open, children were getting stomach-full meals at least once a day. At this age, it is not easy for me to work and cook for them but I try. We received 2 kg rice and 2 kg wheat once and Rs 200 for my two granddaughters, but it was almost two months back. For us, this aid matters a lot because I have no source of fixed income, Sarbati Devi said, while speaking to The Indian Express from her neighbours phone. This neighbour helps the children in accessing online study material as their grandmother doesnt have a smartphone.For several single mothers who have been raising their children alone by doing odd jobs, the ration and little money under the Midday Meal Scheme, matters a lot.Sandeep Kaur from village Nathewal of Jalandhar, whose son Arun is in Class 3 and daughter Rajni in Class 5, works as a domestic help in homes and as MNREGA worker, raising her children single-handedly after her husband died. She doesnt have a smartphone and her children borrow someones phone to access online studies.We received some rice and wheat once but no money has been received yet for either of my two children. I work in other peoples homes to raise my kids. Whatever help comes, be it ration or Rs 100-200, it matters, she said.Rani Kaur, a widow, from a village in Jalandhar, said that when schools were open, her two children, Daljit (Class 3) and daughter Manpreet (Class 5), would love having meals there and the everyday menu was different giving them proper nutrition. After my husbands death, I work as a domestic help and earn Rs 3,000 a month. I cannot give my children the kind of diet they were getting at government school daily. My son asks daily when school will reopen. We received half kg rice and wheat once, but no money has been received for any of the kids, said Rani, talking to The Indian Express from the phone of her relative.For the family of Jaspreet Kaur from Moga, whose husband earns Rs 300-400 a day as a labourer, timely distribution of midday meal ration would have meant a lot during lockdown, as seven kids from their joint family study in a government school.We received ration and Rs 110 once for our children, but nothing after that. Seven kids of our family are in government school and we all work as laborers, added Jaspreet.Data accessed by The Indian Express showed that after schools were closed in March last week, the Punjab Education Department has distributed foodgrains and cooking cost to the students (Class 1 to 8) under the Midday Meal scheme just once, for the period of less than a month  from March 23 to April 15.From April 16 to July till now, that is for more than three months, neither foodgrains nor the cooking cost has been distributed. This has hit families of underprivileged children the most.Centre seeks reportOn June 25, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) also sought a report from the Punjab government for its failure in fully implementing the Midday Meal scheme during the lockdown during a meeting held via video conferencing. Among those who attended were Ram Chandra Meena, Joint Secretary, Department of School Education and literacy, MHRD and Mohammad Tayyab, Director General, School Education, Punjab.The minutes of the meeting between MHRD and state officials, accessed by The Indian Express, said: MHRD has advised all states and UTs vide letter dated 20.03.2020 and 29.04.2020 regarding provision of midday meal or food security allowance to the eligible children under Midday Meal Scheme during closure of schools during Covid-19 and summer vacations 2020-21, respectively. Punjab has provided only foodgrains to children during closure of schools.The minutes recorded that Punjab has been advised to immediately distribute cooking cost or its equivalent pulses, oil etc and submit an action taken report.As per the order dated July 3 issued by the mid day meal division of the MHRD, this year students will also receive foodgrains and cooking cost for June (which otherwise is a vacation month), as a one time special measure due to COVID-19 so as to enable them to meet their nutritional requirement and to safeguard their immunity which is very vital during COVID-19 pandemic.Inexplicable delayIn fact, it was only after June 30, after an inexplicable delay of nearly three months and a rap from the MHRD, that the District Education Offices in Punjab started receiving separate letters from the head office to distribute cooking cost (pulses, oil etc) and foodgrains to the children for the period of April 16 to June 30.As per a letter, dated July 21, to DEO, Fazilka (copy with The Indian Express), the primary children (Class 1 to 5) are entitled to 700 gm wheat (7 days)/800 gm rice (8 days) and Rs 67.20 cooking cost for a period of 15 days from April 16 to April 30. Likewise, upper-primary kids (Class 6 to 8) are entitled to 1.05 kg wheat (7 days)/1.20 kg rice (8 days) and Rs 100.65 cooking cost for the same period.At this rate what remains pending for the children across Punjab from the period of April 16 to June 30 (65 days), is 3.2 kg wheat (32 days)/3.3 kg rice (33 days) and cooking cost of Rs 308.84 per child for primary. For upper-primary it is: 4.8 kg wheat (32 days)/4.95 kg rice (33 days) and Rs 462.79 cooking cost per child.On May 19, the Punjab State Midday Meal Society in its orders had said that as per orders from MHRD received on April 14, the cooking cost per child was increased from Rs 4.48 (per child per day) to Rs 4.97 for primary. For upper-primary it has been revised to Rs 7.45 per day from Rs 6.71. The revised amount was applicable in Punjab from May 15, stated the orders.This Midday Meal aid being given to the students roughly translates to just 100 gm wheat/rice per day and nearly Rs 150 as cooking cost for a month. On the face of it, it is too little but for families of children who are surviving doing labour work and some even without work, this also means a lot, a government teacher told The Indian Express.Were not to blame: TeachersTeachers, meanwhile, said that they have been moving door-to-door to distribute foodgrain packets to kids when the first lot was received but after that nothing came.A teacher, requesting anonymity, said, The foodgrains were received for March 23 to April 15 and we distributed them. We went around in our own vehicles and gave packets to kids. After that we did not receive ration for the rest of the months. Teachers are not at fault. Also, some students also do not have bank accounts due to which there was an issue in transferring cooking cost.Another teacher said that foodgrains for pending months were received on Friday, but pending cooking cost aid was not credited to bank accounts even now. We will start distributing ration packets received today, but cooking cost aid is yet to be received still, he said.Punjab govts claimsMeanwhile, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Midday Meal Scheme, Punjab, refused to answer any queries. I am not authorised to speak to the journalists. Whatever we had to say in this regard, the state Education Minister has said in a media statement. I will not answer any queries, he said.In a statement that was issued by Punjab School Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla on July 16, he had said that midday meal is being provided to 15.79 lakh children across Punjab.Nearly 8262.23 metric tonnes (MT) of foodgrains has been sent to the schools for the first financial quarter of the academic session 2020-21. For the second quarter (July 20-September 20), allocation of 11,974 MT has also been approved. The amount of Rs 37.26 crore as cooking cost has already been sanctioned by the state government which has to be transferred to the accounts of beneficiary students as per the guidelines laid by the Union government. As some students did not have any operative bank account, around Rs 14 crore is lying with the respective schools. We have directed the Education Department officials to get a nod from MHRD for releasing the cooking amount in cash to the students, he claimed.The minister could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts by The Indian Express.

80-year-old is responsible for feeding five grandchildren that live with her after her daughter-in-law died and her son, bablu, deserted them.while schools were open, sarbati devi was relieved that at least four of her school going grandkids were assured at least one meal a day as part of the midday meal scheme for students from class 1 to 8. for everything else, she banked on odd mnrega jobs. but the last four months have seen even that minor assurance of one meal drift away.since schools closed from march 23, she remembers receiving the midday meal ration just once (2-kg rice and 2-kg wheat) and cooking cost (rs 200) that was credited into bank accounts of her two granddaughters. after that, neither the ration nor cooking cost reached the family.however, the local government primary schools head teacher lavjeet singh grewal had been helping the family at his own level, during the lockdown.her three granddaughters  sohna (class 4), sapna (class 5), bhawna (class 7) and a grandson mohit (class 1)  study at a government school and are the beneficiaries of the ration and cooking cost under the mid day meal scheme. while teachers were assigned the duty to distribute ration packets door-to-door with schools being closed, cooking costs had to be transferred to their bank accounts.after my daughter-in-law died, my son left home. it has been two years now. i do not know where he is. he became a liquor addict and refused to take care of his kids. i do odd labour jobs to raise his five children. when schools were open, children were getting stomach-full meals at least once a day. at this age, it is not easy for me to work and cook for them but i try. we received 2 kg rice and 2 kg wheat once and rs 200 for my two granddaughters, but it was almost two months back. for us, this aid matters a lot because i have no source of fixed income, sarbati devi said, while speaking to the indian express from her neighbours phone. this neighbour helps the children in accessing online study material as their grandmother doesnt have a smartphone.for several single mothers who have been raising their children alone by doing odd jobs, the ration and little money under the midday meal scheme, matters a lot.sandeep kaur from village nathewal of jalandhar, whose son arun is in class 3 and daughter rajni in class 5, works as a domestic help in homes and as mnrega worker, raising her children single-handedly after her husband died. she doesnt have a smartphone and her children borrow someones phone to access online studies.we received some rice and wheat once but no money has been received yet for either of my two children. i work in other peoples homes to raise my kids. whatever help comes, be it ration or rs 100-200, it matters, she said.rani kaur, a widow, from a village in jalandhar, said that when schools were open, her two children, daljit (class 3) and daughter manpreet (class 5), would love having meals there and the everyday menu was different giving them proper nutrition. after my husbands death, i work as a domestic help and earn rs 3,000 a month. i cannot give my children the kind of diet they were getting at government school daily. my son asks daily when school will reopen. we received half kg rice and wheat once, but no money has been received for any of the kids, said rani, talking to the indian express from the phone of her relative.for the family of jaspreet kaur from moga, whose husband earns rs 300-400 a day as a labourer, timely distribution of midday meal ration would have meant a lot during lockdown, as seven kids from their joint family study in a government school.we received ration and rs 110 once for our children, but nothing after that. seven kids of our family are in government school and we all work as laborers, added jaspreet.data accessed by the indian express showed that after schools were closed in march last week, the punjab education department has distributed foodgrains and cooking cost to the students (class 1 to 8) under the midday meal scheme just once, for the period of less than a month  from march 23 to april 15.from april 16 to july till now, that is for more than three months, neither foodgrains nor the cooking cost has been distributed. this has hit families of underprivileged children the most.centre seeks reporton june 25, the union ministry of human resource development (mhrd) also sought a report from the punjab government for its failure in fully implementing the midday meal scheme during the lockdown during a meeting held via video conferencing. among those who attended were ram chandra meena, joint secretary, department of school education and literacy, mhrd and mohammad tayyab, director general, school education, punjab.the minutes of the meeting between mhrd and state officials, accessed by the indian express, said: mhrd has advised all states and uts vide letter dated 20.03.2020 and 29.04.2020 regarding provision of midday meal or food security allowance to the eligible children under midday meal scheme during closure of schools during covid-19 and summer vacations 2020-21, respectively. punjab has provided only foodgrains to children during closure of schools.the minutes recorded that punjab has been advised to immediately distribute cooking cost or its equivalent pulses, oil etc and submit an action taken report.as per the order dated july 3 issued by the mid day meal division of the mhrd, this year students will also receive foodgrains and cooking cost for june (which otherwise is a vacation month), as a one time special measure due to covid-19 so as to enable them to meet their nutritional requirement and to safeguard their immunity which is very vital during covid-19 pandemic.inexplicable delayin fact, it was only after june 30, after an inexplicable delay of nearly three months and a rap from the mhrd, that the district education offices in punjab started receiving separate letters from the head office to distribute cooking cost (pulses, oil etc) and foodgrains to the children for the period of april 16 to june 30.as per a letter, dated july 21, to deo, fazilka (copy with the indian express), the primary children (class 1 to 5) are entitled to 700 gm wheat (7 days)/800 gm rice (8 days) and rs 67.20 cooking cost for a period of 15 days from april 16 to april 30. likewise, upper-primary kids (class 6 to 8) are entitled to 1.05 kg wheat (7 days)/1.20 kg rice (8 days) and rs 100.65 cooking cost for the same period.at this rate what remains pending for the children across punjab from the period of april 16 to june 30 (65 days), is 3.2 kg wheat (32 days)/3.3 kg rice (33 days) and cooking cost of rs 308.84 per child for primary. for upper-primary it is: 4.8 kg wheat (32 days)/4.95 kg rice (33 days) and rs 462.79 cooking cost per child.on may 19, the punjab state midday meal society in its orders had said that as per orders from mhrd received on april 14, the cooking cost per child was increased from rs 4.48 (per child per day) to rs 4.97 for primary. for upper-primary it has been revised to rs 7.45 per day from rs 6.71. the revised amount was applicable in punjab from may 15, stated the orders.this midday meal aid being given to the students roughly translates to just 100 gm wheat/rice per day and nearly rs 150 as cooking cost for a month. on the face of it, it is too little but for families of children who are surviving doing labour work and some even without work, this also means a lot, a government teacher told the indian express.were not to blame: teachersteachers, meanwhile, said that they have been moving door-to-door to distribute foodgrain packets to kids when the first lot was received but after that nothing came.a teacher, requesting anonymity, said, the foodgrains were received for march 23 to april 15 and we distributed them. we went around in our own vehicles and gave packets to kids. after that we did not receive ration for the rest of the months. teachers are not at fault. also, some students also do not have bank accounts due to which there was an issue in transferring cooking cost.another teacher said that foodgrains for pending months were received on friday, but pending cooking cost aid was not credited to bank accounts even now. we will start distributing ration packets received today, but cooking cost aid is yet to be received still, he said.punjab govts claimsmeanwhile, prabhcharan singh, general manager, midday meal scheme, punjab, refused to answer any queries. i am not authorised to speak to the journalists. whatever we had to say in this regard, the state education minister has said in a media statement. i will not answer any queries, he said.in a statement that was issued by punjab school education minister vijay inder singla on july 16, he had said that midday meal is being provided to 15.79 lakh children across punjab.nearly 8262.23 metric tonnes (mt) of foodgrains has been sent to the schools for the first financial quarter of the academic session 2020-21. for the second quarter (july 20-september 20), allocation of 11,974 mt has also been approved. the amount of rs 37.26 crore as cooking cost has already been sanctioned by the state government which has to be transferred to the accounts of beneficiary students as per the guidelines laid by the union government. as some students did not have any operative bank account, around rs 14 crore is lying with the respective schools. we have directed the education department officials to get a nod from mhrd for releasing the cooking amount in cash to the students, he claimed.the minister could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts by the indian express. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel

But in Bombay, when I was growing up, it meant a person from UP.It was neither affectionate nor insulting, just a matter of fact. The guy who brought you milk in the morning was called bhaiyya. So was the man who made your bhelpuri.I thought back to the bhaiyya days, the last time I was in Mumbai and noticed how the milkmen and the bhelpuri-wallahs had become a much less important part of the city.People now bought their milk in bottles or in cardboard or plastic packets. The tradition of the doodh-wallah, who came to your door each morning with fresh milk, had been almost forgotten. And the name bhaiyya for doodh-wallah had almost died out.So it is with bhelpuri-wallahs. When I was a child, the beaches were important centres of the social life of the city. It was normal for middle-class families to drive to Chowpatty, get out of their cars and walk on the beach, stopping only to eat bhelpuri.A restaurant called Swati in Mumbai serves Gujarati-style bhel and chaatThe bhelpuri stalls were all run by migrants from UP. The stalls were mostly run by men with the same name: Sharma Snack Stall or Sharma Bhel Centre. All the Sharmas were addressed as bhaiyya by their customers and were happy to be called that.I have no idea why the citizens of Mumbai believed that people from UP  whether milkmen or chaat-wallahs  should be called bhaiyya. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mumbai (or Bombay as it was then) was already Indias most cosmopolitan city but you could still tell the ethnicities apart.The Parsis lived mostly in South Mumbai. There were distinct Muslim areas. Such places as Shivaji Park had a high concentration of Maharashtrians. Matunga was South Indian. Bhuleshwar was Gujarati.Rather than the melting pot it is today, Mumbai was a shimmering mosaic where every community felt at home, but also maintained its own identity. Bollywood, for instance, had a largely Punjabi air and Bandra had a Christian character.Many of these communities consisted of migrants to the city. Over the years, people streamed into the city because it offered opportunities to all. I imagine that the migrants from UP came fairly long ago. While they kept their regional identity, they treated Mumbai as home and even in the 1970s, many of them had been born in Mumbai.Though some got into the dairy business, I doubt if they brought the milk trade with them. On the other hand, they certainly brought chaat to the city.Despite the many extravagant claims made for Delhi as the home of chaat (most legends throw in a Mogul emperor or two to sound more authentic), the truth is that UP is the natural home of chaat. The best chaat in India is still in such towns as Benaras and Lucknow, and nearly all great chaat dishes can usually be traced back to UP.There is no pav-bhaji without packaged bread and Amul butter today ( Shutterstock )There are two great exceptions. The first is Delhi-style chhola-bhatura, which seems to have gained in popularity only after Partition when Punjabis came to the city.And the second is bhelpuri.You cant really dispute that most Mumbai chaat came from UP. Yes, the names were changed. The UP batasha, for instance, has taken on many identities in different parts of India: puchka in Kolkata and golgappa in Delhi.In Mumbai it became pani puri, a purely functional name that described its primary constituents, puri and a spicy, watery solution.But bhelpuri has many ingredients that you dont find in UP chaat. Sev is very much a Gujarati thing. So are mumra (puffed rice or rice crispies if you want to get fancy). The general consensus when I was growing up in Mumbai was that bhelpuri was invented in the city by merging UPs chaat traditions with Gujarati flavours and Gujarati textures.There was even a restaurant that claimed to have invented it: Vithals near the New Empire cinema. But bhelpuri had moved beyond any ethnic origins and belonged to all of Mumbai. At the same time as the Sharmas were stirring it up on Chowpatty, the Shetty bhelpuri chain of restaurants (owned by people from Karnataka) was offering a more upmarket version, complete with bhelpuri packet, in case you were travelling and wanted to take it out of Mumbai with you.In many Gujarati homes, bhelpuri would be assembled (if not fully made) by housewives. This was never as masaledaar as the Chowpatty version but it could be delicious, clean and made with the best ingredients (a date chutney rather than the imli chutney preferred by some stalls).Soam in Babulnath, Mumbai, is also famous for its chaat ( Shutterstock )This tradition received a boost when a small restaurant called Swati (owned by Gujaratis) opened near Bhatia Hospital, and began serving bhel and Gujarati takes on chaat. Swati soon became a phenomenon, and now visitors to Mumbai regard its take on bhelpuri as the definitive version. (It is very good but my favourite remains Soam in Babulnath.) In the process, the Gujaratis have reclaimed bhelpuri and the poor bhaiyyas of Chowpatty are less and less associated with it.The best chaat in India is still in such towns as Benaras and Lucknow, and nearly all great chaat dishes can be traced back to UPLike most Mumbai people of my generation, I loved bhelpuri. In 1979, I wrote the cover story for the newly- launched Bombay magazine and I compared the city with its delicious mixture of separate and distinct elements all bound together in perfect harmony to bhelpuri. At the time, I thought the parallel was apt. (And so, presumably did our readers, the issue sold out in 24 hours.)But I wonder if I would use that parallel today. For a start, I dont think that bhelpuri is the great Mumbai dish any longer. Sure, you get it all over the city but it is just one more dish on a chaat menu. Todays chaat-eaters see no distinction between bhelpuri and pani puri. They dont care that one is distinctively Mumbai and one is pan-Indian.In fact, if you ask people what the great Mumbai street food dish is, they would probably say vada-pav or pav-bhaji. Both are dishes that were popularised in the 70s and after. They are like the dabeli and the Bombay sandwich, dishes that depend on industrial bread and increasingly, on bottled sauces.It is easy to see why they are popular. In essence, they are dishes that any fool can make. There is no pav-bhaji without packaged bread and Amul butter. In the old days, pav-bhaji wallahs used pav from small bakeries but it is all industrial bread now. There is a certain skill involved in cooking the bhaji but as anyone who has eaten pav-bhaji recently will tell you, apart from the use of pre-packaged pav-bhaji masala, there is no proper recipe. Everybody just makes it up, reckoning that packaged bread, butter and packets of ready-made masala will see them through.The vada-pav is now basically about the chutney ( Shutterstock )The vada-pav is now basically about the chutney. There are still people who put the spicing in the vada but more and more vada-pav wallahs are making basic mashed potato bondas and putting them in an industrial bun. A conscientious guy will make his own chutneys. But packaged versions are readily available.I understand why Mumbai street food is becoming no more than a way of assembling mass-produced industrial ingredients. It is cheaper and easier this way. Nor does it require that much skill. (That said, there are places that still make outstanding pav-bhaji and vada-pav in Mumbai).Also, there is the attraction of Westernisation: a vada-pav is a sandwich.But mostly, I think it is because in Mumbai, unlike say Kolkata, people are losing the taste for real chaat. They are happier with a Jain pizza or an alleged hakka noodle. They dont really want to stand by a stall and eat pani puri, one at a time. They think bhelpuri is a mess and they like the sophistication of a bread-based snack.Fair enough. But heres my fear. Making great bhelpuri was an art. No ingredient was industrial. Everything was artisanal. And the final quality of the dish depended on the hand of the man who mixed it all. Did he add the right amount of chutney? Were there too many crushed puris? Had he kept the mumra from taking in too much chutney and getting soggy?But I wont complain. One definition of modernisation is a switch from artisanal to industrial. So, I shall just sit quietly and order my bhelpuri and enjoy the mumra bursting on my palate, the sharp taste of the little shards of onion, the richness of the khajoor chutney and the satisfying crunch of the broken puris.You guys can enjoy your bread!From HT Brunch, July 26, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch","brunchupdated: jul 26,

2020-07-26,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kharif-sowing-now-in-last-leg-but-punjab-has-reached-only-59-of-crop-diversification-target-6524169/,"Kharif sowing now in last leg, but Punjab has reached only 59% of crop diversification target","Punjab agriculture department Director Sutantra Kumar Airi said they will achieve the target once sowing of all Kharif crops is completed. Punjab agriculture department Director Sutantra Kumar Airi said they will achieve the target once sowing of all Kharif crops is completed.THOUGH SOWING of Kharif crops is already in its last phase, Punjab has been able to reach only 59 per cent of its crop diversification target. However, agricultural department officials claim they will be able to reach the target once sowing is over.This year, Punjab has targeted to divert around 3.25 lakh hectares (8.02 lakh acres) from the water-guzzling paddy crop to other alternative Kharif crops including cotton, maize and Basmati. The department had decided to bring 3 lakh hectares (LH) under maize against 1.59 LH last year, 5.15 LH under cotton against around 3.92 LH last year, and 7-LH under Basmati against 6.29 LH last year. Total paddy area targeted was up to 27 LH, which included 20 LH paddy rice (parmal) and 7 LH Basmati (fine, aromatic long rice). Last years paddy area was 29.20 LH, including 22.91 LH under non-Basmati and 6.29 LH under Basmati.Data sourced from the state agriculture department revealed that till date, the state has covered 5.01 LH under cotton  an increase of 1.09 LH (2.69 lakh acres)  but around 13,000 hectares short of the target. Under maize, 83,000 hectares (2.05 lakh acres) has been increased till date while 58,000 hectares more area is required to cover the target. The sowing of maize will continue till the end of this month. Similarly, around 6 lakh hectares have been covered under Basmati and sowing will end by end of this month.By these calculations, Punjab has diverted 1.92 LH (4.74 lakh acres), which is around 59 per cent this year to date against its target of 3.25 LH. Department sources said that when Basmati sowing is completed, area of diversification will be increased.Punjab agriculture department Director Sutantra Kumar Airi said they will achieve the target once sowing of all Kharif crops is completed. He said, Till date, rice crop on around 26 LH has already been sown which included around 20.50 lakh hectares paddy (over 5 lakh with DSR technique), and over 6 LH Basmati. We are expecting to cover at least one more lakh hectare under Basmati, the sowing of which will be completed by next week.He further said that under maize, they had targeted 3 LH, out of which sowing on 2.42 LH is done and around 8,000-10,000 hectares more area will be covered in the coming week and it will cross 2.50 LH. Maize had not seen area even up to 2-LH in the past two decades, he added.Data shows 25.19 LH area was under paddy in 2017-18, 25.05 LH in 2016-17 while area under Basmati was 5.46 LH in 2017-18 and 5.10 LH in 2016-17.All these three crops  Basmati, maize and cotton  need much lesser water as compared to paddy. Farmers of Punjab are ready to diversify area, but the poor market rate and lack of government support to these non MSP crops, especially Basmati and maize, discourage them to take the risk.

Between 15.4 to 64.5 mm is categorised as moderate.There was a 26% rain deficiency in Delhi from June 1 until Wednesday morning. It was expected to fall by Wednesday evening. Extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) was also recorded in parts of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.Regional Weather Forecasting Centre head Kuldeep Shrivastava said the monsoon trough is passing very close to Delhi and bringing rain to the city. The monsoon trough is passing along Ferozepur [Punjab], Hisar, Gurgaon, [Haryana] Daltonganj, Dumka [Jharkhand] and parts of Nagaland. Shrivastava said moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal was likely to bring rain again on Wednesday night and on Thursday.The western end of the trough has shifted southwards and is near to its normal position from Ganganagar (Rajasthan) to the Bay of Bengal, IMD said.IMD said widespread and heavy to very heavy rain is likely in Uttarakhand, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala on Wednesday and Thursday. Extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) was likely over places like Kerala.There has been just 1% excess rain since the beginning of the monsoon on June 1 across the country. Eastern and northeastern India have received 12% excess rainfall. There has been a 20% deficiency in rainfall in northwest India, 2% in central India, and 12% excess over the south peninsula. There is an 11% rain deficiency across the country in July with 30% over northwest India; 7.5% excess over east and northeast India; 20% deficiency over central India and 14.6% excess over the south peninsula.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of Indias annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.The formation of a cyclonic circulation around the South Bay of Bengal is a sign of weak monsoon. This is possibly the first time in several yearsa historical record that there was no low-pressure system forming over the Bay of Bengal in all of July and so rains have been deficient in the core monsoon zone. At least 12 to 15 low-pressure systems form over the Bay of Bengal every monsoon most in July and August. This July rain deficiency is 11%, said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre.Low-pressure systems are the main rain-producing systems during monsoon. Their formation depends on dynamics like the interaction of south-westerly and easterly winds, added Jenamani.IMD has also issued a moderate to severe thunderstorm and lightning warning for Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, and Rayalaseema on Thursday.I remember 2002 was a very bad year when hardly any low-pressure systems formed. Low-pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal are rain-bearing systems. When they move into the land, they bring a lot of rain so they are critical during monsoon.

I was introduced to Anisa and her delicious food by my friend, Ash Lilani, who has the good fortune to know Rezwan Razack (of the Prestige group), one of Bengalurus great gourmets.Rezwan often used Anisas catering service and he sent me the first batch of keema samosas. After that I ordered them each time I was in Bengaluru and took them everywhere with me. (Mumbai, Delhi, even the beach on an island in the Maldives!) Last week, Ash texted me the sad news. Anisa had passed away.I thought back to the first time I had tried the samosas. When I wrote about them, I had to persuade skeptical North Indians that there were Gujarati samosas. Gujaratis eat samosas? was the most common response. We had no idea.I had to explain to them that not only did Gujaratis make some of the best samosas in India, we also made exceptional biryanis. This led to more eye-rolling and expressions of surprise. But Gujaratis are vegetarians, I was told.The Spanish took the empanada to Central America ( Shutterstock )Well yes, most of us are. But some Gujarati Kshatriyas (the old royal families, for instance) do eat meat. And so do many of our minorities. Gujarat contains some of South Asias finest trading communities. Apart from the vanyas, there are also great Muslim trading communities such as the Bohras, the Khojas and the Memons.Anisas samosas were Memon samosas. (So was her biryani, but that is another story.) I doubt if they had a great deal to do with Punjabi samosas. I suspect that the Bohra/Khoja /Memon samosas evolved independently of the North Indian samosa. All they had in common was that they probably originated from the same source: the Middle East.Saying this leads, usually, to more huffing and puffing and such expressions of outrage as: You mean the samosa is not an Indian dish?The answer to that is yes, the samosas we eat (and there is more than one kind) are certainly Indian. But they did not originate in India. There is no shame in admitting that. The calzone of Italy, the coca of Spain (or Catalonia to be more precise) and even the empanada of Central America, all come from the same source. There are even versions of the empanada in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines that have the same origins.Anisa Siraj used to make the flakiest keema samosasThe ancestor of all these dishes is a Middle-Eastern dish called the sanbusak. The world sanbusak is derived from the Persian sanbusa meaning anything triangular. The dish first turns up in an Iraqi text in the early 9th century. It turns up again in a 12th century recipe book and by the 13th century, it is already being described as the triangular fried pastry you find in the Middle East today.During the middle ages, the Arabs were the worlds great traders, scholars, warriors and travellers and they took versions of the sanbusak East and West. In Spain (in Valencia, the region to which the Arabs also introduced rice), the sanbusak became the empanada. (The Spanish took the empanada to Central America.) In Majorca and other parts of Spain, it was called a coca. In Italy, it became a calzone.In each region, stuffings took on a local character. In Valencia, empanadas can be stuffed with tuna and tomato. In Bari, in the South of Italy, the stuffing could be mackerel. In Apulia, the calzone was stuffed with ricotta.Over time, the shapes changed too. In large parts of Europe, they abandoned the triangular shape and went for a semi-circle. In Italy, the Naples version of the calzone can look like a folded pizza, which is why some people think it is no more than a kind of pizza. (In fact, the two dishes have distinct origins.)The Western Indian samosa is far more delicate and delicious than the North Indian stodgy samosaSo, who brought the sanbusak to India and when did it become our own favourite snack?There is no agreement on this, because too much of our history is North India-based. In our retelling, everything is brought by invaders who arrive in Delhi and set up courts. Their food then travels around the country.This version of history (following a tradition created by British historians) forgets that Indian contacts with the rest of the world occurred at many different parts of the peninsula, and often they had to do with trade, not with armies and royal courts.There is no earthly reason for the Gujarati-Muslims of Indias west coast to make so many delicious samosas of their own (the Bohra samosa is even more famous than the Memon samosa), if the samosa only travelled across India, dispatched from Delhi.Anisas samosas were Memon samosas ( Shutterstock )As many of these communities were converted in the medieval era, it is more probable that their food habits were influenced by the Arabs who converted them. I would go so far as to argue that the Gujarati samosa has nothing to do with the Delhi chaat-wallah samosa. Both versions came from the Middle East, but they came separately and developed completely differently thousands of miles apart in different parts of India.All over the Middle East, there are two versions of the sanbusak. One version is deep-fried and another is baked. This is true of calzone as well. As calzone has travelled around the world and turned up on pizzeria menus, it has become a pastry baked in a pizza oven. But in Italy, it is often deep-fried.Did the Arabs bring us the deep fried version?Or did the baked sanbusak transform into a deep-fried samosa that could be made easily at every little dhaba without having to worry about access to an oven? Was it a mixture of both? Frankly, I dont know and I have never read a convincing historical explanation.But what is clear is that even within our deep fried samosas, there are two crucial variations. The first is the shape. Though the Persian origin of the name means triangular, as we have seen, the shape shifted on its travels. Anisas samosa could be rectangular in shape and Bohra samosas, while triangular, are usually much smaller than their burly Punjabi counterparts.The other primary difference  and this one is crucial  is the dough. The North Indian samosa has a one-dimensional, sturdy covering that holds the filling in place. Gujarati samosas on the other hand, have a thin (often flakey) covering, which gets delicately crisp when you fry them. Most Gujarati Muslim households that I know use store-bought pati (or wrapping) to make the samosas and the results are nearly always outstanding.In Italy, the Naples version of the calzone can look like a folded pizza ( Shutterstock )I dont know where Anisa got hers from but what made her Memon samosas so delicious was the flakiness of her pastry. It was not the kind of flakiness you associate with deep frying and it had more in common with baked pastry.The flakiest croissants I have had in Delhi are made by Sahil Mehta and he gets the flakiness, he says, by folding his dough again and again (probably twice as much as anyone else does), so that each layer of buttered pastry rises in the oven giving a flakey crispiness.But does this work when the samosa is deep-fried? I asked Rohit Sangwan of the Taj Lands End, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the science of baking always leaves me in awe. Rohit says that too many cooks start by making the dough with water rather than a fat. Start with fat, he says, and you will get a light flakiness that will survive deep-frying in a kadai. In the bad old days, says Rohit, chefs knew that margarine or lard would give a flakier pastry but now health concerns have led them to abandon that practice. (He is right but I suspect, many French chefs still use animal fat for flakiness.)So, which is the better samosa?Frankly, I think it is a no-contest. The Western Indian samosa is far more delicate and delicious than the North Indian stodgy samosa. Kainaz Contractor of Delhis Rustoms restaurant makes some of the citys most delicious samosas but makes it a point to order the Bohra pati from Mumbai to get the right flakiness and crispness for the outside of her Parsi samosas.But, of course, there is a strong case to be made for the North Indian samosa as a chaat staple and a tea-time snack. Put it next to say, a calzone or an empanada and it is not so different. Both of those dishes can have an equally stodgy crust.In the end, I guess it comes down to what you like. I am a pastry guy. I love flakey patties and buttery croissants, where the flakes settle on your shirt as you eat.If on the other hand, you like your samosas strong and podgy, and served with a chaat chutney, then the Punjabi version is the best.But never forget that whichever version you choose you are eating the descendant of a thousand-year-old dish that has travelled the world.From HT Brunch, August 2, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch","brunchupdated: aug 02, 2020 08:00 isti wrote, three years ago, about ordering delicious flakey keema samosas in bengaluru from anisas kitchen, a catering service run by the eponymous anisa. i was introduced to anisa and her delicious food by my friend, ash lilani, who has the good fortune to know rezwan razack (of the prestige group), one of bengalurus great gourmets.rezwan often used anisas catering service and he sent me the first batch of keema samosas. after that i ordered them each time i was in bengaluru and took them everywhere with me.

A large number of countries have already banned these pesticides and India should too, said experts. (Representational) According to Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), these pesticides are used on almost all crops. A large number of countries have already banned these pesticides and India should too, said experts. (Representational)The long-pending ban on 27 widely-used pesticides, which includes 12 insecticides, 8 fungicides and 7 herbicides, is poised to take final shape soon, with the Centre having already issued a draft order banning the manufacturing and sale of these on grounds of the grave risk they pose to humans and animals. The Indian Express explains what alternatives are available for farmers if such a ban is imposed, and how effective they will be:How much pesticide is used in Punjab as compared to the rest of the country?Punjab has just 1.53 per cent of the countrys area while pesticide usage stood at 9.2 per cent of the country in 2018-19 and over 8 per cent in 2019-20. According to the Directorate of Plant Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, consumption of chemical pesticides in the country was 59,670 metric tonnes (MT) in 2018-19 and 60,599 in 2019-20, while in Punjab it was 5,543 MT last year and around 4,930 MT in 2019-20. In Punjab, pesticide consumption is said to be decreasing, it is still continuous and excessive. The state used up 5,689 MT in 2014-15, and stands at no. 3 in usage after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, but both states have a 6-times larger area as compared to Punjab.Also, Punjab has now started using bio pesticides and its usage has increased from 136 MT in 2014-15 to 246 MT in 2018-19 and 286 MT in 2019-20, which is around 3 per cent of the countrys usage currently.There is still wide a variety of pesticides available to farmers for various uses. Punjab also tops the country in terms of per hectare usage of fertilisers.On which crops are these 27 pesticides mainly used?According to Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), these pesticides are used on almost all crops  rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, cotton, oilseeds, various vegetables, fruit etc. They said that Punjab can do away with these pesticides, even though there are no other alternatives available at present for around nine of the 27 pesticides. Experts said a large number of countries have already banned these pesticides and India should too.What are the alternatives available to farmers?There are three types of alternatives, the first one is Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, which are using cost-effective mechanical methods, second is bio-pesticides, and third is newer molecular target-specific low toxicity pesticides, usage of which is extremely low, and which are a little more expensive, said experts.Neem-based biopesticides, which are environment-friendly, is very effective cost-wise and yield-wise. Its bitter taste keeps pests away from plants. Moreover, the right kind of seeds and precise irrigation can also help farmers keep the pests away.Both PAU and Punjab agriculture department have been encouraging IPM extensively.Which methods are used to control pests under IPM?Under IPM, simple hand-picking, light traps, pheromone traps, sticky traps, glue boards etc. Are used to control pests. With the light trap, we switch on an electric bulb during night time for an hour close to the fields and keep an open mouthed utensil filled with water (in which 20 to 30 ml of diesel or petrol is mixed) under it. The pests get attracted to the light in the night and then we switch it off and all the attracted pests fall into the diesel/petrol mixed water and get killed. IPM aims to protect soil and the environment from poisonous elements, said farmer Amarjit Singh, who has been implementing IPM for long in Char-Ke village at Bhogpur area of Jalandhar.Pheromone traps, which are quite economical, are meant for mating disruption, for suppression of pest population, and mass trapping. Such traps slowly release synthetic attractants which help in the detection of a single species of insect in the fields.Apart from this, farmers also attract birds by installing dana ghar (seed shelters) in the fields and such birds consume the harmful insects in fields.Under IPM, heavy reliance needs to be placed upon monitoring and surveillance of the crops and fields, said experts.How does regular monitoring & surveillance help against pest attacks?It can make farmers aware of the presence of pests and insects in the field at an early stage, which helps them arrest the problem before it crosses the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) of the presence of these pests, said Professor Pardeep K Chhuneja, head, department of entomology, PAU, Ludhiana.For instance, Punjab had seen the lowest cotton productivity in 2015 when whitefly had attacked the cotton crop on a large area and its productivity went down to 197 kg lint (without cottonseed) per hectare. But we have not only decreased 30 per cent usage of pesticides in the cotton crop from 2016 to date but also increased its productivity to 756 kg lint per hectare in 2016, a year after the devastating loss of the cotton crop, 750 kg in 2017, 778 kg in 2018, and 800 kg in 2019, said Dr Chhuneja, adding that continuous monitoring and surveillance of crops was the major reason behind this success story.How else is less usage of pesticides beneficial?Experts said that instead of spraying herbicides to clear weeds, farmers can hire manual labour to remove it. This will not only save their fields from chemical sprays, the money spent on buying harmful pesticides can be diverted towards paying the labour engaged in handpicking such weeds.Farmers use herbicides to clean weeds like Bhang, Datura, Kanda, Peeli buti, Kanghi buti etc. from their fields and the area around the fields to keep pests away.

(representational) according to punjab agriculture university (pau), these pesticides are used on almost all crops. a large number of countries have already banned these pesticides and india should too, said experts. (representational)the long-pending ban on 27 widely-used pesticides, which includes 12 insecticides, 8 fungicides and 7 herbicides, is poised to take final shape soon, with the centre having already issued a draft order banning the manufacturing and sale of these on grounds of the grave risk they pose to humans and animals. the indian express explains what alternatives are available for farmers if such a ban is imposed, and how effective they will be:how much pesticide is used in punjab as compared to the rest of the country?punjab has just 1.53 per cent of the countrys area while pesticide usage stood at 9.2 per cent of the country in 2018-19 and over 8 per cent in 2019-20. according to the directorate of plant protection, ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare, consumption of chemical pesticides in the country was 59,670 metric tonnes (mt) in 2018-19 and 60,599 in 2019-20, while in punjab it was 5,543 mt last year and around 4,930 mt in 2019-20. in punjab, pesticide consumption is said to be decreasing, it is still continuous and excessive. the state used up 5,689 mt in 2014-15, and stands at no. 3 in usage after uttar pradesh and maharashtra, but both states have a 6-times larger area as compared to punjab.also, punjab has now started using bio pesticides and its usage has increased from 136 mt in 2014-15 to 246 mt in 2018-19 and 286 mt in 2019-20, which is around 3 per cent of the countrys usage currently.there is still wide a variety of pesticides available to farmers for various uses. punjab also tops the country in terms of per hectare usage of fertilisers.on which crops are these 27 pesticides mainly used?according to punjab agriculture university (pau), these pesticides are used on almost all crops  rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, cotton, oilseeds, various vegetables, fruit etc. they said that punjab can do away with these pesticides, even though there are no other alternatives available at present for around nine of the 27 pesticides. experts said a large number of countries have already banned these pesticides and india should too.what are the alternatives available to farmers?there are three types of alternatives, the first one

(Source: Bloomberg) Farmhands sow rice saplings at a flooded paddy field in Karnal district, Haryana. (Source: Bloomberg)Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis government is banking on a recovery in rural demand to slow the economys first contraction in four decades. But capricious rainfall may play spoilsport.After an impressive start and good rains in June, the monsoon petered out in July, a crucial month for growth of young grain plants and oilseeds such as rice, cotton and soybeans. Economists will be closely monitoring the rainfall pattern in the coming weeks for hints about the future of the rural economy.Indias agriculture has been the lone bright spot in the countrys shrinking economy, with the government as well as the central bank betting on rural demand to lift growth after recovering tractor sales pointed to a consumption revival. Any setback to the farm sector, which is dependent on monsoon rains to water more than half of the fields, may hamper an economic recovery.The spatial and geographical distribution is very important. When you look at some of these areas the situation is slightly worrying, said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research, the local unit of Fitch Ratings Ltd. We need to see whether the gap will be covered or not.About a fifth of the area in the country has received deficient monsoon rains since June, around half has got normal showers, while the rest have seen excess downpours. July, the wettest month, ended with a 10% deficit, which is potentially bad for crops.Deficient ShowersRains in the north-western region, including states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, have been 20% below normal so far this season, according to the India Meteorological Department. The central region got 7% less than normal rain, the eastern and north-eastern belt saw 10% more than average showers, while the southern peninsula witnessed 14% more than normal rainfall. India mainly grows rice, cotton, corn, sugar cane and oilseeds in the rainy season.The timely onset of the June-September monsoon, however, has helped reservoirs accumulate more water. The weather office is predicting normal rains in August and September, but economists and farmers are keeping a close eye on the monsoons behavior across the country.We are monitoring three things closely  the spatial distribution of rainfall, the pace of sowing, and reservoir levels, said Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Barclays Bank Plc. in Mumbai. Places which are not getting much rainfall are canal fed. So we have to watch carefully water reservoir levels, which are still quite good. Rains this month will be critical as this will have a significant bearing on crop output, he said.The monsoon shapes the livelihood of millions and influences food prices. Insufficient rain in the country, the second-biggest producer of rice and wheat, often leads to drinking water shortages, lower crop output and higher imports of commodities such as edible oils.Dilip Patidar, who has sown soybeans, peanuts, black lentils and corn in 6 hectares (14.8 acres) of land in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, is desperately waiting for rains to save his crops.My crops are at risk due to lack of irrigation as we havent got good rain in the last 43 days, Patidar said by phone. Immediate rain is needed to save crops that are drying. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2020-08-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-area-under-basmati-highest-in-5-years-but-still-short-of-target-6552498/,"Punjab: Area under Basmati highest in 5 years, but still short of target","Basmati does not come under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime and prices of non-MSP crops always keep fluctuating, due to which farmers prefer assured price crops like paddy.DESPITE BASMATI rice being at sold at high rates in the international market, Punjab could only increase the area under this crop by a little over 25,000 hectares (around 62,000 acres) as opposed to the target of 70,000 hectares.Basmati is among the crops being pushed by the Punjab government as part of crop diversification as an alternative to the water-guzzling paddy, which has had a severe effect on the states groundwater table.Basmati does not come under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime and prices of non-MSP crops always keep fluctuating, due to which farmers prefer assured price crops like paddy. However, the area under Basmati this year is the highest  4 per cent more as compared to last year  in the past five years.The rates of Basmati in the international market have gone up 20-25 per cent. Currently, Basmati varieties are being sold at Rs 60-72 per kg i.e Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,200 per quintal in the international market. According to a leading exporter, this is a very good rate and by these standards, more and more area should be brought under it.We request the Punjab government to increase the area under Basmati, which consumes less water and is the best alternative for paddy, said Ashok Sethi, director of Punjab Rice Millers Export Association (PRMEA).Farmers however could not earn much as they have to sell Basmati immediately in mandis to private players like exporters and big arhtiyas after harvesting and they only get what is the prevailing rate at that time.Last year farmers sold Basmati at the rate of Rs 2,500-3500 per quintal, and the same crop is now fetching Rs 6,000-7,000 per quintal in the international market to the exporters.Records show that Punjab had 5.10 LH under Basmati in 2016-17, 5.46 LH in 2017-18, 4.37 LH in 2018-19 and 6.25 LH in 2019-20. The total area under Basmati this year was recorded 6,50,150 hectares. Punjab government was expecting to increase this area to around 7 LH this year and wanted to keep paddy area up to 20 LH.According to data sourced from the Punjab agriculture department, the total paddy and Basmati area recorded this year is 27.36 LH including 6.50 LH of Basmati area and 20.86 LH paddy or non-Basmati.Last year, area under non-Basmati was 22.91 LH and and Punjab had been able to decrease 2.05 LH (5.06 lakh acres) from under paddy.The yield of paddy is around 28-30 quintals per acre against 20-22 quintals of Basmati per acre. As per MSP of paddy, which is Rs 1,868 per quintal, they will sell paddy worth around Rs 56,000 per acre. If the rate of Basmati remains at Rs 2,500- 3,000, they may sell Rs 55,000-66,000 crop from one acre, but there is no guarantee of Basmati rates at the time of harvesting. In the past, farmers were even forced to sell at the rate of Rs 1,100-2,000 per quintal.This Kharif season (which ended July 31), out of 22 districts, 15 witnessed an increase in Basmati area and 7 districts showed a decrease as compared to last year.Amritsar recorded the highest area under Basmati at 1.37 LH this year against 1.39 LH last year, a decrease of 2,000 hectares, followed by Tarn Taran which recorded 97,800 hectares against 95,000 hectares last year, an increase of 2,800 hectares. Muktsar is at no. 3 with 73,500 hectares against 63,000 hectares last year, an increase of 10,500 hectares.Sangrur has recorded 58,500 hectares against 46,000 hectares last year which marks an increase of 12,500 hectares on a year to year basis. Fazilka recorded 55,000 hectares this year against 76,000 hectares last year, a decrease of 21,000 hectares. Gurdaspur is at no. 6 with 42,900 hectares against 50,000 last year, a decrease of 7,100 hectares.We have no doubt diversified over two lakh hectares from water-guzzling paddy to other crops like Basmati, maize and cotton this year and wanted to increase around 7 LH hectare under Basmati, of which 6.50 LH area has already been covered. We are expecting some 1,000 hectares to come under Basmati as some short-duration varieties are still being sown in Punjab, said Director, Punjab Agriculture Department, Dr Sutantra Kumar Airi, adding that Basmati area is highest in the state this year since 2016 and if the fluctuation of prices of non-MSP crops like Basmati is controlled, then much more area would come under it.

2020-08-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/as-long-as-i-am-here-free-farm-power-will-continue-amarinder-6556204/,"As long as I am here, free farm power will continue: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh","Earlier, in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, the Council of Ministers noted the constitutional requirement to hold a session within six months of the previous session and decided on a day-long session within two sittings on August 28.AFTER THE Group of Experts led by noted economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia termed free farm power as damaging for states finances, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Friday ruled out withdrawing free power to farmers in the state asserting the same will continue as long as he is leading the government.The Chief Minister said that though the report of the Montek Singh Ahluwalia panel was only a preliminary one, his government would not consider any recommendation on withdrawal of free power by any expert. As long as I am here, free power to tubewells will continue, he said.Amarinder had constituted the Group of Experts himself in April to bring the states economy back on track. The group had recently submitted its preliminary report to the government.Free farm power is considered a major drain on states resources and power subsidy bill has crossed Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal. The GoEs report had called the subsidy regressive as it benefitted big farmers. Farmers being the major vote bank in Punjab, no political party has been able to rationalise it. Several suggestions have been made that it should be given to only the small farmers but vote-bank politics does not allow any government of the day to take action.Chief Ministers declaration about rejection of Montek committee report on farm power subsidy came at a presentation by the GoE to Amarinder on Friday.A government statement quoted Montek Ahluwalia that he himself clarified during a virtual interaction with the Chief Minister that the report of the expert group was not anti-farmer.Media reports suggesting so were misleading, he was quoted as saying, adding that what the group had suggested was diversification as the only hope for Punjab agriculture.Montek said that since the state government had categorically announced that it had no plans to change its free power for farmers policy, the expert group had recommended that farmers must be incentivised to diversify out of rice, since the water intensive crop was economically profitable for farmers even though the ecological damage was massive. Diversification implies a reduction in area under rice and modernisation of marketing, which in turn implies a much larger role for the private sector, he said.The statement quoted Amarinder saying diversification had already been started in Punjab during his first term as CM. He pointed out that the state had significantly increased cotton area this year by reducing paddy, but the problem of price support remains a big obstacle to diversification. The farmers need MSP for alternate crops to incentivise them away from paddy, he added.Punjab was a power-surplus state, which was why his government had also fixed industrial power rate at Rs 5 per unit, in order to incentivise industry to invest in the state, the Chief Minister said. He underlined the need for promoting industry with the potential to generate more employment.Underscoring the need for long-term planning to restore Punjab to its position of pre-eminence, Montek said while the state had done better than others in handling the Covid crisis, it would need to increase allocation for health, like the rest of the country. Similar pandemics could not be ruled out in the future, he warned, adding that in the medium term, public health expenditure needs to be pushed up to 20 per cent of the total for the next five years.Suggesting radical policy changes to reverse the declining trend in economy, Montek said these would need to be anchored directly by the Chief Ministers office, in association with industry representatives, to avoid any bureaucratic resistance to change. Noting that Punjab needed more improvement in ease of doing business index, he said mid-2021 should be kept as target by the state to complete the necessary changes for triggering the wave of industrialisation.Of the 128 recommendations listed by the group, even if 100 are met, Punjab would make major strides in industrial growth, he added. Our objective should be to have made enough changes in the existing rules and regulations over the next six months that industry on the ground feels that things have changed significantly, Montek said.Be ready to pay heavy price if you withdraw free power: SAD to CMShiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday warned Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh against the withdrawal of the free power facility to the farmers introduced in 1997 by the Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD-BJP government.If you take a single step towards discontinuing free power to farmers, you must prepare yourself and your government to face an unprecedented mass movement by the SAD to safeguard the interests of the already beleaguered peasantry. We will never allow free power to be stopped, the SAD president said, while reacting to reports about the recommendations of a committee set up by the Punjab government and headed by former deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia to suggest ways to revive the Punjab economy in the wake of the lockdown following the Covid-19 pandemic.In a written statement, Sukhbir said that the SAD rejects this report as inimical to farmers and accepting its recommendations would amount to signing the death warrant of poor farmers.He also asked the CM to realise the gravity of the issue and reject today itself the recommendations of the Congresss blue-eyed economist, Montek Singh Ahluwalia who has described the free power facility as regressive and advised the govt to stop it.Sukhbir also lashed out at the other recommendation of Ahluwallia-led group of experts in which the group had advised the state government to slow down the procurement of paddy in the state. The SAD president said that this recommendation of the Congress-loyalist economist sets the cat out of the bag. This is the clinching proof of who really wants to stop assured procurement of farmers produce by the government.Sukhbir said, Free power to farmers has been the most progressive contribution of Parkash Singh Badal to farmers and to the national economy as it has completely secured our food kitty and saved billions of dollars in foreign exchange alone through self-reliance and export in foodgrains. It is strange that some arm-chair economists, sitting in air-conditioned rooms in the metropolitan cities pretend to understand farm economics better than the generations of farmers who have spent their lives toiling in midsummer heat in the farms.Sukhbir said that Captain Amarinder Singh had always been looking for excuses to stop free power to farmers. He had actually withdrawn this facility during his previous tenure as CM during 2002-07 before the SAD forced him through a mass movement to resume it. He has now created a new fig leaf in the form of the recommendations of Ahluwalia to cover his true dislike of this life-saving relief given to the farmers by the Badal government. Farmers are already on the brink of a disaster with the ever-increasing costs of farm inputs and the failure of the prices of their produce to keep pace with the rising costs.

chaired by chief minister amarinder singh, the council of ministers noted the constitutional requirement to hold a session within six months of the previous session and decided on a day-long session within two sittings on august 28.after the group of experts led by noted economist montek singh ahluwalia termed free farm power as damaging for states finances, punjab cm amarinder singh on friday ruled out withdrawing free power to farmers in the state asserting the same will continue as long as he is leading the government.the chief minister said that though the report of the montek singh ahluwalia panel was only a preliminary one, his government would not consider any recommendation on withdrawal of free power by any expert. as long as i am here, free power to tubewells will continue, he said.amarinder had constituted the group of experts himself in april to bring the states economy back on track. the group had recently submitted its preliminary report to the government.free farm power is considered a major drain on states resources and power subsidy bill has crossed rs 10,000 crore this fiscal. the goes report had called the subsidy regressive as it benefitted big farmers. farmers being the major vote bank in punjab, no political party has been able to rationalise it. several suggestions have been made that it should be given to only the small farmers but vote-bank politics does not allow any government of the day to take action.chief ministers declaration about rejection of montek committee report on farm power subsidy came at a presentation by the goe to amarinder on friday.a government statement quoted montek ahluwalia that he himself clarified during a virtual interaction with the chief minister that the report of the expert group was not anti-farmer.media reports suggesting so were misleading, he was quoted as saying, adding that what the group had suggested was diversification as the only hope for punjab agriculture.montek said that since the state government had categorically announced that it had no plans to change its free power for farmers policy, the expert group had recommended that farmers must be incentivised to diversify out of rice, since the water intensive crop was economically profitable for farmers even though the ecological damage was massive. diversification implies a reduction in area under rice and modernisation of marketing, which in turn implies a much larger role for the private sector, he said.the statement quoted amarinder saying diversification had already been started in punjab during his first term as cm. he pointed out that the state had significantly increased cotton area this year by reducing paddy, but the problem of price support remains a big obstacle to diversification. the farmers need msp for alternate crops to incentivise them away from paddy, he added.punjab was a power-surplus state, which was why his government had also fixed industrial power rate at rs 5 per unit, in order to incentivise industry to invest in the state, the chief minister said. he underlined the need for promoting industry with the potential to generate more employment.underscoring the need for long-term planning to restore punjab to its position of pre-eminence, montek said while the state had done better than others in handling the covid crisis, it would need to increase allocation for health, like the rest of the country. similar pandemics could not be ruled out in the future, he warned, adding that in the medium term, public health expenditure needs to be pushed up to 20 per cent of the total for the next five years.suggesting radical policy changes to reverse the declining trend in economy, montek said these would need to be anchored directly by the chief ministers office, in association with industry representatives, to avoid any bureaucratic resistance to change. noting that punjab needed more improvement in ease of doing business index, he said mid-2021 should be kept as target by the state to complete the necessary changes for triggering the wave of industrialisation.of the 128 recommendations listed by the group, even if 100 are met, punjab would make major strides in industrial growth, he added. our objective should be to have made enough changes in the existing rules and regulations over the next six months that industry on the ground feels that things have changed significantly, montek said.be ready to pay heavy price if you withdraw free power: sad to cmshiromani akali dal president sukhbir singh badal on friday warned chief minister captain amarinder singh against the withdrawal of the free power facility to the farmers introduced in 1997 by the parkash singh badal-led sad-bjp government.if you take a single step towards discontinuing free power to farmers, you must prepare yourself and your government to face an unprecedented mass movement by the sad to safeguard the interests of the already beleaguered peasantry. we will never allow free power to be stopped, the sad president said, while reacting to reports about the recommendations of a committee set up by the punjab government and headed by former deputy chairman of planning commission montek singh ahluwalia to suggest ways to revive the punjab economy in the wake of the lockdown following the covid-19 pandemic.in a written statement, sukhbir said that the sad rejects this report as inimical to farmers and accepting its recommendations would amount to signing the death warrant of poor farmers.he also asked the cm to realise the gravity of the issue and reject today itself the recommendations of the congresss blue-eyed economist, montek singh ahluwalia who has described the free power facility as regressive and advised the govt to stop it.sukhbir also lashed out at the other recommendation of ahluwallia-led group of experts in which the group had advised the state government to slow down the procurement of paddy in the state. the sad president said that this recommendation of the congress-loyalist economist sets the cat out of the bag. this is the clinching proof of who really wants to stop assured procurement of farmers produce by the government.sukhbir said, free power to farmers has been the most progressive contribution of parkash singh badal to farmers and to the national economy as it has completely secured our food kitty and saved billions of dollars in foreign exchange alone through self-reliance and export in foodgrains. it is strange that some arm-chair economists, sitting in air-conditioned rooms in the metropolitan cities pretend to understand farm economics better than the generations of farmers who have spent their lives toiling in midsummer heat in the farms.sukhbir said that captain amarinder singh had always been looking for excuses to stop free power to farmers. he had actually withdrawn this facility during his previous tenure as cm during 2002-07 before the sad forced him through a mass movement to resume it. he has now created a new fig leaf in the form of the recommendations of ahluwalia to cover his true dislike of this life-saving relief given to the farmers by the badal government. farmers are already on the brink of a disaster with the ever-increasing costs of farm inputs and the failure of the prices of their produce to keep pace with the rising costs. the indian express is

(Photo: Gurmeet Singh)A day after ordering weekend and night curfew in all cities of the state, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh Friday ordered imposition of Section 144 to prohibit all gatherings of more than 5 persons, other than marriage and bhog ceremonies.While warning of strict action against organisers of such gatherings, the CM made it clear that he would not hesitate to take any harsh steps necessary to save lives and indicated even more stringent measures after August 31, if needed to check Covid spread and save the lives of the people of Punjab.He appealed to all political parties to avoid any gatherings, including protests. In case of any violation of Section 144, the organisers who are putting people at risk by organising such gatherings or allowing people to gather without masks will be arrested, he said.The Chief Minister also requested all religious and community leaders to ask their followers to take all restrictions/precautions as imposed and not to violate Section 144, in the interest of the state, which was witnessing an increase in Covid cases. He also directed the police to strictly enforce prescribed number and social distancing at marriage and bhog ceremonies.Amarinder said that the average daily increase for the last seven days was over 1400, and mortality rate was 2.5 per cent.While addressing the people of the state during his Facebook Live #AskCaptain, Amarinder warned that if people do not take necessary precautions, things will only get worse. Talking tough, he said people were taking thing lightly forcing the government to take harsh measures. The CM said it was shocking that people were not wearing masks and that there were 3000-6000 cases of people being challaned for not wearing masks on a daily basis.On Thursday, the Chief Minister had ordered re-imposition of several lockdown restrictions in the state, including weekend lockdown, daily night curfew from 7 pm to 5 am in all cities/towns, shutdown of 50 per cent non-essential shops in the 5 big towns of Punjab (Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Amritsar and Mohali) on daily basis, all government and private offices to work at 50 per cent strength, and private cars to ply with not more than 3 persons with buses and public transport to ply at 50 per cent capacity. The Department of Home issued guidelines on these restrictions on Friday.Cases to cross 1 lakh by Sept 15Urging people to pay heed to his repeated appeals, Amarinder said: Why dont we understand that the precautions are necessary for saving your lives and those of other Punjabis. Noting that the state was headed towards a peak, he said by September 3, the cases in Punjab are projected to go up to 64,000, and cross one lakh by September 15. Deaths will also increase, with experts estimating over 1,500 deaths by September 3, he warned, hoping that the people will listen to him and take due precautions. We dont have to let Punjab go the America way, he added.Stressing that testing and timely treatment was the key, Amarinder said it was important to report to hospitals within 72 hours of onset of symptoms.The Chief Minister also reiterated his appeal to recovered patients to donate plasma for saving the lives of others. Many police personnel and PCS officers have already pledged their plasma, he pointed out, urging all citizens who had been cured of the disease to do it too.On SYL rowHe expressed the hope that Haryana will see Punjabs viewpoint on the issue of SYL, given the latters critical ground water situation.Haryana already has more water than Punjab and will get additional 1MAF of water through the Sharda-Yamuna Link Canal project, said the Chief Minister, hoping that his Haryana counterpart CM Manohar Lal Khattar will look at the issue from a realistic perspective when they meet soon to discuss the matter.He underlined the need to understand and adhere to international principles on water sharing, as per which all agreements on this precious resource have to be reviewed after 25 years. This was what he had told the Union Minister and Khattar during his video- conference with them, convened earlier this week on the directions of the Supreme Court, he added.The Chief Minister further said he had told the Centre and Haryana that the Eradi Commission was 35 years old and there was need for reassessment of water availability in Punjab, which now has 109 dark blocks as a result of massive detrimental effects on its rivers due to global warning.Punjab has fed the nation and has a much larger cultivated area than Haryana, he pointed out, adding that Haryanas total availability of river water stood at 12.48 MAF as against Punjabs 12.42 MAF. Even though other assets were divided between the two states in 60:40 ratio at the time of Haryanas creation, the same was not done for the Yamuna river water, he noted.On ordinancesReplying to another question from a Tanda resident on the steps being taken by the Punjab government in response to the agricultural ordinances introduced by the Centre, the Chief Minster said his government was strongly opposed to the same and will not accept them at any cost. The ordinances were aimed at shutting down FCI and eliminating the MSP regime, which will spell the death knell for the faring community, he said.The Union government had announced support prices for crops other than wheat and rice but yet there was no guaranteed purchase, he observed, adding that the farming community could not be protected if the MSP regime came to an end.Cleanliness rankingAmarinder expressed happiness over Punjabs Swachhta Survey (Urban) ranking, as per which it was at number 5 in the big states in terms of cleanliness. He congratulated the Nawanshahr team for retaining its ranking among the top cities over the last three years. He suggested having competition between various districts on cleanliness, as that would help the state further improve its national ranking.He hailed Mohali district on becoming one of the first nine districts in India to achieve 100 per cent target in terms of providing drinking water connections to rural households. The Chief Minister also congratulated Sagar Setia, SDM Budhlada, for the beautification work done by him in his town.In response to the request made by an environmentalist to ensure responsibility of the upkeep of the trees planted/being planted to mark the anniversaries of the great Sikh Gurus, the Chief Minister said conservation of the environment was a collective responsibility and we should take it upon ourselves to not only help saplings to survive, but also to plant as many more as we can.In response to a question from a Ludhiana resident seeking clarification on rumours in his village of the state government getting Rs 3 lakh from Centre for every Covid positive patient, the Chief Minister categorically denied receiving any money from the central government for the Covid fight. This information is wrong, not a single rupee has been received, he said, adding that his government had repeatedly, in fact, written to the Centre for financial support to fight the pandemic.Appeal to agitating employeesThe CM appealed to striking employees of Group C & D of the Secretariat and Districts to return to work, saying the government was trying to fulfill their pending demands.Even amid the prevailing crisis, the government was looking into their demands, Amarinder assured the employees, who went on strike after withdrawal of their mobile phone allowances. The employees have not reported for work since then, seeking resolution of their pending issues.On paddy procurementAssuring of fool-proof and efficient arrangements for paddy procurement by his government, Amarinder urged farmers not to go for early harvesting of their rice crop.Making it clear that his government was fully prepared for the paddy procurement, as it had been for wheat, the Chief Minister said bringing the grain to the mandis early would be detrimental as it would simply lie around there till it gets picked up. Harvest and bring the grain only when it is ripe, he urged the farmers while responding to a question by a Samrala resident.To a request from an Amritsar resident for restarting special flights to take Punjabs vegetables to different parts of the country, and to tie up with industries for direct procurement as he had done during his previous term as chief minister, Captain Amarinder said he would surely be looking into it.Inquiry against ASITo a question, he said he was asking the DGP to inquire into and take action, including dismissal, against the Tarn Taran ASI caught consuming chitta in a social media post. Such actions will not be tolerated, he added.Job Melas from next monthHe said that the process of facilitation of 6 lakh jobs, including 1 lakh in government sector, between FY 2021 and FY 2022, will commence next month.On the pending recruitment for PSPCL posts even 6 months after declaration of the results, the Chief Minister assured a Jalandhar resident that the process was delayed due to lockdown but appointment letters have already been issued to 2393 selected candidates for Assistant Linesmen and 71 Assistant Engineer (Electrical).

They discovered that the root and shoot length and rate of seed germination of these coated seeds showed marked improvement in comparison to normal seeds.According to the National Policy for Management of Crop Residue (NPMCR), 70 per cent of the crop residue in the country comes from cereals. India produces 501.73 million tonnes of agriculture residue every year, of which 92.81 million tonnes is simply burned, finding no purpose in any form.Husk, bran, straw, stover, skin, molasses and bagasse are some of the agro-waste products obtained from rice, wheat, maize, millet and sugarcane. Farmers usually burn these waste products after harvest, often leading to massive air pollution as experienced in Delhi during winters.Residual matter from rice and sugarcane contribute to at least 34 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, of the total residue.Annually, the states generating the most farm residue (in million tonnes) include Uttar Pradesh  59.97, Punjab  50.75, Maharashtra  46.45, Andhra Pradesh  43.89 and Karnataka  339.94.The researchers used powdered press mud, which is a type of sugarcane waste, and inoculated with 10 ml each of Bacillus circulans and Bacillus subtilis.

A workout regime is no different. There is a reason why it is referred to as the fitness lifestyle and not just a fitness hobby. Sometimes, however, its hard to stay motivated all the time, especially when the world is in the throes of a global pandemic that has stranded everyone at home. Most public places have remained closed during the coronavirus-led lockdown, particularly gyms and sports clubs.For motivation, we can look to some of the most recognisable faces in the Hindi film industry, who despite being 40 or above have not let themselves slack for even a moment. Not only do these actors excel in their craft, they are all family men who not only inspire their children but us as well, to keep pushing and working hard for our fitness goals. Their Instagram pages are littered with their workout pictures and regimes that are certain to keep anyone motivated.Akshay KumarThe actor may be 52 but he has never been fitter in his life. He is easily one of the most good looking and fittest of all Bollywood celebrities. He sets such fitness goals for himself that he is the only one capable of pulling them off.

His diet is completely vegan and consists of only home-cooked meals.Farhan AkhtarFarhan Akhtar has gone through many body transformations for his various roles.

Ive always refrained from indulging in things that could have adverse effects on my body.Hrithik RoshanHrithik Roshan has been the talk of the entire industry in terms of his physique and dancing abilities since his debut in Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai (2000).

His work out regime includes high intensity cardio and weight training and he is a firm believer in eating small meals at regular intervals to keep hunger pangs at bay.Anil KapoorAnil Kapoor is keeping as fit at the age of 63 as he was at 33. The actor can be spotted at the gym various times in a week through his Instagram and he is looking finer by the day.

2020-09-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/basmati-mandis-farmers-exporters-demand-waiver-market-fee-rural-development-cess-6581143/,"Before arrival of Basmati in mandis, farmers, exporters demand waiver of market fee, rural development cess","Basmati would hit the states mandis this month.Ahead of the arrival of early varieties of Basmati in mandi, Punjab farmers and exporters are demanding a waiver of market fee and rural development fund (RDF) cess charged from exporters when they purchase Basmati from the farmers at Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) premises.They argue that this move will help farmers get good price for their crop from exporters, who are the main purchasers of the Basmati, adding that these taxes are otherwise also refundable to the exporters.Basmati would hit the states mandis this month.Exporters said they pay 6.5 per cent tax in total on purchase of Basmati which includes market committee fee and RDF at the rate of 3 per cent each.A leading exporter said: As per the norms, Basmati exporters are not supposed to pay any tax and the RDF and market fee charged from them is also refundable. But for the past 2-3 years, no refund was given to the exporters by the Mandi Board and over Rs 200 crore of such funds are lying pending with the government.We have written to the Punjab government to issue directions to the Mandi Board to release our long pending Market Fee and RDF dues on priority basis, said Ashok Sethi, Director Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association, adding that if exporters will not get this refund and they are asked to pay both RDF and market fee then it would affect the farmers ultimately.Another leading exporter said that when exporter will be required to pay these heavy taxes, he will certainly keep the price low at the time of purchase.Other exporters that spoke to The Indian Express also Centres recent ordinances have raised many important issues which require immediate intervention of the state government.While Punjab Assembly has passed a resolution against this ordinance, other Basmati growing states like UP, Haryana, Himachal etc. have accepted the new ordinance and issued new advisories like waiving off market fee and RDF while levying user charges (To use the yard of state Mandis) at very low percentage like Haryana would charge 1% use charges, said Sethi, adding that taxes and levies are much higher in Punjab at over 6.5 per cent and this huge disparity in taxes and levies would affect the purchase from farmers.In such a condition, exporters will purchase more from those states where user charges are minimum and will pay less to the farmers here when they will have to spend more on the taxes, said an exporter.They demanded that the situation should be cleared before Basmati varieties like 1509 hit markets by the first week of September.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda General Secretary Jagmohan Singh said that Basmati is one of the best alternative against Paddy (Parmal rice). We support that taxes should not be levied on the traders or exporters when they purchase it from the farmers in the mandis but certainly when traders sell it further and make profits, a portion of the profit share must be charged by the government to utilise that amount for the development of our rural area from where farmers come to the mandis to sell their produce to the exporters, he said.When exporters are free from such charges, government should not charge from them because they assume that they will not get the refund of these taxes and pay less to farmers and made big profits from farmers produce by exporting the premium crop, said a Basmati grower Devinder Singh of Tarn Taran, who grows Basmati on 50 to 70 acres every year.Nearly 2.5 Million Tonnes Basmati is brought to the markets of PMB every year by the farmers.

This year, basmati was grown over 17.5 lakh acres and arrival of the aromatic produce has started in some parts.Demanding rationalisation of the mandi fee and RDF, the exporters said they will like to purchase levy-free basmati as per the ordinance and buy paddy either directly from the farmers or from other states which offer exemptions.It is important to add that the basmati growing states of Haryana, UP, Uttrakhand and Jammu and Kashmir have notified that they will be levying only 1% user charges on the produce brought to their mandi yards while adhering to the new norms under the ordinance which would definitely make the Punjab paddy costly, with 4% fees and fund being levied by the state, said association director Ashok Sethi. He led a delegation of rice exporters from state to meet cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Sunday for clarity over the matter.Sethi said Bajwa assured the exporters that the state government would come to the rescue of the rice millers by bringing parity in taxes, allowing the industry to grow further while giving better rates to the farmers. According to Bajwa, agro processing ventures are an important segment and he will apprise the Punjab CM for a possible way out.Top officers in the mandi board revealed that the matter was under consideration of the top brass in the state and a statement will be issued shortly.According to rice exporters, the taxes imposed by Punjab government will leave their trade uneconomical and render their rice export unviable as they cant compete with the exporters based in Haryana, UP and Delhi as the disparity of taxes would lead to financial crisis.The rice exports had a phenomenal growth during last three years with exports from state touching Rs 14,000 crore, out of the total countrys export of Rs 34,000 crore as per the latest figures released by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).The association claimed that it remained at the forefront in educating basmati growers to use minimal pesticides and other agro-chemicals so that the produce is accepted worldwide.

The low price the crop is fetching for farmers in Punjabs Majha region, which is the hub of Basmati crop in the state, is happening at a time when the rates of Basmati in the international market are almost all-time high between Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 per quintal and exporters are earning a huge profit.What I have sold at Rs 1,651per quintal, traders will sell at the rate of Rs 3,000 to 3,200 per quintal, and then it would be exported for over Rs 5,000 per quintal, said Pavitar Singh, adding that he could not hold out for long hoping for better price as he has no place to store his produce. The Tarn Taran farmer grows the early variety on 20 acres out of his 60 acres farmland and has so far harvested PUSA 1509 only on 3 acres.While the early variety (1509) arrival has started peaking at the mandis, the late ones (1121, 1718) will come in October. Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) officials informed that the rate of the crop started at Rs 2,400 per quintal in the first few days, but now with as arrival of the early variety of the crop is about to touch its peak, the rates have crashed badly.Basmati crop is not purchased by the government, and the private players  exporters, local traders and sheller owners  who purchase it have to pay a 4.50 per cent Mandi fee and Rural Development Fund (RDF) to the PMB. This tax is refundable to the exporters.They are offering a lesser price because they know that as per the ordinance they are not supposed to pay 4.50 per cent taxes and also because the government has not refunded their previous years taxes. So, when they failed to get back their refundable amount from the government, they started targeting farmers and paying less to them while making huge margins themselves, said a senior officer in PMB, adding that ultimately it is the farmer who will face the losses.The big traders are calculating and deducting their 4.50 per cent taxes before paying farmers and it is big loot, he added.Farmers call the low price being offered to them as an impact of the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance.Farmer Gurinder Singh also sold 38 quintals at Rayya Mandi in Amritsar at the rate of Rs 1,800 per quintal on Wednesday.Similarly, Aman Kaler of Ajnala in Amritsar also sold his Basmati produce for Rs 1,800 per quintal.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakuanda General Secretary, Jagmohan Singh, said that the government can now see for itself how much the ordinance would help farmers.For non-government purchase crops, the private players always join hands and offer farmers as per their own wishes and same would happen with assured market crops like wheat and paddy when this ordinance will come into existence, he said, adding that for Basmati farmers were getting price lower than paddy (parmal rice).Traders are telling us that rate would not go up due to Covid-19 and farmers have no choice but to sell at this price only as they cannot store their produce for long, said another farmer, Davinder Singh, who has grown PUSA 1509 on 30 acres and will start harvesting in the coming week. He added that that traders gang-up and create false price in the market when the crops arrival in the mandis is at the peak and after purchasing from farmers the rates are suddenly changed and go up.Punjabs Basmati is mainly exported and it contributes more than 40 per cent of the total export of Basmati worth Rs 34,000 crore per annum.Vijay Kalra, President of the Federation of Arhtiya Association Punjab, admitted that the rate is less as compared to last year. He said that in Amritsar it was purchased around Rs 2,200 to 2,300 per quintal in the beginning but now some farmers are getting less because there must be high moisture in the grain currently.Director, Punjab Agriculture Department, Dr Sutantra Airy said that they have worked hard to increase the area under paddy as it is the best alternatives to water-guzzling paddy, but the fluctuation in rates would discourage farmers to increase the area further. He said that Centre must control these rates to ensure farmers do not suffer.Out of a total of around 6.60 lakh hectares of the Basmati area, PUSA 1509 is sown on around 40 per cent of the area.Exporters not purchasing yetThe Basmati exporters, who are major buyers of Basmati in Punjab, have boycotted the purchase of the premium rice from the state unless the Punjab government does not waive off Market Committee Fee and Rural Development Fund (RDF).Ashok Sethi, Director, Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association, said: We have demanded from the government a complete waiver of Market Fee and RDF, which is 4.5 per cent, and only after that we will purchase it.

The House passed The Appropriation Bills No. 3 and No. 4 of 2020.On the other hand Rajya Sabha passed four Bills in less than four hours. The Upper House too was adjourned for 30 minutes to mourn the death of Karnataka MP Ashok Gasti.(For a concise report on the daily going-ons in the Parliament, subscribe to our political newsletter. Subscribe here and get it in your inbox.)Here are the latest updates:10 pm | Lok SabhaUnion Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman thanks all the 25 members who spoke on the grants issue. She says that this is the first time that an amount this large has been pitched. This is because the gross additional expenditure, with the net cash outgo, is probably one of the highest that budgets have ever seen in india.She highlights that the additional resources which are being placed in the first supplementary demand is largely going towards people-centric activity and some of the most critical government schemes like the PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.The MNREGA scheme has been allotted Rs 40,000 crore, with which the total amount touches Rs. 1 lakh crore- the highest ever spent amountt on MNREGA. Opponents should also recognise this, she says, alleging that under the UPA, the funds of MNREGA went to ghost accounts according to a CAG report.The total transfer to the States- tax plus grants- is 19% more than last year, she says. ""The total transfer to states exceeds centre's gross tax revenue- it is at 107%,"" she adds. The centre has gone much beyond what it had in protecting the States. ""61% of grants put in the budget provisions has already been given. There is a frontload.""FDI in this country is not coming only to ""the names you love to repeat"", Ms. Sitharaman says.On the 63 new entries, she says, a new line has been introduced for affordable housing for the middle classes, among other new windows.""Rs 500 for 3 months has gone to 20 crore poor women. Wages under MNREGA has increased to Rs 202 per day,"" she says. On GST compensation, she says ""I am happy everybody kept recalling the 'act of god' expression. Everybody's happy when I use the term force majeure. This is all because I am a woman who looks very much like 'your neighbourhood aunty',"" she says.Excess grants for 2020-21 and 2016-17 are passed by a voice vote.The Appropriation Bills are passed. House is adjourned till 3 p.m. on Saturday.9.30 pm | Lok SabhaN.K. Premachandran, RSP, seeks clarification regarding 63 new entries for instruments of service. ""The major amount of Rs 46602 crore grant for revenue deficit, that has been sought- did the government not foresee it?"" he asks.He says that the slowdown of the Indian economy had started much before the COVID-19 pandemic.Kunwar Danish Ali, BSP, demands that Jamia Millia Islamia university, which completes 100 years this year, should be given Rs 100 crore grant as per norms. India will be 'atmanirbhar' only when farmers and labourers will get their rights, he adds.9 pm | Lok SabhaGaurav Gogoi, INC, says Congress leader Rahul Gandhi predicted the ""economic tsunami"". In India, we have had the strictest lockdown and the smallest fiscal stimulus, he alleges.The burden on the poor has increased with the rise in petrol and diesel prices, he says. ""The Finance Minister is only focussed on catchy words. Atmanirbhar Bharat is only a rehashed version of Make in India.""Instead of helping the States in the time of need, it has been abdicating its legal and moral responsinility to the States, he says. ""The Finance Minister must reconsider her options... You have the money to spend Rs 20,000 crore for an extravagant Central Vista Project. This Bill completely misses the need of the States, especially Assam.""He requests the Union Finance Minister to ""step aside"". He proposes the creation of an emergency financial recovery commission.Jayadev Galla, TDP, says businesses like travel, tourism, construction and the MSMEs have suffered more than the others during the pandemic. The financial position of A.P. is on the verge of collapse with 5% fiscal deficit. ""None of the 29 commitments made in the A.P. Reorganisation Act have been fulfilled."" He adds that MPLADS funds should not be touched.A.M. Ariff, CPI(M), asks why the demand for grants for the police should be supported when they have attempted to ""put behind bars"" persons who opposed the CAA and the NRC.8 pm | Lok sabhaBJD's Bhartruhari Mahtab says India faces military, health and economic threats. ""Contracting economy may inhibit our ability to feed our children.""He cites economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia to say that reforms fall into 3 groups- 40% of it can be done by the centre, another 40% by the States and the centre, and another 20% by the States alone. ""There is a need to be agreeable across the centre and the states.""""There is a need to push more money into the economy and the government has been doing that,"" he says. ""Government finances are already stressed... India cannot afford to be too fiscally restrained in these distressing times.""He suggests that there is no harm in bringing loans from international institutions.There is a need to keep tabs on the number of migrant workers and on the ""urban poor"". What specific programme is being undertaken for the urban poor, he asks. He also speaks on the recent Odisha floods. ""There is a demand from the Odisha government for Rs 11,000 crores.""BSP's Ritesh Pandey says the decline of the once-vibrant Indian economy is not the result of an ""act of god"" but an ""act of bad governance"". ""I hope whatever supplementary grants are given to the government go to the poor"". The youth of Ambedkar Nagar and U.P. are still awaiting employment, he says.7.20 pm | Lok SabhaDMK's Dayanidhi Maran objects to the use of expression ""Act of God"" by Finance Minister NNirmala Sitharaman on the issue revenue loss of the States.""Demonetisation was a man-made pandemic, and then GST was hurriedly introduced.""How can the Centre expect the States to go for additional borrowing? The Centre is accountable for providing GST compensation to the States.""The Central government's policy and financial response to the COVID crisis has been lukewarm; the economy has collapsed under the weight of the pandemic. It has not undertaken any economic reforms in the last six years,"" Mr. Maran says. He also questions the government's response that it had no data on migrant workers. He seeks release of a white paper on the economic crisis.""It is the middle class which is left out year after year when it comes to giving relief packages. Consumption is the only driver which will improve the situation. Covid-19 has affected the middle class the most, which has also suffered job losses.""The middle class has been given only lip service. No serious relief has been given to the common man. Why are you avoiding the middle class, who are expected to pay taxes diligently?"" Mr. Maran adds.TMC's Sougata Ray says that the revenue deficit will be 6 trillion in 2020-21. ""The economy was on a downward spiral even before Covid-19. India's GDP shrank by 23.9% during April-June. In China it grew by 3.2%.""""Unemployment has reduced post-unlock, but 18.9 million salaried jobs have been lost,"" he adds.The government should speed the transfer of revenues and increase spending on public infrastructure. Free food grain distribution system should be implemented well, he says. ""There are formulae available but they are not being realised"".He raises the question of selling of 6 airports: ""What have airports got to do with fighting the coronavirus?""Midhun Reddy, YSRCP, speaks on the issue of GST dues to States and requests release of funds to the Polavaram project through NABARD. He also alleges swindling in the A.P. Fibernet scheme and demands a CBI inquiry into it.Arvind Ganpat Sawant, Shiv Sena, alleges that all BJP legislators from Maharashtra only contributed to the PM-CARES fund and nothing to the State COVID-19 relief funds. ""Rs 22,000 crore GST dues to Maharashtra have not been paid yet,"" he adds.7 pm | Lok SabhaAdhir Ranjan Chowdhury slams govt. over economy, lack of data on migrant labourersCongress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury says both the supplementary demands are deemed to have been moved. ""I have not found anything to suggest that any new service has been contemplated in the demands for grants.""There has been a complete breach of trust by the Centre when it comes to revenue sharing with the States. This is completely unacceptable. States are being told to relinquish their rights to collect taxes,"" he adds.""The government does not intend to invest in infrastructure. You should come up with a scheme for migrant workers. Without any warning, you announced the lockdown; as a result lakhs of people were on the streets trying to go back home.""On September 1, the government said it had no data on the number of migrant workers killed during covid-19 outbreak. Reports from credible organisations say more than 1,000 migrant workers died due to various reasons, including exhaustion,"" he says.""Net tax revenue of the central government is 40% less. GDP estimate by many international agencies for 2020-21 ranges from -5 to -11.5%,"" he adds. ""The government wants to sell all the public enterprises.""Mr. Chowdhury seeks clarification from the Finance Minister on asset monetisation in PSUs. ""The government took no corrective measures refused to recognise that demonetisation was a wrong step, refused to recognise that a simplified GST should have been brought"".Timing of proceedings is extended till 9 p.m.""Fiscal stimulus given by the government was merely 1.7% of GDP, against 10 to 15% stimulus in other countries.""The next wave of Covid-19 will make the situation more precarious.""The government has been continuously increasing the fuel prices, the demand in rural areas has not been picking up""The government has no data on the jobs created. ILO figure says over 40 crore people are now in the BPL category; according to a report 57% people in rural areas have lost jobs..""In West Bengal, more than 13 lakh migrant workers have reached so far. A huge bonanza was given to the corporate sector in the form of a steep cut in corporate tax."" It was expected that jobs would be protected, but people lost their jobs,"" Mr. Chowdhury adds.6.20 pm | Lok SabhaBJP Member Jayant Sinha continues the discussion on the supplementary demands for grants, 2020-21. This is a manifesto for ""atmanirbharta"", he says.""We are seeking supplementary demand for Rs.2.35 lakh crore, in which huge amounts have been allocated for meeting expenses related to the COVID-19 outbreak.""The impact of expenses incurred is that right now we are conducting 10 lakh tests per day for Covid-19, work on vaccine candidates are under way, Covid care centres have been set up, ventilators are being manufactured. In 70 days, we have provided 50,000 ventilators. We should praise and thank the frontline workers,"" he says.""Funds are also being allocated for the benefit of MSMEs, thereby protecting employment. For those with distressed assets, Rs.250 crore has been allocated.""For MNREGA, an extra Rs.40,000 crore has been given, apart from the Rs.60,000 crore. While 6 crore people were earlier working under MNREGA, it is now 2 crore, as the economy is improving,"" he adds.""We have been able to stabilise the economy, RBI's role cannot be ignored.

a national eligibility test has been set up for this.""some say that there is no scientific proof for homoeopathic medicines effectiveness. homoeopathy is a strain of medicine that focusses not just on the disease but also the patient. the science behind this is not visible to us,"" he says.""for instance, two ways of combating covid-19 are by vaccine and by boosting immunity. methods to boost immunity are available only in indian medicine, and not by western medicine,"" he says. it is regrettable that we did not explore indian medicine in depth earlier, says dr. trivedi. he adds that the

2020-09-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/farm-bill-apmc-act-3-lakh-labourers-without-mandi-work-6600811/,Punjab: Farm bill ending APMC Act will render 3 lakh labourers without mandi work,"Members of various organizations prepare food for farmers, protesting against the agriculture related ordinances, at Puda ground in Patiala. Express Photo: Harmeet SodhiThe implementation of Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, which will end the states Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, also threatens the livelihood of around three lakh labourers who work in mandis across Punjab.These workers get work for 5-6 months in a year in these mandis where they work during wheat, paddy, basmati, maize and cotton procurement season because all these crops are brought to the APMC yards for sale.But when the APMC Act ceases to exist, the traders will purchase the farmers produce anywhere including from the field of a farmer outside these yards.Punjab procures around 31 million tonnes of foodgrain, which includes around 25-26 million tonnes of wheat and rice alone and around 5 million tonnes basmati, and maize etc., in these market committees per annum and for that huge manpower is required in the form of labourers, market committee staff, transporters etc.There are around 1,850 purchase centres, including 152 big mandis (grain markets) across the state where around 28,000 registered arhtiyas in Punjab work with a supporting workforce of around 2-3 lakh labourers and others like accountants. They work for procuring the crops of around 2 million farmers. As every arhtiya has minimum 7 and maximum 20 pucca labourers with them and the majority of these labourers work in the mandis 5-6 months during the procurement season of various crops. With the dismantling of APMCs all these would become jobless, said Ravinder Singh Cheema, former Vice President of the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB).Every such labourer earns Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 a month during the procurement season.We have been working permanently in these mandis for the past over a decade as we get permanent work for 5-6 months in a year here and remaining part of the year, we either works in the farms or go to our native place for a month or two to live with our families back home, said labourer Mohammad Sahu from Bihars Kishanganj area. He added that he along with his 15-20 labourers have been surviving on the basis of mandi work where they load, unload, clean the crop to earn a living.Cheema added: With the end of APMCs, big corporates will take over soon and they will set up all mechanised system to collect and store the grains and just nominal labour would be needed. In Moga, already a Gujarat-based known corporate group has set up a big highly mechanised silo, which stores bulk of the grain. Now, after these bills many such structures would come up in the state like Punjab which is the granary of the country and every big corporate is eyeing it following these ordinances,Such places do not need labour because everything is mechanised and is done without human touch unlike in our APMCs where labourers are loading, unloading, cleaning, filling and stitching the grain bags, said a senior officer in the Punjab Food Supply Department.He added: Apart from these labourers, even large number of arhtiyas will have no work in the coming few years when the direct sale purchase will start as per this ordinance and farmers directly handover to these big houses instead coming to mandis.According to the official, nearly 3,000 to 4,000 staffers of the PMB working in these committees too will become jobless.Cheema informed that one of the biggest corporate houses in the country had already started purchasing the big shellers in Fazilka and Abohar following the announcement of these ordinances with plans to store the grains purchased from the farmers directly.The repercussion would be more dangerous as there are thousands of poor people who earn their grains from the mandi yards, said Cheema, adding that during cleaning when some grains go in waste material these poor people pick those grains from waste and collect a few bags during the season to last them the whole year.

Their outstanding contributions during the last 55 years (since Green Revolution ) remain unsurpassed. But the small state which feeds the nation has not been treated well. The ongoing river disputes and the two farm bills passed in the Lok Sabha are going to hit the states of Punjab and Haryana the maximum, said Captain Amarinder Singh , Chief Minister of Punjab, while inaugurating the two-day Virtual Kisan Mela of PAU on Friday.The mela received an ""overwhelming"" response; more than 1 lakh farmers and farm women of Punjab and adjoining states participated in the mela through social media (Facebook, YouTube).By passing the farm bills in the Parliament, removing minimum assured price (MSP) and closing Food Incorporation of India (FCI), who is going to look after the farmers of Punjab ? he stated.The Kisans of Punjab have made many sacrifices and for their welfare, Constitutional guarantee is must, he added. Destiny brought COVID-19 and even during the challenging times, the godowns of Punjab were full, he said, while congratulating Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Punjab Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister. Already there is a shortage of water and landholdings are shrinking in Punjab. Agricultural fields as well as dairy farming need water. Future generations need food to eat. We need to think of the future of Punjab and its coming generations, he stressed.Referring to paddy crop in the current season, he hailed its average yield of 65 quintal/hectare. Sara Punjab thowda dhanwadi hai (Whole Punjab is thankful to you), said Punjab CM to PAU, while adding You have done your best.Sunil Jakhar, President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, remarked, PAU is a big gift to the farming community. Punjabi farmers and research institutes like PAU removed the kalank (blur) of being dependent on foreign nations for food grains and transformed the country from food-deficit to food-surplus, he said. For the wheat production of 1 crore 28 lakh tonnes during the COVID-19 times, I salute the farmers, he said, while calling upon the Punjab CM to ensure financial security of the farmers. With black clouds hovering over Punjab and disruptive mentality forcing the farmers to protest, we need to work on financial security of farmers of Punjab, he added.

His comments, made in a video address dedicating a railway bridge in Bihar and also on microblogging site Twitter, came after Lok Sabha passed by a majority voice vote the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. On Tuesday, the Lower House passed a third legislation, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020.Modi addressed concerns about prices and the countrys procurement system, under which the government buys farm produce at federally-fixed minimum support prices (MSP) from farmers. Theres disinformation that the government would withdraw benefits of support prices, he said. The Prime Minister said the countrys procurement system will continue to run as usual.People who ruled this country for decades and were in power such people are trying to mislead farmers. They are telling lies to farmers, Modi said.Disinformation is also being spread that wheat and rice, etc, will not be procured by the government from farmers. This is an absolute lie, completely wrong and an attempt to cheat farmers, the Prime Minister said.Modi said the government is committed to give farmers appropriate prices through the support-price mechanism. I want to give farmers a message. Dont fall for lies.The main opposition Congress and a clutch of smaller parties are opposed to the reforms. A key opposition to the bills on Thursday came from the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, whose minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet, exposing a crucial rift between the two parties over efforts to unshackle the farm sector.Indias agricultural trade still requires licenced traders who must operate out of notified markets allotted to them. The bills aim to sidestep this system, called agricultural produce market committees (APMC), free up market restrictions, enable farmers and agribusinesses to engage more confidently under a new contract farming law and help to create modern supply chains. Critics argue the new system will lack adequate oversight in its current form.The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows buyers of farm produce to trade outside the mandi system or wholesale markets run by states under APMCs, which have become cartelised over time.The reforms will give new freedom to farmers. They will bring more options and opportunities for farmers to sell their produce, Modi said.Also read| Failed to convince govt about farmers grouse: Harsimrat Kaur BadalCongratulating farmers of the country over passage of this bills in the Lower House, Modi said the reforms would protect farmers from middlemen. Middlemen stand between farmers and their customers; these middlemen take a big chunk of a farmers income. These reforms have come as a protective shield for farmers.APMC laws require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where the farmers reside, rather than in open markets, which economists say scuttles price discovery, hurting farm profits.The bill enables farmers and buyers of their produce to trade outside these markets without any taxes and will therefore open up APMCs to competitions.The agriculture sector will benefit from modern technology and our farmers will also be empowered, the Prime Minister said.Modi made a veiled but sharp attack on the Congress for opposing the reforms. These people who would make big promises to farmers during election time, would do it in writing, and in their manifestoes, forget these promises after elections, he said.Now when the BJP-NDA (the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-National Democratic Alliance) government is implementing those promises, which others have mentioned in their manifestoes, these people are wantonly spreading misinformation.The Congresss 2019 manifesto promised to liberalise agricultural markets.Modi said people who were opposing the reforms had promised them in their partys election manifestoes.

They are watching; they know who is standing with middlemen.Producers of items such as clothing, utensils and shoes, etc, have the freedom to sell where they want, Modi said, adding: Only farmers were deprived of this freedom. Now they will have the freedom to sell wherever they want in the world.Referring to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was present on the occasion, Modi said Kumar knew the problems of farmers. That is why he had reformed agriculture to remove the APMC law when he first came to power.Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the government itself was spreading lies.

2020-09-19,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/bills-wont-impact-upcoming-paddy-procurement-6602184/,Bills won’t impact upcoming paddy procurement,"Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal.The three farm sector Bills cleared by Lok Sabha will not impact the upcoming paddy procurement in Punjab for which the state government has sought Rs. 35,000 crore as Cash Credit Limit (CCL) advance from the Centre.While the state government has announced that it would procure every grain of the farmers in the paddy procurement season beginning October 1, it will also be able to collect its Market Committee (Mandi) fee and the Rural Development Fund (RDF). The government has levied 3 per cent Mandi fee and RDF each.Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal confirmed as much. The paddy procurement would continue as usual. It will take a few days before the Bills are enacted and notified. Our procurement will start by then. But, the state government would be losing about Rs. 4,000 crore every year after these laws come into effect, he said.Punjab gets about Rs. 60,000 crore from Centre every year on account of procurement of paddy and wheat. About Rs. 35,000 crore is infused into state economy during paddy season and Rs. 25,000 during wheat season, in Asias biggest procurement operations.A senior functionary of state government said that the minimum support price (MSP) would not be affected immediately, but over the years, the Centre would withdraw itself from procuring the farmers produce leaving them at the mercy of private players. The protest by the Punjab government (against the Bills) is not about the immediate effect but about what will come next. The dye has been cast, the functionary said.Manpreet Badal too feels that the Centre has started the withdrawal process. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has a debt of Rs. 4 lakh crore in its books. They just do not have the money. That is why they want to pull out. They may keep giving us assurances, but such assurances were given to us for GST also. If they can go back on what is a constitutional provision, then Prime Ministers assurance in Lok Sabha does not mean anything. The effect will be visible in next six months or a year, he added.Punjab has a massive infrastructure to facilitate procurement of grains. It has about 1800 mandis across the state. One requires money to maintain such massive infrastructure. Then village and link roads are also needed (to connect farmers with mandis). These roads require maintenance. These levies (Mandi fee and RDF) help maintain such infrastructure. Under the new legislations, all these levies will go. The government is already cash crunched, said a Punjab government official.State Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, meanwhile, said the farmers had nothing to worry during this paddy procurement season. We are making arrangements and we have already asked Centre for the CCL of Rs. 35,000 crore.Ashu said they were expecting 175 lakh metric tonnes of paddy. Punjab produces and procures paddy for the central pool. The CCL is advanced to the state by centre for holding the massive procurement operation.Covid poses a challengePaddy procurement season amid Covid-19 peak poses a mammoth challenge to the state government even as it looks at about Rs 35,000 crore to be infused in its economy shattered by the pandemic.Though the state government has a past experience of successfully handling wheat procurement season in April-May, amid lockdown due to pandemic, but functionaries of the government say that the paddy procurement would be different than the wheat season.The difference lies in the fact that in April-May, Punjab had only a few cases of Covid-19 in the state but now the experts were projecting peak in a fortnight, hospitals were flooded with patients, beds were falling short and many deaths were taking place everyday. That time we had not seen the contagion from so close. There were news reports from other countries. Also, during the wheat procurement, no farmer had tested positive. There was no spread. But now, there would be over 1 lakh cases within a week. We do not know how will we handle this. We will firm up a plan by next week, a government official told The Indian Express.He added that during wheat season, the government had more than doubled the procurement stations from 1800 to 4006. This helped in staggering of farmers, who were given tokens to enter the mandis so as to avoid crowd to keep the virus from spreading.It was a huge success. Despite our worst fears, the virus did not spread then. We got so confident that we started thinking the virus had weakened in this part of the country. But the scenario is scary now. It certainly is worrisome.He said the government was now looking at increasing the number of mandis to 5,000. We have 3800 rice mills and 1800 mandis. We should be able to have as many procurement stations. This would help us in staggering the arrival of farmers. We will ensure social distancing, thermal scanners, sanitisers and stick to other protocols.The functionary also said that unlike wheat, paddy was a sensitive grain and it would have to be lifted immediately, The way our Mandi secretaries are testing positive, I am wondering if we will be able to run our mandis successfully then. If there are any cases, the mandis would have to be sealed for sanitisation. We are just keeping out fingers crossed that everything goes well, he said.Minister Ashu said they were looking at setting up rice mills as procurement stations. But we will face a challenge of bogus billing as the paddy will be right there in the mills. We will have to be very vigilant.Ashu said the procurement season would ensue as usual on October 1 and continue till November 30. We cannot delay it as the paddy sowing was already advanced this year and the crop would start coming in early. Then paddy has to be lifted as soon as possible. The government is also looking at more expenditure on HR and other arrangements if more mandis are to be set up. We should do it successfully as we handled wheat.

2020-09-20,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-rebuts-stalins-criticism-on-farm-bills/article32651078.ece,CM rebuts Stalin’s criticism on farm Bills,"They will protect farmers from price fallChief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday supported the Centres three Bills on agriculture reforms, arguing that they would protect the farmers of the State in the event of an unforeseen price fall and benefit them with an assured income.Rebutting DMK president M.K. Stalins criticism of the AIADMKs support to the Bills in the Lok Sabha, he said, Because I, as a farmer, have well understood [the implications of the legislation], the Bills have not been opposed. The situation prevailing in Punjab is not applicable to Tamil Nadu.Awaiting nodThe Bills seek to replace the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance. They are now awaiting the approval of the Rajya Sabha.In a detailed response to the DMK leaders observations, Mr. Palaniswami said the Centre was competent to frame laws on the subject. He said the legislation on price assurance and farm services would regulate contract-farming, which was being practised in respect of cocoa, sugarcane and poultry in Tamil Nadu. It would fulfil the objectives of a State law on contract-farming. As it was intended to promote contract-farming, there were no provisions that compelled or adversely affected farmers.The Leader of the Opposition [Mr. Stalin], who is now opposing the Bill [on price assurance and farm services] for political reasons, did not oppose a similar law brought in by the Amma [former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa] government [last year], he said.As for the Bill to promote trade and commerce in farmers produce, Mr. Palaniswami explained that in regulated markets of Tamil Nadu [unlike in Punjab], there were no commission agents in the light of an amendment to the States Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act. When transactions took place at regulated markets and notified trade areas in Tamil Nadu, a 1% market fee was being collected from traders on the value of agricultural produce purchased by them. But, for wheat and rice in Punjab, a 3% market fee and another 3% in rural development cess were being levied, apart from a 2.5% fee for commission agents. This was why Punjab would suffer a huge revenue loss in the absence of the levy of all the fees.Dismissing Mr. Stalins charge that the farmers would be required to submit their permanent account numbers (PAN), the Chief Minister said only traders had to provide their PAN. Besides, the Bill would not come in the way of transactions at the regulated markets and procurement of agricultural produce at minimum support price.Refuting the DMK leaders criticism that the Bill on essential commodities would enable corporates to hoard agricultural produce, Mr. Palaniswami said the removal of the stock-holding limit would benefit not only farmers but also consumers. There was also a provision against hoarding. Besides, farmers markets (uzhavar sandhai) would not be hit by the legislation on promotion and facilitation of trade and commerce in farmers produce, which had, on the contrary, permitted the markets.I take pride in calling myself a farmer not just once but 1,000 times. The government will continue to take strong measures to safeguard the interests of farmers, he said.","they will protect farmers from price fallchief minister edappadi k. palaniswami on saturday supported the centres three bills on agriculture reforms, arguing that they would protect the farmers of the state in the event of an unforeseen price fall and benefit them with an assured income.rebutting dmk president m.k. stalins criticism of the aiadmks support to the bills in the lok sabha, he said, because i, as a farmer, have well understood [the implications of the legislation], the bills have not been opposed. the situation prevailing in punjab is not applicable to tamil nadu.awaiting nodthe bills seek to replace the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services ordinance, the farmers produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) ordinance and the essential commodities (amendment) ordinance. they are now awaiting the approval of the rajya sabha.in a detailed response to the dmk leaders observations, mr. palaniswami said the centre was competent to frame laws on the subject. he said the legislation on price assurance and farm services would regulate contract-farming, which was being practised in respect of cocoa, sugarcane and poultry in tamil nadu. it would fulfil the objectives of a state law on contract-farming. as it was intended to promote contract-farming, there were no provisions that compelled or adversely affected farmers.the leader of the opposition [mr. stalin], who is now opposing the bill [on price assurance and farm services] for political reasons, did not oppose a similar law brought in by the amma [former chief minister jayalalithaa] government [last year], he said.as for the bill to promote trade and commerce in farmers produce, mr. palaniswami explained that in regulated markets of tamil nadu [unlike in punjab], there were no commission agents in the light of an amendment to the states agricultural produce marketing committee act. when transactions took place at regulated markets and notified trade areas in tamil nadu, a 1% market fee was being collected from traders on the value of agricultural produce purchased by them. but, for wheat and rice in punjab, a 3% market fee and another 3% in rural development cess were being levied, apart from a 2.5% fee for commission agents. this was why punjab would suffer a huge revenue loss in the absence of the levy of all the fees.dismissing mr. stalins charge that the farmers would be required to submit their permanent account numbers (pan), the chief minister said only traders had to provide their pan. besides, the bill would not come in the way of transactions at the regulated markets and procurement of agricultural produce at minimum support price.refuting the dmk leaders criticism that the bill on essential commodities would enable corporates to hoard agricultural produce, mr. palaniswami said the removal of the stock-holding limit would benefit not only farmers but also consumers. there was also a provision against hoarding. besides, farmers markets (uzhavar sandhai) would not be hit by the legislation on promotion and facilitation of trade and commerce in farmers produce, which had, on the contrary, permitted the markets.i take pride in calling myself a farmer not just once but 1,000 times. the government will continue to take strong measures to safeguard the interests of farmers, he said."

Now, with The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, we have created the foundation to build a world-class agriculture ecosystem that will benefit farmers, consumers, wholesalers, processors, and start-ups.There are some who believe that these reforms will result in the end of procurement at minimum support price (MSP), closure of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), and loss of farmers land to corporates. I would like to assure that whether it is MSP or APMCs, all existing systems will continue. We have laid down stringent safeguards to secure farmers from any malpractices. The reforms will introduce competition and efficiency and improve these systems, as well as create freedom and choice for farmers.A FPO, which is an aggregation of farmers, provides higher bargaining power to farmers and helps them realise benefits from economies of scale. AIF and the market reforms have now provided additional enablers and opened up new opportunities for FPOs. They can invest in farm equipment and infrastructure and build forward market linkages by entering into agreements with agribusinesses. This will improve access to advisory, technology, and investment, aligning variety mix and quality as per market demand, and ensuring higher incomes. One of the best examples of a successful FPO is Maharashtras Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Limited. At least 8,000 marginal farmers are registered under FPO, which exports more than 16,000 tonnes of grapes every season. It helps farmers enter into MoUs with leading FMCG companies and access high-tech infrastructure.With improved market linkages, we will also see a shift in what our farmers produce. For a long time now, India has been self-sufficient in many crops, including rice and wheat. An increase in understanding of market demand and trends, through direct engagement with agribusinesses, will enable farmers to grow crops with higher market value and reduce dependency on imports. For example, due to low domestic production, India imports more than $10 billion worth of edible oils. Similarly, we are seeing an increasing demand for healthy foods such as kiwi and avocado in cities; this is primarily served by imports. With reforms, investments can come in and farmers will be able to gather the market intelligence to diversify crop mix, increase domestic productivity to substitute imported crops, and lead India to complete self-sufficiency.The reforms will also provide an opportunity to agribusinesses to build consistent supply and standardised variety by direct procurement from farmers, run their operations more efficiently, and boost export volumes and share of food processing. This will also help eliminate other system inefficiencies such as high intermediary and logistics costs. For example, at least 1,000 seed potato farmers in Punjab, northern Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh have benefited from an increase of 10%-30% in productivity and 35% margin above cost under agreement with Technico Agri Sciences Limited (a subsidiary of ITC). There are thousands of examples of agribusinesses working with farmers leading to higher farmer income and development of agribusinesses.Beyond the investment in traditional agribusinesses, market reforms will drive innovation in the sector and allow new business models to evolve. Different businesses such as farm management services, quality grading and assaying centres, Grade-A warehousing companies, digital marketplaces, are nascent but growing. Innovative business models will attract more investor money and can achieve scale and improve productivity; improvement in post-harvest management will reduce wastage; and digital marketplaces will increase reach and market linkages.Market reforms will also drive private capital formation in the sector and give a boost to the rural economy. Capital formation in agriculture and allied industries has been stagnant with less than 2% CAGR over the last five years and private sector investments are further declining due to gaps in access. With the new market reforms, we will see growth in private sector investment across the value chain. This will create new jobs in allied sectors such as logistics service providers, warehouse operators and processing unit staff. We will also see multi-generational agriculture jobs  children of farmworkers can now aspire to become FPO CEOs or managers for procurement and marketing, without having to go to cities for such opportunities.India is at the cusp of a new frontier in agriculture growth and development  one that farmers, businesses, government and consumers will build together. Different government initiatives have been leading us down this path, and with the passing of the two Acts, we are now well-poised to make the vision of doubling farmer income, building India as the food basket of the world, and providing livelihoods in the agriculture and allied sectors a reality.Rajnath Singh is defence minister and has served as agriculture ministerThe views expressed are personal","analysisupdated: sep 20, 2020 18:56 istwith the passing of two landmark agriculture bills in parliament, we have been able to take the next step towards our vision of transforming farmers into entrepreneurs with higher incomes and better quality of life, cementing indias position in the global market and ensuring atmanirbhar (self-reliant) agriculture.over the last few years, the government has launched initiatives for farmers and the agriculture sector, including a 6,685-crore scheme for the formation of 10,000 farmer producer organisations (fpos); the one-of-its kind 1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund (aif); the national agriculture export policy; and the disbursal of more than 90,000 crore of direct benefit to farmers under pm-kisan. now, with the farmers produce trade and commerce (promotion & facilitation) act 2020 and the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services act 2020, we have created the foundation to build a world-class agriculture ecosystem that will benefit farmers, consumers, wholesalers, processors, and start-ups.there are some who believe that these reforms will result in the end of procurement at minimum support price (msp), closure of agricultural produce marketing committees (apmcs), and loss of farmers land to corporates. i would like to assure that whether it is msp or apmcs, all existing systems will continue. we have laid down stringent safeguards to secure farmers from any malpractices. the reforms will introduce competition and efficiency and improve these systems, as well as create freedom and choice for farmers.a fpo, which is an aggregation of farmers, provides higher bargaining power to farmers and helps them realise benefits from economies of scale. aif and the market reforms have now provided additional enablers and opened up new opportunities for fpos. they can invest in farm equipment and infrastructure and build forward market linkages by entering into agreements with agribusinesses. this will improve access to advisory, technology, and investment, aligning variety mix and quality as per market demand, and ensuring higher incomes. one of the best examples of a successful fpo is maharashtras sahyadri farmers producer company limited. at least 8,000 marginal farmers are registered under fpo, which exports more than 16,000 tonnes of grapes every season. it helps farmers enter into mous with leading fmcg companies and access high-tech infrastructure.with improved market linkages, we will also see a shift in what our farmers produce. for a long time now, india has been self-sufficient in many crops, including rice and wheat. an increase in understanding of market demand and trends, through direct engagement with agribusinesses, will enable farmers to grow crops with higher market value and reduce dependency on imports. for example, due to low domestic production, india imports more than $10 billion worth of edible oils. similarly, we are seeing an increasing demand for healthy foods such as kiwi and avocado in cities;

2020-09-21,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/its-a-no-green-signal-from-the-farm-world/article32655181.ece,It’s a no green signal from the farm world,"There is good reason why opposition to the agriculture Bills may be a reflection of the genuine concerns of farmersIn a virtual rally, the Prime Minister blamed the Opposition parties for misleading farmers about the three Bills on agriculture, in Parliament. While the Opposition may have taken up the cudgels recently, the fact is that farmers have been protesting against the Bills ever since it was promulgated as ordinances in June. These are The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The resignation of Food Processing Industries Minister (and Shiromani Akali Dal MP), Harsimrat Kaur Badal, from the Union Cabinet, and dissenting voices from various mass organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh suggest that the opposition to the Bills may not be politically motivated; rather, it may be a reflection of the genuine concerns of farmers.In brief, the Bills aim to do away with government interference in agricultural trade by creating trading areas free of middlemen and government taxes outside the structure of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) along with removing restrictions of private stockholding of agricultural produce. Attempts to reform the APMC are not new and have been part of the agenda of successive governments for the last two decades. Most farmer organisations also agree that there is excessive political interference and there is need for reform as far as functioning of mandis are concerned.Parliament proceedings | Rajya Sabha passes two farm Bills amid fierce protestsNo consultationSeveral reforms at the level of the central government as well as at the State level have been introduced and welcomed by farmers. However, in this particular case, the issue is not about the Bills; it is also about the process of their introduction. As was pointed out by Ms. Badal, the government has failed to have or hold any discussion with the various stakeholders including farmers and middlemen. This is also true when it comes to consultation with State governments even though the subject of trade and agriculture are part of subjects on the State list. The attempt to pass the Bills without proper consultation adds to the mistrust among various stakeholders including State governments. While the lack of consultation has certainly added to the element of mistrust between the government and farmers, some of the issues raised by farmer organisations are also genuine; recent trends in agricultural prices and incomes have only confirmed these fears.While farmer organisations see these Bills as part of the larger agenda of corporatisation of agriculture and a withdrawal of government support, the immediate concern has been the attempt to weaken the APMC mandis and eventual withdrawal of the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) guaranteed by the government. Although the government has clarified that these Bills do not imply withdrawal of procurement by the State at MSP, there is a genuine fear among farmers about the true intentions of the government. The mistrust is not unfounded given the track record of this government on many issues including demonetisation of 2016, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax and so on. There may not be direct evidence of crony capitalism, but the entry, in a big way, of two of the biggest corporate groups (Adani and Reliance) in food and agricultural retail and the timing of the Bills have not gone unnoticed.Also read | We will move the courts against anti-farmer bills: Amarinder SinghReflects poor understandingThe idea of allowing greater participation of traders and farmers outside the APMC has already been in place in different form. Even otherwise, APMCs account for less than a fourth of total agricultural trade. But APMCs do play an important role of price discovery essential for agricultural trade and production choices. The vilification of APMCs and the middlemen who facilitate trade in these mandis is a poor reflection of the understanding of functioning of agricultural markets. The middlemen are a part of the larger ecosystem of agricultural trade, with deep links between farmers and traders. Most farmers are familiar with the functioning of mandis and see it as an essential part of agricultural trade despite shortcomings. While the proposed Bills do not do away with the APMC mandis, the preference for corporate interests at the cost of farmers interests and a lack of regulation in these non-APMC mandis are cause for concern. The absence of any regulation in non-APMC mandis is being seen as a precursor to the withdrawal of the guarantee of MSP-based procurement.Also read | Highways blocked as farmers protests continue in Haryana, PunjabThe Bihar exampleThe dominant concern in this regard has been expressed by farmers in Punjab and Haryana. Farmers in these States have genuine concern about the continuance of the MSP-based public procurement given the large-scale procurement operations in these States. These fears gain strength with the experience of States such as Bihar which abolished APMCs in 2006. After the abolition of mandis, farmers in Bihar on average received lower prices compared to the MSP for most crops. For example, as against the MSP of 1,850 a quintal for maize, most farmers in Bihar reported selling their produce at less than 1,000 a quintal. Despite the shortcomings and regional variations, farmers still see the APMC mandis as essential to ensuring the survival of MSP regime.Comment | Hardly the 1991 moment for agricultureWhile retail prices have remained high, data from the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) suggest a deceleration in farm gate prices for most agricultural produce. This has happened despite increased procurement through the MSP-based regime for paddy and wheat. Decline in basmati rice prices by more than 30% and despite higher international prices suggests the limitation of market intervention in raising farm gate prices. For most crops where MSP-led procurement is non-existent, the decline has been sharper. Even cash crops such as cotton have seen a collapse in prices in the absence of government intervention. With rising input costs, farmers do not see the market providing them remunerative prices. At the same time, ad hoc interventions by government such as raising import duties on masur and a ban on onion exports also raise suspicion about the intent of the government to leave the price discovery mechanism on the market.

Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced the hike in Lok Sabha.The new MSP rates, announced earlier than usual, come amid widespread protests by opposition parties and farmer groups in Punjab and Haryana, after Parliament passed two key farm bills on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a video address, said opponents of the farm-sector reforms were misleading farmers, saying the government would continue to buy farmers produce at MSP rates.MSPs are federally fixed prices for farm produce aimed at preventing distress sale. The government buys largely rice and wheat at these prices through its procurement system.For the upcoming winter-sown season, the highest increase in MSP was announced for lentil (a jump of Rs 300 a quintal) followed by gram and rapeseed and mustard (Rs 225 a quintal each) and safflower (Rs 112 a quintal). The Cabinet approved an increase of Rs 75 a quintal and Rs 50 a quintal for barley and wheat.At these new MSP rates for key winter crops, farmers would get 106% return over cost of cultivation for wheat, 65% return over costs for barley, and 78% returns over cultivation costs for lentil (masoor) and gram, and 98% return over costs for mustard.In absolute terms, wheat MSP for 2021-22 stands at Rs 1,975 a quintal, up from Rs 1,925 in the previous year. Similarly, the MSP for lentil stands at Rs 5,100, higher than Rs 4,800 during 2020-21. The MSP for mustard was hiked to Rs 4,650 from Rs 4,425 earlier.The differential remuneration (varying hikes in MSP) is aimed at encouraging crop diversification. This increase in MSP is in line with the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, a Cabinet note said.Earlier in the day, in a speech aimed at putting a lid on concerns of farmers groups, Modi said the existing agricultural state-regulated mandis (also known as agricultural produce market committees or APMCs) would continue to function. He also said the government would continue to buy farm produce at MSP rates.APMCs will not shut down. The new laws are not against mandis and I also want to assure the country that the government will continue to buy farm produce at minimum support prices in every (farm marketing) season, the PM had said.Parliament on Sunday passed The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, also passed on Sunday, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country so that agribusiness and farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses in cultivation.Some farmer groups want the government to write MSP into the new act.Our demand is to make MSP a legal right.

2020-09-26,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sowing-seeds-of-doubt-farm-bills-leave-farmers-commission-agents-and-workers-worried/article32698797.ece,"Sowing seeds of doubt: Farm Bills leave farmers, commission agents and workers worried","Farmers in Punjab are worried about the implications of the three new farm bills that will allow them to sell their produce directly to private players. Vikas Vasudeva reports on the concerns of farmers, commission agents and workers despite the governments assurances that the legislation empowers themIn June 2020, 55-year-old Shingara Singh in Fatehpur village in Patiala, Punjab, sold his spring season maize crop at 700-800 per quintal, far below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of 1,850/q fixed by the Central government for the seasons crop. He says private traders buy the produce at a much lower price than the MSP.In the upcoming Rabi (winter) season, Shingara is hoping to get a remunerative price for his wheat crop. In Punjab and Haryana, the Central government purchases wheat and paddy (rice) at the MSP, which gives farmers an assured market and return. But Shingara is worried that following the passage of the farm bills in Parliament last week, even wheat and paddy will face the same fate that crops that are not purchased by the government agencies of the State or the Centre face.The Hindu Explains | Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposedThe Central government says the three bills  the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill  are aimed at transforming agriculture in the country and raising farmers income. The provisions of the bills, it says, will enable barrier-free trade in agricultural produce and empower farmers to engage with investors of their choice.I cant trust private playersBut farmers are not convinced by the governments promises. In both Punjab and Haryana, farmers are up in arms against the three farm bills. They fear that they are a step towards abolition of the MSP regime, leaving farmers to suffer possible exploitation at the hands of big corporate houses. And the fear is not limited to any one group of farmers; it is shared by marginal, small and large/ other farmers. While marginal farmers (those cultivating up to two and a half acres of land) and small farmers (those cultivating up to five acres) fear that they will be completely pushed out of agriculture, large farmers (cultivating over five acres) feel they may be able to ride it out for a few years, but will eventually find it difficult to stand up to multinational corporations and big traders.Shingara is wary of dealing with private companies. His fear is rooted in his experience of trading with a company. He started sowing barley crop around eight years ago after a liquor manufacturing company near his village offered to buy his crop. The company makes beer. People from the company came to our village and wanted us farmers to cultivate barley. They said the company would purchase our produce at a higher price than the MSP. Initially, for two-three years, they did pay us 400 above the MSP. But later, when several farmers started sowing the crop and supply increased, they were reluctant to buy the produce at that assured price. On the pretext of quality, they either rejected the produce or paid us a lower price. After 2015-16, I stopped cultivating barley, he says.Comment | Will the farm bills benefit farmers?Dilbag Singh, 44, another farmer from the same village, who has over 15 acres of family land, speaks of a similar experience that left him poorer. A local pea processing industry asked me to plant green peas. In 2012, representatives of the company approached me and said they would pay 8.5 per kg. They prepared some documents as well. I planted the crop. When the crop was ready, I took a tractor trolley with around 100 bags (50 kg each) of produce to their unit, but they were unwilling to buy my crop citing poor quality. It was only after the intervention of local farmer outfits that they purchased my crop. Later, I sold the rest of my crop that I had sown in five acres of land at 2-3 per kg in the local mandi (market place). I had to bear heavy lossses, he says. I cant trust them anymore.The story is no different in other parts of the State. In Tibba Tapprian village in Rupnagar district, Dharmpal Singh, who owns close to three acres of land, says he sold 25 quintals of maize crop at 800/q at the Balachaur mandi a few days ago. The government announces the MSP, but whats the use if I have to sell my crop below the MSP? Government agencies should buy farmers produce at the MSP or make it legally mandatory for private traders to purchase crop at the MSP, says the 56-year-old.A senior government official points out that the government did not intervene as maize is not distributed under the Public Distribution System (PDS). Government purchases only those crops that are distributed under the PDS. Maize is not among those crops, says Gurvinder Singh, Joint Director at Punjabs Agriculture Department.Surjit Singh, 65, fears that mandis under the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) will gradually vanish if private trade is allowed without any government regulation. Trade within the mandi through the arthiya (commission agent) is taxable, which includes rural development fee, market fee and the commission of the agent. But after these bills, no taxes will be levied on trade outside the regulated mandis, he says. That means private traders and companies can offer a higher price to farmers as they wont have to pay tax. Once they start offering a better price to farmers than what is offered in the mandis, it is but natural that farmers will be inclined to sell their produce to them. And over time, with trade outside the mandis growing, the mandis will eventually disappear. As I stand against the new bills, I have decided Ill sell my crop of Basmati rice only through the mandi. But for how long will I be able to do this? I can negotiate with private traders or companies to some extent because I have better resources than the small and marginal farmers (he owns over 25 acres of land in Patialas Lachkani village). Yet, against the big corporate houses, it will be a losing battle, he says.Comment | Its a no green signal from the farm worldA strong, age-old bondWhile the government says farmers can now trade anywhere, Gurmukh Singh, 47, asks how that will be possible as they cannot afford the hefty transport costs. Gurmukh is a small farmer with around four acres of family land in Lachkani village. He has sown paddy in his field. With hardly any resources to store or transport his produce, he is extremely worried. Once I harvest my crop, I sell it at the local mandi. Even if I get a higher price from private traders in some faraway place, it wont be easy for me take my produce there. I do not have the capacity or resources to trade my crop at distant places. So, even if the bills promise us the freedom to sell anywhere, it seems a distant dream in practice, he says.Moreover, he adds, I cant leave my commission agent for private traders. The relation with my arthiya goes back generations. Whenever I am in need, I get money from him. He pays me in advance for the crop that is to be harvested. Such a relationship based on trust will be difficult to establish with private traders or companies.Also read | First time in decades laws framed to benefit farmers, workers: ModiIn Patialas Ranbirpura village, Avtar Singh, who owns two and a half acres of land, is equally grateful to his commission agent. I have already taken an advance of 1 lakh from him for the paddy crop that I had planted this season. It would have been next to impossible for me to cultivate my farm if my arthiya had not given me the advance. He gave me an advance only because he is assured that my paddy crop, which Ill sell through him, will be purchased by government agencies at the MSP. If the government stops purchasing paddy or wheat at the MSP, I dont think Ill be able to cultivate any crop on the farm. No one will give me an advance or offer any financial help without a tangible guarantee, he says.Avtar fears that once the parallel private market starts functioning outside the regulated market, there will eventually be no MSP in that market. The government should come out with another bill making MSP a statutory right of the farmers, he says.Also read | Government should bring in another Bill or amend current one, says RSS-affiliate SJMCommission agents and labourers working in grain markets have their own concerns about the new bills. The government has announced the MSP for several crops but it is only for wheat and paddy that farmers actually get the MSP. And thats because the government buys it. For instance, this year, government agencies purchased wheat at an MSP of 1,925/q during the official procurement. But now, after government purchase, the wheat is being bought by private traders at 1,600/q-1,650/q in the mandi here. The government, it seems, wants to remove us from the market, says Mulk Raj Gupta, president, Arthiya Association, Patiala new grain market. But they possibly dont realise how many people are generating employment in this entire chain, be it labourers, staff at shops, employees of market committees or others, he says.In the grain market, Badri Mukhiya, 45, who hails from Bihar, ropes in labourers from his State. He says he has been coming to Punjab since 1990, but is now worried after hearing that work at the mandi could reduce. Work includes loading and unloading of produce and cleaning of grain. If farmers stop coming to the mandi altogether or even if fewer farmers come, there will be less work. The livelihood of at least 20 people and their families who are associated with me is dependent on the work we do here. We earn around 400 a day, but we will have to return to our native place if theres no work. Everyone is worried, he says.Farmers travel to a protest site in Patiala on September 22, 2020. | Photo Credit: V.V. KrishnanConcerns and responsesAgricultural experts have expressed their reservations about the bills as well. Lakhwinder Singh, Professor of Economics and Coordinator at the Centre for Development Economics and Innovation Studies at Punjabi University, Patiala, has been mapping rural Punjab for decades. He says these bills have generated a lot of suspicion as they were passed through the ordinance route. The new bills state that the foodgrain trade will be in the hands of private traders. But no safeguards have been enacted. The majority of farmers in India are small and marginal farmers. They usually wait for the crop to be harvested in order to fulfil their basic needs. They dont have the capacity to trade the food at distant places. Therefore, the claim that farmers will have the freedom to sell does not hold true. Giving private players the freedom of foodgrain trade without any regulation will eventually lead to the emergence of monopolies, oligopolies or a cartel system, he says.Also read | Farmers take to the streets over farm BillsNoted economist and professor at the Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University, Sukhpal Singh, points out that 86% of Indian farmers have less than five acres of land, and 67% of farmers have less than two and a half acres of land. These are the victims of the grave economic crisis. How can these small farmers sell their produce in other markets? What is the purpose of new markets if small farmers cannot participate in them? How will the new private markets operate? These new markets will not have any regulation and they wont be taxed by the State government. State governments will regulate only the already running markets. In Punjab, for instance, these markets levy 8.5% tax, including 3% market fee, 3% rural development fund, and 2.5% commission of the commission agents. Thus this year, the tax is around 155/q on paddy and about 164/q on wheat. This means that due to non-tax on private purchase, the purchase of paddy and wheat will be cheaper for private buyers to the extent of 155-164/q. Initially, even if private markets offer farmers 55/q-64/q on paddy and wheat purchases, they (private traders) would still get a profit of 100/q. Government procurement will be affected as farmers will be inclined towards private markets. As the volume of purchase increases in the new system, the government will reduce its purchase target. Gradually, government procurement will be negated. In such a situation, the prices of crops in private markets will be reduced, he says.In response to all these concerns, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a series of tweets in English, Hindi and Punjabi that MSP will continue. Government procurement will continue. We are here to serve our farmers. We will do everything possible to support them and ensure a better life for their coming generations, he tweeted. He added the government was bringing in these provisions as middlemen have been bullying farmers for years.Also read | Isnt English ads on farm Bills making fun of farmers, asks AAPUnion Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also tried to allay fears. He said the APMC system will continue. Alleging that the Opposition was trying to mislead the country, Tomar said, Farmers, so far, were forced to sell their produce in mandis. In Punjab theres 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, through these bills, the farmers will be able to sell their produce even outside the ambit of the mandi.The distance between traders and farmers will reduce now, Tomar told Parliament. If a trader will visit a village, farmers of that village will assemble at one place to sell their produce. [The] trader will fix the rate of purchase after discussing with farmers. The trader will purchase the produce and take that away in a truck. Farmers will not have to go anywhere to sell their produce, he said.Also read | New farm laws will enslave farmers: Rahul GandhiPlaying politics over the billsDespite the governments assurances, concerns persist, and not only among the Opposition parties. After initially supporting the ordinances pushed by the National Democratic Alliance government, Shiromani Akali Dal, an old alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party, decided to take a U-turn on the issue. The Akali Dals lone representative in the Union Cabinet, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, quit the Cabinet in protest against the bills. In her resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Badal wrote, In view of the decision of the Government of India to go ahead with the Bill on the issue of marketing of agricultural produce without addressing and removing the apprehensions of the farmers and the decision of my party, Shiromani Akali Dal not to be a part of anything that goes against the interests of the farmers, I find it impossible to continue to perform my duties as a minister in the Union Council of Ministers.The Akali Dal has also accused the Congress government in Punjab of double speak on the issue. The Congress government in 2017 amended the State APMC Act after coming to power in Punjab to include provisions similar to those in the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Akali Dal claimed. According to the State Act, trade can be done only after obtaining a licence from the government in its mandis under the Punjab Mandi Board or the private mandis. However, according to the Centres new farm bills, no licence from the State government is required; any PAN card holder can engage in trade. Besides, no private or government mandi is required for trade under the new farm bills. Trade can be done outside the physical premises of markets or deemed markets notified under various State agricultural produce market laws.The ruling Congress party, on the other hand, accused the Akali Dal of misleading people on the farm bills and asked the party to part ways with the NDA. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that the Akali Dals claims of standing shoulder to shoulder with the farmers are hollow as long as it remains a part of the Central government.In neighbouring Haryana, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, whose Jannayak Janta Party is part of the coalition government with the BJP, has made it clear that while theres no mention of doing away with the MSP in the farm bills, he will quit if the MSP is indeed discontinued. That leaves a question mark on the alliance.While parties spar with one another, farmers are concerned about the present. On September 25 afternoon, hundreds of angry farmers sat on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway at the Shambhu border of Punjab-Haryana, protesting against the bills. Jasbir Singh, 55, who owns two and a half acres of land in Kutha Kheri village in Patialas Rajpura Tehsil, says he has enough cash in hand to undertake farming operations. But after harvesting my paddy crop, Ill be needing money for sowing wheat in my field. Its only my arthiya who will give me an advance. If mandis go redundant and arthiyas go away, how will I sustain myself? I am under a debt of about 2.5 lakh. I dont think I have a choice but to sell my land, he says as he drops his head in despair.","farmers in punjab are worried about the implications of the three new farm bills that will allow them to sell their produce directly to private players. vikas vasudeva reports on the concerns of farmers, commission agents and workers despite the governments assurances that the legislation empowers themin june 2020, 55-year-old shingara singh in fatehpur village in patiala, punjab, sold his spring season maize crop at 700-800 per quintal, far below the minimum support price (msp) of 1,850/q fixed by the central government for the seasons crop. he says private traders buy the produce at a much lower price than the msp.in the upcoming rabi (winter) season, shingara is hoping to get a remunerative price for his wheat crop. in punjab and haryana, the central government purchases wheat and paddy (rice) at the msp, which gives farmers an assured market and return. but shingara is worried that following the passage of the farm bills in parliament last week, even wheat and paddy will face the same fate that crops that are not purchased by the government agencies of the state or the centre face.the hindu explains | why are the agriculture bills being opposedthe central government says the three bills  the essential commodities (amendment) bill, the farmers produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) bill, and the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services bill  are aimed at transforming agriculture in the country and raising farmers income. the provisions of the bills, it says, will enable barrier-free trade in agricultural produce and empower farmers to engage with investors of their choice.i cant trust private playersbut farmers are not convinced by the governments promises. in both punjab and haryana, farmers are up in arms against the three farm bills. they fear that they are a step towards abolition of the msp regime, leaving farmers to suffer possible exploitation at the hands of big corporate houses. and the fear is not limited to any one group of farmers; it is shared by marginal, small and large/ other farmers. while marginal farmers (those cultivating up to two and a half acres of land) and small farmers (those cultivating up to five acres) fear that they will be completely pushed out of agriculture, large farmers (cultivating over five acres) feel they may be able to ride it out for a few years, but will eventually find it difficult to stand up to multinational corporations and big traders.shingara is wary of dealing with private companies. his fear is rooted in his experience of trading with a company. he started sowing barley crop around eight years ago after a liquor manufacturing company near his village offered to buy his crop. the company makes beer. people from the company came to our village and wanted us farmers to cultivate barley. they said the company would purchase our produce at a higher price than the msp. initially, for two-three years, they did pay us 400 above the msp. but later, when several farmers started sowing the crop and supply increased, they were reluctant to buy the produce at that assured price. on the pretext of quality, they either rejected the produce or paid us a lower price. after 2015-16, i stopped cultivating barley, he says.comment | will the farm bills benefit farmers?dilbag singh, 44, another farmer from the same village, who has over 15 acres of family land, speaks of a similar experience that left him poorer. a local pea processing industry asked me to plant green peas. in 2012, representatives of the company approached me and said they would pay 8.5 per kg. they prepared some documents as well. i planted the crop. when the crop was ready, i took a tractor trolley with around 100 bags (50 kg each) of produce to their unit, but they were unwilling to buy my crop citing poor quality. it was only after the intervention of local farmer outfits that they purchased my crop. later, i sold the rest of my crop that i had sown in five acres of land at 2-3 per kg in the local mandi (market place). i had to bear heavy lossses, he says. i cant trust them anymore.the story is no different in other parts of the state. in tibba tapprian village in rupnagar district, dharmpal singh, who owns close to three acres of land, says he sold 25 quintals of maize crop at 800/q at the balachaur mandi a few days ago. the government announces the msp, but whats the use if i have to sell my crop below the msp? government agencies should buy farmers produce at the msp or make it legally mandatory for private traders to purchase crop at the msp, says the 56-year-old.a senior government official points out that the government did not intervene as maize is not distributed under the public distribution system (pds). government purchases only those crops that are distributed under the pds. maize is not among those crops, says gurvinder singh, joint director at punjabs agriculture department.surjit singh, 65, fears that mandis under the agricultural produce market committee (apmc) will gradually vanish if private trade is allowed without any government regulation. trade within the mandi through the arthiya (commission agent) is taxable, which includes rural development fee, market fee and the commission of the agent. but after these bills, no taxes will be levied on trade outside the regulated mandis, he says. that means private traders and companies can offer a higher price to farmers as they wont have to pay tax. once they start offering a better price to farmers than what is offered in the mandis, it is but natural that farmers will be inclined to sell their produce to them. and over time, with trade outside the mandis growing, the mandis will eventually disappear. as i stand against the new bills, i have decided ill sell my crop of basmati rice only through the mandi. but for how long will i be able to do this? i can negotiate with private traders or companies to some extent because i have better resources than the small and marginal farmers (he owns over 25 acres of land in patialas lachkani village). yet, against the big corporate houses, it will be a losing battle, he says.comment | its a no green signal from the farm worlda strong, age-old bondwhile the

2020-09-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/explained-converting-bites-to-bytes-6617547/,Converting Bites to Bytes,"Traders sampling a soyabean farmer's produce at Madhya Pradesh's Harda mandi. (Harish Damodaran)A major legacy of the Amul model is that dairy farmers today are paid not just for the quantity, but also quality, of milk they supply. Both cooperative and private dairies fix the purchase price of milk based on its fat and solids-not-fat content. The Gerber centrifuge and lactometer that measure these enable farmers to be paid more for the same volume of milk containing higher total solids.This benefit, of receiving a price linked to quality, isnt available to other farmers, more so in crops that  unlike milk or sugarcane  are sold through APMC (agricultural produce market committee) mandis. Even where some quality premium is given, it is a result of subjective assessment. Soyabean traders hardly check for oil. They visually inspect grain samples drawn from a farmers lot to gauge size uniformity and the extent of damaged/discoloured beans or foreign matter. Moisture level is determined by simply biting the bean. The moisture is low if it cracks and high (unacceptable) if the teeth sink in. Pungency of chilli is ascertained by feeling it on the tongue and the colour by seeing the inside of the fruit.Column| The men behind APMC, MSP and procurementThe loser is the farmer, who cannot bargain with traders encircling his grain unloaded in the mandi auction platform. Theres no equivalent of a Gerber-lactometer reading that he can cite to demand a better price, even if his crop is above fair average quality. But can produce quality be assessed without depending on the eyes, nose and tongue of people? And can it be done at the mandi  that too, instantly?This is where new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies  computer vision and spectrometry  hold promise.AI is about seeing like a computer, but analysing like a human being. Just as the Tesla self-driving car is trained to recognise red lights and roads, and know when to stop and when to move, we can replace humans with machines to do both physical and chemical analysis of food. Such analysis would be instant, on the spot and without going to a lab, says Taranjeet Singh Bhamra, CEO of AgNext Technologies.His Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur-incubated company has developed machine-learning algorithms that can do quality assessment of various farm produce in 30 seconds. That includes physical analysis through computer vision. We have a handheld device SpecX Visio that you can take to the mandi and click a picture of a sample of, say, rice. It will digitise that image and immediately tell how many of the grains are broken, shriveled, weevilled (bored by insects) or chalky (opaque), claims Bhamra.AgNext has also come out with an AI-based solution to undertake fine leaf count in tea. Tea that is plucked could be one bud one leaf, one bud two leaves, one bud three leaves or even banjhi (no bud). We can through image recognition  computer eye instead of human eye  accurately count as well as classify leaves, buds, banjhi and shoots in any sample, he tells The Indian Express.A trader uses Intello Labs mobile app at Lasalgaon onion market in Maharashtra. A trader uses Intello Labs mobile app at Lasalgaon onion market in Maharashtra.That apart, AgNext has built algorithm models based on spectrometry to analyse the chemical characteristics of food. It draws on the concept that when light is thrown at different wavelengths on an object, that object (produce) would generate a reflectance spectrum graph. Each of its molecules will, in turn, have a unique signature in that graph. The molecular signature of the chemical of interest  it could be curcumin (the key active ingredient in turmeric), capsaicin (which imparts pungency to chilli), polyphenols in tea, caffeine in coffee, nicotine and chloride in tobacco, gluten in wheat and amylose in paddy  can then be analysed and an AI model developed after scanning several samples of the produce.We have prepared reflectance graphs for many commodities. It is a lot of grunt work. In turmeric alone, we collected 7,000-8,000 samples, whose curcumin content varied from 2-3% in Punjab and Haryana to 3-5% in Erode (Tamil Nadu), Nizamabad (Telangana) and Sangli (Maharashtra) and 6-7% in Manipur. This was followed by their lab analysis, scanning using our device, correlating and building the whole model. For tea, we collected over half-a-million leaves to analyse and annotate each image to teach a computer to detect it, explains Bhamra.AgNexts SpecX series of computer vision and spectrometry algorithms-based devices  one of them can instantly analyse even protein, lactose and the presence of adulterants such as palm oil in milk  operate on a common AI Qualix platform. Being lightweight, they can be taken to the field, with internet connection required only to transfer data onto the platform.ExplainSpeaking| What farmers should be demanding instead of MSPs?The Mohali (Punjab)-based startup isnt the only one working on eliminating subjectivity in quality analysis of agri-commodities through digitisation and AI  what Bhamra calls converting bites to bytes. There are others like Intello Labs and Nebulaa Innovations Private Ltd, whose founders are again from IIT Bombay and Jodhpur, respectively.Most mandis have no systems to objectively grade produce based on colour, size and visual defects. Quality assessment should become digital, verifiable and scalable. Once produce is automatically graded and standardised, the power of assaying will get democratised and taken away from traders, points out Milan Sharma, CEO of Intello Labs.The Gurugram-headquartered companys mobile app Intello Track uses neural network machine learning algorithms to analyse physical quality of fruits & vegetables. The app captures images of a representative sample of the produce that is brought and categorises it as grade A, B or C.

(harish damodaran)a major legacy of the amul model is that dairy farmers today are paid not just for the quantity, but also quality, of milk they supply. both cooperative and private dairies fix the purchase price of milk based on its fat and solids-not-fat content. the gerber centrifuge and lactometer that measure these enable farmers to be paid more for the same volume of milk containing higher total solids.this benefit, of receiving a price linked to quality, isnt available to other farmers, more so in crops that  unlike milk or sugarcane  are sold through apmc (agricultural produce market committee) mandis. even where some quality premium is given, it is a result of subjective assessment. soyabean traders hardly check for oil. they visually inspect grain samples drawn from a farmers lot to gauge size uniformity and the extent of damaged/discoloured beans or foreign matter. moisture level is determined by simply biting the bean. the moisture is low if it cracks and high (unacceptable) if the teeth sink in. pungency of chilli is ascertained by feeling it on the tongue and the colour by seeing the inside of the fruit.column| the men behind apmc, msp and procurementthe loser is the farmer, who cannot bargain with traders encircling his grain unloaded in the mandi auction platform. theres no equivalent of a gerber-lactometer reading that he can cite to demand a better price, even if his crop is above fair average quality. but can produce quality be assessed without depending on the eyes, nose and tongue of people? and can it be done at the mandi  that too, instantly?this is where new artificial intelligence (ai) technologies  computer vision and spectrometry  hold promise.ai is about seeing like a computer, but analysing like a human being. just as the tesla self-driving car is trained to recognise red lights and roads, and know when to stop and when to move, we can replace humans with machines to do both physical and chemical analysis of food. such analysis would be instant, on the spot and without going to a lab, says taranjeet singh bhamra, ceo of agnext technologies.his indian institute of technology (iit) kharagpur-incubated company has developed machine-learning algorithms that can do quality assessment of various farm produce in 30 seconds. that includes physical analysis through computer vision. we have a handheld device specx visio that you can take to the mandi and click a picture of a sample of, say, rice. it will digitise that image and immediately tell how many of the grains are broken, shriveled, weevilled (bored by insects) or chalky (opaque), claims bhamra.agnext has also come out with an ai-based solution to undertake fine leaf count in tea. tea that is plucked could be one bud one leaf, one bud two leaves, one bud three leaves or even banjhi (no bud). we can through image recognition  computer eye instead of human eye  accurately count as well as classify leaves, buds, banjhi and shoots in any sample, he tells the indian express.a trader uses intello labs mobile app at lasalgaon onion market in maharashtra. a trader uses intello labs mobile app at lasalgaon onion market in maharashtra.that apart, agnext has built algorithm models based on spectrometry to analyse the chemical characteristics of food. it draws on the concept that when light is thrown at different wavelengths on an object, that object (produce) would generate a reflectance spectrum graph. each of its molecules will, in turn, have a unique signature in that graph. the molecular signature of the chemical of interest  it could be curcumin (the key active ingredient in turmeric), capsaicin (which imparts pungency to chilli), polyphenols in tea, caffeine in coffee, nicotine and chloride in tobacco, gluten in wheat and amylose in paddy  can then be analysed and an ai model developed after scanning several samples of the produce.we have prepared reflectance graphs for many commodities. it is a lot of grunt work. in turmeric alone, we collected 7,000-8,000 samples, whose curcumin content varied from 2-3% in punjab and haryana to 3-5% in erode (tamil nadu), nizamabad (telangana) and sangli (maharashtra) and 6-7% in manipur. this was followed by their lab analysis, scanning using our device, correlating and building the whole model. for tea, we collected over half-a-million leaves to analyse and annotate each image to teach a computer to detect it, explains bhamra.agnexts specx series of computer vision and spectrometry algorithms-based devices  one of them can instantly analyse even protein, lactose and the presence of adulterants such as palm oil in milk  operate on a common ai qualix platform. being lightweight, they can be taken to the field, with internet connection required only to transfer data onto the platform.explainspeaking| what farmers should be demanding instead of msps?the mohali (punjab)-based startup isnt the only one working on eliminating subjectivity in quality analysis of agri-commodities through digitisation and ai  what bhamra calls converting bites to bytes. there are others like intello labs and nebulaa innovations private ltd, whose founders are again from iit bombay and jodhpur, respectively.most mandis have no systems to objectively grade produce based on colour, size and visual defects. quality assessment should become digital, verifiable and scalable. once produce is automatically graded and standardised, the power of assaying will get democratised and taken away from traders, points out milan sharma, ceo of intello labs.the gurugram-headquartered companys mobile app intello track uses neural network machine learning algorithms to analyse physical quality of fruits & vegetables. the app captures images of a representative sample of the produce that is brought and categorises it as grade a, b or c. thus, grade a onions are defect-free and of 40-55 mm diameter, while grade b will have no skin with below 40 mm or above 55 mm size. in grade c onions, there would be cuts or cracks with double patti (skin), sprouting and smut infection.we also have a handheld nir (near infrared spectroscopy) scanner that measures brix/total soluble solids

(File)WITH THE Opposition SAD raising the stakes with the resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union Cabinet over the Centres Farm Bills amid protests by farmers, Congress-ruled Punjab is seriously contemplating a move to amend its APMC Act and declare the entire state as a Principal Mandi Yard, The Indian Express has learnt.Sources said the government, which is under tremendous political pressure, believes that doing so will circumvent provisions in The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which was passed in Parliament.The declaration of mandi yards ensures that any procurement outside their ambit is considered illegal, farmers do not get a price less than the MSP, and the state gets its mandi fee.Sources said the government is yet to take a final decision after Chief Minister Amarinder Singh sought legal opinion on the issue and was briefed by Advocate General Atul Nanda Thursday evening.When contacted, Nanda declined to provide any details. State Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal said the government is considering such a move. But there is a feeling that the Supreme Court may shoot it down. The Chief Minister has already said that we will go to the Supreme Court against the central governments legislation. Let us see, he said.Explained: What is the basis of MSP? How is it fixed, and how binding is it?Sources in the Chief Ministers Office said that agriculture experts had recommended on September 17 that Punjab should follow steps taken by Rajasthan, another Congress-ruled state.Last month, Rajasthan had notified all warehouses under the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and Rajasthan State Warehousing Corporation (RSWC) as procurement centres under the states APMC Act.At the time, the Chief Minister told us that he would wait for both Houses of Parliament to pass the Bills.

Farmers across the country are protesting the passage of three bills in Parliament that seek to reorganise marketing of farm produce. However, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee is planning to stage a protest near Aayakar Bhavan in Basheerbagh area at 11.30 a.m. on Friday.I sell my sona masoori rice directly to customers. When I grow marigold flowers in winter, I sell them at the Gudimalkapur market where I have to pay 10% margin to the seth (trader), says Srinivas Reddy, a farmer. The market yard has a very limited use to us. Only farmers who borrow from traders and sell the produce through them will be affected, says Mr. Reddy. While the commission to be paid at the market is fixed at 4%, multiple farmers said they had to pay 10% commission in addition to transporting the produce and scouting for buyers.The nearest market yards from Pudur are Vikarabad and Chevella. Food Corporation of India procurement and production data over the past five years (2015-2020) shows that nearly a quarter of farmers in Telangana did not access the marketplace for the MSP fixed by the central government. While rice procurement by FCI averaged between 95% to 79% in Punjab, it averaged between 77% and 51.8% in Telangana. Nationally, FCI procured between 37.5% and 32.7% of the rice produced in five years. We prefer to sell it directly to retailers. Rice mills procure from farmers and give an incentive per vehicle, says Kadavati Ramcharan who takes land on cowl (lease) and cultivates rice, vegetables and flowers in Pudur. While protests broke out in many parts of the country after the passage of the three bills, it has hardly caused a ripple among the farmer community in Telangana. Farmers who produce fruits and other perishables are however worried how the changes in the marketplace will impact them. No business is possible without dalals (middlemen). Some farmers have contracts with corporates but they buy only the A-Grade produce. What about the rest? How do we sell that? asks Prabhakar Reddy who cultivates carrots, tomatoes and other vegetables on three-acres.Among the new players in the market is an agri-tech startup which says is revolutionising fresh produce supply chain. It has a procurement centre near Ibrahimpalle on Chevella-Vikarabad Rd. A day before the procurement our field officer visits the farm and informs the farmer about the quantity we need. We check quality while procuring and send the produce to our Kompally warehouse, says Raju who manages the centre.The market yards are controlled by ruling party leaders. The first change in state government inevitably leads to change in the power structure of the market committee. The ruling party nominates the chairperson who ensures fair trade, says Madhav Reddy who works at the Chevella market yard.","passage of 3 bills in parliament on farm produce marketing has hardly caused a ripple in telanganafarmers in telangana are unlikely to join the nationwide strike called by all india coordination committee of farmers movements on september 25. farmers across the country are protesting the passage of three bills in parliament that seek to reorganise marketing of farm produce. however, all india kisan sangharsh coordination committee is planning to stage a protest near aayakar bhavan in basheerbagh area at 11.30 a.m. on friday.i sell my sona masoori rice directly to customers. when i grow marigold flowers in winter, i sell them at the gudimalkapur market where i have to pay 10% margin to the seth (trader), says srinivas reddy, a farmer. the market yard has a very limited use to us. only farmers who borrow from traders and sell the produce through them will be affected, says mr. reddy. while the commission to be paid at the market is fixed at 4%, multiple farmers said they had to pay 10% commission in addition to transporting the produce and scouting for buyers.the nearest market yards from pudur are vikarabad and chevella. food corporation of india procurement and production data over the past five years (2015-2020) shows that nearly a quarter of farmers in telangana did not access the marketplace for the msp fixed by the central government. while rice procurement by fci averaged between 95% to 79% in punjab, it averaged between 77% and 51.8% in telangana. nationally, fci procured between 37.5% and 32.7% of the rice produced in five years. we prefer to sell it directly to retailers. rice mills procure from farmers and give an incentive per vehicle, says kadavati ramcharan who takes land on cowl (lease) and cultivates rice, vegetables and flowers in pudur. while protests broke out in many parts of the country after the passage of the three bills, it has hardly caused a ripple among the farmer community in telangana. farmers who produce fruits and other perishables are however worried how the changes in the marketplace will impact them. no business is possible without dalals (middlemen). some farmers have contracts with corporates but they buy only the a-grade produce. what about the rest? how do we sell that? asks prabhakar reddy who cultivates carrots, tomatoes and other vegetables on three-acres.among the new players in the market is an agri-tech startup which says is revolutionising fresh produce supply chain. it has a procurement centre near ibrahimpalle on chevella-vikarabad rd. a day before the procurement our field officer visits the farm and informs the farmer about the quantity we need. we check quality while procuring and send the produce to our kompally warehouse, says raju who manages the centre.the market yards are controlled by ruling party leaders. the first change in state government inevitably leads to change in the power structure of the market committee. the ruling party nominates the chairperson who ensures fair trade, says madhav reddy who works at the chevella market yard."

In April, he began preparations with his mentor and former Kerala team-mate, Raiphi Gomez, in Thiruvananthapuram.The two would spend time together, discussing cricket. During one of those chats, Sanju told Gomez that it was lack of consistency that was preventing his development into a prolific run-scorer. He had hardly scored anything substantial in the last IPL after one century. Its something that has been hurting him for a while now. He was worried that he was not able to take the game to the next level, Gomez told The Indian Express.Sanju called up Amal Manohar, his college mate at Thiruvanthapurams Mar Ivanios College.

The results provided clues to his glaring inconsistency levels in the IPL. We met in April and after conducting a basic test on Sanju, I realised that he was hardly getting time to recover between matches in the IPL. Simply put, he was carrying the fatigue from one match to the other, which was acting as an impediment, Manohar explained. He devised a series of exercises that helped Sanju build muscle mass, become stronger, improve his agility, all of which would aid in quicker recovery between matches.Sanju worked diligently on these aspects and within four weeks, began to notice drastic improvements.Food for thoughtSanju Samson with former Kerala team-mate Raiphi Gomez. Sanju Samson with former Kerala team-mate Raiphi Gomez.There was another aspect that needed a close watch: his diet. Its not that Sanju was careless about what he ate. He wanted someone experienced to closely monitor his meals. Gomez was instrumental in hiring Arun, an executive chef at Zam Zam Bun Cafe. A friend had recommended his name. So, I sent him a menu and asked him to prepare meals for Sanju, and he immediately came on board, Gomez elaborated. While chalking out the menu, Gomez gave Arun three specific instructions: include carbohydrates in moderation, maximise proteins and eliminate fats.Its a challenge to prepare a menu tailor-made to the needs of sportspersons. I have taken care to ensure Sanjus fitness is not compromised, while at the same time, theres a method to improvise so that he doesnt get bored of eating the same stuff over a period of time, Arun offered.Even during the lockdown, Sanju would spend at least five hours in training. Arun would constantly keep in touch with his high-profile client on Whatsapp to apprise him of the menu. Typically, lunch would consist of wheat dalia with mushroom, egg whites, chicken breast, along with watermelon seed salad and mixed fruit. Dinner usually included a portion of kiwi marinated chicken with scrambled egg white, cucumber and jalapeno corn kernel salad. Sometimes, I would substitute dalia with rice and also include fish on a regular basis since Sanju prefers seafood over lean meat. I would also include at least three types of fruits and snacks like muffins and cookies made from wholewheat flour and not maida, Arun said.Rich dividendsThat the hard work and preparation has been worth it is evident. Theres almost a sense of infallibility in Sanjus batting in this IPL. Following the two power-packed performances  a 32-ball 74 against Chennai Super Kings and a 42-ball 85 versus Kings XI Punjab  the Kerala wicket-keeper gave a peek into his mindset. I am more aware of my game now. That apart, I have been working hard on my fitness, diet, training and my strength because my game relies a lot on power-hitting, he said.That Sanju possesses all the attributes of a power-hitter is well documented. But he looks fresher and more at ease with himself than ever before.Training with tennis ballsGomez believes that, after the blazing start to Sanjus IPL season, he can only get better. Gomez knows how demanding this tournament is, given his stints with the Rajasthan Royals, Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Pune Warriors India from 2008 to 2010.When I participated in the IPL, it was an eye-opener for me. It gave me an insight into how some of the world-class players train and operate. I realised that your cricketing skills alone will not guarantee you success. It will happen when your diet, fitness and mind are in sync. I am happy that Sanju has used this time during the lockdown to his advantage, Gomez opined.During the five months when competitive cricketing activity was suspended, Sanju trained regularly with tennis balls on Gomezs terrace. Despite the space constraints, the senior pro would replicate different match situations and urge the 25-year-old to demonstrate his power-hitting by keeping a still base. This was done with such devotion that over time, it became part of Sanjus muscle memory.Rahul Dravid had said that if you want to master one shot, you need to play at least 10,000 balls. Apart from fitness training and diet, this is what Sanju has been doing during the extended break. Such an elaborate preparation is essential because only then can you score back-to-back 100s in IPL and still remain fresh because your body needs that energy to fuel you, the 35-year-old explained.Gomez said that he has been in touch with Sanju over phone during the IPL in the UAE, but the two dont talk about anything specific concerning his game. He has worked hard in these five months and is off to a good start now I hope he can make it count, he concluded. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

agitation, cites coal, fertiliser shortage","By PTICHANDIGARH: Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday urged protesting farmers to ease their ongoing 'rail roko' agitation and allow goods trains to pass through, in the larger interest of the state.However, he reiterated his government's complete support to the farmers in their fight against the Centre's new farm laws.Different farmers' bodies had stepped up their agitation by resorting to blocking rail tracks for an indefinite period from October 1 in the state to protest the new farm legislations.Although farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee have been squatting at rail tracks in Amritsar and Ferozepur since September 24.In an appeal to the protesting farmers, the chief minister urged them to ease their rail blockade in order to ensure that the state is able to meet its critical needs and ensure that the citizens, including the farming community, are not put to any serious inconvenience in the coming days.In a statement here, the chief minister pointed out that due to the prolonged blockade of goods trains, the situation at Punjab's coal plants is critical and they are left with only five to six days' supply of coal.Once the supplies run out, the government will be forced to shut down these plants, which will severely impact the state's electricity supply and cause immense hardship to the citizens, he said.Further with not a single fertilizer rake entering Punjab for the last one week, there could be severe shortage of fertilizers for use by farmers for sowing of the wheat crop, he said.There is, therefore, an urgent need to allow inflow of fertilizer rakes into the state to ensure that there are sufficient stocks for the Rabi season, he said.Singh also pointed to the need to create space for storage of rice and wheat, to be harvested by Punjab's farmers in the coming seasons.For this, the existing stocks of these foodgrains would have to be lifted and dispatched by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to other parts of the country, he said.Singh asked the farmers to take cognisance of these grave concerns and let goods trains to ply through Punjab in order to allow movement of coal, fertilizers and food grains.Such movement was essential to prevent any serious inconvenience to the farmers and other Punjabis, he said, exhorting the Kisan Unions to heed his personal request in the larger interest of the state.","by ptichandigarh: punjab chief minister amarinder singh on monday urged protesting farmers to ease their ongoing 'rail roko' agitation and allow

(Photo: Aqsa Khan)When fresh clashes erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh in the South Caucasus approximately two weeks ago, Parvez Ali Khan knew that he had to do something for the country that he now calls home. Khan, a 47-year-old from Patiala, India, had moved to Armenia five years ago with his wife and two daughters, in the hope of economic prospects and now runs Indian Mehak Restaurant and Bar, a two-year-old establishment located in the heart of capital Yerevan, just minutes away from Republic Square.Parvez Ali Khan runs Indian Mehak Restaurant and Bar in Yerevan, Armenia. (Photo credit: Aqsa Khan) Parvez Ali Khan runs Indian Mehak Restaurant and Bar in Yerevan, Armenia. (Photo credit: Aqsa Khan)Since fighting broke out on September 27, Armenian officials have said that the total military death toll has gone up to 244 as of October 6, according to a Reuters report, making it one of the most violent clashes in the region since the 1990s. It is unclear how many people have been forced to leave Karabakh since the fighting began, but social media posts and witness reports suggest the numbers are high.I must have seen approximately 30,000 refugees in Yerevan, Khan says. On October 4, on the restaurants Facebook page, the family announced that they were providing freshly-cooked Indian food to people who had fled the Nagorno-Karabakh region and were seeking refuge in the capital. We are Punjabis and we help people wherever we are. We have always done it, Khan says.Since the clashes have intensified, Armenians across the country have stepped in to help in whatever way they can, and Khan says he wanted to do his bit. So he turned to the resources he had easy access tohis restaurants kitchen. People from the Nagorno-Karabakh region who were seeking refuge in Yerevan were being given dry ingredients, with no access to facilities where they could cook, Khan says.Overnight, he turned his kitchen into a space where his staff could prepare hundreds of food packages to distribute in the capital. I had some savings that I had kept aside to open a restaurant in Prague. That didnt materialise due to the coronavirus outbreak. So I am using those funds for this.We started on October 4, and it just blew up, says 20-year-old Aqsa, Khans elder daughter. We knew there were refugees, but we didnt know there were so many. Since then, Khan and his family, along with four employees, have been working 12-hour shifts to prepare boxes with rice and naan, chole-bhature, vegetable dishes with potatoes, brinjal etc., all cooked using less spice than what is customary in Punjabi cooking, to suit the preferences of Armenians.Aqsa Khan (right) and her sister Alsa pack prepared food in their restaurants kitchen. (Photo: Aqsa Khan) Aqsa Khan (right) and her sister Alsa pack prepared food in their restaurants kitchen. (Photo: Aqsa Khan)But the family doesnt think they are doing anything unusual. There is a lot of unity in Armenia, Aqsa explains, pointing to citizens who have come together to donate whatever was possiblefrom money to essentials. We were thinking about how we could help. So we first posted on the Facebook page about donating proceeds from delivery and take-out orders. But then we saw that the refugees didnt have access to fresh food and we thought this was more impactful.Employees at Indian Mehak Restaurant and Bar in Yerevan, Armenia, work round the clock to prepare food packages. (Photo: Aqsa Khan) Employees at Indian Mehak Restaurant and Bar in Yerevan, Armenia, work round the clock to prepare food packages. (Photo: Aqsa Khan)Aqsa says that the family found inspiration for the initiative when a local resident approached the restaurant asking for dry ingredients that she could use to prepare food for children to whom she was providing shelter. The family offered cooked Indian food instead. We thought that we would be doing it for 25 to 30 people only, says Khan. But the family soon realised that there were many more who needed their assistance.Aqsa and her sister Alsa, 18, then took to Facebook and announced that the restaurant was offering Indian food to whoever was coming in from Artsakh, another name for Nagorno-Karabakh. On the first day, some 400 people asked for help, says Khan. It grew from there, Aqsa adds.Also Read | Azerbaijan vs Armenia: An old regional conflict, interested neighboursAs their social media post has spread, the Khans phones havent stopped ringing. While some callers have been requesting for food packages, many others have reached out to the restaurant to offer assistance in any way they can. Women are calling us to ask if we need help in the kitchen. People are bringing their cars to help distribute the food, says Khan.Recently, a volunteer delivered food from the restaurant all the way to Hrazdan, a town some 50 kms away, where some residents of Nagorno-Karabakh have sought refuge. Another volunteer has helped deliver food to Tsaghkadzor, a town a little further away. While the Khans are cooking the dishes, four Armenians have stepped in to help package the food and deliver it across Yerevan.Now refugees are calling us directly, as are organisations who are helping them. Some hotels who have been hosting refugees have also asked us to provide (food packages) for one meal a day, says Aqsa. I have never seen anything like this.Parvez Ali Khan helps load food packages into a waiting van outside his restaurant in Yerevan, Armenia. (Photo: Aqsa Khan) Parvez Ali Khan helps load food packages into a waiting van outside his restaurant in Yerevan, Armenia. (Photo: Aqsa Khan)Since the initiative is only a few days old, for now, Khan is making use of his restaurants supplies to prepare these food packages. The restaurant has found an outpouring of support from people across Armenia and even those in the diaspora. Many have left them messages of gratitude, promising to visit the restaurant when they can. After the war, I will visit your restaurant and celebrate our victory, says one message on their Facebook page, with hundreds of others in a similar vein.There arent too many Indians in Armenia, says Khan, and his establishment is among the few prominent Indian restaurants in the country. In Yerevan alone, he believes, there must be around 100 Indian families, with approximately 4,000 Indian students studying medicine, scattered in universities across the country. Following the Indian governments operation of Vande Bharat flights to help citizens overseas return home during the coronavirus pandemic, many have temporarily left.The Khan family and their employees pose with the Indian and Armenian national flags in their restaurants kitchen in Yerevan, Armenia.

During their years at school and college in the country, they have made friends, learnt the language and the culture and have adapted well here, while holding on to their Indian citizenship. They like the country. The family has been working non-stop to prepare the food packages and they dont have too much time for more questions.

Even pulses and oilseeds are being procured at the respective MSPs, it said.Seeking to send out a clear message to the protesting farmers that the Centre has no intention of scrapping procurement at MSP, senior officials held a press conference on Wednesday on steps being taken for procurement of the kharif crops.The conference was jointly addressed by agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal, food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey, textile secretary Ravi Capoor and Food Corporation of India (FCI) chairman and managing director D V Prasad.""MSP procurement was done in the past, will be done in the present and future as well. Farmers' need not worry,"" the agriculture secretary said.There has been a record increase in coverage of the kharif crops to 401 lakh hectares this year and a bumper foodgrains production is also expected.

2020-10-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/capt-rejects-farmers-ultimatum-on-vidhan-sabha-session-6708386/,Capt rejects farmers’ ultimatum on Vidhan Sabha session,"The CM said that while his government was totally committed to fighting shoulder to shoulder with the farmers in their fight for their survival. (File)Hours after farmers gave a one-week ultimatum to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to call a special Vidhan Sabha session to reject farm laws, threatening to otherwise ghearo Congress leaders, Amarinder rejected the ultimatum saying he will do what he feels is necessary in the interest of the farmers.Amarinder had earlier said he would call a special session of the Vidhan Sabha on the matter. On Wednesday, he said that an ultimatum cannot be allowed to force the government into taking hasty steps. He reiterated that his sole interest was protecting the states farmers and the farm sector at all costs, and not in appeasing farmer organisations. The Chief Minister added that he will take whatever decisions needed in the best interest of the farming community.He was reacting to reports that, at a meeting held on Wednesday, the kisan unions had issued an ultimatum to the state government for convening a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to amend laws for countering the Centres agricultural legislations.Amarinder made it clear that unions threat to gherao his residence or the houses of the state ministers and Congress leaders would not force him into taking any decision which may eventually turn out to be detrimental to the interests of the farmers.He pointed out that he had taken suggestions of all these unions a few days back on the way forward on the farm laws, and would ensure that nothing is allowed to obstruct his governments efforts to save the livelihood of the farmers and secure the future of their children.On the decision of the kisan unions not to heed his appeal to allow goods trains to pass amid their `rail roko protests, the Chief Minister said it was regrettable, since by not relaxing their agitation, these organisations were damaging the interests of the farmers as well as the state.The state government needs to urgently transport foodgrain, coal, fertilizer and petroleum on priority, besides lifting the paddy grain from the mandis, for which the RBI had already authorised the first tranche of the around Rs 30,220 crore against credit limit till October end, he pointed, urging the unions not to endanger the farmers interest by their decision. The balance CCL of the total Rs 35,552 crore will be released after revision at the end of the month while sanctioning the amount for November.The Chief Minister said if the current stocks of wheat and rice were not lifted from the godowns, there would be no storage capacity left for the next harvest. Further, he noted that the states coal stocks were critical, and if not replenished soon there would be severe power shortages, which would hamper the wheat sowing operations.Amarinder also pointed out that with fertilizer stocks running low, potato sowing would also be adversely affected. With blockades at petrol stations, oil flow was also getting affected, which would impact the movement of tractors and the produce, he added.The CM said that while his government was totally committed to fighting shoulder to shoulder with the farmers in their fight for their survival, these decisions of the kisan unions were not in the interest of the famers. They would cause immense hardship to the farmers themselves, apart from the ordinary citizens of Punjab.This is a collective fight, for which all political parties should join hands with the protesting farmers and the state government, he said, urging the kisan unions to reconsider their decisions in the larger interest of the state and its people, including the farmers.

2020-10-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-markets-msp-no-guarantee-crops-wheat-paddy-6715560/,"In Punjab markets, MSP no guarantee for crops other than wheat, paddy","Over the past three weeks, a large number of farmers have sold around 1.30 lakh quintals narma to ginners, private traders in Bathinda, Mansa, Fazilka Mandis, Mukatsar, Barnala and Faridkot mandis and also directly to fetch a good price. But they have only managed to get Rs. 4,600 to Rs. 5,300 per quintal for even their fine quality cotton.Ajit Singh (50), a farmer from Nathana in Bathinda district of Punjabs Malwa region, sold his 40 quintals kapas/narma directly to a ginning unit, which separates cotton from seed, and the owner of this unit purchased it exactly as per the new agri Act without paying any Market Development Fee (MDF), Rural Development Fee (RDF), which is one per cent each, and 2.5 per cent arhtiya (commission agent) charge. In the end, the farmer was paid Rs. 5,300 per quintal for his crop while the MSP for narma is Rs. 5,725 per quintal. The farmer was given Rs. 425 per quintal less payment  or 7.5 per cent less than MSP  as the buying unit argued that the quality of the crop was not up to the mark. Ginners are the main buyers of raw cotton in Punjab.Ajit is not the only one. A fellow farmer, Gurtej Singh, who sold 20 quintals narma to the same ginner outside the mandi was paid Rs. 5,000 per quintal, which is 12.5 per cent or Rs. 725 per quintal less than the declared MSP. In this case, the ginner paid him less because the farmer came to him via his arhtiya, who charged 2.5 per cent commission per quintal from the purchaser.In both cases  one of direct sale and other through arhtiya outside the mandi, farmers were paid much below the MSP fixed by the government.Over the past three weeks, a large number of farmers have sold around 1.30 lakh quintals narma to ginners, private traders in Bathinda, Mansa, Fazilka Mandis, Mukatsar, Barnala and Faridkot mandis and also directly to fetch a good price. But they have only managed to get Rs. 4,600 to Rs. 5,300 per quintal for even their fine quality cotton.Not only cotton growers in the Malwa region of Punjab are facing such losses but in the other region  Majha  of Punjab where PUSA 1509 Basmati arrival is in full swing farmers are fetching Rs. 1,600 to 2,100 per quintal against Rs. 2,700 per quintal last year, while Basmati rate in the international markets is all-time high this year. This is happening despite Punjab governments reduction in MDF and RDF rates from 2 per cent each to 1 per cent each for Basmati traders and millers, who were demanding level playing field with Haryana where mandi user charges are 1 per cent. The state government has not reduced MDF and RDF rates for cotton.Farmers also sold maize at Rs. 800-900 per quintal recently in the third region, Doaba, of the state against MSP of Rs. 1,850 set by the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).Though the Punjab government has already rejected three agri Acts, and also reduced MDF and RDF on Basmati and may follow it in the cotton crop too, there is no visible change in the fate of farmers who are growing crops other than wheat and paddy, which are purchased by the government. These other crops are sold directly to private players or via arhtiyas.Crops like Basmati, cotton, maize, barley, pulses, oilseeds, guar, etc. are only purchased by the private players barring cotton, which is also purchased by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI). CCI enters the market if the rate goes significantly below the MSP, it enters in the market to level the market price by purchasing cotton at the MSP with up to 1 per cent to 4 per cent of cuts only against MSP depending upon the moisture in cotton.In Punjab, CCI entered the market on Monday and purchased 200 quintals cotton at Sangat (Bathinda) and Tappa (Barnala) mandis at the rate of Rs. 5,496 quintal to 5,725 per quintal which is quite above the prevailing market price of narma in Punjabs mandis. Last year also CCI had purchased 35 per cent of the total 42.60 lakh quintals kapas in Punjab when the rates went down.When I went to a private player to get good price against the mandi what I got over Rs. 400 less than the MSP, said Ajit Singh.We have entered in the market because the rate of cotton has gone very low against the MSP and now we are purchasing it at full MSP with moisture content, not beyond 12 per cent as cotton with moisture content with 8 per cent is getting full MSP and there is 1 to 4 per cent cut if the moisture level is 9 to 12 per cent, said Assistant General Manager (AGM) CCI Punjab Neeraj Kumar, adding that even with 4 per cent cut farmer would get around Rs. 5,500 per quintal.But like cotton, there is no government agency for other crops like Basmati, maize, etc. which will enter the market to purchase these if the market rate goes too low like this year.Why should I pay 4.50 per cent tax including 2 per cent MDF & RDF and 2.5 per cent Arhtiya commission when as per the new bill there is no such condition and farmers are coming to me directly for selling their cotton as nearly 1,000 farmers have approached me and we are paying them as per the quality of their cotton but when we have to pay the above taxes certainly farmers will get less and government must understand it, said Suresh Kumar, Managing Director of Punjab Spintex Limited, a Bathinda based cotton yarn manufacturer, exporter, and owner of a ginning unit.If the government wants a win-win situation for farmers, then it should pay the difference between the MSP and the actual amount paid to the farmers, he said, adding that it will make spinning viable too because CCI sells us cotton (without seed) at quite a high price.Bhagwan Bansal, president, Punjab Ginners Association, said that ginners are the main buyers of the Kapas in Punjab and they are not finding the level playing when neighbouring Haryana is charging 1 per cent mandi user charges, Punjab is sticking to 2 per cent as it will ruin Punjab ginning industry when border area farmers sell in Haryana mandis which are as close as for them as Punjab mandis.But even a slashing of mandi tax may not help farmers as exporters, millers, and traders of Basmati claim that the low rate of Basmati is because of high breakage in the rice.A big rice exporter said that farmers fate will hardly improve because everything is in the hands of the purchaser as they may show his good quality crop in poor light to pay him less and farmers hardly have any option but to sell.Majority of arhtiyas also exploit the farmer in connivance with both- private players and government agencies (for wheat and paddy) by paying less to the farmers for the crop and making gains by charging full MSP from the government, said another rice sheller owner, adding that farmers get their payment from arhtiyas not from the government directly.When the Farmers Produce, Trade and Commerce Bill is not implemented in the state and Punjab government has agreed to the demand of private traders for reduction of MDF and RDF fee then why farmers loot is taking place right under the nose of the Punjab government, questioned farmer Gurmeet Singh Sarhali of village Sarhali under Batala tehsil of district Gurdaspur. Sarhali sold his PUSA 1509 Basmati at the rate of Rs 1,800 per quintal against Rs 2,700 last year. He added: We are diversifying from paddy by growing Basmati for several years, but the government is not thinking about us and had left us to the mercy of exporters, traders, and arhtiyas who are minting huge amount of money from the same Basmati which they are purchasing from us as a meagre price.

price.bhagwan bansal, president, punjab ginners association, said that ginners are the main buyers of the kapas in punjab and they are not finding the level playing when neighbouring haryana is charging 1 per cent mandi user charges, punjab is sticking to 2 per cent as it will ruin punjab ginning industry when border area farmers sell in haryana mandis which are as close as for them as punjab mandis.but even a slashing of mandi tax may not help farmers as exporters, millers, and traders of basmati claim that the low rate of basmati is because of high breakage in the rice.a big rice exporter said that farmers fate will hardly improve because everything is in the hands of the purchaser as they may show his good quality crop in poor light to pay him less and farmers hardly have any option but to sell.majority of arhtiyas also exploit the farmer in connivance with both- private players and government agencies (for wheat and paddy) by paying less to the farmers for the crop and making gains by charging full msp from the government, said another rice sheller owner, adding that farmers get their payment from arhtiyas not from the government directly.when the farmers produce, trade and commerce bill is not implemented in the state and punjab government has agreed to the demand of private traders for reduction of mdf and rdf fee then why farmers loot is taking place right under the nose of the punjab government, questioned farmer gurmeet singh sarhali of village sarhali under batala tehsil of district gurdaspur. sarhali sold his pusa 1509 basmati at the rate of rs 1,800 per quintal against rs 2,700 last year. he added: we are diversifying from paddy by growing basmati for several years, but the government is not thinking about us and had left us to the mercy of exporters, traders, and arhtiyas who are minting huge amount of money from the same basmati which they are purchasing from us as a meagre price. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to

However, only 14 special trains could move out of the state in October till Thursday due to rail roko agitation by various farmer organisations against the Centres three farm laws.Although Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the states godowns have sufficient space to store rice after it arrives from the rice shellers, he has requested farmer unions to allow the movement of goods trains. Each special train carries food grains weighing between 2,500 metric tonnes and 3,000 metric tonnes. Agitating farmers should allow these special trains to move out of Punjab because it is directly linked to the transportation and stocking of their produce, Ashu said.FCI will transport grains once trains startAshu said such trains will also bring fertilisers and coal (for power generation) to Punjab from other states, which are also directly linked to the farmers.Nearly 130 LMT of wheat and 50 LMT of rice are lying in Punjab godowns and as soon as the farmers allow trains to run, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) would again start the transportation process of these food grains to the other states. The FCI has 576 godowns in Punjab with the storage capacity of 235 LMT of grains.Punjab has 27.36 lakh hectares of area under paddy this year and the state government is targeting total procurement of 171 LMT in the kharif marketing season which started on September 27 and would end by November 30. The MSP for common variety paddy is Rs 1,868 per quintal and for A grade Rs 1,888 per quintal for this kharif season.Keep an eye on moisture content , says ministerAshu said the Punjab government is ensuring that paddy is procured on MSP and the farmers are paid by arhtiyas (commission agents) within 24 hours. Asked about the complaints from some mandis, including Ajnala, in Punjab about the paddy being procured below the MSP, he replied, We are requesting farmers to ensure that they bring paddy to the mandis that has moisture content not more than the specification. Otherwise, arhtiyas sometimes either reject their produce or purchase it at price below MSP on mutual consent with the farmer. But, he said, if any complaint is received against anyone indulging in illegal activities, prompt action would be taken against the culprit.The maximum permissible moisture content in paddy is 17%. Though some arhtiyas do purchase paddy having moisture content even up to 22%, they impose the value cut as per the increase in moisture. After the procurement, when the paddy reaches rice millers, they have to deliver 67 kg of rice for every 100 kg of paddy to the government or the FCI. So when the moisture content is more at the time of procurement, it finally results in less rice out of paddy after milling process.","picture used for representational purpose onlychandigarh: nearly 1,000 special goods trains left punjab with around 1.16 lakh metric tonnes (lmt) of wheat and rice for other states in september. however, only 14 special trains could move out of the state in october till thursday due to rail roko agitation by various farmer organisations against the centres three farm laws.although punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister bharat bhushan ashu said the states godowns have sufficient space to store rice after it arrives from the rice shellers, he has requested farmer unions to allow the movement of goods trains. each special train carries food grains weighing between 2,500 metric tonnes and 3,000 metric tonnes. agitating farmers should allow these special trains to move out of punjab because it is directly linked to the transportation and stocking of their produce, ashu said.fci will transport grains once trains startashu said such trains will also bring fertilisers and coal (for power generation) to punjab from other states, which are also directly linked to the farmers.nearly 130 lmt of wheat and 50 lmt of rice are lying in punjab godowns and as soon as the farmers allow trains to run, the food corporation of india (fci) would again start the transportation process of these food grains to the other states. the fci has 576 godowns in punjab with the storage capacity of 235 lmt of grains.punjab has 27.36 lakh hectares of area under paddy this year and the state government is targeting total procurement of 171 lmt in the kharif marketing season which started on september 27 and would end by november 30. the msp for common variety paddy is rs 1,868 per quintal and for a grade rs 1,888 per quintal for this kharif season.keep an eye on moisture content , says ministerashu said the punjab government is ensuring that paddy is procured on msp and the farmers are paid by arhtiyas (commission agents) within 24 hours. asked about the complaints from some mandis, including ajnala, in punjab about the paddy being procured below the msp, he replied, we are requesting farmers to ensure that they bring paddy to the mandis that has moisture content not more than the specification. otherwise, arhtiyas sometimes either reject their produce or purchase it at price below msp on mutual consent with the farmer. but, he said, if any complaint is received against anyone indulging in illegal activities, prompt action would be taken against the culprit.the maximum permissible moisture content in paddy is 17%. though some arhtiyas do purchase paddy having moisture content even up to 22%, they impose the value cut as per the increase in moisture. after the procurement, when the paddy reaches rice millers, they have to deliver 67 kg of rice for every 100 kg of paddy to the government or the fci. so when the moisture content is more at the time of procurement, it finally results in less rice out of paddy after milling process."

(Representational)A day after advance procurement of paddy began in Punjab on September 27, the state appointed 8,000 nodal officers across villages of Punjab to curb stubble burning. But these nodal officers, as per initial stubble burning trends, seem to have failed in curbing the menace.There role this season so far has been limited to verifying and reporting the field burning cases to their respective coordinators or cluster officers, rather than preventing stubble burning.In Punjab, rice harvesting mainly begins from Majha region  Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, and Pathankot districts  in the second week of September as this region mainly goes for short duration varieties of rice including PUSA 1509, a Basmati variety. This is done to make way for two more crops, vegetables and a late variety of wheat or winter maize.This is also the reason that stubble fires start from Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts as farmers are in hurry to clear the fields for the next crop.According to emerging trends, Punjab has reported 1,926 stubble burning cases till Friday out of which 1,427 fires (74 per cent) were reported from Majha including 48 per cent from Amritsar, 21 per cent from Tarn Taran, and 5 per cent from Gurdaspur district. Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has also imposed environmental compensation of worth Rs 12.25 lakh in 460 cases.According to the PPCB, around a half dozen farmers have been booked for setting their fields on fire. These fires are more than four times higher as compared to the last year when 461 fires were reported during the same period from September 21 to October 9.In Malwa, there is one district, Patiala,which has reported highest 153 cases to date.The trends are showing that in Amritsar three blocks  Majithia, Tarsikka and Jandiala Guru  have reported 542 fires out of total 920 of the district, whereas Taran Khadur Sahib and Tarn Taran blocks reported 247 out of 405 fires.In Patiala too, Pataran block reported 48 out of 153 fires.In all these blocks farmers go for vegetable sowing after the paddy harvesting and to clear the fields for the next crop they are burning their fields instead incorporating the stubble in the soil, said Dr. Anil Sood, head of ACM Division, Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, adding that this time due to early harvesting because of the early sowing due to Covid and no late rain in September (which used to delay the harvesting), the fires have started showing high trend early as compared to last year.These blocks are those blocks where farmers take three crops in a year as they sow mattar (green peas) and potato in September and October, respectively, and after harvesting these in November and December they go for either later variety of wheat or winter maize or ajwaain (celery), said Chief Agriculture Officer (CAO) Tarn Taran, Dr Kulbir Singh Saini, also having additional charge of CAO Amritsar.Vegetable farmers hardly have time to incorporate stubble and they are not ready to spend Rs 3000 extra to incorporate the stubble for preparing field for vegetables, said an Agriculture Development officer in Amritsar, requesting anonymity, adding that it is important to change the mindset of farmers.Nodal Officers (NOs), who will work till November 15  the end of harvesting season, were supposed to make the farmers aware to the harmful impact of stubble burning.For creating awareness, the NOs were authorised to organise meetings at village level and hand over pamphlets. However, most of the NOs, who are from various government departments including school teachers, agri department employees, cooperation department, rural development, revenue department, Guardian of Governance (GoGs), have limited themselves to verifying, reporting of the field fires with reason on the Action Taken Report (ATR) app of the government.My role begins when I get a message from PRSC about a fire in my village and then I go there, verify that whether it is stubble fire or any other fire including fire to garbage of any accidental fire and then after clicking the photos of that I upload it on the App with reasons of fire and then next task is of the coordinator of cluster officer, said a government school teacher, who is appointed as NO in Tarn Taran, adding that farmers hardly listen to them.Government does not want any confrontation with the farmers due to ongoing agitation of the farmers against the three agri Acts passed by the Centre.The state government does not want that the anger against Centre should take a turn towards them and has asked us to be soft with farmers, said a senior agriculture officer in Amritsar, adding that farmers only need Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 compensation to curb this.Authorities, meanwhile, maintain that there is nothing to be worried about it as it is just the beginning and the fires will be much less this year by the end of the harvesting.Punjab has distributed 23,500 stubble management machines this year in addition to 51,000 such machines that were already available in the state till the previous year.Newly appointed Director, Agriculture Punjab, Rajesh Vashisth neither took calls nor replied to the message sent to him about the role of nodal officers in curbing the burning.

2020-10-10,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-economic-arguments-in-favour-of-the-three-farm-bills-all-you-need-to-know/story-o83I0wXRIqKATqspyQ9VqO.html,The economic arguments in favour of the three farm bills: All you need to know,"The economic arguments in favour of the three farm bills: All you need to knowindiaUpdated: Oct 10, 2020 08:30 ISTLast week, the President of India gave his ascent to the three farm bills, namely, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 (FPTC), the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 (FAPAFS), and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The opposition and farmers organisations continue to protest against these laws. While politics will take its own course, it is useful to examine the economic rationale of the arguments being given to justify these bills. The arguments, broadly speaking, are twofold.One, the bills give greater freedom to farmers to sell their produce. They will abolish intermediaries, or at least some levels of intermediaries between farmers and buyers. This will ensure that the farmer gets a bigger share of the price paid by the consumer and will, therefore, improve agricultural incomes.Two, the clamour for incorporating Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) into the law is a pursuit of vested interests as only a handful of farmers enjoy the benefits of MSP-based procurement in the country today. The agricultural practices in Green Revolution regions of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, where MSP was the cornerstone, have prevented reforms and these changes will lead to a creative destruction in agriculture.Unfair exchange is not the basic reason for predicament of Indian farmersThe argument that these bills will remove intermediaries, and therefore make farmers well-off, assumes that an unfair exchange is the biggest problem facing Indias farmers. But Inflation data shows that retail and wholesale prices for important food items, cereals, pulses, vegetables and fruits, move in tandem. This means farmgate prices are not completely divorced from the prices prevailing in retail markets, and intermediaries do pass on profits or losses in food markets to farmers.What could be a bigger problem for farmers is the large volatility in prices of crops such as pulses and vegetables. Cereals, where the MSP regime is in place for rice and wheat (over one-third of the total rice and wheat production is procured by the government), face the lowest price volatility. This is exactly why farmers keep demanding MSP-based procurement for all crops.The main reason for the agrarian crisis is that agriculture employs far too many people to be remunerative. At least 40% of Indias workforce is employed in agriculture, even though it generates less than 15% of the countrys GDP. The current set of reforms does nothing to address this basic income-employment asymmetry in agriculture.That Indian agriculture, including the green revolution states, have a lot of inefficiencies is well known. Some of these inefficiencies, such as overexploitation of groundwater, have emerged as a serious threat to sustainability of farming itself. MSP-based procurement of rice in states like Punjab has contributed to the sustainability crisis of agriculture. But there is more to this.Agriculture is essentially an unviable exercise in IndiaFarming, even at MSP prices has not been always viable in India. The government claims that MSPs provide a guaranteed return of at least 50% over the cost of production for farmers. The cost measure used by the government to calculate this mark-up is A2+FL. It includes the cost incurred on hired labour, imputed family labour, seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, irrigation charges, interest on working capital, land revenue, depreciation on farm buildings and implements and rent paid for leased-in land. Farmers organisations have been demanding for a long time that MSPs should provide a 50% return over the C2 measure of cost, which includes rental value of own land and interest on fixed capital in addition. Logically speaking, C2 includes the opportunity cost of being in farming. A farmer could choose to rent his land and utilise his fixed capital for other income instead of using it for farming. A comparison of MSPs for rice and wheat with these two cost measures shows that they do not cover the entire C2. Since cost measures are released with a time lag, this comparison cannot be made for recent years.The natural question to ask his why do farmers still continue farming even if the best-case scenarioprocurement over MSPis not remunerative enough? This otherwise counter-intuitive question of why seemingly unviable economic activities continue is a recurring theme in political economy.It is not necessary that the cost heads for imputed family labour or rental value of land are actually paid out by the farmer during the production process. While such a squeeze might keep farming economically viable in terms of actual payables and receivables, it does entail the farmer embracing poverty of sorts. While most people associate poverty lines with predefined income levels, such as the popular $1/day poverty line of the World Bank, classical political economists have other views. A 2011 World Bank blog by Martin Ravallion quotes Adam Smiths concept of relative poverty from the Wealth of Nations.A linen shirt  is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct., Smith wrote. It is not very difficult to envisage farmers not being able to afford goods and services, which are seen essential for leading a dignified life in todays age and age.Government policy has not helpedThere are two ways to improve farm incomeseither increase yields, or prices. Both of these face policy apathy. India lags behind countries such as the US and China in terms of yields even for cereals. This gap has been increasing overtime.Yet, India spends much less on agricultural research and development than China. According to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), spending on agricultural research in China was 0.62% of its value added in agriculture, while this number was just 0.3% for India. These numbers are for 2013, the latest period for which data is available in the FAO database. The numbers are unlikely to have changed for India. The total expenditure (revised estimates) of Department of Research and Education under Ministry of Agriculture was 0.24% of the value added in agriculture.Policy intervention on prices often takes the shape of depriving farmers of any windfall gains from higher prices, while no support is available when prices crash. Even MSPs for rice and wheat have been growing at a slower pace in the past few years.The way forwardThe future of Indian agriculture cannot be salvaged by simply allowing greater freedom to farmers. Agriculture can have a better future only when the excess workforce employed in farming moves to the non-farm sector and there is a greater demand for agricultural products as incomes increase. Because the majority of Indians cannot even afford a decent food basket, many commentators have reached a wrong conclusion that Indian agriculture is facing a problem of plenty.Also, Indias policymakers need to realise that agriculture is heavily supported by governments in most countries. As has been pointed out by Ashok Gulati in an Indian Express article published on September 28, producer support to farming in India as a share of total farm receipts is negative, something which goes against the stereotype of agriculture being heavily subsidised. Promises of future gains from deregulation can hardly be a substitute for budgetary support for Indian farmers.","the economic arguments in favour of the three farm bills: all you need to knowindiaupdated: oct 10, 2020 08:30 istlast week, the president of india gave his ascent to the three farm bills, namely, the farmers produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) bill, 2020 (fptc), the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement of price assurance and farm services bill, 2020 (fapafs), and the essential commodities (amendment) bill, 2020. the opposition and farmers organisations continue to protest against these laws. while politics will take its own course, it is useful to examine the economic rationale of the arguments being given to justify these bills. the arguments, broadly speaking, are twofold.one, the bills give greater freedom to farmers to sell their produce. they will abolish intermediaries, or at least some levels of intermediaries between farmers and buyers. this will ensure that the farmer gets a bigger share of the price paid by the consumer and will, therefore, improve agricultural incomes.two, the clamour for incorporating minimum support prices (msps) into the law is a pursuit of vested interests as only a handful of farmers enjoy the benefits of msp-based procurement in the country today. the agricultural practices in green revolution regions of punjab, haryana and western uttar pradesh, where msp was the cornerstone, have prevented reforms and these changes will lead to a creative destruction in agriculture.unfair exchange is not the basic reason for predicament of indian farmersthe argument that these bills will remove intermediaries, and therefore make farmers well-off, assumes that an unfair exchange is the biggest problem facing indias farmers. but inflation data shows that retail and wholesale prices for important food items, cereals, pulses, vegetables and fruits, move in tandem. this means farmgate prices are not completely divorced from the prices prevailing in retail markets, and intermediaries do pass on profits or losses in food markets to farmers.what could be a bigger problem for farmers is the large volatility in prices of crops such as pulses and vegetables. cereals, where the msp regime is in place for rice and wheat (over one-third of the total rice and wheat production is procured by the government), face the lowest price volatility. this is exactly why farmers keep demanding msp-based procurement for all crops.the main reason for the agrarian crisis is that agriculture employs far too many people to be remunerative. at least 40% of indias workforce is employed in agriculture, even though it generates less than 15% of the countrys gdp. the current set of reforms does nothing to address this basic income-employment asymmetry in agriculture.that indian agriculture, including the green revolution states, have a lot of inefficiencies is well known. some of these inefficiencies, such as overexploitation of groundwater, have emerged as a serious threat to sustainability of farming itself. msp-based procurement of rice in states like punjab has contributed to the sustainability crisis of agriculture. but there is more to this.agriculture is essentially an unviable exercise in indiafarming, even at msp prices has not been always viable in india. the government claims that msps provide a guaranteed return of at least 50% over the cost of production for farmers. the cost measure used by the government to calculate this mark-up is a2+fl. it includes the cost incurred on hired labour, imputed family labour, seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, irrigation charges, interest on working capital, land revenue, depreciation on farm buildings and implements and rent paid for leased-in land. farmers organisations have been demanding for a long time that msps should provide a 50% return over the c2 measure of cost, which includes rental value of own land and interest on fixed capital in addition. logically speaking, c2 includes the opportunity cost of being in farming. a farmer could choose to rent his land and utilise his fixed capital for other income instead of using it for farming. a comparison of msps for rice and wheat with these two cost measures shows that they do not cover the entire c2. since cost measures are released with a time lag, this comparison cannot be made for recent years.the natural question to ask his why do farmers still continue farming even if the best-case scenarioprocurement over mspis not remunerative enough?

This changeover did not benefit the farm sector to the extent it should have, and it serves as a cautionary tale for the rest of the country in doing away with regulations without the right incentives for private investment in agriculture, economists have said.Also Read: The economic arguments in favour of the three farm bills: All you need to knowBihar is one of the fastest growing states in India, with its gross state domestic product, or GSDP, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12.14% between 2011-12 and 2016-17. The share of agriculture in the states GSDP is about 23%, higher than the national average of 14%, which means that the farm sector generates more income as a proportion of the overall income in Bihar than it does in the country as a whole.The reforms dont appear to have improved Bihars agricultural growth. Farm growth in the state averaged 2.04%, lower than the all-India average of 3.12% in the period between 2001-02 to 2016-17. This happened despite a stable political environment, improvement in investment on rural infrastructure and reforms in agricultural marketing, said Elumalai Kannan and Sanjib Pohit, authoris of the NCAER study..The post-reforms period, when compared to the pre-reforms period, does show an increase in the average wholesale prices of major crops such as paddy, wheat, and maize. The average price of paddy increased by 126%, wheat by 66%, and maize by 81%, the authors said.However, analysis showed that a simultaneous increase in volatility of prices affected the stability of farmers income, ultimately affecting farmers ability to invest and diversify. This instability in prices of farm produce, the authors note, could be a reason for Bihars lower agricultural growth. Price volatility refers to price fluctuations of a commodity.Maize is a major crop in the state. In the pre-reform period (2002-06), the price volatility of maize (as calculated by a statistical measure known as coefficient of variation) stood at 11.2%. This went up to 24.9% in the post-reform period (2007-16). Similarly, price volatility had gone up significantly for also paddy and wheat. A knock-on effect of the lockdown has resulted in maize prices crashing to Rs 1,000-1,300 per quintal, against a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,850, this year.An analysis by Jaipur-based Chaudhury Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (CCSNIAM) conducted in 2011-12, along with the NCAER study quoted above, unanimously state that after APMC market yards were abolished in the state, there has been scant private investment in new markets.This has led to low market density, meaning farmers often lack secure market channels within easy reach. The studies have called for a public-private partnership for developing wholesale markets.One reason why the reforms did not pay off for Bihar is the lack of enabling policies. The state needed to have incentive mechanisms, such as tax concessions, to attract private investment in the creation of agricultural markets, cold storage and warehousing facilities, economists said.The withdrawal of the government has meant that there is no assured floor price in the form of MSP. Farmers are left to the mercy of traders who unscrupulously fix a lower price for agricultural produce that they buy. Inadequate market facilities and institutional arrangements are responsible for low price realisation and instability in prices, the NCAER study has noted.The latest countrywide farm reforms, therefore, are no silver bullet. The expectation with these reforms is, once you allow markets to determine both production and prices and what to produce, it will help farmers with better price discovery. Thats the assumption, said NR Bhanumurthy, the vice-chancellor of the Bengaluru BR Ambedkar School of Economics.Bhanumurthy said the opening up of state-run APMC markets to private competition alone wont work if it is not accompanied by other factors, such as an efficient crop insurance, expansion of food processing, storage infrastructure and better market information systems.","indiaupdated: oct 10, 2020 15:24 istbihars agricultural reforms of 2006, which saw the state liberalise agricultural trade by abolishing state-regulated markets, resulted in better prices for produce such as rice, wheat and maize, but the changes also brought greater price volatility, ultimately hurting farm growth, a study has suggested.the reforms did not result in any significant private investment in new market infrastructure and a missing floor price due to the governments withdrawal from the sector continued to put farmers at a disadvantage, the study by the national council of applied economic research (ncaer) said in their ongoing research project agricultural diagnostic for bihar state of india.the findings of the study come in the wake of parliament enacting three controversial farm reforms that aim to liberalise the agricultural sector, including ending local monopolies of state-run wholesale markets -- known as agriculture produce market committees or apmcs -- by opening them up to private competition.also read: bjps cec to meet today to discuss candidate list for bihar pollsthe national democratic alliance (nda) government pushed the three bills -- the farmers produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) bill, 2020;

2020-10-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/punjab-farmers-adamant-on-burning-stubble-authorities-hope-to-convince-them-6721207/,"Punjab: Farmers adamant on burning stubble, authorities hope to convince them","However, the department of agriculture is still hopeful of convincing the farmers. (Representational)On October 10, residents of Thikriwal village of Barnala district tore away flex sheets which had a message printed, asking people not to burning paddy stubble. The tempo driver who had to fix these sheets on flex boards in different villages had to run to save himself and the remaining flex boards lying in his tempo. Minor children too were involved in this protest.Flex sheets were damaged in many villages of Mansa. At Sangatpura village of Sangrur, these sheets were removed from boards within hours. At Ladhal and Daska villages of Sangrur, government officials were taken hostage when they went to stop farm fires on Saturday. Tehsildaars had to rush to intervene. On October 7, a patwari had been held hostage for hours at Jhoran village in Sangrur and Tehsildar Kuldeep Singh had to apologise publicly to bring back patwari who was kept hostage by BKU (Ugrahan).In protests being organised at different places in Punjab, farmer union leaders are publicly announcing that they would take officials to task if they come to stop farm fires. They assert that this year, they will not listen to any appeals to stop farm fires.These are a few incidents which show farmers are hell-bent on burning paddy stubble in Punjab. Many of them claim that when the government is troubling them with farm laws, they would not cooperate with them.However, the department of agriculture is still hopeful of convincing the farmers. Rajesh Vashisht, Punjab director (agriculture), told The Indian Express, In 2018-19, we had provided 28,000 crop residue management machines (CRM) to farmers at subidised rates for which there was a budget of Rs 250 crore. In 2019-20 financial year, another 23,000 machines were provided to farmers with a budget of Rs 233 crore. In the current financial year, we have a target of providing 23,500 machines to farmers for which our allocated budget for subsidy is Rs 239 crore. We can extend it to Rs 300 crore as well . All these machines aim to do CRM and hence, farm fires in those fields will come down automatically. These (incidents of farmers defiance) are a few sporadic incidents. As farmer unions are protesting against farm laws, they have started raising paddy stubble burning issues as well.He said, I appeal to farmers to relax rail roko as we need a minimum of 20 days to bring DAP in Punjab from Kandla port and further distribute it in all districts as 80% of the DAP is imported. Harvesting is in full swing and, therefore, farmers may need it any time. We need time for transportation and distribution as well. If sowing of wheat is delayed even by a week, it can affect the yield by 1.5 quintal per acre. Hence, the farmers should not cause loss to themselves and should relax rail roko.Manmohan Kalia, nodal officer (CRM), told The Indian Express, Around 14 lakh farmers are involved in paddy transplantation. In 2018-19, area under paddy was 31.03 lakh hectare (LH) out of which 5 LH was basmati. In 2018-19, a total of 49% of area under paddy farming was burnt after harvesting while in 2019-20, area under paddy reduced to 29.30 LH while basmati out of it increased to 6LH and the paddy stubble was burnt on 37.4% area which was 11.6% less compared to previous year. This year, our crop residue machines are increasingly reaching more villages. The area under paddy cultivation has further reduced to 27.3 LH while basmati increased to 7 LH out of this total area. Hence, paddy varieties were grown on 20.3 LH out of which 5LH was done via direct sowing of rice (DSR). We hope that fields wont burnt in DSR technique and even basmati-growing farmers wont burn fields unless they grow yet another crop before wheat sowing. We hope to decrease the area under paddy stubble burning. We are aware that farmer unions are protesting against farm laws but still our efforts will continue.Kalia said that they have honoured more than 50,000 farmers in the past three years for not burning their fields. However, many farmers are asking union leaders to come to their villages so that no official can check them when they burn their fields.

(representational)on october 10, residents of thikriwal village of barnala district tore away flex sheets which had a message printed, asking people not to burning paddy stubble. the tempo driver who had to fix these sheets on flex boards in different villages had to run to save himself and the remaining flex boards lying in his tempo. minor children too were involved in this protest.flex sheets were damaged in many villages of mansa. at sangatpura village of sangrur, these sheets were removed from boards within hours. at ladhal and daska villages of sangrur, government officials were taken hostage when they went to stop farm fires on saturday. tehsildaars had to rush to intervene. on october 7, a patwari had been held hostage for hours at jhoran village in sangrur and tehsildar kuldeep singh had to apologise publicly to bring back patwari who was kept hostage by bku (ugrahan).in protests being organised at different places in punjab, farmer union leaders are publicly announcing that they would take officials to task if they come to stop farm fires. they assert that this year, they will not listen to any appeals to stop farm fires.these are a few incidents which show farmers are hell-bent on burning paddy stubble in punjab. many of them claim that when the government is troubling them with farm laws, they would not cooperate with them.however, the department of agriculture is still hopeful of convincing the farmers. rajesh vashisht, punjab director (agriculture), told the indian express, in 2018-19, we had provided 28,000 crop residue management machines (crm) to farmers at subidised rates for which there was a budget of rs 250 crore. in 2019-20 financial year, another 23,000 machines were provided to farmers with a budget of rs 233 crore. in the current financial year, we have a target of providing 23,500 machines to farmers for which our allocated budget for subsidy is rs 239 crore. we can extend it to rs 300 crore as well . all these machines aim to do crm and hence, farm fires in those fields will come down automatically. these (incidents of farmers defiance) are a few sporadic incidents. as farmer unions are protesting against farm laws, they have started raising paddy stubble burning issues as well.he said, i appeal to farmers to relax rail roko as we need a minimum of 20 days to bring dap in punjab from kandla port and further distribute it in all districts as 80% of the dap is imported. harvesting is in full swing and, therefore, farmers may need it any time. we need time for transportation and distribution as well. if sowing of wheat is delayed even by a week, it can affect the yield by 1.5 quintal per acre. hence, the farmers should not cause loss to themselves and should relax rail roko.manmohan kalia, nodal officer (crm), told the indian express, around 14 lakh farmers are involved in paddy transplantation. in 2018-19, area under paddy was 31.03 lakh hectare (lh) out of which 5 lh was basmati. in 2018-19, a total of 49% of area under paddy farming was burnt after harvesting while in 2019-20, area under paddy reduced to 29.30 lh while basmati out of it increased to 6lh and the paddy stubble was burnt on 37.4% area which was 11.6% less compared to previous year. this year, our crop residue machines are increasingly reaching more villages. the area under paddy cultivation has further reduced to 27.3 lh while basmati increased to 7 lh out of this total area. hence, paddy varieties were grown on 20.3 lh out of which 5lh was done via direct sowing of rice (dsr). we hope that fields wont burnt in dsr technique and even basmati-growing farmers wont burn fields unless they grow yet another crop before wheat sowing. we hope to decrease the area under paddy stubble burning. we are aware that farmer unions are protesting against farm laws but still our efforts will continue.kalia said that they have honoured more than 50,000 farmers in the past three years for not burning their fields. however, many farmers are asking union leaders to come to their villages so that no official can check them when they burn their fields. the farmers allege the centre has also refused to pay rs 100 per quintal bonus to them for not burning paddy stubble. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest ludhiana news, download indian express app."

(Photo: Harmeet Sodhi)(Written by Karamvir Singh Sidhu)Farmers all over the country are protesting against the recently approved three laws on agriculture produce marketing. However these protests are more vociferous in Punjab, where the common people also support the cause of the farmers.No doubt the central government has violated the constitutional provisions of federalism by enacting law on agriculture, which is a state subject. However, the prime reason for univocal opposition to the new laws is due to blatant attack on the institutional system of procurement of wheat and paddy at minimum support price (MSP), which is the lifeline of Punjabs socio-economic fibre.Force behind the Green RevolutionThe robust institutional system of procurement of wheat and paddy did not come up in a single day, it has emanated from a phenomenon known as Green Revolution. It was a holistic programme, conceived in the early sixties, to pull the teeming population from the ruthless jaws of hunger by achieving manifold increase in the yield of cereals grown in the Indian fields. The programme was conceptualised in two parts, first to increase the yield of grain by shifting from traditional agriculture to industrial agriculture by using high yielding varieties (HYV) of seeds, intensive chemical fertilizers and consistent irrigation. Second part of the programme was to create an institutional system to incentivise the farmers by providing them an assured and remunerative price of their produce so that they feel encouraged to invest in HYV seeds, fertilizers and other inputs to increase the productivity. Two significant institutions  Agriculture Prices Commission, now known as Commission for Agriculture Cost And Prices (CACP) and Food Corporation of India (FCI)  were established whose respective mandates were to fix remunerative support price and facilitate procurement of produce to be distributed amongst the poor of the country through public distribution system (PDS). Simultaneously, Punjab established its own infrastructure to regulate and streamline the procurement on behalf of FCI.The farmers of Punjab, due to their entrepreneurial attitude and capability to adopt innovations, put their blood and sweat to make Green Revolution a success and in less than 10 years transformed the perception of India, in food production, from ship to mouth situation to a food surplus nation.new Laws favour private playersUnfortunately with a single stroke of pen, this historical edifice has been made redundant by the Union government. The law favours private players who will outclass the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) registered trades due to uneven playing field. The asymmetric competition between the private players and APMC registered trades are well defined in the provisions of Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020, which is the most controversial among the three Acts. As per this Act, farmers are not required to market their produce through APMC registered trades, they are free to sell it to any trader, company or an individual possessing a PAN. Farmers can create their own e-platform to market their produce anywhere in the country. States can neither check nor regulate intra-state or inter-state movement of farm produce. They can not levy any tax or duty outside the APMC markets. These provisions will create a parallel market of unregistered and unbridled individuals, traders and corporations who will open their shops anywhere in the state and will compete with the registered APMC traders who will have to pay the state taxes.The most visible damage to Punjab will be the loss of revenue from Market Fees and Infrastructure Development Fund, which is approximately Rs 3600 crore per annum. This fund is dedicated to rural development such as construction and maintenance of village link roads, APMC markets, agriculture research and allied activities, due to which Punjabs rural infrastructure is the best in the country.More than 500,000 to be affectedLivelihood of approximately 45,000 APMC traders, 500,000 casual workers who work in mandis during rabi and kharif seasons and transporters will also be threatened.There are around 5,000 rice mills in MSME sector. In near future these mills will also be shut down under the monopoly of multinational companies (MNCs) who will establish their own mills of huge capacities. At present Punjab Mandi Board compiles all the data of daily wholesale price of cereals, fruits, vegetables and pulses traded in the state. Henceforth, there will be no agency to collect and tabulate such data because the transactions that will take place outside the APMC markets will not be recorded anywhere.The provisions of contract Act known as The farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 are also disappointing. The farmers fundamental right to approach judicial courts, in case of dispute with the companies have been taken away by keeping this Act beyond the jurisdiction of legal frame work. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 will encourage hoarding and black-marketing. The chances of MNCs creating artificial scarcity of stocked produce also cannot be ruled out.Strengthening agricultural supply chains is a welcome step. Bringing in multinational companies to integrate the produce of India with global supply chain is also a pro-active thinking. However, providing unbridled access to MNCs at the cost of APMC markets by branding them monopolistic and exploitative institution and putting the states entire supply chain in the lap of MNCs who have devoured more than 80% of national assets amount to throwing the farmers from frying pan into the fire.Noble Laureate Joseph Stiglitz amply depicts the character of MNCs as greedy and heartless entities who place their profits above all other values. They squelch their competitors and squeeze their suppliers and workers and put their costs on society ,without regulations and positive interventions markets on their own run the risk of reinforcing inequalities and create societies of haves and have nots. Only those countries have taken the advantage of free market economy who have kept the greed of MNCs under control through institutional competition discipline and developmental taxes.MNCs all over the world are eyeing to establish their hegemony on farm produce trade along with agriculture land, which is the biggest business as well as an asset in the world.Farmers in developed countries are also pressurising their governments to bring in land protection laws to help save them from the corporate greed. Canadian government has started a process in this direction. Unfortunately the Indian government, through the new laws, has become an accomplice to fulfil the ambitions of the corporates. The high tech silos being constructed in Punjab by one of the Indian MNCs is part of a greater design as this company wishes to join the wheat cartel of the world where Australia, USA, Canada, European Unions and Japan are active partners. They are in pursuit of roping in the rest of the world to make consolidated cartel so that entire wheat production as well as the trade of wheat is fully controlled by them.These reforms will push at least 70% small and marginal farmers out of agriculture to serve as a cheap labour to the industry. Even former RBI chairman Raghuram Rajan supports this view.If the present laws are not amended they will prove the last straw to break the camels back and an era of serfdom may start in rural India, which is antithesis to the psyche of a Punjabi farmer.Land foundation of farmers social lifeLand is the foundation of Punjabi farmers culture and social life, he locates his roots and existence in his land, he will never accept such law, which attacks his existence. It is therefore imperative for the central government to visualize psychological and financial implication of these laws on the social structure of the state.The perception that political parties are behind the farmers agitation in Punjab is misconstrued and lack of intelligence regarding ground realities.

2020-10-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhis-air-quality-poorwind-direction-shift-may-improve-it-6721681/,Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’;wind direction shift may improve it,"High PM2.5 levels are seen during winter and post-monsoon.The air quality in the national capital and adjacent areas was recorded in the poor category on Monday morning, with concentration of fine particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 increasing to the highest recorded levels this season so far.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.The city recorded an overall AQI of 240 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.The AQI in Jahangirpuri (301) and Vivek Vihar (316) hit the very poor category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 242 microgram per cubic meter (g/m3) at 9 am  the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100g/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream were 106g/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60g/m3 are considered safe.Delhis air quality had turned poor on Wednesday, the first time in since June 29, with the Central Pollution Control Board recording a 24-hour average AQI of 215.SAFAR said as many as 448 farm fires were observed in Punjab, adjoining Pakistan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh which impacted Delhis air quality on Sunday.However, the wind direction will change from northwesterly to southeasterly and the impact of farm fires will reduce, it said.On Monday morning, Delhis minimum temperature settled at 19.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 pandemic.High level of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most  18 to 39 percent  to Delhis air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign  Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh  which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A green war room with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government will also start the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, starting Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017.

He has publicly said that while the laws give farmers options to sell their produce to private buyers, the government would continue to purchase staples such as rice and wheat at MSPs. The laws seek to end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees or APMCs by opening the sector to private competition.These assurances have done little to satisfy millions of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and western parts of Uttar Pradesh. Big farmer groups, who usually produce substantial surpluses, fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.The reforms are a crucial test for the Narendra Modi governments ability to push through structural reforms in the countrys antiquated agriculture sector, which supports nearly half of all Indians, while mollifying especially large farmers in the food bowl states, who are an influential voting bloc.At the talks, the agriculture ministry team comprising senior officials as well as government economists intend to clarify the governments intention and make presentation on the economic benefits of opening up agriculture trade, an official said requesting anonymity.Influential farm leaders from Punjab

the government would continue to purchase staples such as rice and wheat at msps. the laws seek to end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees or apmcs by opening the sector to private competition.these assurances have done little to satisfy millions of farmers in punjab, haryana and western parts of uttar pradesh. big farmer groups, who usually produce substantial surpluses, fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.the reforms are a crucial test for the narendra modi governments ability to push through structural reforms in the countrys antiquated agriculture sector, which supports nearly half of all indians, while mollifying especially large farmers in the food bowl states, who are an influential voting bloc.at the talks, the agriculture ministry team comprising senior officials as well as government economists intend to clarify the governments intention and make presentation on the economic benefits of opening up agriculture trade, an official said requesting anonymity.influential farm leaders from punjab invited to the talks include balbir singh rajewal, head of the bharatiya kisan union (rajewal), ruldu singh mansa, president of punjab kisan union, major singh punnawal of the kulhind kisan sabha, indrajit singh kot buddha of kisan

Agricultural growth, in independent India, has passed through many phases.The new laws are in sync with input subsidy, minimum support price, government procurement and distribution of foodgrains, introduction of contract farming through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act.The share of agriculture workers in the total workforce of the country has come down from 69.9% in 1951 to 54.6% in 2011, according to the Census. In the corresponding period, the share of agriculture as part of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) output has declined from 51.9% to 14.4%. The fall in employment share is not commensurate with the decline in the GDP share. The agriculture sector uses a workforce which far exceeds its economic value. The average income of an agricultural household as against its average monthly consumption is nearly on par.Indias agricultural policy right from Independence was geared towards food sufficiency. Remunerative crop pricing was never a priority. The standard approach towards increasing farmers income was always about devising supplementary means in the form of animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries and bee-keeping. This continued as a matter of policy even after we moved from food scarcity to food surplus.The Green Revolution is seen as the success of new technology, which brought with it high-yielding crops. However, what is often overlooked is the role of farmers. Since 1955, foodgrain imports from the United States (US) under the PL-480 scheme, in excess of market requirement, kept the prices artificially down. This resulted in farmers becoming demoralised. However, when imports were reduced to realistic levels, farmers felt the incentive to produce more. This is what we need today.Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has advocated doubling farmers incomes by 2022 from the levels of 2016. He spoke of remunerative pricing in this regard.On April 13, 2016, the government set up a Committee on Doubling Farmers Income chaired by Dr Ashok Dalwai. The committee, after consultations, came up with 14 reports. The farm laws were based on the insights provided by this committee.There are 23 crops, including 14 kharif, seven rabi and two calendar-year crops for which the government notifies the minimum support price based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. There is no legal prohibition to a farmer selling his/her produce in an open market in pursuit of a better price. What, however, was missing was a legal and marketing architecture to protect and incentivise the farmer.The minimum support price, since its introduction in the 1960s, has remained focused on the wheat belt of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. In the rice belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Assam distress sales were often reported. Today, the wheat belt farmers is agitating, based on the misperception that the minimum support price will be withdrawn. The fact is that the government has provided a better minimum support price over the last six years, and will continue the policy as witnessed by the recent procurement through the minimum support price. The new laws will provide better choices with adequate safeguards to the farmers.The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, provides farmers with a choices that have been denied to them so far. It does not replace the system of Agricultural Produce Market Committee-run mandis, government procurement, or minimum support prices. The 62nd report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture  Agriculture Marketing and Role of Weekly Gramin Haats  highlighted the mess the Agricultural Produce Market Committee-run markets are in.There has clearly been a political usurpation of a democratic institution. In some states, the market fee is levied even for trade transactions taking place outside the market yard, whereas in some states transactions outside the market yard are illegal.A farmer cannot go to a mandi other than that with which he/she is registered. In reply to my unstarred question (No.328 dated February 4), the minister for agriculture said that the government has decided to develop existing 22,000 gramin haats into full-fledged gramin agricultural markets.The fear that market yards will disappear is unfounded. If we continue to do things as before, we will continue to get the same results. We have been hearing of farmer suicides and distress.The prime minister is bringing in positive changes and trying to empower the under-privileged.

A change in wind direction is likely to improve AQI slightly on Tuesday, he said.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 258 microgram per cubic metre (g/m3) at 7 pm -- the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 g/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5  finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream  were 119 g/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 g/m3 are considered safe.Delhis air quality had turned poor on Wednesday, the first time in since June 29, with the Central Pollution Control Board recording a 24-hour average AQI of 215.SAFAR said the AQI is predicted to improve slightly  to the moderate category -- by Wednesday.As many as 614 farm fires were observed in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions on Sunday but the count is nearly one eight the peak values recorded in the last two years, it said.Farm fires contributed 3 percent particulate matter to Delhis PM2.5 concentration on Monday. It is likely to be negligible for the next two days due to a change in the wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, the government agency said.On Monday, Delhis minimum temperature settled at 19.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic.High levels of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent -- to Delhis air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign -- Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh -- which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A green war room with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government will also start the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, starting Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning. Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter","environmentupdated: oct 13, 2020, 17:45 istdelhi recorded its worst air quality since february on monday as the concentration of fine particulate matters pm2.5 and pm10 increased to their highest recorded levels this season.however, the ministry of earth sciences air quality monitor, safar, said the air quality index (aqi) was likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.the city recorded a 24-hour average aqi of 261. it was 216 on sunday and 221 on saturday.the aqi hit the very poor levels at delhi technological university (307), ito (315), patparganj (307), ashok vihar (302), jahangirpuri (320), vivek vihar (351), wazirpur (306), bawana (310) and anand vihar (312).the last time delhis air quality hit such poor levels was on february 26 (aqi 274).an aqi between 0 and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.a senior scientist at the delhi pollution control committee said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed accumulation of pollutants.stubble burning has also increased in neighbouring states. a change in wind direction is likely to improve aqi slightly on tuesday, he said.pm10 levels in delhi-ncr stood at 258 microgram per cubic metre (g/m3) at 7 pm -- the highest this season so far, according to cpcb data. pm10 levels below 100 g/m3 are considered safe in india.pm10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. these particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.the levels of pm2.5  finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream  were 119 g/m3. pm2.5 levels up to 60 g/m3 are considered safe.delhis air quality had turned poor on wednesday, the first time in since june 29, with the central pollution control board recording a 24-hour average aqi of 215.safar said the aqi is predicted to improve slightly  to the moderate category -- by wednesday.as many as 614 farm fires were observed in punjab, haryana and neighbouring border regions on sunday but the count is nearly one eight the peak values recorded in the last two years, it said.farm fires contributed 3 percent particulate matter to delhis pm2.5 concentration on monday. it is likely to be negligible for the next two days due to a change in the wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, the government agency said.on monday, delhis minimum temperature settled at 19.4 degrees celsius. the maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour.low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.with delhi-ncr bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the covid-19 pandemic.high levels of air pollution in delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.according to an analysis by the council on energy, environment and water, a delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent -- to delhis air pollution.road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).this year, the delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign -- yuddh pradushan ke viruddh -- which is being led by chief minister arvind kejriwal and environment minister gopal rai.a green war room with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the delhi secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.the environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.the government will also start the spraying of pusa bio-decomposer solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, starting tuesday.the solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning. starting october 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the graded response action plan, which was first implemented in delhi-ncr in 2017.(this story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)follow more stories on facebook and twitter"

The quantity procured so far is 33% higher than the corresponding period last year, according to data cited by the farm ministry.While the procurement of the kharif (monsoon crop) staple is continuing robustly, farmers in Punjab and Haryana continue to protest against a set of laws enacted by Parliament to deregulate agricultural markets, which they fear will weaken the MSP system, whereby farm produce is bought by the government at assured prices.The Centre would also procure pulses, oilseeds and copra at MSP beyond the quantity approved so far from any state where the market rate falls below MSP under its price support scheme, the agriculture ministry said in a statement on Monday.Despite this, several summer-sown crops, such as soybean and maize, are selling below minimum prices set by the government because the government procures too little of non-cereals.The government continues to procure kharif 2020-21 crops at its MSP from farmers as per its existing MSP schemes and procurement is going on smoothly, the farm ministry statement said, pointing to the higher procurement trend.Until October 11, the government through its food agencies has additionally procured 606.56 tonnes of two pulses  moong and urad  with an MSP value of 4.36 croreThe government has also approved requests from 10 states to procure 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds. These states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.The government has also sanctioned procurement of 100,000 tonnes of copra, a perennial crop, from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Crops such as soybean, ragi, maize and cotton, are selling up to 30% below MSPs, data from Agmarknet, the agriculture ministrys portal that tracks prices in mandis or wholesale markets, shows.Poor returns from crops have been a lingering problem for farmers, especially during episodes of gluts, such as now. MSPs, which are fixed at 50% over cost for nearly two dozen crops, dont necessarily lead to higher farm incomes as the governments procurement at MSP rates is largely restricted to wheat and rice. For most other crops, farmers are mostly price takers, meaning they are forced to accept whatever the markets dictate.Nudging the private sector towards triggering a market-clearing price that is closer or equal to MSP will depend on the extent of governments procurement, economist Abhijit Sen said.For commodities such as pulses and oilseeds, the governments procurement is insufficient to improve market rates. For instance, the nearly 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds they government has approved for procurement at MSP is less than 15% of the total production -- too small a quantity to make a difference in prices offered by private entities.","indiaupdated: oct 14, 2020, 05:31 istthe government has bought over 4 million tonnes of paddy from nearly 350,000 farmers, who have been paid minimum support price (msp) of 8,032 crore until october 11 since procurement of crops began on september 24. the quantity procured so far is 33% higher than the corresponding period last year, according to data cited by the farm ministry.while the procurement of the kharif (monsoon crop) staple is continuing robustly, farmers in punjab and haryana continue to protest against a set of laws enacted by parliament to deregulate agricultural markets, which they fear will weaken the msp system, whereby farm produce is bought by the government at assured prices.the centre would also procure pulses, oilseeds and copra at msp beyond the quantity approved so far from any state where the market rate falls below msp under its price support scheme, the agriculture ministry said in a statement on monday.despite this, several summer-sown crops, such as soybean and maize, are selling below minimum prices set by the government because the government procures too little of non-cereals.the government continues to procure kharif 2020-21 crops at its msp from farmers as per its existing msp schemes and procurement is going on smoothly, the farm ministry statement said, pointing to the higher procurement trend.until october 11, the government through its food agencies has additionally procured 606.56 tonnes of two pulses  moong and urad  with an msp value of 4.36 crorethe government has also approved requests from 10 states to procure 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds. these states are tamil nadu, karnataka, maharashtra, telangana, gujarat, haryana, uttar pradesh, odisha, rajasthan and andhra pradesh.the government has also sanctioned procurement of 100,000 tonnes of copra, a perennial crop, from andhra pradesh, karnataka, tamil nadu and kerala.crops such as soybean, ragi, maize and cotton, are selling up to 30% below msps, data from agmarknet, the agriculture ministrys portal that tracks prices in mandis or wholesale markets, shows.poor returns from crops have been a lingering problem for farmers, especially during episodes of gluts, such as now. msps, which are fixed at 50% over cost for nearly two dozen crops, dont necessarily lead to higher farm incomes as the governments procurement at msp rates is largely restricted to wheat and rice. for most other crops, farmers are mostly price takers, meaning they are forced to accept whatever the markets dictate.nudging the private sector towards triggering a market-clearing price that is closer or equal to msp will depend on the extent of governments procurement, economist abhijit sen said.for commodities such as pulses and oilseeds, the governments procurement is insufficient to improve market rates. for instance, the nearly 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds they government has approved for procurement at msp is less than 15% of the total production -- too small a quantity to make a difference in prices offered by private entities."
2020-10-14,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/farmers-stir-due-to-fear-of-revenue-loss-from-mandi-taxes-fee-study/articleshow/78649362.cms,Farmers stir due to fear of revenue loss: Study,"Only 19% households aware of MSPLopsided procurementInefficiencies of FCICereal productionCHANDIGARH: A research study conducted by the State Bank of India (SBI) research team has found that the ongoing farmers agitation is not due to the minimum support price (MSP) but vested political interests, as some states are concerned about the loss of revenue from mandi taxes and fees.It currently ranges from 8.5% (6% mandi tax and 2.5% fee for handling central procurement) in Punjab to less than 1% in some other states. Punjab earns an annual revenue of about Rs 3,500 crore from mandi taxes and fee.The study, conducted by a team under SBIs group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh , has also found that apart from Haryana, in no other state do farmers, whose annual income is more than the national average, sell their crops in electronic national agriculture market (e-NAM) mandis.In the case of Punjab, where annual income of agricultural households is almost Rs 2.8 lakh, only 1% farmers are associated with e-NAM.With the government linking mandis under electronic national agriculture market, state taxes should become redundant, says the study.According to the National Sample Surveys 70th round survey on key indicators of situation of agricultural households in India, on an average only 19% of households are aware of MSP and 15% are aware of procurement agency. Only 7% households sell crops to procurement agency and only 10% of total crops are sold at MSP. This indicates that almost 93% of households sell goods in open market and face market imperfections, says the study. None of the new agri-laws directly impinge upon the MSP regime, it adds.According to the study, key challenges such as lack of advanced processing technologies, market disconnects and absence of supply chain infrastructure have led to sub-optimal agri-exports from India. The freedom of choice that these new agri Acts give is a step in the right direction. But, this has to be supported with building infrastructure and educating the farmers about potential income they can generate by moving to other agri-produce, reads the study.India follows a legacy and lopsided system of procurement of primarily cereals that was implemented in the 1960s to benefit from the cereal granary states in north India, primarily Punjab and Haryana, and a large part of edifice of food grain procurement infrastructure is built around such states, says the study. While Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are at first and second number in rice production, food grain procurement is only 18% by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from such states, but in Punjab and Haryana (number 10) which are lower in rice production, the average procurement is still a staggering 90% by FCI. Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of wheat also, but again a laggard in wheat procurement.Therefore, the study says, such lopsided procurement has resulted in significantly skewed income of agricultural households with average income in Punjab at Rs 2.8 lakh being 3-3.5 times higher than states like UP and WB. It has also resulted in disproportionately higher number of farmers on e-NAM from states like UP and minimal from Punjab thus distorting market pricing. Also, uneven procurement across select states resulting in significant burden on exchequer with FCI total outstanding loans from the National Small Saving Fund (NSSF) estimated at Rs 3.22 lakh crore by March 2021.The research team has concluded, FCI is an organisation of grave inefficiencies. It is neither able to manage stock of food grains nor its finances. As of July 1, 2020, the grain stock in the central pool was 822 lakh tonne against the buffer norm of 411 lakh tonne, almost double than the required. This is an example of economic inefficiency.It has also come to the fore that the godown capacity utilisation in some states is unsatisfactory. This is unfortunate that states like UP and WB, which are top producers of rice and wheat, are using only 61% of the godown capacity. This may be due to the fact that these states are unable to procure wheat and rice in appropriate quantities. The trend of mandi prices of wheat and rice indicate that in these states prices are so much less than the annual average and even less than the MSP, reads the study.The study also says that the value of cereals per hectare is 12 times less than fruits and vegetables, but we keep eulogising cereal production. Fruits and vegetables have the highest value of output per hectare followed by condiments and spices. So the country should quickly move up the agri value chain to ensure farm income gets broad-based.","only 19% households aware of msplopsided procurementinefficiencies of fcicereal productionchandigarh: a research study conducted by the state bank of india (sbi) research team has found that the ongoing farmers agitation is not due to the minimum support price (msp) but vested political interests, as some states are concerned about the loss of revenue from mandi taxes and fees.it currently ranges from 8.5% (6% mandi tax and 2.5% fee for handling central procurement) in punjab to less than 1% in some other states. punjab earns an annual revenue of about rs 3,500 crore from mandi taxes and fee.the study, conducted by a team under sbis group chief economic adviser soumya kanti ghosh , has also found that apart from haryana, in no other state do farmers, whose annual income is more than the national average, sell their crops in electronic national agriculture market (e-nam) mandis.in the case of punjab, where annual income of agricultural households is almost rs 2.8 lakh, only 1% farmers are associated with e-nam.with the government linking mandis under electronic national agriculture market, state taxes should become redundant, says the study.according to the national sample surveys 70th round survey on key indicators of situation of agricultural households in india, on an average only 19% of households are aware of msp and 15% are aware of procurement agency. only 7% households sell crops to procurement agency and only 10% of total crops are sold at msp. this indicates that almost 93% of households sell goods in open market and face market imperfections, says the study. none of the new agri-laws directly impinge upon the msp regime, it adds.according to the study, key challenges such as lack of advanced processing technologies, market disconnects and absence of supply chain infrastructure have led to sub-optimal agri-exports from india. the freedom of choice that these new agri acts give is a step in the right direction. but, this has to be supported with building infrastructure and educating the farmers about potential income they can generate by moving to other agri-produce, reads the study.india follows a legacy and lopsided system of procurement of primarily cereals that was implemented in the 1960s to benefit from the cereal granary states in north india, primarily punjab and haryana, and a large part of edifice of food grain procurement infrastructure is built around such states, says the study. while uttar pradesh and west bengal are at first and second number in rice production, food grain procurement is only 18% by the food corporation of india (fci) from such states, but in punjab and haryana (number 10) which are lower in rice production, the average procurement is still a staggering 90% by fci. uttar pradesh is the largest producer of wheat also, but again a laggard in wheat procurement.therefore, the study says, such lopsided procurement has resulted in significantly skewed income of agricultural households with average income in punjab at rs 2.8 lakh being 3-3.5 times higher than states like up and wb. it has also resulted in disproportionately higher number of farmers on e-nam from states like up and minimal from punjab thus distorting market pricing. also, uneven procurement across select states resulting in significant burden on exchequer with fci total outstanding loans from the national small saving fund (nssf) estimated at rs 3.22 lakh crore by march 2021.the research team has concluded, fci is an organisation of grave inefficiencies. it is neither able to manage stock of food grains nor its finances. as of july 1, 2020, the grain stock in the central pool was 822 lakh tonne against the buffer norm of 411 lakh tonne, almost double than the required. this is an example of economic inefficiency.it has also come to the fore that the godown capacity utilisation in some states is unsatisfactory. this is unfortunate that states like up and wb, which are top producers of rice and wheat, are using only 61% of the godown capacity. this may be due to the fact that these states are unable to procure wheat and rice in appropriate quantities. the trend of mandi prices of wheat and rice indicate that in these states prices are so much less than the annual average and even less than the msp, reads the study.the study also says that the value of cereals per hectare is 12 times less than fruits and vegetables, but we keep eulogising cereal production. fruits and vegetables have the highest value of output per hectare followed by condiments and spices. so the country should quickly move up the agri value chain to ensure farm income gets broad-based."

2020-10-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-govt-recommended-paddy-varieties-sold-below-msp-farmers-6735516/,"In Punjab, govt-recommended paddy varieties being sold for prices below MSP, say farmers","As per government recommendation, there is no cut in the MSP if the moisture level is up to 17 per cent in the harvested crop. (Representational)As Sukhdev Singh (name changed) from Pathankot went to sell his paddy PR 126 variety  developed and recommended for cultivation by the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), his arhtiya (commission agent) and the quality inspector of a government procurement agency told him that his produce will be procured at Rs 1,768 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 1,888 per quintal. The cut of Rs 120 per quintal on MSP, the farmer was told, was due to the variety being a hybrid variety, which is generally banned in Punjab. He was told that government agencies will purchase only government recommended varieties at full MSP.As the farmer tried to convince them that PR 126 was recommended by the government and not hybrid, his pleas were ignored. Exasperated, he finally approached officials from the District Agriculture Department to intervene. It was only after department officials visited the mandi that the farmer was paid MSP for his crop.Cases similar to this have also come to light from Gurdaspur and Batala mandis where several farmers say they have been forced to sell their recommended varieties at a price lower than the MSP due to arhtiyas and government agencies dubbing them as hybrid.At Jalandhar grain markets, several farmers have been alleging that despite their paddy being Grade A quality, they are being forced to sell their crops at Rs 1,700 to 1,800 per quintal on the pretext of high moisture content due to connivance of government agencies, rice sheller owners and arhtiyas.Most of them said that they are facing a minimum cut of Rs 100 to 150 per quintal.As per government recommendation, there is no cut in the MSP if the moisture level is up to 17 per cent in the harvested crop.In fact, this time because of no rain in September, the moisture content in the crop is even below the recommended limit, said the officials in the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) department.But as per data sourced from Punjab Mandi Board (PMB), the selling rate of paddy in mandis is below Rs 1,888 per quintal.Though we fill J form, which keeps the record of crop sold by farmers to the government agency, but the majority of this J forms remain in the custody of ahrtiyas, and farmers are not aware that their crop is sold at what price to the government in actual as we get only a kucha slip without any sign on it from arhtiyas who make our payment after getting money from the government, said farmer Harjowan Singh, who sold his 200 quintals paddy at the rate of Rs 1,780 per quintal as told by arhtiya to him.Block Agriculture Officer, Pathankot, Dr Amrik Singh, told The Indian Express: I was surprised when the farmer approached me and said that PR 126 is being considered as hybrid variety by the arhtiya, rice shellers and procurement agency, who are well aware of it being sown on a large area for the past 4 years in Punjab. We went to mandi to argue the farmers case to get full MSP.He added: Our department has been issuing statements and making farmers aware on WhatsApp groups that if they are getting below MSP for their PR 121, PR, 126, 122, 124, 128, 129 and HKR 47, in the name of hybrid variety then they should immediately inform us, he said, adding that such cases are there across mandis.But majority farmers are blindly dependent on the arhtiyas and facing the losses on the name of paddy varieties, moisture level etc., he said, adding that farmers need to be little aware about such wrong practices.When Punjab is supposed to procure over 16 million tonnes (160 lakh tonnes) paddy, one can imagine the scale of loss to farmers if they even face Rs 50 to Rs 100 cut for their Grade A crop, said another senior Agriculture Department officer, adding that when a farmer is irrigating his crop for months he should be firm on not selling his crop below MSP if his crop falls under governments specifications.To avoid such non-transparent system of payment, the Centre government wanted to transfer the money directly in the accounts of farmers, but arhtiya lobby did not let it happen in Punjab.We do not have much staff and have to depend on millers, commission agents, and procurement agencies, and the majority of them are indulging in harassment of farmers, who sell their crop at Rs 50 to 100 per quintal below MSP to avoid any harassment, said one of the senior officers in the Food and Civil Supply department, requesting anonymity.

Within days, rural groups and opposition leaders launched public protests.The move toward a free market for farm sales goes to the heart of a system that directly affects more than half of the nations 137 crore people, altering government controls that millions of families have come to rely on, but that have hobbled the nations efforts to productively farm one of the largest areas of fertile land on earth. If they succeed, India could not only feed itself, but become a major food exporter.We need private sector investment in technology and infrastructure for Indian agriculture to realize its full potential and compete better in the global marketplace, said Siraj Chaudhry, managing director and chief executive officer of agriculture services company National Collateral Management Services Ltd. But the government must make its intent very clear to win over skeptics. This is a major policy change that impacts a large and vulnerable section of the population.India processes less than 10% of its food production and loses about Rs 90,000 crore ($12.3 billion) a year due to wastage from inadequate cold storage, said Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer at government think tank NITI Aayog.Modi has a long resume of contentious policy steps, including a ban on high-value cash notes, the biggest tax reform since Independence in 1947 and the worlds toughest coronavirus lockdown rules. The latest seems mild by comparison: a set of amendments to laws that govern the purchase, sale and storage of farm produce.Yet eight opposition lawmakers were suspended for unruly behavior when the new bill was passed and groups representing farmers and political parties organized demonstrations, sit-ins and tractor rallies in grain-producing states such as Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.Shiromani Akali Dal, a long-term supporter of the BJP, which rarely went against the decisions of Modis coalition, quit the government. It said farmers fear the measures will eventually kill the governments price support regime for crops and leave them at the mercy of big corporations that would control the market.Modi and his ministers say the concerns are baseless and the price guarantee program will continue. His administration even raised some minimum prices for winter crops to try to reassure farmers that the price supports arent in jeopardy.Its a highly emotive subject in India. The government sets price floors for more than two dozen crops and buys mainly wheat and rice for its welfare programs together with some pulses and oilseeds to prevent distress sales by farmers. The massive subsidies help distribute staples to the poor through a chain of more than 500,000 fair-price shops.The issue has become even more heated because of the pandemic. The disruption to farms and supply chains has exposed weaknesses in the government welfare system, which is hampered by bureaucracy, underfunding and archaic distribution facilities.Farmers point out that, while the governments guaranteed prices are often considered benchmarks, private buyers dont have to pay them.We are disappointed, said Charanjeet Singh, who grows rice, wheat and vegetables on his farm in the northern state of Haryana. The government should guarantee that all farmers, irrespective of whether they are selling in the designated grain markets or to private buyers, will get at least the minimum support price.Analysts and industry experts say the new policy has the potential to change the face of Indian agriculture, which has been hampered by low yields and inefficient smallholdings, by encouraging more contract farming. Thats a system where private companies agree prices for crops with farmers prior to the harvest or even before sowing, and offer loans, provide quality seeds and encourage mechanization.The new rules would also make it easier to sell crops in other states or abroad. Farmers would get a more stable income and the increased production would boost exports and revenue, they say.Overall, the reforms should benefit farmers and encourage contract farming, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. said in a report. As private sector participation increases over the years, the Indian agriculture sectors supply chain and infrastructure would improve.Farming has lagged behind other sectors of Indias economy. The rural poverty rate is about 25% compared to 14% in urban areas, according to World Bank data. Underinvestment has made the food supply vulnerable, a fact that is being underlined as the coronavirus spreads across the country.Food inflation accelerated 9.7% in September as Covid hit the nations already fragile supply chains. While supporters of the farm reforms say the changes would make the system more robust in future, others argue that the crisis reinforces the need for a safety net for farmers.It will be the end of the road for the food security program, said Kannaiyan Subramaniam, general secretary of a farmers union in southern India, who grows gooseberries, potatoes and other vegetables. In the long run, corporations will monopolize trade, production and stockpiles. The government will succumb to pressure from the WTO and get rid of the public grain procurement.Before the new amendments, farmers in most states were restricted from selling their crops outside government-facilitated wholesale markets and faced legal hurdles in transporting harvests to other states.Central to the reforms is an amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, a 1955 law that some say is the root of Indias agricultural inefficiency.It was an anti-farmer policy, said Atul Chaturvedi, president of the Solvent Extractors Association of India, which represents vegetable-oil processors. This one act stymied the growth of Indian agriculture big time.When prices rose due to demand, the laws price-control measures kicked in, discouraging investment to increase production, said Chaturvedi, who is also executive chairman of Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. The government would also sometimes ban exports of some farm goods to control local prices, as well as limiting the ability to store crops. Farmers suffered huge losses when production, especially of perishable commodities, surged.Some critics of the amendments to the law say the new situation could be worse for farmers. Corporates and multinational companies buy agricultural products at a cheaper rate and sell at higher prices, squeezing both ends by hoarding and black marketeering, said the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a farmers pressure group. There is no penalty for failure to honor contracts.If the government can push through the reforms while retaining the support of farming communities, it could create a platform for wide-scale improvements in the nations food output, The country is already the worlds largest producer of milk and the second-biggest grower of wheat, rice and some fruits and vegetables. Its also one of the biggest exporters of cotton, rice and sugar.If India can raise productivity to global norms, the country could become an important link in global food supply chains, NITI Aayogs Kant wrote in a newspaper article.

As the issues boils over, there are always people who offer workable, green solutions. HT brings you some of these change-agents, who have built-up profitable businesses, where everybody saw trouble.Green concern at heart of big planA visit to Amloh, an industrial town in Fatehgarh Sahib, will showcase a simple, unique solution. Industrialist Han Raj Garg, 38, an MBA, thought of using paddy straw as fuel in his factory in 2014, and the idea has clicked. Farmers earned more (some even earned in lakhs by making bales of straw for Garg) and Amloh has the lowest number of farm fire incidents in Punjab today.My concern for environment and farmers led me to monetise straw, said Garg, whose units manufacture edible oils under the name, Shree Ganesh Edibles Pvt Limited.Garg added there was no-cost effective in-situ (without transport) stubble management formula as yet. Farmers will shun the illegal practice of burning, if they get money for handling straw.Han Raj Garg, 38, an MBA, thought of using paddy straw as fuel in his factory in 2014. ( HT Photo )In 2014, I started with 25,000-tonne of paddy straw. For the past three years, I am purchasing 72,000 tonne of stubble and paid Rs 11 crore to farmers.In 2019, the Supreme Court ordered Rs 100 per quintal as compensation for farmers for handling straw. I have been doing it since 2014, he says, adding that nearly 1,000 farmers directly or indirectly (mostly marginal) collect straw from other farmers fields. I know a farmer who collected paddy straw from 3,000 acre in 2019 and made a profit of Rs 30 lakh, Garg added.For six years, I am not selling straw from my own fields, but collecting from neighouring fields. Who will burn paddy straw when you will Rs 100 per quintal for it?, said Harinder Singh, a farmer.Garg added that the major issue in using paddy straw as fuel was its silica content, which led to a snag in industrial boilers. With research, plus experience, we have been running our factory on rice straw for seven years. For the past two years, we have been supplying 0.5 MW power to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited, he said.Our process is environment-friendly in two ways. We dont use fossil fuels in factory and are also resolving the unregulated burning of agricultural waste, that causes air pollution, he said.If the government supports me, I can invest more and will purchase stubble from the 1.08 lakh acre under paddy in Fatehgarh Sahib district. Government officials, however, are not receptive and not allowing me to run a 15MW co-gen plant for factory on rice straw, even as a proposal has been submitted, he says. VISHAL RAMBANIProgressive farmer Sukbir Singh Dhaliwal, 46, is scripting a success story with his venture that converts crop waste into products that can be used as fuel in industries. Dhaliwal and some of his friends began the start-up, Farm2Energy, in 2016 to convert paddy stubble into bio-coal. Bio-coal is a carbon-neutral fuel that can replace ordinary coal in industrial processes.Last year, he and fellow entrepreneurs Kamaljeet Singh, Sandeep Singh Shergill and Preet Singh Chandoke lifted stubble residue from 20,000 acre.Sukbir Singh Dhaliwal, 46, is scripting a success story. ( HT Photo )Over the past four years, they have also set up a pellet-making factory in Khanna. Not only paddy residue, our unit processes paddy straw, corn stover, sugarcane trash and wheat straw and supplies it to biofuel, bio-power and bio-based industries. We also help farmers in managing biomass, said Dhaliwal. The industry has huge potential, as the world is progressing towards cleaner energy solutions, he claimed.The automobile industry is concentrating on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), and stubble can be used to make it. Due to the lack of any government initiative, such ventures are not coming up. We are sitting on a gold-mine of opportunities. We are burning it away and polluting the environment. Farmers cannot be blamed as they have limited resources, added Dhaliwal.This year, the chances of him getting the raw material are bleak. Many farmers who had converted to crop residue management have yet again cleared their fields by burning. The majority of the farmers are either protesting on railway tracks or selling the crop in mandis, triggering labour shortage. We are facing problems in collecting residue as farmers are angry, added Dhaliwal. MOHIT KHANNALucrative, eco-friendly way to earn moneyWhen Hardeep Singh, 48, a farmer of Sathiala village in Baba Bakala subdivision, decided to sell his stubble to a sugar mill as opposed to setting it alight, little did he know that it would soon become a lucrative business opportunity, harvesting a handsome dividend of 5 lakh per season.The entrepreneur, who owns 10 acre of agricultural land, says, In 2016, I used a baler machine to manage my stubble for the first time and sold the residue to a sugar mill. Before that I used to burn crop residue, the same as other farmers. The mill paid me a decent sum and I saw a business opportunity. I started managing stubble for other farmers in my village and selling it to cardboard-making firms and sugar mills in the state.Hardeep Singh charges 1,000 per acre from the farmers for management and transportation of crop residue. ( HT Photo )Hardeep says, Private firms pay us 130 per quintal of stubble and we are able to extract around 24 quintal from one acre. We manage the stubble in the form of squares, weighing 20kg a piece.Earlier, I had one baler machine attached to a single tractor, now I have two. With two balers and four tractors, I have been managing stubble over 1,000 acre, Hardeep says. A baler is used to compress stubble into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store.Hardeep charges 1,000 per acre from the farmers for management and transportation of crop residue. He employs 45 labourers for management and transportation of stubble and has six tractor-trailers for transportation. Sometimes, we help poor farmers free of charge, says Hardeep, adding that the business is both lucrative and environment-friendly. Daljit Singh, a farmer of Gurdaspur district, says farmers spend around 2,500 per acre on stubbleHardeep has applied for subsidy for purchasing more balers, but he has, so far, not been granted the same by the agriculture department.  ANIL SHARMABusiness expansion can curb stubble burningFor farmer Gurshiwender Singh, 38, management of paddy waste turned out to be a golden opportunity for enhancing his income. Last year, he earned 31 lakh in around 50 days by selling stubble to a biomass generation plant.Gurshiwender, of Mehma Sawai village, around 35km from district headquarters, says he sells organic waste to a private biomass generation plant at Sedha Singh Wala village and made a profit of 7 lakh in 2019.After Sukhbir Agro Energy Limited set up a biomass energy generation plant in Bathinda in 2017, I invested in one baler, which cost 15 lakh and availed a 40% subsidy. Now, I have two bailers and six tractors and collect paddy straw from Mehma Sawai and three other adjoining villages. The biomass plant management pays 130 per quintal. Last year, I had supplied 24,000 quintal of dried crop waste, says Gurshiwender. He supervises stubble management over 8 acre.The technology is inexpensive and farmers have to pay a nominal price for safe disposal of crop residue. The government should promote multiple biomass plants in each district to eradicate stubble burning, he says.Gurshiwenders family owns six acre and he cultivates rice over another 10 acre of leased land, employing 100 people.He adds, Unfortunately, a section of paddy growers continue to burn stubble. I charge 500 per acre, the same amount that a farmer pays to a straw-reaper operator and for setting crop residue on fire. The agrarian community is aware that burning stubble damages the microorganisms present in the upper layers of the soil. Vishal JoshiFarmer-turned-entrepreneur for five yearsFor Nakodar farmer, Kewal Singh, the leap from a farmer to an entrepreneur was driven by a concern for environment and to do something for the worsening pollution.Kewal set up a 6MW capacity bio-mass-based power plant Green Planet Energy Pvt Ltd production unit at Bir village in 2015. The model was simple, he purchased stubble from fellow farmers, used it to generate electricity and sell it to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). He soon got 15 baler machines that visit farmers fields to get the straw in order.All my machines have been at work for 24 hours of day for the past month. The plant has the capacity of 75,000 tonne of paddy straw, said Kewal, adding he earns handsome profit each season.On an average, a machine generates 3 tonne paddy straw and I pay Rs 1,350 per tonne to a farmer, Kewal added.Kewal Singh set up a 6MW bio-mass power plant in 2015. ( HT Photo )Joga Singh from Tut Kalan village in Jalandhar said he had been selling 4-5 tonne of paddy straw to the electricity generation plant and getting Rs 135 per quintal for straw bales.Another farmer, Sukhdev Singh from Talhan village, said he along with five other farmers, purchased baler machines last year after the state government provided them subsidy.We have been selling the stubble to the unit and earning enough profit, while this process has also led to increased fertility in the soil, said Sukhdev. District agriculture officer Naresh Gulati said a machine with a baler lines up the scattered straw/stubble for bales to be easily made.

( ht photo )in 2014, i started with 25,000-tonne of paddy straw. for the past three years, i am purchasing 72,000 tonne of stubble and paid rs 11 crore to farmers.in 2019, the supreme court ordered rs 100 per quintal as compensation for farmers for handling straw. i have been doing it since 2014, he says, adding that nearly 1,000 farmers directly or indirectly (mostly marginal) collect straw from other farmers fields. i know a farmer who collected paddy straw from 3,000 acre in 2019 and made a profit of rs 30 lakh, garg added.for six years, i am not selling straw from my own fields, but collecting from neighouring fields. who will burn paddy straw when you will rs 100 per quintal for it?, said harinder singh, a farmer.garg added that the major issue in using paddy straw as fuel was its silica content, which led to a snag in industrial boilers. with research, plus experience, we have been running our factory on rice straw for seven years. for the past two years, we have been supplying 0.5 mw power to the punjab state power corporation limited, he said.our process is environment-friendly in two ways. we dont use fossil fuels in factory and are also resolving the unregulated burning of agricultural waste, that causes air pollution, he said.if the government supports me, i can invest more and will purchase stubble from the 1.08 lakh acre under paddy in fatehgarh sahib district. government officials, however, are not receptive and not allowing me to run a 15mw co-gen plant for factory on rice straw, even as a proposal has been submitted, he says. vishal rambaniprogressive farmer sukbir singh dhaliwal, 46, is scripting a success story with his venture that converts crop waste into products that can be used as fuel in industries. dhaliwal and some of his friends began the start-up, farm2energy, in 2016 to convert paddy stubble into bio-coal. bio-coal is a carbon-neutral fuel that can replace ordinary coal in industrial processes.last year, he and fellow entrepreneurs kamaljeet singh, sandeep singh shergill and preet singh chandoke lifted stubble residue from 20,000 acre.sukbir singh dhaliwal, 46, is scripting a success story. ( ht photo )over the past four years, they have also set up a pellet-making factory in khanna. not only paddy residue, our unit processes paddy straw, corn stover, sugarcane trash and wheat straw and supplies it to biofuel, bio-power and bio-based industries. we also help farmers in managing biomass, said dhaliwal. the industry has huge potential, as the world is progressing towards cleaner energy solutions, he claimed.the automobile industry is concentrating on compressed natural gas (cng), and stubble can be used to make it. due to the lack of any government initiative, such ventures are not coming up. we are sitting on a gold-mine of opportunities. we are burning it away and polluting the environment. farmers cannot be blamed as they have limited resources, added dhaliwal.this year, the chances of him getting the raw material are bleak. many farmers who had converted to crop residue management have yet again cleared their fields by burning. the majority of the farmers are either protesting on railway tracks or selling the crop in mandis, triggering labour shortage. we are facing problems in collecting residue as farmers are angry, added dhaliwal. mohit khannalucrative, eco-friendly way to earn moneywhen hardeep singh, 48, a farmer of sathiala village in baba bakala subdivision, decided to sell his stubble to a sugar mill as opposed to setting it alight, little did he know that it would soon become a lucrative business opportunity, harvesting a handsome dividend of 5 lakh per season.the entrepreneur, who owns 10 acre of agricultural land, says, in 2016, i used a baler machine to manage my stubble for the first time and sold the residue to a sugar mill. before that i used to burn crop residue, the same as other farmers. the mill paid me a decent sum and i saw a business opportunity. i started managing stubble for other farmers in my village and selling it to cardboard-making firms and sugar mills in the state.hardeep singh charges 1,000 per acre from the farmers for management and transportation of crop residue. ( ht photo )hardeep says, private firms pay us 130 per quintal of stubble and we are able to extract around 24 quintal from one acre. we manage the stubble in the form of squares, weighing 20kg a piece.earlier, i had one baler machine attached to a single tractor, now i have two. with two balers and four tractors, i have been managing stubble over 1,000 acre, hardeep says. a baler is used to compress stubble into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store.hardeep charges 1,000 per acre from the farmers for management and transportation of crop residue. he employs 45 labourers for management and transportation of stubble and has six tractor-trailers for transportation. sometimes, we help poor farmers free of charge, says hardeep, adding that the business is both lucrative and environment-friendly. daljit singh, a farmer of gurdaspur district, says farmers spend around 2,500 per acre on stubblehardeep has applied for subsidy for purchasing more balers, but he has, so far, not been granted the same by the agriculture department.  anil sharmabusiness expansion can curb stubble burningfor farmer gurshiwender singh, 38, management of paddy waste turned out to be a golden opportunity for enhancing his income. last year, he earned 31 lakh in around 50 days by selling stubble to a biomass generation plant.gurshiwender, of mehma sawai village, around 35km from district headquarters, says he sells organic waste to a private biomass generation plant at sedha singh wala village and made a profit of 7 lakh in 2019.after sukhbir agro energy limited set up a biomass energy generation plant in bathinda in 2017, i invested in one baler, which cost 15 lakh and availed a 40% subsidy. now, i have two bailers and six tractors and collect paddy straw from mehma sawai and three other adjoining villages. the biomass plant management pays 130 per quintal. last year, i had supplied 24,000 quintal of dried crop waste, says gurshiwender. he supervises stubble management over 8 acre.the technology is inexpensive and farmers have to pay a nominal price for safe disposal of crop residue. the government should promote multiple biomass plants in each district to eradicate stubble burning, he says.gurshiwenders family owns six acre and he cultivates rice over another 10 acre of leased land, employing 100 people.he adds, unfortunately, a section of paddy growers continue to burn stubble. i charge 500 per acre, the same amount that a farmer pays to a straw-reaper operator and for setting crop residue on fire. the agrarian community is aware that burning stubble damages the microorganisms present in the upper layers of the soil. vishal joshifarmer-turned-entrepreneur for five yearsfor nakodar farmer, kewal singh, the leap from a farmer to an entrepreneur was driven by a concern for environment and to do something for the worsening pollution.kewal set up a 6mw capacity bio-mass-based power plant green planet energy pvt ltd production unit at bir village in 2015. the model was simple, he purchased stubble from fellow farmers, used it to generate electricity and sell it to punjab state power corporation limited (pspcl). he soon got 15 baler machines that visit farmers fields to get the straw in order.all my machines have been at work for 24 hours of day for the past month. the plant has the capacity of 75,000 tonne of paddy straw, said kewal, adding he earns handsome profit each season.on an average, a machine generates 3 tonne paddy straw and i pay rs 1,350 per tonne to a farmer, kewal added.kewal singh set up a 6mw bio-mass power plant in 2015. ( ht photo )joga singh from tut kalan village in jalandhar said he had been selling 4-5 tonne of paddy straw to the electricity generation plant and getting rs 135 per quintal for straw bales.another farmer, sukhdev singh from talhan village, said he along with five other farmers, purchased baler machines last year after the state government provided them subsidy.we have been selling the stubble to the unit and earning enough profit, while this process has also led to increased fertility in the soil, said sukhdev. district agriculture officer naresh gulati said a machine with a baler lines up the scattered straw/stubble for bales to be easily made.  jatinder mahal"

A few days back, a number of agitating farmers at Shambu border had confiscated two trucks loaded with paddy and informed the district authorities about the same besides circulating the video of the incident on some social media groups.Farmers say that as paddy is not being purchased on MSP in some other states, the private buyers including rice millers in Punjab are buying the produce at better prices than private buyers of these states. They said this has led to the arrival of paddy at rice mills in Punjab at a large level which may affect the paddy procurement of farmers in Punjab.On Friday night, the farmers and rice millers were involved in a clash in a village of Samana block in Patiala district following which rice millers had opened fire to disperse the protesting farmers. The police said farmers levelled allegations against a rice miller in Dhakrabba village of Patiala of procuring paddy from outside states including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The farmers staged a protest near the mill following which rice millers fired a gunshot, but nobody was injured.Samana DSP Jaswant Singh Mangat said, We have booked the rice mill owner for an attempt to murder under sections of the IPC and Arms Act. No arrest has been made so far. The farmers suspected that the rice miller was procuring paddy from other states. Police have involved the food supply officials to probe the matter.Notably, a similar case against a rice miller was registered at Patran police station on Friday after the farmers confiscated a paddy-loaded truck on October 13. The farmers alleged that the paddy from other states was procured illegally by the rice millers on cheaper prices. The police said market committee officials found the bills of paddy with the truck owner and rice miller as fake following which the rice miller was booked for cheating and forgery.BKU Ekta Dakaunda general secretary Jagmohan Singh said, The illegal paddy procurement by rice millers from other states would affect the farmers in Punjab as the procurement will slow down when rice millers will run out of space to unload paddy for thrashing process. Like farmers of UP and Bihar who are forced to sell out their paddy in far off states like Punjab at much cheaper prices in the absence of paddy purchase on MSP, the farmers in Punjab will also be ruined if the new farm laws are implemented.7 trucks intercepted at Shambhu borderOn Friday, a joint team of Mandi Board officials, food supply officials and the police launched an operation to curb bogus milling and unauthorized sale of paddy crop in Punjab from other states. The police said seven truckloads of paddy being brought to Punjab from UP were intercepted at Shambhu border on Friday.

In the PIL, directions were sought for implementation of the agriculture produce pricing policy of the Centre.On May 26, 2015, the state governments of Punjab and Haryana agreed to give MSP on purchase of sunflower and maize and the same was recorded in the order. Subsequently, the Punjab government led by SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal declined to procure sunflower seeds and for this the state was reprimanded by the high court in its order dated July 14, 2015.Haryana started purchasing these crops on MSP, but Punjab remained undecided.The central government even gave an undertaking that whatever payments are to be made by the Punjab to the farmers for MSP, the same amount would be reimbursed to the state within 10 days as per policy, and this has also been followed in Haryana.In the meantime, the government in Punjab changed and the Congress-led by Captain Amarinder Singh came into power in March 2017. However, indecisiveness over payment of MSP for maize and sunflower continued.Hearing the matter on July 31, 2017, HC even summoned senior functionaries of the Centre and the state. While Haryana submitted figures regarding procurement of sunflower on MSP, Punjab gave an undertaking that it would also procure sunflower under PSS scheme. Yet Punjab failed again and HC recorded its displeasure on August 17, 2017.In 2018 again, the Union government submitted its proposal for procurement of sunflower and maize on MSP, nothing was done by the Punjab government. During the hearing of the case, several affidavits were filed by Punjab farmers, claiming that they had suffered losses because of non-payment of MSP by Punjab on maize and sunflower.A contempt petition was also filed by the petitioners on April 26, 2019 against Punjab for non-procurement of maize and sunflower for which it had given an undertaking to the court. The same is pending before the HC at present.Chetan Mittal, senior advocate and assistant solicitor general of India, who has been representing the Centre in the case, said in the latest affidavit on August 19, 2020, that no proposal from Punjab to procure maize had been received. All these facts and records received from the Centre shows that no effort has been done by the state of Punjab and its agencies, including Markfed, Punjab Agro, which have remained non-responsive regarding MSP on these two crops, said Mittal.","contempt plea filed by petitioners against punjabchandigarh: both the congress and shiromani akali dal (sad) in punjab have been protesting against the centres new agriculture laws, especially for legal guarantee of minimum support price (msp), but their governments in the state have failed to provide msp to farmers on sunflower and maize since 2015 despite several assurances to the punjab and haryana high court.the matter is pending before the high court since 2014-15 in the wake of a public interest litigation (pil) filed by a group of punjab and haryana farmers, directing the states and their nodal agencies to purchase agriculture produce other than rice and wheat on msp. in the pil, directions were sought for implementation of the agriculture produce pricing policy of the centre.on may 26, 2015, the state governments of punjab and haryana agreed to give msp on purchase of sunflower and maize and the same was recorded in the order. subsequently, the punjab government led by sad patriarch parkash singh badal declined to procure sunflower seeds and for this the state was reprimanded by the high court in its order dated july 14, 2015.haryana started purchasing these crops on msp, but punjab remained undecided.the central government even gave an undertaking that whatever payments are to be made by the punjab to the farmers for msp, the same amount would be reimbursed to the state within 10 days as per policy, and this has also been followed in haryana.in the meantime, the government in punjab changed and the congress-led by captain amarinder singh came into power in march 2017. however, indecisiveness over payment of msp for maize and sunflower continued.hearing the matter on july 31, 2017, hc even summoned senior functionaries of the centre and the state. while haryana submitted figures regarding procurement of sunflower on msp, punjab gave an undertaking that it would also procure sunflower under pss scheme. yet punjab failed again and hc recorded its displeasure on august 17, 2017.in 2018 again, the union government submitted its proposal for procurement of sunflower and maize on msp, nothing was done by the punjab government. during the hearing of the case, several affidavits were filed by punjab farmers, claiming that they had suffered losses because of non-payment of msp by punjab on maize and sunflower.a contempt petition was also filed by the petitioners on april 26, 2019 against punjab for non-procurement of maize and sunflower for which it had given an undertaking to the court. the same is pending before the hc at present.chetan mittal, senior advocate and assistant solicitor general of india, who has been representing the centre in the case, said in the latest affidavit on august 19, 2020, that no proposal from punjab to procure maize had been received. all these facts and records received from the centre shows that no effort has been done by the state of punjab and its agencies, including markfed, punjab agro, which have remained non-responsive regarding msp on these two crops, said mittal."

(File photo)Ahead of crucial legislation to be brought by the Congress government in Punjab Vidhan Sabha negating the Centres farm laws, former Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who attended the first day of the session after skipping many sessions, came up with a parallel model to tide over the crisis likely to arise after implementation of farm laws.Hours after his appearance in the special session of Vidhan Sabha, Sidhu, in his 31-minute speech on his YouTube channel, Jittega Punjab, asked his partys government to take responsibility, stop looking at Centre for MSP and have its own resources. He even went on to say that if the state thinks it does not have resources then it should crack down on mafias, including the sand, transport, liquor and cable. The state would be flush with funds, he said.The Congress government in Punjab has been demanding that the Centre should pay the MSP as the states farmers grow foodgrains for the Centres granaries. The government is preparing to pass legislation to negate the Centres farm laws.Sidhu, who skipped all sessions ever since he attended the Budget session in February 2019, made his appearance in the Assembly as the special session concerns the farmers issues. In the past Sidhu had faced criticism from Opposition parties for staying away from Assembly and not taking up peoples issues.He said the Centres MSP was not the only solution to Punjab farmers problems. Taking a different line than the state government, he said, If MSP was the solution, then why thousands of farmers committeed suicide in the past?Advocating diversification and MSP for all the crops consumed in the state, he said, Punjab has no procurement model to lift crops other than wheat and paddy. Nether has Punjab got the storage space. Today, the Central foodgrain warehouses are empty, they will buy our rice this year, our wheat next year. What after that? Our timeline for preparation is just one-three years.A state that does not eat rice, utilises 14 billion cubic metres of groundwater more than the rechargeable limit. As such, 80 per cent of Punjabs groundwater is being over-exploited. One cubic metre has 1,000 litres of water. In five-10 years the entire land will go barren. Today 86 per cent of Punjabs farmers are under debt. Punjabs struggle is not just to save the mandis and MSP. If it was then why did thousands of Punjab farmers commit suicide? he added.He demanded that the state should give MSP on oil seeds, vegetables, pulses and fruits. If the government does not have resources to help farmers then they should crack down on liquor, sand, transport and cable mafia, he reiterated.Giving credit to farmers and Sonia Gandhi for the special session of Vidhan Sabha, he called it like a shining star amid the dark clouds of black farm laws. It will be a slap on the Centres black laws whose echo would be heard across the country. This is the victory of farmers pious struggle, this is the victory of farmer-oriented vision of Congress president. I want to congratulate the state on the first step. But this is just the first step. If we do not take more steps, then it would not mean anything.Hitting at the SAD alike, he said, Akali Dal wants that the entire state should be declared the principal mandi yard but would that be able to ensure MSP to farmers? We can use Article 254 (2) but we cannot force the government to procure. Till today, Punjabs rice and wheat was lifted by Centres agency FCI. That is why I am saying we should go towards the real solution. When we know that in a year or more, danger is lurking on us that the Centre may not procure our grains. When we know Adani and Ambani will bring contracts, then we should be ready. Our commitment should be towards MSP and towards assured procurement and not just to save the dwindling agriculture, but to put it on a golden path so that our youths going abroad should come back and take to agriculture.Becoming a votary of federalism, he said, they should fight against the Centre for going against the spirit of Constitution that provided autonomy to the states.Without naming Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, he went on to say that governments should give a solution. He said the way farmers are struggling, they are strengthening our democracy,It is time for the government to shoulder its responsibilities. This is the struggle of the farmers and to say farmers struggle is supported by some outside powers and to say that this could create turbulence in the state is a disrespect and insult to the farmers and their struggle. Amarinder had been cautioning the Centre that withdrawal of MSP could provide several anti-Punjab forces an opportunity to spoil the environment of the state. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2020-10-25,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stubble-burning-researchers-look-for-tech-solutions-as-daily-fire-counts-crosses-1-000-mark-in-punjab-haryana/story-DHS8EBwXu1o7efGtjxTTjL.html,Stubble burning: Researchers look for tech solutions as daily fire count crosses...,"mumbaiUpdated: Oct 26, 2020, 00:06 ISTBurning of rice stubble has started earlier than usual this year with daily fire counts crossing the 1,000-mark in Punjab and Haryana combined, revealed the data by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), an independent policy research institution, on Thursday.Stubble or straw is the residue left behind in large quantities after harvesting the paddy crops. Most farmers are forced to burn the stubble as a quick way of getting rid of the residue so they can begin sowing the next crop. This mass burning of agriculture residue leads to emission of particulate matter (PM-10 and PM-2.5) and greenhouse gases (GHG), which contribute to the poor air quality in Punjab, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).Between September 1 and October 20, the CEEW has recorded more than 9,000 fires. Simultaneously, the air quality in Delhi-NCR has dropped to a very poor category with air quality index (AQI) crossing the 300 mark. AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.The harvest of rice in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which usually peaks at the end of October, will mature early this year. In July a labour shortage induced by the Covid-19 pandemic forced farmers to sow their rice seeds directly in the fields instead of transplanting seedlings from nurseries.With rice crop maturing eight to 10 days earlier than usual, harvest season has kicked off, as have rice stubble burning incidents.While the central and state governments are trying out a host of policy measures and alternatives for collection and disposal of stubble, science and technology institutes are also working on interventions for processing the waste.Addressing problem at the rootPunjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, which has seen moderate success with the widely used happy seedera tractor-operated machine that can sow wheat seeds even in standing paddy stubblehas also developed hybrid straw management systems (SMS). A super seeder is a tractor-mounted machine that can plough the stubble and sow wheat seeds simultaneously. It is a combined harvesting system, said Mahesh Kumar Narang, principal extension scientist, farm machinery and power engineering, PAU.However, the super seeder throws the ploughed straw to the centre of the field and additional labour may be required to remove the straw. To address this, the PAU has developed Super SMS, which can be fitted to the super seeder. The Super SMS chops the ploughed straw evenly and distributes it evenly over the field. This helps manage the entire straw residue within the field. The super seeder is currently priced at 1.10 lakh, he added. For a farmer, the price for using the super seeder is almost 350 to 400 more per acre than using a happy seeder. However, the labour cost of mulching the stubble is eliminated, said Narang.Along similar lines, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has designed a stubble removing machine (SRM) and collection trolley, which can cut the stubble and collect the residue in a trolley at the same time. Happy seeder, super seeder and SRM are comparatively cheaper than traditional balers that are priced at 7-8 lakh, said Narang.High yield and green alternative to coalThe rice straw holds potential as an alternative to coal in thermal power plants is widely accepted. However, paddy residue has seen very little success in its use as fuel in power plants because it has to be processed before it can be used as a fuel in a thermal plant.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) in Delhi, proposes heating the straw at very high temperatures in controlled conditions to convert the residue into high-yield bio coalan environment-friendly alternative to coal.There are inherent problems in using raw rice straw as fuel because there is high moisture content and the gross calorific value (GCV) is low, which makes it difficult to use in large scale, said Sanjay Dhakate, chief scientist and head of advanced carbon products group, CSIR-NPL. The solution proposed by Dhakate is using heat in a controlled environment to convert agri-waste into coal-like material. This is called torrefaction.As a pilot, NPL has set up a small stainless-steel plant in its lab for torrefying rice straw by applying heat from 250 to 400 degrees Celsius. The plant redirects the gases emitted to generate power to back the plant in turn. We have found that on torrefaction at 250C, the GCV of the residue is 3,762 kcal/kg and it further increases to 4,342, 5,129 and 5,339 kcal/kg with an increase in torrefaction temperature from 300C to 400C, said Dhakate. This is comparable to the calorific value of coal used in thermal plants (6000-8000 kcal/ kg). The NPL is currently working with National Thermal Power Corporation Limited for large-scale implementation of torrefaction of rice straw.Darpan Das, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University, USA, also endorses torrefaction. He offers the concept of briquetting of rice straw to curb emissions, a process involving compaction of fuel to an energy-densified material. Formerly a PhD student at IIT-Bombay, Das has used the same, as a strategy to reduce emissions from domestic applications of coal in cookstoves. This can be used for agro-residues for efficient conversion to bio-briquettes which can cater to the household energy needs of the country. Briquettes can also serve as additional support to the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme of providing LPG to every citizen, said Das.Cost, feasibility a challenge for implementation, say expertsCollection of rice straws is a labour-intensive and expensive process, even with the machines in place, say experts. In Punjab alone, around 13,000 happy seeders and 200-odd super seeder machines were deployed last year, according to Narang. For a state that generates 19.7 metric tonne of paddy straw, the CEEW estimates the requirement of 35,000 happy seeder machines.While there is a rise in takers for the machines with the subsidy offered by the government, there is a big gap in the number of machines that are required and are available, said LS Kurinji, research analyst, CEEW. Large-scale dissemination of technology is a challenge in implementation, agreed Das.There are 290 manufacturers of various straw management machines empanelled with the government of India. In Punjab, individual farmers get a 50% subsidy on the purchase of a machine and cooperatives can avail a subsidy of 75%. The subsidy for buying straw management machines should continue for at least three more years so that farmers continue to invest in them, said Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairperson of the Punjab state farmers and farmworkers commission.For power plants to substitute coal with biomass, too, is not an easy task. Technologically it is possible to use rice straw as fuel in thermal power plants. The problem is the plants are too far away from the paddy fields. This adds to the transportation cost. Ideally, Punjab and Haryana should buy up the agri-waste to fuel the power plants within the states, said Ajay Mathur, director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute.Instead of dictating a policy to promote the use of biomass as a coal substitute in power plants, the government should set out guidelines for disposing of rice straw in an environment-friendly way. This will give entrepreneurs and researchers to find disruptive solutions to the problem, said Jakhar, adding that to promote innovation, the government should set up funds for competitions seeking solutions.BOX:The problem: The air quality in north India, particularly along the Indo-Gangetic plains, stoops to dangerously low levels between October and November every year. This is also the time when farmers in the region set fire to their agricultural waste after harvesting their paddy fields.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are the biggest producers of rice in the country in the Kharif season between May and November every year. In 2017-18, almost 62% of all the rice procured by the Food Corporation of India came from these states.Harvesting begins in October and peaks by the end of the month. At the end of the harvest, stubbles of paddy are left rooted in the fields. Farmers usually have barely two weeks to clear this stubble so they can start sowing the next crop, which is wheat.Left with a heap of unwanted rice stubble, with little time to dispose of it, farmers set fire to the heaps and use the ash as a fertiliser. However, stubble burning emits greenhouse gases and harmful particulate matter into the air, which leads to pollution. Punjab alone generates 19.7 million metric tonnes of rice straw in a year.Burning of rice straw releases particulate matter and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. These emissions pose severe health risks and can be detrimental to lung functions.","mumbaiupdated: oct 26, 2020, 00:06 istburning of rice stubble has started earlier than usual this year with daily

governments are trying out a host of policy measures and alternatives for collection and disposal of stubble, science and technology institutes are also working on interventions for processing the waste.addressing problem at the rootpunjab agricultural university (pau), ludhiana, which has seen moderate success with the widely used happy seedera tractor-operated machine that can sow wheat seeds even in standing paddy stubblehas also developed hybrid straw management systems (sms). a super seeder is a tractor-mounted machine that can plough the stubble and sow wheat seeds simultaneously. it is a combined harvesting system, said mahesh kumar narang, principal extension scientist, farm machinery and power engineering, pau.however, the super seeder throws the ploughed straw to the centre of the field and additional labour may be required to remove the straw. to address this, the pau has developed super sms, which can be fitted to the super seeder. the super sms chops the ploughed straw evenly and distributes it evenly over the field. this helps manage the entire straw residue within the field. the super seeder is currently priced at 1.10 lakh, he added. for a farmer, the price for using the super seeder is almost 350 to 400 more per acre than using a happy seeder. however, the labour cost of mulching the stubble is eliminated, said narang.along similar lines, the indian institute of technology (iit), ropar, has designed a stubble removing machine (srm) and collection trolley, which can cut the stubble and collect the residue in a trolley at the same time. happy seeder, super seeder and srm are comparatively cheaper than traditional balers that are priced at 7-8 lakh, said narang.high yield and green alternative to coalthe rice straw holds potential as an alternative to coal in thermal power plants is widely accepted. however, paddy residue has seen very little success in its use as fuel in power plants because it has to be processed before it can be used as a fuel in a thermal plant.the council of scientific and industrial research-national physical laboratory (csir-npl) in delhi, proposes heating the straw at very high temperatures in controlled conditions to convert the residue into high-yield bio coalan environment-friendly alternative to coal.there are inherent problems in using raw rice straw as fuel because there is high moisture content and the gross calorific value (gcv) is low, which makes it difficult to use in large scale, said sanjay dhakate, chief scientist and head of advanced carbon products group, csir-npl. the solution proposed by dhakate is using heat in a controlled environment to convert agri-waste into coal-like material. this is called torrefaction.as a pilot, npl has set up a small stainless-steel plant in its lab for torrefying rice straw by applying heat from 250 to 400 degrees celsius. the plant redirects the gases emitted to generate power to back the plant in turn. we have found that on torrefaction at 250c, the gcv of the residue is 3,762 kcal/kg and it further increases to 4,342, 5,129 and 5,339 kcal/kg with an increase in torrefaction temperature from 300c to 400c, said dhakate. this is comparable to the calorific value of coal used in thermal plants (6000-8000 kcal/ kg). the npl is currently working with national thermal power corporation limited for large-scale implementation of torrefaction of rice straw.darpan das, a postdoctoral fellow at johns hopkins university, usa, also endorses torrefaction. he offers the concept of briquetting of rice straw to curb emissions, a process involving compaction of fuel to an energy-densified material. formerly a phd student at iit-bombay, das has used the same, as a strategy to reduce emissions from domestic applications of coal in cookstoves. this can be used for agro-residues for efficient conversion to bio-briquettes which can cater to the household energy needs of the country. briquettes can also serve as additional support to the pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana scheme of providing lpg to every citizen, said das.cost, feasibility a challenge for implementation, say expertscollection of rice straws is a labour-intensive and expensive process, even with the machines in place, say experts. in punjab alone, around 13,000 happy seeders and 200-odd super seeder machines were deployed last year, according to narang. for a state that generates 19.7 metric tonne of paddy straw, the ceew estimates the requirement of 35,000 happy seeder machines.while there is a rise in takers for the machines with the subsidy offered by the government, there is a big gap in the number of machines that are required and are available, said ls kurinji, research analyst, ceew. large-scale dissemination of technology is a challenge in implementation, agreed das.there are 290 manufacturers of various straw management machines empanelled with the government of india. in punjab, individual farmers get a 50% subsidy on the purchase of a machine and cooperatives can avail a subsidy of 75%. the subsidy for buying straw management machines should continue for at least three more years so that farmers continue to invest in them, said ajay vir jakhar, chairperson of the punjab state farmers and farmworkers commission.for power plants to substitute coal with biomass, too, is not an easy task. technologically it is possible to use rice straw as fuel in thermal power plants. the problem is the plants are too far away from the paddy fields. this adds to the transportation cost. ideally, punjab and haryana should buy up the agri-waste to fuel the power plants within the states, said ajay mathur, director-general of the energy and resources institute.instead of dictating a policy to promote the use of biomass as a coal substitute in power plants, the government should set out guidelines for disposing of rice straw in an environment-friendly way. this will give entrepreneurs and researchers to find disruptive solutions to the problem, said jakhar, adding that to promote innovation, the government should set up funds for competitions seeking solutions.box:the problem: the air quality in north india, particularly along the indo-gangetic plains, stoops to dangerously low levels between october and november every year. this is also the time when farmers in the region set fire to their agricultural waste after harvesting their paddy fields.punjab, haryana and uttar pradesh are the biggest producers of rice in the country in the kharif season between may and november every year. in 2017-18, almost 62% of all the rice procured by the food corporation of india came from these states.harvesting begins in october and peaks by the end of the month. at the end of the harvest, stubbles of paddy are left rooted in the fields. farmers usually have barely two weeks to clear this stubble so they can start sowing the next crop, which is wheat.left with a heap of unwanted rice stubble, with little time to dispose of it, farmers set fire to the heaps and use the ash as a fertiliser. however, stubble burning emits greenhouse gases and harmful particulate matter into the air, which leads to pollution. punjab alone generates 19.7 million metric tonnes of rice straw in a year.burning of rice straw releases particulate matter and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. these emissions pose severe health risks and can be detrimental to lung functions."

The study was part of the policy series by Punjabi Universitys centre for development economics and innovation studies.Emphasising on the need for all stakeholders, including government, industry and the civil society to shift their strategy from reactive to proactive, the study points out that the national programme on crop diversification does not have clear provisions on outreach activities to sensitise farmers about alternate crop options.Similarly, there is insufficient convergence with other programmes such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, National Rural Livelihood Mission, and agro-enterprise related schemes which could help in management of paddy stubble or crop diversification.Rural Punjab spends  7.6cr annually to treat ailmentsThe study says that people in rural Punjab spend more than Rs 7.6 crore every year on treatment for ailments caused by stubble burning.It is estimated that 20 million tonnes of rice stubble is produced every year in Punjab, out of which 80% is burnt on farms. Cost of air pollution due to stubble burning in India is estimated to be US $30 billion annually.Stubble burning emits particulate matter (PM 2.5), which is the most adverse for human health since the particles can get trapped inside the lungs and raise the lung cancer risk by 36%.Burning one tonne of rice (paddy stubble) accounts for a loss of nitrogen (5.5kg), phosphorus (2.3kg), potassium (25kg), and sulphur (1.2kg) in the soil. Moreover, the heat from burning crop residue kills critical bacterial and fungal populations in the soil, apart from organic carbon.Implementation IssuesThe research found that the unavailability of crop residue management (CRM) machines has been a key issue in mitigating paddy stubble burning. In 2019, despite a sanction of 22,854 machines, only 14,625 were available for use. The in-situ management machines are still unaffordable to many farmers despite subsidy provisions.Small farmers cannot afford machines despite subsidyHappy seeder costs Rs 1.50 lakh and requires a 65-horsepower tractor. Small farmers cannot afford to buy the machinery, even with a subsidy of 50% at current rates. Even though the central sector scheme (CSS) provides 80% subsidy to cooperative societies to rent out machines to farmers, most (cooperative societies) did not have funds to buy such machinery even on subsidy, says the study.Diversification IssuesCrop diversification package should be a mix of policy measures, encouragement of agrobusiness enterprises possibly under Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan scheme, awareness campaigns for farmers explaining the importance of the scheme for them and what it offers, economic incentives such as minimum support pricesfor alternative crops, along with infrastructure support like agricultural inputs for identified alternative crops, reads the study. There is a need for a detailed study involving all stakeholders to understand slow progress towards crop diversification in spite of regulatory policy nudges and fiscal policy incentives announced by the central as well as state governments.","farmers continue to burn crop stubble despite banchandigarh: india needs a central coordinating mechanism for paddy stubble management and crop diversification with adequate resources, clear assignment of responsibilities between national and sub-national agencies to counter the ill-effects of crop stubble burning during covid-19 pandemic.this has been recommended by a study conducted by national institute of public finance and policy senior researchers rita pandey and anuja malhotra and the energy and resources institutes shailly kedia. the study was part of the policy series by punjabi universitys centre for development economics and innovation studies.emphasising on the need for all stakeholders, including government, industry and the civil society to shift their strategy from reactive to proactive, the study points out that the national programme on crop diversification does not have clear provisions on outreach activities to sensitise farmers about alternate crop options.similarly, there is insufficient convergence with other programmes such as the national rural employment guarantee scheme, national rural livelihood mission, and agro-enterprise related schemes which could help in management of paddy stubble or crop diversification.rural punjab spends  7.6cr annually to treat ailmentsthe study says that people in rural punjab spend more than rs 7.6 crore every year on treatment for ailments caused by stubble burning.it is estimated that 20 million tonnes of rice stubble is produced every year in punjab, out of which 80% is burnt on farms. cost of air pollution due to stubble burning in india is estimated to be us $30 billion annually.stubble burning emits particulate matter (pm 2.5), which is the most adverse for human health since the particles can get trapped inside the lungs and raise the lung cancer risk by 36%.burning one tonne of rice (paddy stubble) accounts for a loss of nitrogen (5.5kg), phosphorus (2.3kg), potassium (25kg), and sulphur (1.2kg) in the soil. moreover, the heat from burning crop residue kills critical bacterial and fungal populations in the soil, apart from organic carbon.implementation issuesthe research found that the unavailability of crop residue management (crm) machines has been a key issue in mitigating paddy stubble burning. in 2019, despite a sanction of 22,854 machines, only 14,625 were available for use. the in-situ management machines are still unaffordable to many farmers despite subsidy provisions.small farmers cannot afford machines despite subsidyhappy seeder costs rs 1.50 lakh and requires a 65-horsepower tractor. small farmers cannot afford to buy the machinery, even with a subsidy of 50% at current rates. even though the central sector scheme (css) provides 80% subsidy to cooperative societies to rent out machines to farmers, most (cooperative societies) did not have funds to buy such machinery even on subsidy, says the study.diversification issuescrop diversification package should be a mix of policy measures, encouragement of agrobusiness enterprises possibly under aatmanirbhar bharat abhiyan scheme, awareness campaigns for farmers explaining the importance of the scheme for them and what it offers, economic incentives such as minimum support pricesfor alternative crops, along with infrastructure support like agricultural inputs for identified alternative crops, reads the study. there is a need for a detailed study involving all stakeholders to understand slow progress towards crop diversification in spite of regulatory policy nudges and fiscal policy incentives announced by the central as well as state governments."

(Express photo by Harmeet Sodhi)AFTER MASSIVE influx of paddy from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to Punjab to be sold at the MSP rate, farmers union leaders of the have caught several trucks of Basmati, a premium quality rice, coming from other states.Basmati is not purchased by the government but by private players, and has huge demand in the international market. Farmers blamed heavy influx of basmati from other states for the drastic fall in its rates in Punjab this year, as compared to last year. They said traders, rice millers and some political leaders are hand-in-glove and involved in bringing Basmati from UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh (MP), which has a negative impact on the interests of Punjab farmers a millers are also pressuring them to sell their own Basmati at a rate much below the prevailing market price by claiming that they already have enough supply from other states.This year, farmers are selling the early variety of Basmati Pusa 1509 at Rs 1,600-2,100 per quintal against Rs 2,500-2,700 per quintal the rate of the same variety last year. Traders say even the late Basmati variety 1121 wont sell at much better rates.A farm leader said farmers have stopped around a dozen trucks of a Cabinet minister, who owns a rice sheller, carrying Basmati near the Punjab-Haryana border and now another Cabinet minister is requesting them to release the trucks of his colleague. However, farmers are serving food to the truck drivers, unions said.Amid the pandemic, the Punjab government has converted rice shellers into purchase centres cum mandi yards so as to avoid heavy rush in designated mandis under the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB). With rice shellers serving as mandis, they cannot indulge in their own sale purchase.The governments own notification says that mandi yards owned by private players do not allow them or their relatives to do any trading there, then how can they store rice from other states here as it calls for cancellation of their licenses? asked Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (Dakunda).By allowing the transportation of Basmati from other states to Punjab by millers or arhtiyas, who also own rice shellers and store at their own premises, the government is nullifying its own rule, he said.Under the garb of the coronavirus, the Modi government has passed the three anti-farmers Bills while the state government, under the garb of coronavirus, converted the rice shellers into procurement centre/cum mandis yards and gave a free hand to millers to purchase the Basmati crop from across India and store in their own shellers, even if its detrimental to the farming community of Punjab, said Jagmohan.How can these politicians protect our interests? asked another farmer.Farmers on the other hand said traders are not only looting the farmers of other states, but also the farmers of their own states and minting money.After purchasing from us at Rs 1,600-2,000 per quintal, the millers are selling it three to five times higher rates in the domestic and international markets, said farmer Dalwinder Singh from Tarn Taran, adding that political leaders are the real owners of several big rice shellers of Punjab and are also involved in arhtiyas business.If basmati import from other states is not stopped by the government then the fate of Punjabs farmers will be at stake. Why will they grow Basmati if it has to be sold below the MSP of Paddy? asked Onkar Singh, a farmer from Majitha, adding, These politicians have no mercy for poor farmers.A rice exporter said Basmati in other states is available to them at quite a cheaper rate, so why would they pay rates to Punjabs farmers?The agro processing rice Industry meanwhile said that the rice industry is in total disarray and appealed to the government to intervene.It is disheartening that Punjab is facing an extreme crisis with complete dislocation of rice exports and harassment by police and department of vigilance due to detaining of Basmati paddy trucks coming from other states at various barriers during the last one week, said Director, Punjab Rice Millers Export Association, Ashok Sethi.Punjab accounts for over 100 Basmati manufacturing units primarily for export and meeting domestic requirements.While it produces about Rs 8,000 crore-worth of Basmati, the industry needs much more to meet its production capacities.The export contribution of Punjab is almost 45 per cent of the total country export of Basmati (Rs 34,000 crore).A large number of export containers carrying rice worth over Rs 5,000 crore are stuck at Ludhiana ICD and other locations, disrupting the entire supply chain and blocking funds, resulting in unprecedented financial crunch, Sethi said.

2020-10-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/amid-row-over-farm-laws-centre-tells-punjab-it-wont-pay-rdf-in-paddy-season-6904754/,"Amid row over farm laws, Centre tells Punjab it won’t pay RDF in paddy season","The Centre has also sought to scrutinise how the state government spends the RDF. (Representational)A few days after President Ram Nath Kovinds assent to Centres farm laws, the Rural Development Fund (RDF) appears to have become a casualty with Centre not keeping a provision for the RDF in the Cash Credit Limit extended for the current paddy procurement season. The Centre has also sought to scrutinise how the state government spends the RDF.In the Cash Credit Limit extended to the state by Centre for paddy procurement, the RD fee component is not accounted for in the provisional cost sheet for procurement of paddy. This means that Punjab cannot withdraw RDF from the CCL it has received.If the state does not get RDF on paddy, it would cost the exchequer about Rs 1,100 crore in paddy season alone.The farm laws do not provide for RDF and market fee for the states. As per the new agri laws, the states cannot charge any RDF and mandi fee from the buyers.Punjab makes about Rs 3,500 crore annually on account of RDF and Mandi fee, at the rate of 3 per cent each of MSP, both charged from the buyers (in this case the Centre, as the foodgrains go to Central pool).Communication from CentreIn a letter (dated October 23) to Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, Punjab, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Distribution has stated that matters related to deductions from MSP made by state and utilisation of RD fee for the purpose of development of procurement centres are under scrutiny.In the provisional cost sheet attached along with the letter, no monetary provision is indicated towards the RDF. The column mentioning about the RDF has been kept blank with a footnote that the RDF is now under scrutiny.The provisional rates of custom milled rice procured and delivered to central pool during the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21, include MSP of raw rice and par boiled rice between Rs 1,868 to 1,888, market fee between Rs 56.04 to Rs 56.64 at 3 per cent of MSP, arhtiya charges between Rs 45.38 to Rs 45.88, besides other charges. Every one quintal of packed rice would cost the Centre between Rs 3,269.13 to Rs 3,241.95. The other costs include mandi charges, handling charges, driage, milling charges, gunny bags price.This is dictatorship: Punjab ministerPunjab Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told The Indian Express that they have received two separate communications from Centre. They have asked us to provide them the details about how we spend the RDF. So, our RDF account is under scrutiny. And they have sent us a provisional cost sheet for paddy procurement according to which they will not be paying us any RDF. This is the height. Look at what all they are doing to Punjab. It is hitting back at us because our farmers are protesting.He added that the government was preparing a detailed reply to the Centres communication.We will be telling them what all we do with RDF. What do they want? Punjab will give its precious resources for the entire country, grow crops, spend money on procurement centres and road network and not charge the Centre anything? This is dictatorship. We will not get cowed down, he said.He added that the Centre was also running away from paying the commission to arhtiyas. We pay them a commission of 2.5 per cent and they have now fixed a ceiling of Rs 46 per quintal. This is what they wanted to do with the farm laws. Where will the commission agents go? They had done this during wheat season also and we had taken it up with them. But again the provisional cost sheet says the same thing.Double blowIf the state does not get RDF this time then it would be a double blow for the funds crunched state that has not been getting its GST compensation also. Doing away with RDF and mandi fee in the farm law is a major controversial point with Punjab. The state government has been opposing it tooth and nail as the state has about 1800 mandis across the state and a network of long roads to make sure that each farmer does not have to travel more than 20 km to reach a mandi. The RDF and mandi fee is spent on the maintenance of 70,000 km-rural link roads and other infrastructure besides other projects.The state earns about Rs 3,500 crores annually in the form of market fee and rural development fund (RDF) for providing its mandis for selling wheat, paddy, Basmati and cotton crops. In the Kharif and Rabi season 2019-20, the government earned Rs 3,642 crore.Not first row over RDFThis is not the first attempt by Centre to seek details about RDF.

(representational)a few days after president ram nath kovinds assent to centres farm laws, the rural development fund (rdf) appears to have become a casualty with centre not keeping a provision for the rdf in the cash credit limit extended for the current paddy procurement season. the centre has also sought to scrutinise how the state government spends the rdf.in the cash credit limit extended to the state by centre for paddy procurement, the rd fee component is not accounted for in the provisional cost sheet for procurement of paddy. this means that punjab cannot withdraw rdf from the ccl it has received.if the state does not get rdf on paddy, it would cost the exchequer about rs 1,100 crore in paddy season alone.the farm laws do not provide for rdf and market fee for the states. as per the new agri laws, the states cannot charge any rdf and mandi fee from the buyers.punjab makes about rs 3,500 crore annually on account of rdf and mandi fee, at the rate of 3 per cent each of msp, both charged from the buyers (in this case the centre, as the foodgrains go to central pool).communication from centrein a letter (dated october 23) to secretary, food and civil supplies, punjab, the union ministry of consumer affairs, food and distribution has stated that matters related to deductions from msp made by state and utilisation of rd fee for the purpose of development of procurement centres are under scrutiny.in the provisional cost sheet attached along with the letter, no monetary provision is indicated towards the rdf. the column mentioning about the rdf has been kept blank with a footnote that the rdf is now under scrutiny.the provisional rates of custom milled rice procured and delivered to central pool during the kharif marketing season (kms) 2020-21, include msp of raw rice and par boiled rice between rs 1,868 to 1,888, market fee between rs 56.04 to rs 56.64 at 3 per cent of msp, arhtiya charges between rs 45.38 to rs 45.88, besides other charges. every one quintal of packed rice would cost the centre between rs 3,269.13 to rs 3,241.95. the other costs include mandi charges, handling charges, driage, milling charges, gunny bags price.this is dictatorship: punjab ministerpunjab food minister bharat bhushan ashu told the indian express that they have received two separate communications from centre. they have asked us to provide them the details about how we spend the rdf. so, our rdf account is under scrutiny. and they have sent us a provisional cost sheet for paddy procurement according to which they will not be paying us any rdf. this is the height. look at what all they are doing to punjab. it is hitting back at us because our farmers are protesting.he added that the government was preparing a detailed reply to the centres communication.we will be telling them what all we do with rdf. what do they want? punjab will give its precious resources for the entire country, grow crops, spend money on procurement centres and road network and not charge the centre anything? this is dictatorship. we will not get cowed down, he said.he added that the centre was also running away from paying the commission to arhtiyas. we pay them a commission of 2.5 per cent and they have now fixed a ceiling of rs 46 per quintal. this is what they wanted to do with the farm laws. where will the commission agents go? they had done this during wheat season also and we had taken it up with them. but again the provisional cost sheet says the same thing.double blowif the state does not get rdf this time then it would be a double blow for the funds crunched state that has not been getting its gst compensation also. doing away with rdf and mandi fee in the farm law is a major controversial point with punjab. the state government has been opposing it tooth and nail as the state has about 1800 mandis across the state and a network of long roads to make sure that each farmer does not have to travel more than 20 km to reach a mandi. the rdf and mandi fee is spent on the maintenance of 70,000 km-rural link roads and other infrastructure besides other projects.the state earns about rs 3,500 crores annually in the form of market fee and rural development fund (rdf) for providing its mandis for selling wheat, paddy, basmati and cotton crops. in the kharif and rabi season 2019-20, the government earned rs 3,642 crore.not first row over rdfthis is not the first attempt by centre to seek details about rdf. earlier, during former chief minister parkash singh badals regime, former union finance minister late arun jaitley had also asked the state to route the rdf through the consolidated fund so that the centre knows where the state was spending the money. it had blown into a major controversy following which the centre had to relent.punjab is already up in arms against the centre for not restoring the goods train traffic.ppcc chief sunil jakhar on tuesday tweeted: first was refusal to release punjabs gst dues, now its stopping of trains to punjab. two phrases come to mind which are used in international standoffs but definitely not used within a nations federal structure  1. economic sanctions 2. blockade. what next ?in another tweet, he said, to teach punjabis a lesson for opposing #farmlaws , some wise guy in delhi may next suggest to ban having makki ki roti and sarson ka saag in india. large country like india needs to be governed with an equally large heart! the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest chandigarh news, download indian express app."
2020-10-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/decoding-punjab-farmers-protest-wheat-paddy-cycle-minimum-support-price-6906767/,"Decoding farm protests in Punjab: Behind stir, the wheat paddy cycle and farmers’ fear of losing minimum support","A farmer sows the seeds of wheat grain after burning the paddy stubble in his field near Ghanour-Patiala road in Patiala on October 28, 2020. (Express Photo: Harmeet Sodhi)With just 1.19 per cent of the total farmer households and 1.53 per cent of land in the country, Punjab has been contributing over one-third of the total wheat and paddy procured by the central government every year.The agrarian economy of the state is largely dependent on this annual procurement at minimum support price (MSP) by central government agencies such as the Food Corporation of India.The state that feeds the nation The state that feeds the nationThe farmers of the state are protesting against the new agriculture laws as they fear that these will deprive them of their livelihood by leading to the closure of the state government mandis, doing away with assured procurement at MSP, and driving them to the bondage of corporate players.Ever since the green revolution in the 1960s, the Punjab farmer has been following the wheat-paddy cycle that not only ensured food security for the country but also prosperity for the state that came to be known as the bread basket of India.Over 11 lakh farmer households (according to Agriculture Census 2015-16) of the state have been growing around 360 lakh tonnes (36 million tonnes) food grain out of which, 289 lakh tonnes (28.9 million tonnes) of wheat and paddy are procured for the national pool ever year. According to Punjab Mandi Board (PMB), this figure is around 32 pr cent of central governments food grain procurement.A farmer earns anywhere between Rs 70,000 and Rs 75,000 per acre from wheat and paddy after excluding the input costs. On an average, one acre yields around 28-30 quintals of paddy worth Rs 52,800 to Rs 56, 600 at the rate of Rs 1,888 per quintal as per the MSP. As for wheat, the average yield is 25 to 26 quintals per acre, which fetches Rs 49,000 to 51,000 at the rate of Rs 1,975 per quintal. Most small farmers also till land on rent for anywhere between Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 an acre.In the 2019-20 kharif and rabi seasons, Punjab contributed 162.28 lakh tonnes (16.2 million tonnes) paddy and 127.12 lakh tonnes (12.7 million tonnes) wheat, respectively, to the national pool. Punjab produces nearly 18 million tonnes of wheat out of which five million tonnes is kept for self-consumption, seed requirement, and for selling in the open market by the farmers.Punjab also contributes substantially to foreign exchange by exporting over two million tonnes of Basmati out of nearly 25.54 lakh tonnes (2.6 million tonnes) of the premium rice grown in the state.Wheat and paddy continue to be the staple of Punjab farmers who grow very little maize and cotton in comparison. Interestingly, maize and cotton are often sold to private traders and price crashes are commonplace even though the central government specifies an MSP for these crops too. But since there is little procurement of these crops by the central government, private players dominate, and seldom pay at MSP.Nearly 0.5 million tonnes of maize was purchased by private traders from Punjab mandis last year when state also grew 42.60 lakh quintals kapas (raw cotton with seed), and 5.3 million tonnes sugar cane for crushing (according to cane commissioner, Punjab), few thousand tonnes of pulses and oilseeds and around 73 lakh tonnes vegetables, and fruits (mainly kinnow).The wheat-paddy cycle has come at a heavy cost to the quality of the soil as well as groundwater. Paddy, a water-guzzling crop, not suited to the terrain, has spelt doom for the groundwater aquifers, which are in the dark zone in almost three-fourth of the state. This is forcing farmers to dig new bore wells every year, thereby adding to their input costs.The area under wheat and paddy increased from a couple of lakh hectares to 27 lakh hectares under paddy and 35 lakh hectares under wheat in the past fives decades, which has led Punjab to become the highest consumer of fertilisers in the country. To irrigate this huge area, Punjab has installed 14.16 lakh tubewells, which could eventually result in desertification of the state.Along with heavy usage of fertilisers, Punjab also went in for mechanised farming to manage sowing and harvesting of wheat and paddy on such a large scale, says Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh, adding that heavy use of diesel, whose price is spiralling, is further raising the input costs.Small and marginal farmers grow wheat and paddy, as it gives them assured income. They have no knowledge about private trade, and are not in a position to go looking for buyers and better prices.The contribution of Punjab cannot be forgotten as it took the responsibility of making India food surplus when it was highly grain deficit in 1960s and farmers here were asked to grow wheat and paddy, says noted economist S S Johal, recalling how good seeds were provided to the farmers and Commission for Agriculture Crops and Price (CACP), which recommends price of the crops after calculating all the input costs, was set up and Food Corporation of India (FCI) was created to procure wheat and paddy in the 1960s.While farmers fear the government will soon discontinue the MSP, Johal does not think so.The MSP will stay as long as the Public Distribution System (PDS) continues in the country, and PDS cannot be stopped in a country like India where millions are living below the poverty line, he said.

2020-10-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/central-farm-laws-hit-punjab-mandi-rural-development-boards-6908188/,Central farm laws to hit Punjab where it hurts most: mandi and rural development boards,"With paddy spread out for drying, it is feast for pigeons at a grain market in Jalandhar. (Express photo by Anju Agnihotri Chaba)The implementation of Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, which removes restrictions on farmers selling agri-produce outside the notified Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) yards, has not only brought the very existence of six-decade-old Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) under cloud, but it is also set to hit the three-decade-old Rural Development Board (RDB).Both PMB and RDB are major revenue earners for the state, and are also the biggest infrastructure builders next only to the Public Works Department.The Punjab government claims that if the earnings of these boards are stopped, the state will find it difficult to maintain over 31,000-km of rural link roads as well as farmers welfare schemes, including the debt relief scheme.The PMB earns nearly Rs 1,950 crore annually as Market Development Fee (MDF), which is 1 per cent on cotton, maize, and potato; 2 per cent on fruits and vegetables, and 3 per cent on wheat, rice, barley and paddy. This amount is shared between the PMB, which keeps Rs 1,200 crore, and market committees, which get Rs 650 crore.Apart from this, the PMB also earns some revenue from selling off its plots, and leasing out maize driers, cold rooms and ripening chambers, which it has set up over the past decade.Similarly, RDBs annual income is around Rs 1,850 crore, which mainly comes from 3 per cent Rural Development Fund (RDF) charged from the purchaser of crops. The annual income of both the boards comes to around Rs 3,800 crore, and a major portion this comes from central governments purchase agency FCI, which buys around 13 million tonnes of wheat and 16 million tonnes of paddy.The PMB, which was set up under the Punjab Agriculture Produce Markets Act, 1961, is entrusted with the responsibility of developing mandis/mandi infrastructure to facilitate farmers in selling their agricultural produce. The amenities it provides includes auction platform, sheds, office buildings, canteens, roads, electrification and public health services, etc.The RDB, on the other hand, was incorporated in April 1987 under Rural Development Act, 1987 and is mandated with the promotion of better agriculture, and granting relief for the loss and damage to agricultural produce. It also provides the facility of streets lights, dharamshalas, panchayat ghars, canals and drains, government health infrastructure, drinking water, sanitation, and government educational institutions in rural areas.Both the boards share a huge burden of the states expenditure.PMB, which is the nodal agency for rural link roads, takes care of 14,600 roads with a total length of 31,988 km out of the 64,878 km-long link roads in the rural areas, including high (28,705 km), medium (26,437 km) and low (9,736 km) traffic volume roads. The remaining 15,647 link roads that are 32,890-km long are maintained by the PWD.The PWD and PMB maintain these roads on almost 50-50 basis, and PMB does so from its own earnings, said a senior officer of the PMB, adding that these roads are repaired and re-carpeted every six years by the PMB.Nowhere in the country is there such a fine system of roads linking rural areas with the main roads and market committees so that farmers can easily bring the grain to the mandis. One can find a mandi or purchase centre at a distance of 2 to 5 km, says former Vice-Chairman of PMB, Ravinder Singh Cheema.It was set up to regulate the marketing of agricultural produce by eliminating malpractices prevalent in the trade in the 1950s, said Cheema, adding that the board also set up 152 main yards, 280 sub yards and 1,436 purchase yard (total 1868 purchase points) across the state.The PMB has also set up seven maize dryers with a total capacity of 248 tonnes per batch at a cost of Rs 55 crore at seven places across the state so that farmers can get a good price for their dry maize. Otherwise they face huge losses because of severe cuts in price in the name of high moisture content in the crop.All these dryers are given on an annual lease of Rs 27.92 lakh.PMB has also established 12 pack houses at a cost of Rs 13 crore, which include cold room and ripening chambers with a capacity of 950 metric tonnes (cold room) and 460 tonnes (ripening chambers). They are given on annual lease of around Rs 1.51 crore.PMB is supposed to spend Rs 1,500 crore for various development works in 2020-21. It had provided Rs 700 crore for debt relief to farmers in March 2020. Around 4.94 lakh J-farm holders (farmers) are insured through it by depositing a premium. It paid Rs 3.65 crore in 788 cases of agriculture-related accident or deaths in the financial year of 2019-20.Further, the PMB has over 22,000 plots, including shops, grain shops booths, etc out of which over 9,000 have already been sold to arhtiyas and traders. It has developed several vegetables and fruit markets as well.The RDB is supposed to spend Rs 1,630 crore this financial year on various development works, including phirnis (a road encircling the village), repair of kucha houses for the poor, water supply and sanitation.We do not know of any place other than these mandis to sell our crops. We have no idea where we will go if the purchaser does not come to the mandis, says farmer Nirbhair Singh, a farmer in Jalandhar grain market.Vice-Chairman of Punjab Mandi Board Vijay Kalra says, While the farm Acts are already in place, farmers in Punjab are still coming either to arhtiyas or to the APMC yards because they have no idea where to sell their crop.

Read MoreCHAND IGARH: Reacting to the Centres decision to put rural development fund (RDF) utilisation under scrutiny this year, the Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh claimed on Wednesday that it was the first step towards the end of the minimum support price (MSP) regime.The RDF due to the state would actually be Rs 1,100 crore and the decision has come as a bolt from the blue for us. Last year, Rs 1,836 crore was the RDF collected on wheat and paddy crops. The assurances that MSP will continue even after the new farm laws are enacted is only a verbal assurance to misguide farmers, said Singh, on reports of the Centre putting the RDF usage by the state government under scrutiny while finalising provisional rates of milled rice and gunny bags for the ongoing paddy season.This is no precedent of the RDF being held back from the cash credit limit (issued to the state for procuring paddy and wheat each year) and there is every reason to connect the move to the apprehensions about the intentions of BJP at the Centre over the farm Acts, he added. Deductions made by the state from the MSP and the utilisation of RDF are under scrutiny of the Union ministry of consumer affairs. The state charges 3% RDF on transactions in the grain markets during the procurement process, besides the marketing fee.

Before the 1980s, farmers used to till the remaining debris back into the soil after harvesting the crops manually. The origin of stubble burning can be traced to the advent of the Green Revolution and mechanised harvesting, which utilised the combined harvesting technique. The Green Revolution increased greatly rice and wheat production, which simultaneously increased stubble post harvest. However, the popular combined harvesting technique was not efficacious, as machines left behind one-foot-tall stalks. This prompted stubble burning as a low-cost and speedy solution available to farmers due to the limited time period of 20-25 days between harvesting one crop and sowing another.Environmental impactStubble burning is practised predominantly by farmers in north India. It releases harmful gases including nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. In recent years, this practice has created vast smoke blankets across the Indo-Gangetic Plain and numerous neighbouring States, including Delhi. This directly exposes millions of people to air pollution. As per a TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) report, in 2019 the air pollution in New Delhi and other parts of north India was 20 times higher than the safe threshold level as prescribed by the World Health Organization. Stubble burning also has a deleterious impact on soil fertility, destroys organic fertilizers and reduces ground water levels. Stubble burning during a pandemic could worsen the situation by making lungs weaker and people more susceptible to disease. It could also impact those recovering from infection.Also Read Centre promises law to check stubble burningIn 2013, stubble burning was banned by the Punjab government. In 2015, the National Green Tribunal imposed a ban on stubble burning in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and directed government to assist farmers by obtaining equipment like happy seeders and rotavator. Stubble burning is an offence under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981.Recently, in Aditya Dubey v. Union of India, the Supreme Court appointed retired apex court judge Justice Madan B. Lokur as a one-man committee to monitor and provide steps to prevent stubble burning activities in Punjab, Haryana and U.P. Haryana submitted that numerous steps are taken to curb stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, including the development of an app to detect and notify authorities about stubble burning committed in a particular field. Now the Union government has brought out an ordinance to set up a permanent commission for air quality management, which will replace the Justice Madan B. Lokur Commission.New revolutionA revolution in timely stubble removal is the need of the hour. The action plan of Punjab and Haryana appears to focus more on setting up Custom Hiring Centres which will facilitate farmers removing stubble by providing them with machinery such as the happy seeder, rotavator, paddy straw chopper, etc. on rent along with the supply of more balers. As per a study by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre, the application of happy seeders and super SMS machines can improve agricultural productivity by 10% to 15% while reducing labour costs and allowing the soil to become more fertile.Also Read Centre sets up permanent Commission to tackle air pollution in Delhi territoryThis year, the Union government is testing an innovative method, the PUSA Decomposer, developed at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa. The PUSA Decomposer is a set of four tablets made by extracting fungi strains that help the paddy straw to decompose at a much faster rate than usual, giving farmers the option to shred the straw, spray a solution containing the fungal strains, and mix it with the soil for decomposition. If methods such as this become successful, it will be a new revolution in farming.

This is despite tall claims made by the government year after year to stop farm fires. The most instances of stubble burning have been reported from Karnal district (731), which is chief minister Manohar Lal Khattars constituency .According to the Centres System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), PM2.5 levels in Delhi-NCR increased by up to 44% due to stubble burning in Haryana in October 2019. The Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change too accepted this in the Parliament in March this year.The quality of air in Haryana is already in the poor category this month and is expected to fall in the severe category with the onset of winter and increasing instances of crop residue burning in the state. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) is in the very poor category in 15 districts out of 22 at present. While Hisars air quality is in the severe category, the AQI of the remaining six districts is in the poor category.Stubble burning will increase in the coming days. Late basmati rice harvesting is yet to be completed, after which cases of stubble burning will increase in the first two weeks of November, an officer from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said.According to the state agriculture department, even though the Haryana government has been discouraging farmers from cultivating paddy, it has been sown on around 12.83 lakh hectares across Haryana. The maximum paddy cultivation has been reported in Karnal this year  around 1.7 lakh hectares.HSPCB had started monitoring stubble burning in the last week of September this year, when paddy harvesting began in Haryana. The latest data shared by HSPCB shows that 3,773 incidents of stubble burning have been recorded in the state so far this month. Most of the farm fires have been reported from Karnal (731), Kurukshetra (675), Kaithal (653), Ambala (479) and Fatehabad (304) districts. On an average, more than 100 cases have been reported daily across Haryana.Over 240 cases were reported on October 18, the highest so far on a single day this month.The Supreme Court had last year directed the Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh governments to give an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal for non-basmati produce to farmers who do not burn stubble. The apex court had also ordered the three states to bear the operational cost of hiring machines for handling the agricultural residue on behalf of marginal and small farmers.All district officials have been directed to make sure that machines are made available to farmers, especially the small and marginalised farmers, at very nominal rates. We are also working towards providing monetary incentives to them, said Amit Arya, media advisor to the CM. Arya, however, refused to comment on the fact that the maximum cases have been reported from Khattars constituency.We have reached out to farmers to make buying and hiring machines easy and affordable for them, but for farmers with small land holdings, the machines are basically useless.

(Representational)The Punjab farmer is not ploughing a lonely furrow. He is protesting, he is raising his voice  backed by a collective and well-coordinated effort. So there are voluntary donations, contribution of dry ration, arrangement of transport and de-centralised system which have kept this month-long protest going on.Although farmers have been organising protests and dharnas since mid-June, they intensified their protest since October 1 when an indefinite rail roko and dharnas at toll plazas, private petrol pumps and storage houses started. Thirty farmer unions are taking part in this protest at more than 100 places in Punjab.Many donors sitting abroad send funds to the unions with which they are attached. Donations are voluntarily made twice a year  after crop harvesting of rabi and kharif crops. For regular members, we make it mandatory to donate as per the area under agriculture and liabilities, said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda). These days paddy procurement has been done. Therefore, funds are being collected by almost every farmer organisation from regular members while the rest can do it voluntarily. Mostly farmers donate a part of the procured crop (wheat or paddy) to their village units, which sell it in mandis and the money is kept in the unions village unit account. Dry ration like wheat flour, rice and pulses are also donated by farmers on a regular basis at each dharna site. Milk is collected from the entire village before going to dharna site on a daily basis. At times vegetables are donated by some vegetable growers or we purchase them as well. Similarly, we purchase sugar, tea leaves and disposable utensils, Jagmohan said.He said, Our Muslim vegetable growers/wholesalers donated vegetables at Malerkotla as well as Sangrurs dharna spots for many days despite the fact that tomatoes and onions are going out of the common mans reach. We mostly cook pulses, roti or once in a while namkeen or meethe chawal are made. As Punjabs staple food is wheat, we need more of wheat flour. Villagers also donate ration at village gurdwaras where langar is cooked and later brought to the dharna site by sewadaars on a daily basis. Punjabs tradition of langar can never let anyone sleep hungry. People donate money at dharna sites as well. Most of these are non-farmers, Jagmohan said.BKU (Ugrahan) has 69 dharnas going on at toll plazas and petrol pumps. Every day roster is made and duties are assigned to village units near the dharna sites on a rotation basis for bringing cooked langar to dharna site along with milk. Tea is made at the site and cooked food is served to people sitting at dharna. People who sleep at dharna sites sometimes make fresh chapatis in the evening while cooked dal/ vegetable comes from village units during the day itself, said Sukhdev Singh, general secretary of BKU (Ugrahan).The Ugrahan group collects funds twice a year from village units after wheat and paddy procurement.Kisan Mazdoor Sangrash Committee (KMSC) has been organising rail roko since September 24 at select locations. President of the outfit Satnam Singh Pannu said, On a daily basis, some villagers come to dharna sites and go back by evening. Every morning, they bring fresh milk and cooked chapatis. These are kept at a common langar site being managed by kar sewaks. Milk is used for making tea. We have been using wheat procurement funds since September to pay for tents and sound system. Now paddy procurement seasons donations will be helping us in our long struggle ahead.Transport expensesVillage units of farmer unions collect funds at village levels. These funds are then used for to and fro movement of union and non-union members to dharna sites via tempos, trolleys, mini-buses and buses. Sometimes, few union members use their vehicles and later take fuel charges from the union. Men and women come in separate vehicles while youngsters come on their bikes. Village units already have funds in their accounts which are being used for transportation of villagers at dharna sites.Membership feeMembership fee of most of the unions is taken once in two years and it is nominal  Rs 20 only. Many non- members also come to these dharnas on a daily basis. BKU (Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh said before paddy harvesting started, more than 75,000 people used to come at various dharna spots on a daily basis. Now the number has come down to 50,000.Tent/ sound systemPayment for tents and sound system is made mostly on a weekly basis from the unions accounts. Union members maintain that they have not calculated the exact expenses but it must be huge. Jagmohan said, At Sangrur railway station nearly 10-11 unions had organised combined dharna for 21 days and our collective expenses at one site was around Rs 4 lakh, including all expenses. Donors are generous. As from langar point of view, Punjab is blessed with a habit of donating and the remaining expenses are managed through collections from villagers and voluntary donations.

The city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 293, which falls in the poor category.It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhis pollution and negating the effect of better ventilation.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate,201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a significantly large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India.Also Read | Farm fire share in Delhis pollution but opposition parties are in denial: Gopal RaiHigher wind speed and better ventilation index will be favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday, it said.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhis pollution was 16 per cent on Monday. It had soared to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.Stubble burning accounted for 32 per cent of Delhis PM2.5 pollution on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday.Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhis pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.According to Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 33,165 fire events this season so far, while Haryana has reported 6,034 farm fires during the period.NASAs satellite imagery also showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 18 kilometers per hour on Monday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the central governments Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the citys ventilation index  a product of mixing depth and average wind speed  was around 12,000 meter square per second on Monday  favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier during the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai targeted the BJP and the Congress on the issue of stubble burning, saying the share of farm fires in Delhis pollution has soared to 40 per cent but the opposition parties were in denial.We have been saying it again and again that stubble burning is a major reason behind severe levels of pollution in Delhi around Diwali, but the BJP and the Congress say the share of farm fires in Delhis pollution was just 4 to 6 per cent, whereas statistics show it has increased to 40 per cent, Rai told reporters. In Delhi, the administration sprayed the bio-decomposer developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, in non-Basmati rice fields to prevent stubble burning.

Speaker C.P.

We will not allow this to happen in Rajasthan. Over 95% of farmers do not get remunerative prices for their produce... Our amendments will protect them.Mr. Dhariwal said the Central laws, if enforced without any change, would also adversely affect the public distribution system (PDS), as the commodities like rice and wheat would not be available for procurement.The Central Acts do not even mention MSP. Do they want the corporates to set up their shops in front of mandis and deceive the farmers? he asked.Energy Minister B.D. Kalla, who replied to the debate on the Bill for amending the Essential Commodities Act, said the State amendments would stop monopolistic practices in the market and provide relief to consumers buying agricultural produce. He said the Bill would cover potato, onion, grains, pulses, oilseeds and edible oils.While Agriculture Minister Lal Chand Kataria, initiating the debate, said the Central laws would ultimately abolish Krishi Upaj Mandis and turn the farmer into labourers on their own land, senior BJP MLA Rajendra Rathore said the Congress itself had earlier advocated the creation of a free market for farmers.Leader of Opposition Mr. Kataria said the Central laws had been enacted after taking into account recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, which talked about one nation, one market as well as the contract farming and abolition of indirect mandi taxes. He said the Congress leaders in the State wanted to make their leaders in New Delhi happy by bringing the Bills.The Bills have sought to restore agricultural safeguards in the State through the regulatory framework of the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961, in order to secure the livelihood of farmers, farm labourers and others engaged in agriculture and related activities. One of the Bills has provided for imprisonment of three to seven years along with the fine of 5 lakh for harassment of farmers.No farming agreement for the sale or purchase of a crop will be valid unless the price paid for the agricultural produce is equal to, or greater than, the prevailing MSP announced by the Central government, according to the Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance Bill.The Bill seeking to amend the Essential Commodities Act has proposed to protect the consumers from hoarding and black-marketing of agricultural produce and secure the interests of farmers. Unlike the Central Act which had removed the ceiling on the stock of farm commodities, it has sought to give powers to the State government to regulate the production, supply and distribution and impose stock limits under extraordinary circumstances.The State government has claimed that it can amend the Central Acts in exercise of its powers vested under Article 254(2) of the Constitution and affirmed that agriculture, land and markets were the primary legislative domain of the State falling under Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.Outside the Assembly, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has questioned the Centres intent behind the enactment of the controversial laws and said the Bills had been tabled in the Parliament without any discussion with the State governments and other stakeholders.

2020-11-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-lack-assured-price-basmati-holds-back-shelling-industry-full-potential-6940395/,Punjab: Lack of assured price for Basmati holds back its shelling industry from blossoming to full potential,"Punjab produces around 25-26 lakh tonnes (2.5 to 2.6 million tonnes) of Basmati annually, which is around 34 per cent of the total production of the country.Punjabs basmati rice shelling industry  which has not only been meeting around 50 per cent of domestic needs of the premium grain, but also contributing 40-50 per cent of the total export of Basmati to various countries  has been heavily dependent on other states to make itself viable, having the capacity to mill Basmati worth Rs 25,000 crore.Bamati is a long grain aromatic rice grown in the specific geographical area of seven states of the country including Punjab, Haryana, some districts of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh (Western UP), Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Punjab produces around 25-26 lakh tonnes (2.5 to 2.6 million tonnes) of Basmati annually, which is around 34 per cent of the total production of the country. In 2019-20, around 7.5 million tonnes (75 lakh tonnes) Basmati was produced in the country.Punjab has a huge potential of increasing Basmati area because it usually covers 27-28 lakh hectares acreage under rice including around 5.50-6.50 lakh hectares under Basmati and remaining under paddy (parmal rice). The state can easily increase this area to double, which is good for its ground water, the shelling industry and the environment.Of the total production of Basmati, 58 to 59 per cent (4.54 million tonnes) is exported annually and remaining nearly 41% (3 million tonnes) is consumed in the country.To meet the 50 per cent domestic need and around 40-50 pet cent of the total export, Punjab needs at least 33-37 lakh tonnes (3.3-3.7 million tonnes) Basmati while Punjab is producing 7 to 11 lakh tonnes less Basmati against its total supply in the export and domestic markets. For these 7 to 11 lakh tonnes Basmati, it has to depend on UP, Uttarakhand and Delhis traders, who purchase at Narela market, which is Asias biggest rice and wheat mandi, from traders and farmers of UP, Haryana and Uttarakhand. The Basmati of these states  UP, Delhi and Haryana, and Uttarakhand  falls under the GI tag and has the same demand in the international market as Punjabs Basmati.We have around 100 Basmati shelling units in Punjab, which have the capacity of milling over Rs 20,000 crore of Basmati, but are milling Basmati around Rs 15,000-16,000 crore so as to make the industry viable, said Ashok Sethi, a leading Basmati exporter and director, Punjab Basmati Rice Exporter Association.Another leading exporter said, We are getting around Rs 8,000-9,000 crore Basmati from Punjab and for the remaining we are dependent on other GI tag areas. While Punjab has huge potential to grow as per the need of the Basmati shelling industry as around 27-28 lakh hectares area is under rice here, only 6 to 6.50 lakh hectares is dedicated under Basmati while this area can be doubled easily if government supports the Basmati growers.According to Agricultural and Processed food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under Ministry of Commerce and Industry Government of India, in 2019, around 19.50 lakh hectares was under Basmati across seven GI states including maximum under Punjab (6.29 lakh hectares) and Haryana (8.43 lakh hectares), around 5 lakh hectares in UP and remaining less than one lakh hectares in four other GI states.The biggest rice shelling industry is located either in Punjab or in Haryana. Punjabs farmers are ready to enhance the area under Basmati if they get assured price like paddy, said Block Agricultural Officer Pathankot Dr Amrik Singh, adding that it is one of the best alternatives for Punjabs farmers. A senior official at APEDA said that India is exporting Basmati to over 100 countries and this export can be increased further if a little more focus and support is provided to both farmers and exporters of the country.Sethi said that in 2019, a total 44.54 lakh tonnes of Basmati worth Rs 34,000 crore was exported.

The ministrys official projections show the governments total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20, an increase of 18%.To be sure, production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne, slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20, according to an official forecast.Also read | Officers will visit villages to buy entire paddy: KCR messages farmersThe ministry has expanded its procurement operations, which refers to the governments buying of farm produce at assured prices, for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers, against last years 10.2 million.The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show.According to the ministrys data, the government has bought, till November 4, over 22.4 million tonne of paddy, which is already 20.18% higher than the 18.6 million tonne procured during the corresponding period last year. Of the total purchases, Punjabs share so far has been the highest at 15.8 million tonne, which is 70.52% of the total quantity procured.Farmers in Punjab are protesting against the reforms that allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce, permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. A crucial change is that traders, agribusinesses and supermarkets can buy produce from any market, rather than only in notified markets where they are licenced to operate. The government enacted three laws on September 24 to usher in these changes.The laws have angered farmers, particularly in Punjab, who fear the reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers growers an assured price, leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, on several occasions, that the three laws have no bearing on the current system of procurement at assured prices, which will continue.To placate farmers, the governments food buying agencies have launched large buying operations in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.Year-on-year comparisons show higher purchases. For instance, the government, till November 1, purchased 12.9 million tonne paddy in Punjab, which is 37% higher than the quantity procured during the corresponding period last year (9.4 million tonne).In Uttar Pradesh, paddy procurement till November 1, was higher by 413% at 390,920 tonne, against 76,254 tonne during the same period last year.The food ministry has also started procuring rice for the first time from Uttarakhand and so far, 405,174 tonne have been purchased.Till November 4, the paddy purchases have benefited nearly 1.8 million farmers, who have been paid MSP of Rs42,422.49 crore since procurement of crops began on September 27.The higher procurement will likely overshoot the governments storage capacity and make managing stocks difficult unless the government offloads more as food aid to the poor, said analyst Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.From April to November 2020, the government has made an additional offering of free food under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), launched due to Covid-19. This has freed up storage capacities of bulging state-held granaries and made way for higher paddy procurement.The total allocation under the PMGKY is 32.1 million tonne. This included 21.4 million tonne of rice and 10.6 million tonne of wheat. As on September 1, total federally held food stocks stood at 77.3 million tonne, up from 71.2 million tonnes on the same date last year.The Centre has fixed an MSP for the so-called common variety paddy at Rs1,868 per quintal and for the A grade variety at Rs1,888 per quintal for the current year. The government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country for the 2020-21 kharif season.","indiaupdated: nov 05, 2020, 22:24 istthe union government is on course to buy a record quantity of paddy this year with a sharply higher share of punjab to blunt a politically-challenging farmers agitation against a set of laws enacted to liberalise the farm sector, projections of the food ministry show.paddy is the main summer staple that drives the incomes of cultivators in states such as punjab. the ministrys official projections show the governments total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20, an increase of 18%.to be sure, production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne, slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20, according to an official forecast.also read | officers will visit villages to buy entire paddy: kcr messages farmersthe ministry has expanded its procurement operations, which refers to the governments buying of farm produce at assured prices, for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers, against last years 10.2 million.the government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show.according to the ministrys data, the government has bought, till november 4, over 22.4 million tonne of paddy, which is already 20.18% higher than the 18.6 million tonne procured during the corresponding period last year. of the total purchases, punjabs share so far has been the highest at 15.8 million tonne, which is 70.52% of the total quantity procured.farmers in punjab are protesting against the reforms that allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce, permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. a crucial change is that traders, agribusinesses and supermarkets can buy produce from any market, rather than only in notified markets where they are licenced to operate. the government enacted three laws on september 24 to usher in these changes.the laws have angered farmers, particularly in punjab, who fear the reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (msp) system, which offers growers an assured price, leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.prime minister narendra modi has said, on several occasions, that the three laws have no bearing on the current system of procurement at assured prices, which will continue.to placate farmers, the governments food buying agencies have launched large buying operations in punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, tamil nadu, chandigarh, jammu & kashmir, kerala, gujarat and andhra pradesh.year-on-year comparisons show higher purchases. for instance, the government, till november 1, purchased 12.9 million tonne paddy in punjab, which is 37% higher than the quantity procured during the corresponding period last year (9.4 million tonne).in uttar pradesh, paddy procurement till november 1, was higher by 413% at 390,920 tonne, against 76,254 tonne during the same period last year.the food ministry has also started procuring rice for the first time from uttarakhand and so far, 405,174 tonne have been purchased.till november 4, the paddy purchases have benefited nearly 1.8 million farmers, who have been paid msp of rs42,422.49 crore since procurement of crops began on september 27.the higher procurement will likely overshoot the governments storage capacity and make managing stocks difficult unless the government offloads more as food aid to the poor, said analyst abhishek agrawal of comtrade, a commodities trading firm.from april to november 2020, the government has made an additional offering of free food under the pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana (pmgky), launched due to covid-19. this has freed up storage capacities of bulging state-held granaries and made way for higher paddy procurement.the total allocation under the pmgky is 32.1 million tonne. this included 21.4 million tonne of rice and 10.6 million tonne of wheat. as on september 1, total federally held food stocks stood at 77.3 million tonne, up from 71.2 million tonnes on the same date last year.the centre has fixed an msp for the so-called common variety paddy at rs1,868 per quintal and for the a grade variety at rs1,888 per quintal for the current year. the government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country for the 2020-21 kharif season."

We spoke to kids about life in the pandemicmore-lifestyleUpdated: Nov 06, 2020, 20:16 ISTTheyre worried; they miss the world. Yet, the growing hasnt stopped. And the world is still full of wonder. Yet, just how much of 2020 theyve really been able to bear. School, that half day of chatter, learning, unlearning and finding your place among your peers, has shrunk to a tinny-voiced screen. Playground friendships have unravelled. There are no scraped knees this year. No falling off bicycles, dusting yourself off and getting back on. No everyday adventures in the big bad world. No escape from the grown-ups.Its no wonder, then, that when we asked kids across India to tell us what they liked and what they missed most during this pandemic, the responses were as wide-ranging and they were heartbreaking.Of course theyre missing normalcy: I miss the rush and sound of horns of Hyderabad says one child. Another in Delhi misses Tuesday spring rolls at the school canteen.The child of a toddy tapper in Kerala is concerned about the familys finances. And one child in rural West Bengal is glad for afternoons because it means quiet time to paint.Indias children are missing school, teachers, a separated parent, a friend. But most of all, theyre missing the freedom to walk a few steps further, stay out half an hour longer, test newfound strengths and new autonomies upon the world beyond their home.Theyve lost one summer alreadyno cousins, no eating raw mangoes straight from the tree. Now, a very different festive season is here. As one child put it: My biggest worry is, when will the disease go away and when will I be able to go to school again?How will Indias children remember 2020?

Mumbai, 2020.IM WORKING ON AN ALBUMRia Chawda, 16; MumbaiJB Petit High School for GirlsThe lockdown has been rather hectic for me. Online schooling started a couple of weeks ago, and Ive had to adjust to this new way of learning. Its been tough, staring at the screen for eight hours a day. Having said that, it hasnt been all bad. The fact that I can eat and sleep at any time during the day (including during school) has been great.During the lockdown, I did not learn a new skill but instead tried to get better at the things I love. I love music and spent a lot of time on my guitar and at my keyboard. I worked on my song-writing and am trying to produce stuff on my laptop. I should have a full album soon.Ive also been working on my portfolio for university liberal arts and music. And Ive been reading a lot.I do miss the outdoors; its been nine months since I played badminton and the courts havent reopened yet, Chawda says.I do miss the outdoors; its been nine months since I played badminton and the courts havent reopened yet. I miss going to CCI [Cricket Club of India]; it used to be like a second home. And I miss human interaction. Of course I chat with my friends, but its not the same as being with them.My parents wouldnt let me meet people initially, so its been a relief being able to finally hang out with my best friends  Karthika and Zara  over the last few weeks. We still cant have sleepovers or go out for dinner as we used to. Its sad that we cant do that anymore.Im nervous about returning to school after all this. I wonder what school life is going to be like. Apart from my best friends, I havent been able to keep in touch with any other people. I feel like I have drifted out of most of my social circle, and now if I called them, it would be weird and awkward.Students Life in Lockdown. Darsh Gupta, Delhi; 2020.IM FINALLY READING THE HARRY POTTER BOOKSDarsh Gupta, 9; New DelhiSt Thomas SchoolI have discovered that I like art. I draw images of birds and little boats. I am drawn to boats because they dont pollute, and I dont like pollution. I found the air to be a little cleaner to breathe during the lockdown. My two cousins and I have spent a lot of time racing each other to the terrace and playing with ice and water. My older brother Sparsh, 14, taught me some coding. Together we programmed a circuit to make a small circle. I also got my parents to play Ludo with me and my grandparents to play snakes and ladders with us. Ive also upped my skating skills on the terrace.Its sad that I cant hang out with my friends. I used to love cycling around the colony with them. A bunch of us would also play kho-kho and cricket together. Now we cantIm worried about school not starting up again next year, Gupta says.Im at least glad I get to meet some of my friends over our online classes. Were allowed a few minutes of chatter before the teaching starts.I am worried about school not starting up again next year. Apart from meeting my friends and teachers, I really miss the Tuesday special spring rolls in the canteen. What I dont miss is the rock hard ice cream that they serve every day in summer. (Just to clarify, I love ice-cream otherwise.)What I did get to do was read Harry Potter (my brother finally agreed to let me have his set). I am now on book six. I am also reading the Geronimo Stilton series  its the adventures of a mouse whos scared of everything.Overall, I have found the lockdown has not been very good and I worry about when we will get to go to school again. But I am happy for all the people around me, with whom Ive got to spend so much time.Though we have to sacrifice many things, the background is serene and silent, says Sanal. ( Photo by Vivek R Nair )I NEVER LIKE TO CURSE A SITUATIONPranav Sanal, 14; Thiruvananthapuram, KeralaKaraikkakam government schoolI dont usually like hustle and bustle. Though we have to sacrifice many things, the background is serene and silent these days. The routine of the earlier life is missing. My father and mother [a toddy tapper and a part-time nursery teacher] have not had much work due to the pandemic, so we have stopped buying my pencils and paper. But I have turned to charcoal.I miss my school, friends and my favourite game, cricket. But it seems we have to live with the evil for some time and I never like to curse a situation. We have to readjust our life clock to each situation. The lockdown has affected the poor and daily-wage earners badly. When my father talks about tomorrow I also become little nervous, but life has to go on.Untitled by Sidrat ul Muntaha. Pulwama, Kashmir; 2020.WE TALK A LOT MORE NOWSidrat ul Muntaha, 14; Pulwama, KashmirHamdard Grammar SchoolMy life changed completely during the pandemic. Earlier everybody was busy. We were busy with school and our parents with their work. Now we converse a lot with each other. Our parents discuss all family matters with me and my brother. Now we are also part of the discussions. My father even talked to me about his new business partnership.But the team work of school is gone. There is a barrier between teachers and students, which is the screen. There are no practicals, no experiments.I miss that feeling of summer in a different state. Last year we went to Rajasthan, Sidrat ul Muntaha says.We used to visit new places every year. This year we couldnt do that. I miss that feeling of summer in a different state. Last year we went to Rajasthan!I used to come home and write about the places I had seen. This year I have stopped writing. I would write poems as well but this year I could only write a poem on Covid, nothing else.I loved visiting relatives. Now I am scared of visiting them.Janata Curfew by Zayan Rahman. Bhojpur, Bihar; 2020.I WANT MY DAD TO COME HOMEZayan Rahman, 9; Bhojpur, BiharJean Paul Public SchoolI have learnt the importance of cleanliness and of washing hands. Though washing hands is an old practice, I realised that it should be done regularly. Also, as I was not allowed to eat food from outside. I learnt to avoid junk food and enjoy home-cooked food. But the best part has been spending time with my mother and other family members. With no school, we spent hours together. It made me learn the value of family and togetherness.The best part has been spending time with my mother and other family members. I wish my father wasnt stuck in Dubai, Rahman says.The saddest thing is that I have not been able to meet my father since March. He is working in Dubai and he has got stuck there. I miss my father a lot and hope the things get normal so that my father will be able to get back home.I also miss my school, my class friends and the time spent with them at the school grounds. Though there is no lockdown in Bihar, my family follows the Covid-19 guidelines strictly and I am not allowed to go outside to play. Earlier we used to visit public parks or to the zoo or go to a mall on weekends.Stop Covid-19 by Asra Irsan. Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh; 2020.I WISH I COULD GO TO THE PARKAsra Irsan, 12; Lucknow, Uttar PradeshCity Convent SchoolThe pandemic gave me time to develop a hobby. I started learning to cook. It was something I wanted to do for the longest time. Now I to try cook something (mostly snacks) every evening when my parents sit for a cup of tea. I learned to bake a cake, which I am proud of. I am trying to bake cookies. I am following a new routine where I get up early for my online classes. With no tutorial classes, I have also learned to manage my studies on my own. I have started to help my mother in chores. This was not possible earlier because I had too much homework.Visiting the village used to be a lot of fun but it was not possible this year. Now I speak with my uncles and cousins over video call, says Israni.The thing I miss the most is going out to parks in the city. My father used to take us once every week. I also miss playing with my friends every day. Now we meet and play some games online but they are not that fun.I miss my uncles, who live in a village outside the city. We used to visit them every summer. I love playing in the fields with my cousins and plucking raw mangoes from the trees and eating them with salt while sitting beside the water pump. Visiting the village used to be a lot of fun but it was not possible this year. Now I speak with my uncles and cousins over video call.Fight Against Coronavirus by Harfateh Singh.

In the evenings, I love to play with my friends in the park. Earlier, online classes seemed a little boring, but now teachers have made them more lively and interesting. Also, I have started playing online games on my mothers mobile phone, which is becoming one of the best things in the day for me. During this pandemic, I learnt to make sandwiches and Maggi and now have an interest in cooking also.I am worried about school. How will it be to be in school, with friends, going and coming every day? Harfateh Singh says. ( Gurminder Singh / HT Photo )Before the pandemic, I used to attend so many birthday parties of my friends but for the past seven months, I have not attended any, which I am missing a lot. I also love to visit my dearest aunt, who lives in Solan [Himachal Pradesh]. Being a hill station, time spent there has always been memorable for me, but we have not visited the place since the lockdown. I also badly miss my friends and teachers, especially the fun we friends would have during recess time of school. I am really worried about the schools reopening when we are still not clear about the virus. How will it be to be in school, with friends, going and coming every day? I am also missing my swimming classes.Wear A Mask by Mrigav Thakuria. Kamrup, Assam; 2020.I MISS SCHOOL, AND I DONTMrigav Thakuria, 15; Kamrup, AssamSatpakhali High SchoolThe Covid-19 pandemic and the countrywide lockdown was something none of us expected or hoped to experience. But despite the hardships, there were some positives. One good thing was that there was respite from school. Most students loved that, at least initially. The lockdown brought good news for the environment as well since factories were shut for weeks and it helped improve air quality. The other thing I noticed was that there was reduction in consumption of intoxicants among people due to inability to procure them or move around. Use of masks also reduced the spread of other diseases commonly seen during summer months. Visits by doctors were common during summer, but this year that was not the case as few people suffered from severe fever and other seasonal diseases.Since I am appearing for my Class 10 board exams next year, attending physical classes where we can interact more closely with our teachers and get our doubts clarified I miss that a lot, Thakuria says.The pandemic and the initial lockdown brought lot of suffering for many. Thousands of people from Assam, mainly villagers, who had gone to other states for work, were stranded for weeks and had a very tough time getting back. Our classes were shut for weeks and finally they resumed only online. But many students in villages had a tough time as they either didnt have mobile phones or there was no proper internet network. I miss going to school, attending classes and interacting with my friends. Since I am appearing for my Class 10 board exams next year, attending physical classes where we can interact more closely with our teachers and get our doubts clarified I miss that a lot.Life in the Pandemic by Mahitha Allani.

In this pandemic situation, we got that, but I never imagined so many months of holidays. The first two months of lockdown were a lot of joy and happiness in my home. Later on it became so boring. I was a bit irritated but I like to stay home with mom and my brother.I like the time we spend together, playing games, watching movies, cooking and, of course, studying. I did not stop my hobbies due to this pandemic, I continued my Carnatic music classes. I love to sing.When the online classes started, I had a lot of anxiety about them. But now I think this situation is not bad as it gives students a chance to self-study and prepare without other disturbances, Allani says,When the online classes started, I had a lot of anxiety about them.

I also like doing tasks which my school teachers sometimes send on my fathers mobile . I play with my friends in the morning and again in the afternoon. I mainly prefer to draw landscapes and nature. As I live in a village I get many things to see such as a pond, green rice fields and a river. I have my own drawing book and colour pencils. Afternoon is the best time because everyone sleeps after lunch. I sit in the courtyard and draw. There is no disturbance at that time and I can draw on my own.Before the pandemic we used to go to my grandfathers house, which is a two or three hours journey by boats and rickshaw. I have not been there for many months. I miss them, Mondol says.I miss going to school, my school friends and going out with my parents. This year I missed the Durga Puja very much. Even though the village Durga Puja was held, the gathering was not there and the festivity was missing. We had to wear masks. Before the pandemic we used to go to my grandfathers house, which is a two or three hours journey by boats and rickshaw. I have not been there for many months. I miss them. My father said that we will go there very soon. My biggest worry is, when will the disease go away and when will I be able to go to school again?Division of Life by Prashant Dhakad.

I never took care of hygiene but now its my biggest worry that I cant consume street food due to the spread of Covid-19.I am missing my cousin Anshul, who lives in Bhopal and used to visit Bareli frequently. Due to the pandemic his fathers financial condition got affected and his visits to the village and to Bareli have almost stopped.

I had time to learn to play the harmonium and pick up gatka, which is an Indian martial art associated with the Sikhs. I helped serve food to the poor people and migrants who were walking miles to reach their home, and I understood why my teacher and parents say that serving people is serving God and humanity. I got a chance to spend more time with my family, which was another thing I liked about the lockdown and the government guidelines.The pandemic is a challenge for everybody but it brought a few good things into my life.

2020-11-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/agriculture-gdp-growth-economy-7055240/,Spot the seeds of growth,"Clearly, agriculture, which contributes only 15-16 per cent of GDP, cannot overturn contraction in other sectors, but along with the rural sector, it could jump-start the economy, if we fixed its ills and transformed it. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)In the first quarter of this financial year, Indias GDP contracted by 23.9 per cent but agriculture grew by 3.4 per cent. Can agriculture make up for degrowth elsewhere? And can it do better than 3.4 per cent? To the first question, I would say  yes, up to a point; to the second  definitely.Clearly, agriculture, which contributes only 15-16 per cent of GDP, cannot overturn contraction in other sectors, but along with the rural sector, it could jump-start the economy, if we fixed its ills and transformed it.To begin with, we must reduce our preoccupation with prices and markets to first ensure that more farmers produce enough surplus to gain from higher prices and expanded markets. Despite green shoots, agriculture is ailing. Only 44 per cent of irrigable area is irrigated. Groundwater is fast depleting, soils are degraded, extension services barely function and climate change is speeding up.Consider water, the key to higher yields. Almost 90 per cent of Indias groundwater goes into irrigation and is grossly over-extracted. In Punjab, water tables have been falling by over 2.3 ft/year since 2000, propelled by free electricity and no meters (only West Bengal meters groundwater use). By 2030, 65 per cent of Indias blocks will be over-extracting groundwater (World Bank).Opinion | Yoginder K Alagh writes: Farm bills can achieve a lot, but in a crisis year government should exercise cautionMoreover, 86 per cent of our farmers cultivate two ha or less, often in fragments; 75-80 per cent borrow credit informally; 70 per cent provide only 4-5 per cent of marketed surplus in wheat and rice, even in surplus states; barely 6-12 per cent sell in mandis, and few gain from MSPs. Farm incomes are low and erratic. Millions have fallen into extreme poverty with COVID-19. In its current state, agriculture cannot lubricate our growth, let alone engine it.However, agriculture can do hugely better if we change the way we farm; focus more on allied sectors  livestock, fisheries and forests  and build strong growth links with the non-farm rural economy which, along with agriculture, contributes some 46 per cent of NDP.How do we change the way we farm? First, remodel irrigation by expanding rainwater harvesting (for both surface water and recharging groundwater); promoting micro-irrigation for efficient water use; and regulating groundwater extraction. Between 1999 and 2009, Gujarats agriculture grew at 9.6 per cent, attributed mainly to rainwater harvesting and BT cotton (T Shah et al, EPW). In 10-15 years, Gujarat built 0.5 million micro-structures: Check dams, bunds, etc. MGNREGA could be put to similar use in other states.On micro-irrigation, again, a 2014 government study for 13 states found it significantly reduced water and fertiliser use, while raising wheat yields by 25 per cent, and vegetable yields by 52 per cent. However, only 10 per cent of Indias cropland has micro-irrigation. Regulated irrigation expansion will increase yields, cropping intensity and high-value crops.Second, agroecological farming can save costs, employ more labour and rejuvenate soils. A survey of 286 experiments in sustainable farming across 57 countries found a mean yield increase of 79 per cent (J Pretty et al, 2006). Moving from cereals to multiple products, including poultry, fruits and vegetables, will also fit our changing dietary patterns.Opinion | K K Ragesh writes: Rules, precedent were ignored to push through anti-farmer Bills in Rajya SabhaThird, we need more research into heat-resistant crops and better extension. A study in Science (366, 2019) reported that agricultural information delivered via cell-phones increased yields by 4 per cent and the odds of adopting recommended inputs by 22 per cent, across several countries, including India.Fourth, and most essential, is institutional change. Our farms are too small for tapping scale economies or effectively exploiting markets. What we need is smallholders pooling resources and farming cooperatively in small groups. People often say: But cooperative farming failed in the 1960s. They forget that we misguidedly pushed large and small farmers into one cooperative. Today we know better. Cooperation works if groups are small, relatively homogenous, constituted by friends and neighbours, cemented by trust.Kerala is an obvious success story. It has 68,000 all-women group farms with 4-10 women jointly leasing land, pooling labour, sharing costs and returns. My in-depth research on a sample of group and individual farms in two districts showed that groups had 1.8 times the annual value of output/ha and five times the net returns/farm relative to individual family farms (95 per cent male-managed). Mean net return/group farm was Rs 1.2 lakh, thrice the national average of Rs 37,000/farm that year. Groups also enabled women to deliver on banana contracts. Notably, 87 per cent of the 50,000 groups cultivating under COVID survived economically, including vegetable farmers, whereas most individual vegetable farmers lost out due to lack of harvest labour and market outlets.Is group farming specific to Kerala? No. We have emerging examples in Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat and Telangana. In Bihar and Bengal, farmers have pooled their land into contiguous plots, and use electric pumps for drip irrigation, which was not possible with scattered plots and few power sources. These smallholder collectives also cooperate for input purchase and farm operations. Many have doubled their wheat and rice yields. And they, as also those in Gujarat, report being more food secure during the pandemic than their smallholder neighbours farming alone. Notably, these are not the Farmer Producers Organisations that market together but cultivate separately. The groups I mention do joint production and have adapted the SHG model. Many of Indias six million SHGs could run group enterprises.Opinion | Ashok Gulati writes: On farm bills, government must get its act together, but Opposition is misguidedFifth, livestock, fisheries and forests, which account for 26 per cent, 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent of GVP from agriculture, have huge underused potential. Livestock is much discussed, but what about fisheries? India is the worlds second-largest producer of aquaculture fish and employs 13.5 million people, 32 per cent being women (FAO). In 2017-18, our fisheries grew at 11.9 per cent.Similarly with forests. They provide an estimated 47 per cent of Indias GDP of the poor (TEEB). Since 1990, when we launched joint forest management with community cooperation, forest cover has risen to 21.5 per cent of geo-area. Our target is 33 per cent. Forest protection and plantation, biodiversity restoration and eco-tourism can create millions of jobs.Finally, we must strengthen farm and rural non-farm linkages: 61 per cent of rural incomes come from non-farm activities. A vast under-tapped potential lies in agro-processing (rural families purchase 80 per cent of the food they eat); machine tools and agro-machinery (consider Ludhiana in the 1980s); farm tourism; and health and education services. In turn, this will boost aggregate demand. Expenditure elasticities calculated by Maitreesh Ghatak et al using CMIE data indicate that a rise in incomes of the bottom 50 per cent of rural households would raise demand for many local products.Transforming agriculture and its allied sectors and creating synergy with the non-farm rural economy would energise growth and invigorate rural communities. This would also help more rural youth find local jobs, rather than be forced to live as aliens in inhospitable cities.This article first appeared in the print edition on November 17, 2020 under the title Spot the seeds of growth.

The total allocation under the PMGKY is 32.1 million tonnes. This included 21.4 million tonnes of rice and 10.6 million tonnes of wheat.

Amarinder Singh on Saturday. (Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)THE nearly two-month-long train blockade in Punjab looks set to end, after farmer unions said they would allow movement of both passenger and goods trains starting Monday evening, following a meeting with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday. However, they said they were suspending their agitation for only 15 days, and would resume if the Centre did not meet their representatives regarding the new farm laws.A government statement said the farmers had acceded to the CMs appeal to allow both passenger and goods trains. The farmer leaders said they would continue with their plans to lay siege to Delhi on November 26-27.Arun Kumar, the Director General of the Railway Protection Force, told The Sunday Express, We are in touch with the state government. We are making arrangements to run trains from Monday. If we get the assurance that everything will be fine, we are ready to run (trains).A Railway Ministry spokesperson said they had received a communication from Punjab that tracks are now clear for train operations. The Railways will take steps towards restoration of train services at the earliest after undertaking the necessary maintenance checks and completing other protocols.Announcing the decision to allow all trains, Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal urged political parties in Punjab to support them in their fight against the farm laws, and not let the issue be politicised.Thanking the farmers, Amarinder Singh said he would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on their behalf. Let us together put pressure on the Centre to see our point of view and understand how these laws would ruin Punjab, he said, asserting that he was with the farmers in their fight. We all have farmer blood in our veins.Darshan Pal, state president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, who was at the meeting with the CM, said, We have only lifted the rail blockade. The rest of the agitation will continue.He said it would take time for them to get the message across to farmers organisations sitting in the precincts of railway stations across the state, and for the latter to collect their belongings and leave, which is why they had given Monday evening as the time to the government.The farmers have been claiming that they have not blocked any tracks, and that they would allow only goods trains till their demands regarding farm laws were met. The Centre, however, maintained that it wouldnt clear goods trains if passenger trains werent allowed as well. The farmers saw the Centres stand, which has hindered the supply of essential supplies to Punjab and hit its industries, as a tactic to force their hand.The rail roko movement against the three Central farm laws was started by the farmers on September 24. After talks with the state government, they had lifted the blockade for goods trains on October 21. A state government team including senior ministers and later officers had failed so far in getting them to agree to passenger trains.The Punjab government got the farmers to relent by urging them that the continuing blockade was leading to rising resentment among the public. All the thermal plants in the state have been forced shut as they have run out of coal, while the farmers themselves are facing a severe shortage of fertilisers, especially urea, which is threatening their wheat crop. The industry, just emerging from the Covid setback, is estimated to have suffered losses to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore in this two-month period, with Amarinder Singh claiming on Saturday that six lakh migrant workers had left due to units shutting down. Over 13,500 containers carrying export materials alone are stranded at Dhandari Dry Port in Ludhiana.The blockade has also impacted the supply of 40 lakh metric tonnes of parboiled rice from Punjab to Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh for PDS distribution, with Punjabs silos full with foodgrains.Singh said the rail blockade was also impacting urgent Army supplies to the Valley and Leh-Ladakh.Darshan Pal said they didnt want to inconvenience anyone, and were hence conceding on the issue of trains while continuing their agitation. For now, we have the support of the common people. But industrialists are suffering due to disruption in the supply of raw material, labourers are losing jobs.At least one farmer organisation, the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee that is protesting on the Amritsar-Delhi tracks near Jandiala Guru, Amritsar, however, said it would not backtrack. We will not let any passenger trains resume, said Sawarn Pandher, the leader of the committee that had earlier too boycotted meetings with Central ministers and officers.Amarinder Singh promised to look into other demands of farmers as well, including relating to sugarcane price hike and clearance of dues, as well as withdrawal of FIRs registered in stubble burning cases.Welcoming the decision by the farmers, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar exhorted all parties to work together in their interest and that of the state. We will not allow Punjab to burn, we will not allow the BJP to divide us on rural-urban or religious lines, he said.Since the Punjab deadlock began, 2,352 passenger trains have been either cancelled or diverted, while 3,850 freight trains could not be loaded and 230 loaded freight trains remain stranded outside the state. The total loss to the Railways since September 24 is estimated at Rs 2,220 crore.The high cost of a blockadeThe two-month-long rail blockade has meant all the thermal plants in the state have been forced shut due to the lack of coal, shortage of fertilisers even as silos overflow with grains, Rs 30,000 crore loss to the Covid-hit Punjab industry, Rs 2,200 crore loss to the Railways, as well as an impact on Army supplies.

Read MoreCHANDIGARH: Justifying Punjab s changes to the APMC Act in the wake of the controversy over Centres new farm laws, state chief principal secretary to chief minister Suresh Kumar said the state laws came with caveats for the private buyers.With the focus on the agriculture sector, Kumar also sought to defend Punjabs power subsidy worth Rs 8,000 crore to the farmers, claiming that it goes to maintain food prices affordable.One of the demands of the farmers is that the amendments done by Punjab to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in 2017 should also be repealed. The amendments included allowing private market, allowing digital marketing, facilitating access to distant markets through e-NAM and creating commodity exchange, he said while speaking at Business and Policy Dialogue organised by the Indian School of Business (ISB).Punjab was one of the few states that did this with vetting by the Centre to facilitate alternate marketing options. These operations were started in 28 of the principal market yards in the state. The ITC buys 1 million of tonnes of rice, besides over 2.5 million tonnes of wheat is exported through digital trading, chill and kinnow are sold using electronic connections, he added.But even though ITC and Pepsi have private markets, Punjab had added a caveat there. The difference in the legislation of 2017 and the 2020 laws is that even the private markets are fully regulated under Punjabs Act. They (private buyers) have to comply with the transaction recording system with stocking and warehousing norms. We had finalised our rules and they also had to pay the mandi taxes. Globalisation does not mean that the state revenue has to be compromised. In GST, 5% of purchase tax has been withdrawn from Punjab, which is about Rs 5,000 crore and now 6% will go with the new laws (Rs 4,800 crore). The states capacity to raise revenue for development has to be maintainedDoubts about contract farmingPunjab already has Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013. It is under my signature as I was the agriculture production commissioner at that time. After that I was the chief settlement commissioner and there was not even a single contractrelated case registered in the office and even till today no case is registered. The new Contract Farming Act is a shade improvement as it has nothing to do with the land and whatever is grown as growing as per the conditions of the buyer, he said.The apprehension of the farmers is that they wont get contracted price paid if the market is down. Farmers want the minimum price paid to them. Punjab laws were based on land leasing. However, even the Central laws have a catch. The farmers say that the land is not leased but there is a recovery dispute on remuneration, it will be recovered as arrears of land revenue. The matter will be resolved under Punjab Land Revenue Act. If a recovery suit comes, the collector has the power to attach the land. If a big company has a dispute, they will bring in a whole battery of lawyers. The farmers are not foolish and understand this. They want the land attachment aspect removed, he said.Pb spends 10% on farm subsidiesDo the farming subsidies really benefit the farmers? The farmer gets the MSP based on the actual cost, so there is no net benefit to the farmer because of the subsidy. The farmer is given cheaper insecticide, fertilisers because as a country we want to keep the prices of food affordable. It is actually a subsidy to the consumer and not the farmer, he added.Rs 7,000 crore Punjab is paying by way of free electricity to the farmers, water is also free. This is not even counted by the Centre. The state is spending Rs 8,000 crore every year, which is 10% of the states budget. People keep asking so much of subsidy but farmers are still poor, Kumar said.There is the system of markets of faith in practice without the Punjab Tenancy Act. There are no disputes and the culture has worked well by leasing to known people.Not all is lostAll is not lost with the farm laws and this is what I keep repeating in my meetings with my colleagues. The only thing is that we need to engage with the farmers to get to know what their apprehensions are and try and resolve them, said Kumar in reply to a question.If you read the language of the Food Security Act, it says that the Centre shall procure food for the public distribution system through the state and central agencies. We are only saying just as that the foodgrains will be procured at a specified price and that assures the farmers the minimum support price (MSP), he said.","with focus on the agriculture sector, kumar also sought to defend punjabs power subsidy worth rs 7,000 crore ... read morechandigarh: justifying punjab s changes to the apmc act in the wake of the controversy over centres new farm laws, state chief principal secretary to chief minister suresh kumar said the state laws came with caveats for the private buyers.with the focus on the agriculture sector, kumar also sought to defend punjabs power subsidy worth rs 8,000 crore to the farmers, claiming that it goes to maintain food prices affordable.one of the demands of the farmers is that the amendments done by punjab to the agricultural produce market committee (apmc) act in 2017 should also be repealed. the amendments included allowing private market, allowing digital marketing, facilitating access to distant markets through e-nam and creating commodity exchange, he said while speaking at business and policy dialogue organised by the indian school of business (isb).punjab was one of the few states that did this with vetting by the centre to facilitate alternate marketing options. these operations were started in 28 of the principal market yards in the state. the itc buys 1 million of tonnes of rice, besides over 2.5 million tonnes of wheat is exported through digital trading, chill and kinnow are sold using electronic connections, he added.but even though itc and pepsi have private markets, punjab had added a caveat there. the difference in the legislation of 2017 and the 2020 laws is that even the private markets are fully regulated under punjabs act. they (private buyers) have to comply with the transaction recording system with stocking and warehousing norms. we had finalised our rules and they also had to pay the mandi taxes. globalisation does not mean that the state revenue has to be compromised. in gst, 5% of purchase tax has been withdrawn from punjab, which is about rs 5,000 crore and now 6% will go with the new laws (rs 4,800 crore). the states capacity to raise revenue for development has to be maintaineddoubts about contract farmingpunjab already has punjab contract farming act, 2013. it is under my signature as i was the agriculture production commissioner at that time. after that i was the chief settlement commissioner and there was not even a single contractrelated case registered in the office and even till today no case is registered. the new contract farming act is a shade improvement as it has nothing to do with the land and whatever is grown as growing as per the conditions of the buyer, he said.the apprehension of the farmers is that they wont get contracted price paid if the market is down. farmers want the minimum price paid to them. punjab laws were based on land leasing. however, even the central laws have a catch. the farmers say that the land is not leased but there is a recovery dispute on remuneration, it will be recovered as arrears of land revenue. the matter will be resolved under punjab land revenue act. if a recovery suit comes, the collector has the power to attach the land. if a big company has a dispute, they will bring in a whole battery of lawyers. the farmers are not foolish and understand this. they want the land attachment aspect removed, he said.pb spends 10% on farm subsidiesdo the farming subsidies really benefit the farmers? the farmer gets the msp based on the actual cost, so there is no net benefit to the farmer because of the subsidy. the farmer is given cheaper insecticide, fertilisers because as a country we want to keep the prices of food affordable. it is actually a subsidy to the consumer and not the farmer, he added.rs 7,000 crore punjab is paying by way of free electricity to the farmers, water is also free. this is not even counted by the centre. the state is spending rs 8,000 crore every year, which is 10% of the states budget. people keep asking so much of subsidy but farmers are still poor, kumar said.there is the system of markets of faith in practice without the punjab tenancy act. there are no disputes and the culture has worked well by leasing to known people.not all is lostall is not lost with the farm laws and this is what i keep repeating in my meetings with my colleagues. the only thing is that we need to engage with the farmers to get to know what their apprehensions are and try and resolve them, said kumar in reply to a question.if you read the language of the food security act, it says that the centre shall procure food for the public distribution system through the state and central agencies. we are only saying just as that the foodgrains will be procured at a specified price and that assures the farmers the minimum support price (msp), he said."

It could be a breakthrough if adopted with an integrated approach, YV Singh, principal scientist of microbiology at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), an affiliate institution of the ICAR which developed the solution, told HT.Singh said the technology had an efficacy range of 70%-80%, citing results from its use in 24 villages in Delhi this October. This means it can successfully decompose up to 80% of the straw in a given area.The Delhi government adopted the technology from IARI to prevent burning of paddy stubble in about 700 hectares of rice fields, a project that cost Rs20 lakh.The institute has applied for a patent for the technology and is in the process of signing contracts with private firms to commercially market the product, Singh said.Also read | Delhi govt asks Centre to use bio decomposer in Punjab, HaryanaAssuming farmers in Punjab burn paddy straw in at least two million hectares, it will cost the state Rs571 crore to fund the use of Pusa decomposer to eliminate stubble burning, HTs calculation based on the Delhi governments costs show.Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop. It is the fastest and cheapest way to clear the fields of unwanted stalks.The burning of more than seven million hectares of crop residues has emerged as one of the biggest sources of winter pollution, resulting in weeks-long smog in New Delhi every October and November.Burning paddy straw has emerged as a big problem in the past two to three decades as farmers have shifted to mechanised combine harvesters, which cut the grainy part of a rice plant, leaving the stalk intact.While the straw from basmati rice, which is mostly exported, is soft enough to be used as fodder, the residue of other rice varieties, which account for most paddy acreage, is too stiff to be of any use. Farmers say they have few effective, affordable alternatives to burning.Pusa decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi, Singh said. To prepare a solution of 25 litres, farmers need to add four capsules of the decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed. To decompose paddy stubble in one hectare, farmers need to spray 25 litres of this solution.According to A. Amarender Reddy, the principal scientist at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, microbial agents in the solution act on the straw to make it soft, break down its components and release nutrients into the soil.The IARI is trying to popularise its solution in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers have used it in about 12000 hectares, which is just a fraction of the total rice acreage. Some form of subsidy may be needed to popularise its use, said Singh said.The farm ministry already runs a programme called Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the State of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & NCT of Delhi with funds worth Rs1,151 crore from 2018-19 to 2019-20 to subsidise machinery needed for management of crop residue. According to data from the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, the state witnessed 40,000 incidents of farm fires on November 5.Five years ago, the National Green Tribunal, an environmental court, banned stubble burning.

They are in the interest of farmers. They deal with marketing and contract farming, etc. MSP is outside their scope, Tomar said.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states are protesting a set of laws approved by Parliament in September to open up agricultural markets in the country, throwing a political challenge to the Narendra Modi government.On Thursday, police detained hundreds of farmers in Haryana and security on the Delhi-Haryana border was tightened to stop cultivators from entering the national capital, where they plan to hold rallies.The government has defended the recent reforms, saying these changes will bring big buyers, supermarkets and exporters to farmers doorstep. Farm unions, however, say the new rules could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. The government, on the other hand, has insisted it will still purchase staples at guaranteed prices.Tomar said the Modi government had increased the MSP of rice by 43% between 2013-14 and 2020-21. He also said payments made to farmers for paddy procurement had doubled under the National Democratic Alliance government compared to those under the previous United Progressive Alliance government. Total MSP value paid to farmers for paddy had gone up to Rs 4.34 lakh crore during 2014-19, up from Rs 2.88 lakh crore paid during 2009-14, he said.So, our commitment to MSP is clear. The procurement system will continue, the minister added.I want to appeal to our farmer brothers. We are ready to talk about all issues and resolve differences. That is why I have invited them again for talks on December 3.The government fixes MSP for 23 crops, but buys mostly grains from farmers at these prices. This tends to benefit staple growers. For most other items, farmers get what markets dictate.Experts say a law barring sale of farm produce below MSP makes little economic sense. If it is not profitable to buy at MSP, say, when demand is low, then the private sector will simply exit the mandi (markets). On the other hand, it is not possible for the government to buy everything at MSP, said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at New Delhis Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Support to farmers is not in question. But support in the form of MSP, which is market-distorting, raises questions, such as whether can we move to other ways of supporting farmers that cause less collateral damage, Sharma said.Analysts also say higher MSPs or procurement could raise greater scrutiny of India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). WTO rules cap government procurement for subsidized food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms.","indiaupdated: nov 27, 2020, 04:27 istagriculture minister narendra singh tomar on thursday said he could neither say yes nor no to the demand by farmers for a law to guarantee minimum support prices (msps), hinting for the first time that the union government is not ruling out such a possibility.abhi mein iske baare me haan bhi nehin keh sakta aur naa bhi nehin keh sakta (at this point, i can neither say yes nor no on this), the farm minister said in an interview with ht at his office, when asked if the government would even consider the demand.farmers representatives in their november 13 meeting with the farm minister and food minister piyush goyal demanded a repeal of three farm laws or amending them to outlaw the sale of farm commodities below federally fixed msps.the recent laws have a different mandate. they are in the interest of farmers. they deal with marketing and contract farming, etc. msp is outside their scope, tomar said.farmers from punjab, haryana and other states are protesting a set of laws approved by parliament in september to open up agricultural markets in the country, throwing a political challenge to the narendra modi government.on thursday, police detained hundreds of farmers in haryana and security on the delhi-haryana border was tightened to stop cultivators from entering the national capital, where they plan to hold rallies.the government has defended the recent reforms, saying these changes will bring big buyers, supermarkets and exporters to farmers doorstep. farm unions, however, say the new rules could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. the government, on the other hand, has insisted it will still purchase staples at guaranteed prices.tomar said the modi government had increased the msp of rice by 43% between 2013-14 and 2020-21. he also said payments made to farmers for paddy procurement had doubled under the national democratic alliance government compared to those under the previous united progressive alliance government. total msp value paid to farmers for paddy had gone up to rs 4.34 lakh crore during 2014-19, up from rs 2.88 lakh crore paid during 2009-14, he said.so, our commitment to msp is clear. the procurement system will continue, the minister added.i want to appeal to our farmer brothers. we are ready to talk about all issues and resolve differences. that is why i have invited them again for talks on december 3.the government fixes msp for 23 crops, but buys mostly grains from farmers at these prices. this tends to benefit staple growers. for most other items, farmers get what markets dictate.experts say a law barring sale of farm produce below msp makes little economic sense. if it is not profitable to buy at msp, say, when demand is low, then the private sector will simply exit the mandi (markets). on the other hand, it is not possible for the government to buy everything at msp, said pravesh sharma, a fellow at new delhis indian council for research on international economic relations.support to farmers is not in question. but support in the form of msp, which is market-distorting, raises questions, such as whether can we move to other ways of supporting farmers that cause less collateral damage, sharma said.analysts also say higher msps or procurement could raise greater scrutiny of india at the world trade organisation (wto). wto rules cap government procurement for subsidized food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms."

Leaders of farmers groups said that they will resume their march  christened Delhi Chalo on Friday morning.While Delhi prepared for a possible law and order challenge as well as traffic disruptions, high drama unfolded in Haryana on Thursday, as farmers from Punjab entered the state a day after being thwarted by border barricades.The police in Ambala erected barricades on an overbridge on the Ghaggar river connecting the Haryana town with Punjabs Patiala. Farmers threw several of these barricades into the river, facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. Protesters could be seen waving black flags and shouting slogans.The police made announcements on loudspeakers, asking farmers on the Punjab side to disperse, but that did not help. As smoke from tear gas clouded the skies and farmers outnumbered security personnel, they were allowed to enter Haryana around noon.However, their forward march was not smooth, with frequent barricades and trucks filled with sand on the Grand Trunk (GT) Road blocking their way. This led to traffic snarls that hit commuters as well. But the farmers marched on.Apart from this confrontation in Ambala district, there were face-offs between protesters and the police in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Haryanas Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind districts bordering the Congress-run Punjab. At Karnal, there was another face-off and police again used water cannon. A farmer was injured, though no arrests were reported.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who criticised the Haryana Polices action.Haryana Police chief Manoj Yadava, however, said that his force acted with great restraint. In this entire episode, not only a number of police personnel were injured, but police and private vehicles were also damaged, he said in a statement.As tension spiralled, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart, Manohar Lal Khattar, exchanged words over Twitter. While Singh asked Khattar why his government was stopping farmers, and the BJP leader told him to stop inciting them.Food bowl Punjab is at the centre stage of the farmers agitation against the governments moves to open up agricultural markets in the country and bring sweeping reforms to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population.Farmers have demanded a repeal of three laws enacted by Parliament in September which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the governments minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice.Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal held day-long negotiations on November 13 with leaders of several farmers groups in an attempt to end over two months of a politically challenging agitation. The discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future.New farm laws were the need of the hour.

istthousands of farmers from punjab broke barricades and forced their way into haryana on thursday, braving tear gas shells and water cannons en route to delhi, where law enforcement officials deployed stringent crowd control measures as residents grappled with long traffic snarls in border areas.by late evening, a large group of farmers  both from haryana and punjab  reached a toll plaza at panipat, about 100km from the capital, setting the stage for a confrontation with the delhi police, who have refused to give them permission for protests within the city limits. leaders of farmers groups said that they will resume their march  christened delhi chalo on friday morning.while delhi prepared for a possible law and order challenge as well as traffic disruptions, high drama unfolded in haryana on thursday, as farmers from punjab entered the state a day after being thwarted by border barricades.the police in ambala erected barricades on an overbridge on the ghaggar river connecting the haryana town with punjabs patiala. farmers threw several of these barricades into the river, facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. protesters could be seen waving black flags and shouting slogans.the police made announcements on loudspeakers, asking farmers on the punjab side to disperse, but that did not help. as smoke from tear gas clouded the skies and farmers outnumbered security personnel, they were allowed to enter haryana around noon.however, their forward march was not smooth, with frequent barricades and trucks filled with sand on the grand trunk (gt) road blocking their way. this led to traffic snarls that hit commuters as well. but the farmers marched on.apart from this confrontation in ambala district, there were face-offs between protesters and the police in bharatiya janata party (bjp)-ruled haryanas sirsa, kurukshetra, fatehabad and jind districts bordering the congress-run punjab. at karnal, there was another face-off and police again used water cannon. a farmer was injured, though no arrests were reported.congress leaders rahul gandhi and priyanka gandhi vadra, communist party of india (marxist) general secretary sitaram yechury and delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal were among those who criticised the haryana polices action.haryana police chief manoj yadava, however, said that his force acted with great restraint. in this entire episode, not only a number of police personnel were injured, but police and private vehicles were also damaged, he said in a statement.as tension spiralled, punjab chief minister amarinder singh and his haryana counterpart, manohar lal khattar, exchanged words over twitter. while singh asked khattar why his government was stopping farmers, and the bjp leader told him to stop inciting them.food bowl punjab is at the centre stage of the farmers agitation against the governments moves to open up agricultural markets in the country and bring sweeping reforms to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population.farmers have demanded a repeal of three laws enacted by parliament in september which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the governments minimum support price (msp) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice.agriculture minister narendra singh tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister piyush goyal held day-long negotiations on november 13 with leaders of several farmers groups in an attempt to end over two months of a politically challenging agitation. the discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future.new farm

And so recently it has acquired an upscale image, gaining attention that was previously restricted to carrots and potatoes.Beetroot Risotto at OpheliaWhether steamed, raw, pickled, roasted, mashed, gravied, sauted, stuffed, creamed, or souped  this root vegetable has solidified its place in restaurant kitchens.Continuing on this theme of the vegetable being ignored, Saurabh Luthra, Co-Founder Romeo Lane says, The ruby red vegetable was often given a cold shoulder in the kitchen, making it the most underrated ingredient, and even though it is readily available, many thought twice before picking it.Perhaps, many dont know how to get out the taste and its sheer versatility; but from hummus to spreads, ravioli, dim sum sheet dough, soups, salads to mock meat and even desserts, beetroot can lay a great foundation to any dish.Chef Anas Qureshi of Molecule in Green Park agrees, saying, Beetroot may not be your first choice because of its unusual taste but it is delicious when paired with bright, sweet, and fresh flavours. At Molecule, we are doing two dishes with Beetroot which are Beetroot Prawn Tempura Sushi and Beetroot Avocado Barley Salad.In the Sushi, the rice is cooked in beetroot juice, which gives it an amazing pink colour, and adds a little sweet flavour, which complements the prawn greatly. In beetroot avocado barley salad, the dressing is made using roasted beetroot puree, vinegar, olive oil and orange marmalade, with beetroot puree giving the salad a bright colour and earthy taste.Speaking of ways to bring out their flavour, Chef Amit Singh of Ophelia says, I think of beets as needing something nutty to complement their taste. You can bring two autumnal flavours together and add a hit of sweet acidity by pairing beets with crisp apples, while Dijon Mustard, with its sharp, tangy edge makes a delightful foil to beets.This vegetable is loaded with vitamins and minerals, is low in calories and fat, and contains inorganic nitrates and pigments, both of which have a number of health benefits. He also notes it has become a hot favourite for todays conscientious eater. Kanishk Tuteja of Nukkad Cafe and Bar, agrees saying, We use beetroot to make a bright coloured Golgappa. It has obvious health benefits, and we, as responsible chefs and restaurateurs, have to surprise them in forms of garnishes and colours, while also keeping their health in mind, especially these days.Among its many uses, the beetroot is providing options influenced by hardcore meaty meals.The Beetroot Galouti Kulcha at our Khan Market establishment is inspired by the lamb galouti. It is a healthy and versatile option for vegetarians and also for those wanting a lighter option to lamb. Charcoal smoked, the main flavours of the dish are ginger, green chilli, cardamom powder which balance out the sweetness of the beetroot, shares Agnibh Mudi, Brand Chef, Foxtrot.At Made in Punjab, I created Beetroot Ki Tikki that is crusty outside with a tender core, which has become one of our top-selling vegetarian starters. Our idea was to give vegetarians diners options beyond potato and paneer. Our Imli ki Chutney complements the tikki, making it a star dish after a slow initial response, concludes chef Mahabir.","shantanu david byexpress news servicethe beetroot, that most humble of root vegetables, was previously best known for bleeding onto the rest of your salad, with a blood-curling hue.it got a bit of a pr boost when red velvet cakes were in vogue last decade, their dye-like quality being put to good use in colouring the cake batter, but that trend has also since faded (unlike beetroot stains you may or may not have left on your mothers best table linen).however, in 2020, the year where anything can happen, beetroot is seeing a, perhaps overdue, surge in popularity in restaurant kitchens across the capital, in a cross-section of cuisines.chef mahabir singh from made in punjab says, beetroots versatility has made it the vegetable of the year, giving the chefs a blank canvas to paint on. and so recently it has acquired an upscale image, gaining attention that was previously restricted to carrots and potatoes.beetroot risotto at opheliawhether steamed, raw, pickled, roasted, mashed, gravied, sauted, stuffed, creamed, or souped  this root vegetable has solidified its place in restaurant kitchens.continuing on this theme of the vegetable being ignored, saurabh luthra, co-founder romeo lane says, the ruby red vegetable was often given a cold shoulder in the kitchen, making it the most underrated ingredient, and even though it is readily available, many thought twice before picking it.perhaps, many dont know how to get out the taste and its sheer versatility; but from hummus to spreads, ravioli, dim sum sheet dough, soups, salads to mock meat and even desserts, beetroot can lay a great foundation to any dish.chef anas qureshi of molecule in green park agrees, saying, beetroot may not be your first choice because of its unusual taste but it is delicious when paired with bright, sweet, and fresh flavours. at molecule, we are doing two dishes with beetroot which are beetroot prawn tempura sushi and beetroot avocado barley salad.in the sushi, the rice is cooked in beetroot juice, which gives it an amazing pink colour, and adds a little sweet flavour, which complements the prawn greatly. in beetroot avocado barley salad, the dressing is made using roasted beetroot puree, vinegar, olive oil and orange marmalade, with beetroot puree giving the salad a bright colour and earthy taste.speaking of ways to bring out their flavour, chef amit singh of ophelia says, i think of beets as needing something nutty to complement their taste. you can bring two autumnal flavours together and add a hit of sweet acidity by pairing beets with crisp apples, while dijon mustard, with its sharp, tangy edge makes a delightful foil to beets.this vegetable is loaded with vitamins and minerals, is low in calories and fat, and contains inorganic nitrates and pigments, both of which have a number of health benefits. he also notes it has become a hot favourite for todays conscientious eater. kanishk tuteja of nukkad cafe and bar, agrees saying, we use beetroot to make a bright coloured golgappa. it has obvious health benefits, and we, as responsible chefs and restaurateurs, have to surprise them in forms of garnishes and colours, while also keeping their health in mind, especially these days.among its many uses, the beetroot is providing options influenced by hardcore meaty meals.the beetroot galouti kulcha at our khan market establishment is inspired by the lamb galouti. it is a healthy and versatile option for vegetarians and also for those wanting a lighter option to lamb. charcoal smoked, the main flavours of the dish are ginger, green chilli, cardamom powder which balance out the sweetness of the beetroot, shares agnibh mudi, brand chef, foxtrot.at made in punjab, i created beetroot ki tikki that is crusty outside with a tender core, which has become one of our top-selling vegetarian starters. our idea was to give vegetarians diners options beyond potato and paneer. our imli ki chutney complements the tikki, making it a star dish after a slow initial response, concludes chef mahabir."

We are ready to take bullets, but wont return home till the time the three black laws are repealed. In fact, the farmers are already dead, says Mitthu Singh (52), reaching the Tikri border at the doorstep of Delhi with hundreds of farmers from Fatehabad in Haryana and parts of Punjab in tractors and trolleys on Friday in response to the call for Dilli Chalo by farmers groups.As he gears up to cook the first meal of the day with fellow farmers after a round of fierce face-off with Delhi Police, others join the conversation.Lost trustIt is the most dictatorial government. It is a government for the Ambanis and Adanis. They have sold everything  from railways to airports  to them, chips in Buta Singh, 32, also from Fatehabad. He says that people in many villages in Fatehabad had put banners outside their villages, asking political leaders not to enter. We will groom our own people to contest elections next time, he says.Hakam Singh, 55, also part of the group, adds that his ancestors toiled hard on the land to make it fertile and they were engaged in agriculture for generations. We cannot give our land to corporates on lease. We cannot be labourers on our own land, adds the elderly, donning a black turban with a flowing white beard.Parked haphazardly for almost a kilometre from the Tikri border till Pandit Shree Ram Sharma metro station in Bahadurgarh and beyond, many tractors had green and red flags tied in the front bearing the names of different farmers unions inscribed in Gurmukhi. Almost all trolleys were blanketed with tarpaulin or covers made of plastic fertiliser bags sewn together, keeping in view the falling mercury.Well-stockedTo make their travel comfortable through the bumpy roads and keep themselves warm, many had their trolleys padded with rice straw before putting mattress on them. We are carrying flour, potatoes, spices, utensils and cooking gas cylinders. A few trolleys carry woods to be used as a fuel and there is a water tanker with a capacity of around 5,000 litres, says Paramjit Pradhan, 60, adding that they could sustain themselves for months. I have fought for the farmers for four decades. I have been a comrade [a communist], he proudly proclaims, holding a red flag. Many also carried small stairs to enable the elderly members to climb up and down the trolleys. Some cars were also part of the convoy that was first to reach Delhi.Shringar Singh (70) says that they have been travelling for two days to reach Delhi from Moga in Punjab and broke through at least half-a-dozen barricades.The Haryana police tried to stop us with water cannons and tear gas. They had dug up roads, put barbed wires and parked punctured trucks to block our way. But we managed to overcome all hurdles. The Delhi police, however, were the most fierce in their attempt to stop us, says Sukhwant Singh (42).Pyara Singh, 74, says that no one wants to leave the comfort of their home and step outside, especially at his age, but they were compelled to march to Delhi.

The farmers are demanding that they be ensured that the sale of their produce happens at the minimum support price (MSP) but all the crops, including wheat, rice and millets, are already being sold at almost half the MSP.

The farmers finally got off the stretch when Delhi Police allowed them to enter the national and protest there. However, the farmers were stopped at the Sirsa toll at 3 pm but later allowed to go after around 4 pm.In Ghaziabad, the farmers blocked traffic at two places  Hapur Chungi Road and NH-58 in Modinagar.

We will groom our own people to contest elections next time, he says.Hakam Singh, 55, also part of the group, adds that his ancestors toiled hard on the land to make it fertile and they were engaged in agriculture for generations.

We cannot be labourers on our own land, adds the elderly, donning a black turban with a flowing white beard.Parked haphazardly for almost a kilometre from the Tikri border till Pandit Shree Ram Sharma metro station in Bahadurgarh and beyond, many tractors had green and red flags tied in the front bearing the names of different farmers unions inscribed in Gurmukhi.

Home secretary Ajay Bhalla had on November 28 written addressed to Darshan Pal Singh, the Punjab chief of the Krantikari Kisan Union, along with 31 organisations, reiterating the home ministers offer for early talks.The AIKSCC said the home ministry should not lead the discussions as agriculture was outside its jurisdiction.

A few actually managed to visit a Gurdwara.Yes, we missed the nagar kirtan (processional singing of hymns), during which we would travel around our villages with the Guru Granth Sahib decked nicely on a vehicle ahead of us. But there we would have celebrated it only with a few hundred other villagers. Here, we have the entire Punjab and people from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for company, Jagtar Singh, a Patiala farmer camping at Delhis Singhu Border, said, summing up the general mood.In the morning, at Singhu and Tikri borders, the farmers either stood in large groups or sat in their tractors and trolleys to do paath (reading of the holy text). That was followed by the distribution of prashad, and then a langar was organised even as a holy discourse was broadcast on loudspeakers.If we were back home, we would have had a sumptuous langar comprising of kheer, pakode, many varieties of sweets, and other dishes, said Shamsher Singh, a farmer from Amritsar. At the two border points, however, the langar had fewer options with the menu consisting of rice, roti, dal, vegetable and halwa.There are two Gurdwaras close to the Singhu border on the Delhi side. A few farmers who entered Delhi via internal roads also made it to the Gurdwaras.I havent missed a Gurdwara visit on this day ever since I was a child. I didnt miss it this time either, said Jasjeet Singh, a farmer from Faridkot, who took a bath, offered prayers and ate at the langar of the Dera Sant Baba Resham Singh Ji Gurdwara, about two kilometres from the Singhu border.The Gurdwara authorities chose to downplay visits by the protesting farmer, lest they draw unnecessary attention. There were many devotees we have never seen before, but we dont ask questions of anyone visiting this Gurdwara, said an official who didnt reveal his identity.The Sikh farmers at the Tikri Border werent lucky enough to find a Gurdwara in close proximity.Farmers assembled at the Burari ground too had to be content with limited celebrations at the venue although they danced and sang together to celebrate the festive day. We didnt have the Guru Granth Saahib with us, but we found new people to celebrate the festival with, said Jasvinder Singh, a farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in UP.Many Sikh farmers said they had woken up on the festive day by 4-5 am to bathe and wear fresh clothes.Our Diwali and Dussehra, too, was lost in the protests. So we were not very optimistic about celebrating Guru Nanak Jayanti with our families. But I had kept aside a pair of clean clothes for the day, saidInderjeet Singh, a farmer from Tarn Taran.While farmers at the Singhu border had sufficient water to bathe, many at the Tikri border struggled to find water. Jasjeet Singh, a farmer from Faridkot, said that he decided to give the prayers a miss as he hadnt taken a bath or changed his clothes for the past week.But well light lamps along the police barricades and outside our trucks at night. Well also light our vehicle headlamps and indicators at night to celebrate the festival, he said.Sikhs in Delhi and Haryana brought milk, fresh fruits and even lamps and battery-operated lights for the farmers. This time I have decided to celebrate the festival with my farmer brothers, said Jagtar Singh, a Sikh businessman from Rohini in Delhi.Farmers said they missed being with their families on the festive occasion, but it was a small sacrifice, given the task ahead of them. I have asked my wife to light an extra lamp on my behalf. She has asked me not to return until our demands are fulfilled. Well celebrate the festival again when we return home victorious, said another farmer, Hardeep Singh, from Ludhiana.At the Singhu border, farmers even walked up to police personnel to offer them prashad even as the police continued to maintain physical distance because of the pandemic.We may be on the other side of the barricades, but we are not enemies. So, we accepted the prashad and wished them, said a policeman who didnt want to be identified.Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), did not comment on the limited interaction between the Sikh farmers and the police personnel. I wish them on the festival and urge them to proceed to the Burari ground to carry on their protest peacefully, Sharma said.","delhiupdated: dec 01, 2020, 00:47 istif they were in their villages on guru nanak jayanti on monday, the sikh farmers protesting against new farm laws at delhis borders would have begun the day by wearing new clothes, visiting the local gurdwara, reading the holy scripture, organising a langar (community kitchen) and ended the festive day by lighting lamps.at the protest sites, however, the farmers could perform only a few of these rituals and in a very limited way -- some couldnt even find water to bathe -- but that did little to dampen their mood. a few actually managed to visit a gurdwara.yes, we missed the nagar kirtan (processional singing of hymns), during which we would travel around our villages with the guru granth sahib decked nicely on a vehicle ahead of us. but there we would have celebrated it only with a few hundred other villagers. here, we have the entire punjab and people from haryana and uttar pradesh for company, jagtar singh, a patiala farmer camping at delhis singhu border, said, summing up the general mood.in the morning, at singhu and tikri borders, the farmers either stood in large groups or sat in their tractors and trolleys to do paath (reading of the holy text). that was followed by the distribution of prashad, and then a langar was organised even as a holy discourse was broadcast on loudspeakers.if we were back home, we would have had a sumptuous langar comprising of kheer, pakode, many varieties of sweets, and other dishes, said shamsher singh, a farmer from amritsar. at the two border points, however, the langar had fewer options with the menu consisting of rice, roti, dal, vegetable and halwa.there are two gurdwaras close to the singhu border on the delhi side. a few farmers who entered delhi via internal roads also made it to the gurdwaras.i havent missed a gurdwara visit on this day ever since i was a child. i didnt miss it this time either, said jasjeet singh, a farmer from faridkot, who took a bath, offered prayers and ate at the langar of the dera sant baba resham singh ji gurdwara, about two kilometres from the singhu border.the gurdwara authorities chose to downplay visits by the protesting farmer, lest they draw unnecessary attention. there were many devotees we have never seen before, but we dont ask questions of anyone visiting this gurdwara, said an official who didnt reveal his identity.the sikh farmers at the tikri border werent lucky enough to find a gurdwara in close proximity.farmers assembled at the burari ground too had to be content with limited celebrations at the venue although they danced and sang together to celebrate the festive day. we didnt have the guru granth saahib with us, but we found new people to celebrate the festival with, said jasvinder singh, a farmer from lakhimpur kheri in up.many sikh farmers said they had woken up on the festive day by 4-5 am to bathe and wear fresh clothes.our diwali and dussehra, too, was lost in the protests. so we were not very optimistic about celebrating guru nanak jayanti with our families. but i had kept aside a pair of clean clothes for the day, saidinderjeet singh, a farmer from tarn taran.while farmers at the singhu border had sufficient water to bathe, many at the tikri border struggled to find water. jasjeet singh, a farmer from faridkot, said that he decided to give the prayers a miss as he hadnt taken a bath or changed his clothes for the past week.but well light lamps along the police barricades and outside our trucks at night. well also light our vehicle headlamps and indicators at night to celebrate the festival, he said.sikhs in delhi and haryana brought milk, fresh fruits and even lamps and battery-operated lights for the farmers. this time i have decided to celebrate the festival with my farmer brothers, said jagtar singh, a sikh businessman from rohini in delhi.farmers said they missed being with their families on the festive occasion, but it was a small sacrifice, given the task ahead of them. i have asked my wife to light an extra lamp on my behalf. she has asked me not to return until our demands are fulfilled. well celebrate the festival again when we return home victorious, said another farmer, hardeep singh, from ludhiana.at the singhu border, farmers even walked up to police personnel to offer them prashad even as the police continued to maintain physical distance because of the pandemic.we may be on the other side of the barricades, but we are not enemies. so, we accepted the prashad and wished them, said a policeman who didnt want to be identified.gaurav sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), did not comment on the limited interaction between the sikh farmers and the police personnel. i wish them on the festival and urge them to proceed to the burari ground to carry on their protest peacefully, sharma said."

Its in the same form it was in more than a month ago when district officials sprayed the Pusa bio-decomposer on the farm, they had told him the post-harvest stubble would turn into manure in 15 to 20 days.For some reason, the bio-decomposer doesnt quite seem to be effective on the post-harvest stubble of the fine-grained rice.We had got the bio-decomposer sprayed on our field on October 23 and it has been a month and the stubble has not shown any sign of melting, said Yadav, 33 . He quickly added: We are not nitpicking. The Delhi governments initiative could be a good solution for farmers cultivating mota chawal (non-basmati rice), but we have not benefitted much.The Pusa bio-decomposer has been developed by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi to turn post-harvest crop residue into manure, and has been plugged by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as a potential solution to the annual practice of stubble burning in neighbouring agrarian states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh that covers the national capital in a blanket of smoky haze every winter.In the capital, the bio-decomposer was sprayed free in 25 villages between October 11 and November 20. Hindustan Times visited some villages in the rural pockets of Delhi to find out how effective it had been. Some farmers found the solution to be useful in converting stubble into manure, some said that it was taking much longer than the 15-20 days the Delhi government said the process would take.The free spraying was not done everywhere, but interested farmers could contact the district administration and get their farms sprayed if they wanted to. The government survey was limited to 2,000 acres of non-basmati fields.In the same village where Deepak Yadav grows basmati, three farmers cultivate non-basmati varieties. Two of them said they seen noticeable results in their fields where the bio-decomposer successfully turned the sturdy stubble into manure.The stubble from non-basmati varieties is thicker and coarser, and when we use harvesting machines, the remains of the straw requires some kind of intervention. It took around 22 days for the stubble to turn into manure. It is good that the government is coming up with solutions for farmers and providing this free of cost, said Kushal Singh, who owns eight acres in Najafgarh.The early response for the decomposer may be mixed, but most farmers say the solution could be a viable option. Farmers should be told how exactly the solution works, under what circumstances it could take longer than the promised 15-to-20 days to turn stubble into manure, and what the farmers need to do to ensure the process is faster and more effective, they said.How the solution worksThe bio-decomposer is being tested in the fields of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and factors such as temperature and quality of stubble plays a role in the impact of solution, said Dr AK Singh, director of IARI . He said the process takes at least 25 days, but could last as long as two months.He said that bio-decomposer works on stubble after it has been cut into small pieces by the Super Straw Management System (SMS). SMS is a machine attached to a combine harvester, which chops the stubble remains into pieces. The solution is then sprinkled over the stubble.Once the field is harvested, the solution has to be sprayed in the field after which the field should be plowed with a rotavator machine so that the solution is mixed with the soil. The field should then be irrigated and left for 25 days. When left for 25 days, we have seen that the effectiveness of the decomposer was as much as 90%, Singh said.He said that for the decomposition to be effective, a minimum 25 days is needed between paddy harvesting and sowing of the wheat crop. When the temperatures are lower or when the bio-decomposer is used after machines such as Happy Seeder are put to use, the time for decomposition was around two months, Singh said. The Happy Seeder is a machine that cuts and lifts rice straw, sows wheat, and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch.A senior official of the Punjab agriculture department said that in the agricultural demography of Delhi, such simple solutions could be easier, but Punjab has nearly 2.7 million hectares of land under paddy cultivation, of which 600,00 hectares is used to grow basmati varieties.It is great that the Delhi government is taking the initiative and wants to find a solution for the problem of stubble burning, but agrarian states such as Punjab, Haryana and even UP have been experimenting with solutions for years now, and if things were this simple, then we would be the first to implement it. We are not denying that a certain bio-decomposer could be yielding better results, but the result depends on multiple factors, the official said, requesting anonymity.Farmers who harvested their fields in the latter part of October or early November, when the temperatures start falling, would have possibly seen that the process takes longer, said a Delhi government spokesperson.I dont know which farmers are finding it to not be effective, but it could possibly be because in lower temperature the fungal growth takes time. The field should also be irrigated, because the fungus needs that to grow. But the non-basmati farmers that we have surveyed have seen a tremendous result from the Pusa bio-decomposer, the spokesperson said.Delhi is differentTribhuvan Singh, a farmer in Daryapur village of Najafgarh, said the practice of setting fire to stubble to clear the fields has been almost done away with in Delhi. He said that because of small landholdings, it is easier for farmers here to hire labour and manually get rid of the stubble.There are two problems. Since the fields are smaller, the use of mechanised harvesting is neither a feasible option, nor a very popular one here. Another reason is that when you harvest some fine basmati varieties by machines, the grain tends to split and this fetches lower prices in the market. So the need for such a bio-decomposer is barely there in Delhi, said Singh.The Delhi government had on November 5 announced the formation of a 15-member impact assessment committee to study the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer in 2,000 acres (810 hectares) of Delhi. Based on the committees report, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had written to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi and adjoining areas, calling the bio-decomposer a success in Delhi and suggested that the new body direct states such as Punjab and Haryana to use the technique.The Basmati Survey Report, 2018-2019, by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) showed that Delhi had a total of 1.58 hectares of land under rice cultivation, out of which in 1.2 hectares basmati varieties were being grown.Similarly, in states such as Punjab and Haryana there was a consistent shift towards the cultivation of basmati varieties, instead of non-basmati ones. The APEDA report shows that in Punjab, between 2018 and 2019, 549.19 hectares of land was under basmati cultivation, compared to the total of 2863.08 hectares under rice cultivation. In Haryana, out of 1278.79 hectares of land under rice cultivation, 631.75 hectares were under basmati.Latest data also shows that the area under basmati this year in Punjab was the highest in five years, a 4% increase compared to last year.In Delhi, the practice of stubble burning is not prevalent. That is also because the city has a major packaging industry, so the stubble from paddy is sold off at a good price, without having to burn it. This was just an experiment. We need to send out the message that this is a feasible solution. Happy seeders, etc have not worked because those are not practical solutions, the Delhi government spokesperson said.She added, These machines are hardly used for 20 days in the whole year. Even if all the subsidies were working perfectly and reaching the farmers in time, it is very expensive. No one will invest that much for its use for just 20 days in a year. The bio-decomposer is a great alternative.","delhiupdated: dec 03, 2020, 02:25 istdeepak yadav, a farmer in jhuljhuli village of south-west delhis najafgarh, picks up and displays the stubble of a

2020-12-02,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/won-t-budge-an-inch-s-ay-protesting-farmers-on-new-farm-laws/story-zeL7FBQQ0GzqDG0tUZFfLL.html,"Won't budge even an inch, too much at stake for us: Farmers","delhiUpdated: Dec 03, 2020, 02:15 ISTA day ahead of the next round of talks with the government, farmers protesting at Delhis borders said they will not budge an inch till the three new farm laws are not revoked. The farmers said they are under huge debt and that the new laws will make their condition even worse.I am under huge debt. My family will be on the streets if the government does not revoke the new farming bills, said Jasdeep Singh from Bahadurpur village in Sungrur district of Punjab, one of the thousands of farmers protesting at the Singhu and Tikri borders for the last six days.Explaining his situation, Singh said his family of six is completely dependent on the five acres land they own and use to produce wheat. We produce around eight quintals of wheat and sell it at the mandis at a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs1,835 per quintal. Now, with no assurance of MSP in the new farm law, the corporates will not give us more than Rs 900 to Rs 1,000. Our income will be reduced to half. How will we survive and pay our debts in that situation? he said.Sitting next to him at Singhu border on Wednesday, Singhs mother Amarjeet Kaur said, Just four days before we left to participate in the protest, a family committed suicide in our neighbourhood after they failed to pay back their debt to the bank. These incidents will become frequent now. She says her family has to repay a debt of Rs 8 lakh.The farmers fear the new laws will do away with a guaranteed MSP, enabling private players to procure the produce at much lower rates. The government has been saying the MSP system will not be done away with.Raising similar concerns, Karanweer Singh, a farmer from Charuni Jattan village of Kurukshetra in Haryana, said his family of 12 are dependent on the produce they harvest from their 15-acre land. A major portion of our produce is consumed at home and the remaining is sold at the mandis on the MSP. What will we earn if there is no MSP? I will have to withdraw my children from schools because I wont be able to pay their fees, he said, adding his family has to repay a loan of Rs 4 lakh before the next harvesting season.Balwinder Singh Rana, president of Majja Kisan Sangarsh Committee Punjab, said farmer associations across the country have decided not to accept anything but complete revocation of the three laws. More than two lakh farmers from Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab will soon join us in our protest. We wont accept any amendment in the laws. The government cannot do away with the mandi system and abolish the MSP.Kunwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha (Punjab), said, We will go for the meeting called by the Centre on Thursday but we will not accept anything other than complete revocation of the three laws.Several small farmers feared they will not be able to sell their produce outside the current mandi system. Kulwinder Singh, a farmer from Moga, said he cultivates wheat and rice on a two-acre land for his family of six. The new laws have opened up the market for corporates. Now, the rich farmers, who have the resources and can sell their produce directly in cities like Delhi or Mumbai, will benefit.

We are here so that the future generations dont question us on how we let the government ruin their lives?

The farmers unions want nothing short of a complete withdrawal of the recently enacted Farm Acts, which they claim will ruin small and marginal farmers. Their main worry is about a possible withdrawal of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and a dismantling of the public procurement of grains. They also contend that by leaving farmers to the mercy of the open market, the stage has been set for large private players to take over agriculture.Epicentre of the unrestOn the other hand, the government claims that the Acts will only increase options for farmers in the output markets, that the MSP-procurement system will continue, and that there is absolutely no plan to dismantle the system. To support its claims, the government points to the fact that there is absolutely no mention of either MSP or procurement in the Acts. So why are farmers so agitated as to go on a march to Delhi, which according to reports, even turned ugly in several places? It needs to be noted that the protests are largely in the States of Punjab and Haryana. If the governments assertions are true, then why are farmers in these States so rattled? And how true are the claims and counter-claims put forth by the two sides?The Hindu Explains | Who gains and who loses from the farm laws?For a start, the governments claim that there is no mention of MSP-procurement in the Acts is true. It is also true that a large-scale public procurement of paddy is going on in Punjab as the protests are raging. But farmers are really worried and appear prepared for the long haul. Why?It is the lifeline hereThe Public Distribution System (PDS) is the lifeline in these States. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are heavily dependent on public procurement and assured price through MSP. This is far greater than farmers in any other State. Nearly 88% of the paddy production and 70% of the wheat production in Punjab and Haryana (in 2017-18 and 2018-19) has been absorbed through public procurement, Food Grains Bulletin and Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, Government of India.In contrast, in the other major paddy States such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, only 44% of the rice production is procured by public agencies. In the case of wheat, this percentage is even lower. In the major wheat States of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, only a quarter (23%) of the production is procured by public agencies. This clearly shows the heavy dependence of farmers in Punjab and Haryana on MSP and the public procurement system. In a sense, this system has been the lifeline of these States. It is conceivable then that any disruption to the system, real or perceived, will cause a major upheaval. The farmers are now up in arms against the government as they perceive their very existence to be at stake.Comment | Will the farm bills benefit farmers?Governments obligationsThe government needs to continue procurement too. What is missed in this scenario is that if farmers of Punjab and Haryana need the procurement system, the government needs it even more. This is because of its obligations under the PDS and the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Support under the NFSA is a legal and rights-based entitlement.There are nearly 80 crore NFSA beneficiaries and an additional eight crore migrants who need to be supported under the PDS. The government needs an uninterrupted supply of grain, particularly from these two States, to maintain the PDS. In the last three years, nearly 40% of the total paddy production in the country (45 million tons) and 32% of wheat production (34 million tons) has been procured by public agencies to supply the PDS.Ground Zero | Farm Bills leave farmers, commission agents and workers worriedThis year, due to the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic and the migrant crisis, the government has earmarked much larger quantities for public distribution  about 58 million tons of rice and 37 million tons of wheat. This translates into nearly half of the rice production (49%) and 35% of the wheat production in the country. This implies that the government needs to procure a huge quantum of grains than in previous years as the government cannot afford to go to the open market. That is a sure recipe for disaster as prices will skyrocket, and with the stock restrictions gone under the recent Essential Commodities Act Amendment, there is a possibility of large-scale hoarding too.Why these States matterIf the government intends to procure such huge quantities of grains, then it needs to turn to these two States, because it is these States that have always been in the forefront in supplying grains to procurement agencies. Nearly 35% of the rice and 62% of the wheat procured in the last three years has been from these States. Also, nearly 50% of the total coarse grains came from these two States. Thus, the government has little option but to continue its procurement from these States in the foreseeable future. Even after the COVID-19 situation improves and the migrant crisis abates, the obligations under the NFSA will continue.Dilli Chalo | Women in Punjab keep the fires burningIt is clear that dismantling the procurement system is neither in the interests of farmers nor the government. Therefore, it is imperative that the government reaches out to the farmer groups and assures them of the indispensability of MSP-procurement system. The government needs to start this initiative immediately to allay their legitimate concerns.Data | Farmers, new agriculture laws and government procurementImprovements neededApart from addressing the core issue of the MSP-procurement system, many more improvements are needed in the Acts.

The government compensates the FCI for its losses.HAS STATE PROCUREMENT PROGRAMME LED TO OVERPRODUCTION OF RICE AND WHEAT?Guaranteed prices offered by the FCI encourage farmers to produce large quantities of rice and wheat. Higher production puts pressure on the FCI to buy extra supplies from farmers, resulting in overflowing state warehouses and a ballooning subsidy bill that often pushes up the budget deficit.Despite sitting on massive mounds of rice and wheat, the FCI finds it challenging to export as the annual rise in MSPs and its own storage costs make FCI's rice and wheat more expensive than world prices, making overseas sales uneconomic.Once in a while, the Indian government gives small quantities of rice and wheat to other countries through diplomatic deals. Still, FCI's warehouses are chock-a-block.WHO LARGELY BENEFITS FROM FCI'S SAFETY NET?The safety net ironically covers relatively well-off farmers from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, forcing their poorer counterparts from Bihar and other underdeveloped states to sell at a discount.Every year, farmers from Punjab and Haryana sell almost their entire produce to the FCI at MSPs thanks to well-developed market yards and efficient procurement centres, a far cry from Bihar's underdeveloped grain procurement infrastructure.Also, unlike poor farmers from Bihar, the rich and politically influential farming community of Punjab and Haryana ensures that the FCI continues to buy large volumes of rice and wheat from their states, where agriculture is a mainstay.While Punjab and Haryana sell almost their entire rice and wheat output to FCI, the government agency's procurement in Bihar has remained at less than 2% of the state's total production.Left out of the safety net, most farmers from Bihar are forced to sell at a discount of 25% to 35%.Already deprived of assured returns, farmers from Bihar have not explicitly opposed the new laws which growers from Punjab and Haryana fear will eventually pave the way for the FCI to stop buying their grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.","new delhi: thousands of farmers angered by farm laws that they say threaten their livelihoods have intensified their protests by blocking highways and camping out on the delhi borders.the prime minister narendra modi-led government and leaders of protesting farmers' unions have held several rounds of talks but have not made any progress in breaking the deadlock over the set of laws passed by parliament in september.although various farmer unions have supported the protest, the agitation is largely led by the growers of relatively well-off states of punjab and haryana .every year the government spends billions of dollars on buying millions of tonnes of rice and wheat from punjab and haryana, and the world's most expensive food procurement programme has now become the centrepiece of india's biggest farmers' protest in years.how does india run its mammoth food procurement programme?after calculating the cost of cultivation, the state-run commission for agricultural costs and prices (cacp) announces minimum support prices (msps) for more than 22 commodities yearly to set a benchmark.although every year the cacp announces msps for most crops, the food corporation of india (fci), the main state-run grain procurement agency, buys only rice and wheat at those prices due to a lack of storage and funds.after buying rice and wheat from farmers at msps, the fci sells the staples at highly subsidised prices to the poor. the government compensates the fci for its losses.has state procurement programme led to overproduction of rice and wheat?guaranteed prices offered by the fci encourage farmers to produce large quantities of rice and wheat. higher production puts pressure on the fci to buy extra supplies from farmers, resulting in overflowing state warehouses and a ballooning subsidy bill that often pushes up the budget deficit.despite sitting on massive mounds of rice and wheat, the fci finds it challenging to export as the annual rise in msps and its own storage costs make fci's rice and wheat more expensive than world prices, making overseas sales uneconomic.once in a while, the indian government gives small quantities of rice and wheat to other countries through diplomatic deals. still, fci's warehouses are chock-a-block.who largely benefits from fci's safety net?the safety net ironically covers relatively well-off farmers from the northern states of punjab and haryana, forcing their poorer counterparts from bihar and other underdeveloped states to sell at a discount.every year, farmers from punjab and haryana sell almost their entire produce to the fci at msps thanks to well-developed market yards and efficient procurement centres, a far cry from bihar's underdeveloped grain procurement infrastructure.also, unlike poor farmers from bihar, the rich and politically influential farming community of punjab and haryana ensures that the fci continues to buy large volumes of rice and wheat from their states, where agriculture is a mainstay.while punjab and haryana sell almost their entire rice and wheat output to fci, the government agency's procurement in bihar has remained at less than 2% of the state's total production.left out of the safety net, most farmers from bihar are forced to sell at a discount of 25% to 35%.already deprived of assured returns, farmers from bihar have not explicitly opposed the new laws which growers from punjab and haryana fear will eventually pave the way for the fci to stop buying their grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers."

(Photo by Praveen Khanna)Five hundred litres water, 200 litres milk, 50 kg sugar and 60 kg tea leaves  through the day at Tikri border, tea simmers in a 100-litre vessel for thousands of farmers protesting there since November 26. Potato fritters and tea for breakfast, some jalebi in the afternoon, and chole-rice, aloo-gobhi and kheer for lunch and dinner.Several langars have been set up across the three main protest sites in Delhi-NCR  Ghazipur border, Singhu border and Tikri, with pavements lined with sacks of rice and vegetables and chulhas for cooking, drums of milk reaching at the crack of dawn, and cooking duties drawn out.At 4 am, when everyones still fast asleep at the Tikri border, six middle-aged men from Haryana wake up daily to prepare the first meal of the day for 6,000-plus protesters  tea and potato fritters. By the time, the first cup of tea is ready, its 5 am. Ram Kesh Singh (52), a paddy farmer from Rohtak, said: Every day, we prepare potato fritters, kheer, aloo-gobhi, chole and rice, all cooked in desi ghee. We got these massive utensils from Bahadurgarh, hired three cooks. This is our sewa for all the other protesting farmers. The group buys fresh vegetables daily from mandis nearby, and also accepts produce donated by well-wishers. Over 100 kg of potato and cauliflower is peeled and kept aside for dinner.Maan (42), a farmer from Jhajjar who is a part of another kitchen, said, People are donating groceries; we are blessed. Today morning, a man gave us 100 cans of drinking water. We have 17 trucks, some given by transporters, and they ferry milk and vegetables. A small-scale kitchen operates in another corner, where eight elderly farmers peeled onion and potatoes for a meal for 100. Sardoor (60) from Punjab said, We go back home every three days and return with ghee, milk and daal. This is our mini pind In the last six days, we have used three tonnes of ghee. We are here to stay, that truck is our bedroom.At the Ghazipur protest site, a makeshift kitchen operates below the flyover, and on Friday, there is pulao, dal and aloo-gobhi for lunch. Help has come in from the volunteers of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, whove prepared 2.5 quintal dal, 125 kg rice, and 2 quintal of vegetables. Tarsem Singh from the committee said, The food is enough to serve thousands. With many sugarcane farmers at the protest site, sweets made of jaggery have been a constant snack since the protests began. While many relied on the langar, others had set up their own kitchens along the road. With a gas, stove and enough ration for six months, Mandeep Singh (39) prepared lunch for himself and around 20 others. He said, We packed up whatever we could and left from our hometown, Pilibhit.At Singhu border, where the maximum number of protesters have gathered, a langar set up by a gurdwara committee from Punjabs Hoshiarpur feeds nearly 10,000 people every day. The farmers have carried more than 10 gas cylinders, over 500 kg ingredients, large dishes, frying pans, steel spatulas, disposable plates and glasses and dustbins.We have more than 50 people working at the langar at all times. We start early in the morning and it goes on till 10 pm. Today we have matar paneer, dal and rice for lunch along with jaggery lassi and kheer If we run out of gas, we get it filled from the nearest station.

Along with three new farm laws, thousands of farmers are also protesting these harsh measures, saying they cannot afford costly alternatives. But trials this harvest season indicate that crop-residue burning could be stopped, or at least effectively controlled, by a new technology that is showing encouraging results.A proprietary microbial solution developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  usually referred to as the Pusa institute -- that turns biomass, such as rice stubble, into natural manure, has proved to be successful in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, according to scientists behind the project. The Delhi government, which utilised the technology and is strongly promoting it, has also found the experiments to be a success.ICARs invention, named Pusa, decomposes crop residue, including paddy straw, and turns it into manure in about 25 days, thus eliminating the need to burn paddy stubble, YV Singh, principal scientist of microbiology at the institute, a top state-run facility, told HT.Singh said the technology showed an efficacy range of 70%-80% during in-house open trials. This paved the way for the Delhi government to adopt the technology, drenching over 800 hectares of non-basmati rice fields with the bio-decomposer in the Capitals rural belts for free. The operation, undertaken between October 11 and November 20, cost approximately Rs 20 lakh.A Delhi government panel studied the outcomes of the trials, termed it a success, and recommended expanding its use nationally as its appraisal found that the decomposer turned 90%-95% crop residue into manure in 15-20 days.Delhi has found a solution to the problem of crop residue burning and now no state can now make any excuse, Delhis chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters on November 5 after touring rice farms under the project.Assuming farmers in Punjab burn paddy straw in at least two million hectares of rice, it will cost the state Rs 571 crore to fund the use of Pusa decomposer, HTs calculation based on the Delhi governments costs show. This could be effectively path-breaking because the cost is just a fraction of the Rs 6,000 crore the state spends annually on subsiding various farm inputs, from cheap fertilisers to power.IMPACT OF STUBBLE FIREFarmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop.Since the straw from premium basmati rice, which is mostly exported, is soft enough to be used as fodder, it does not require burning, and has little role in air pollution. The share of basmati in overall paddy output is just 2.1%, official data shows. The residue of non-basmati rice varieties, which account for the largest paddy area, is too hard to be of any economic use, and farmers have long maintained that there is no viable or cost-effective alternative to burning the unwanted stalks.Though Punjabs farmers have increasingly switched to modern machines to efficiently harvest rice, such machines also leave paddy stalks in their wake, leading to stubble-burning, said Manpreet Singh, a farm engineering specialist at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. Automated harvesters are designed to shave off the grainy part of paddy, leaving loose straw behind. Farmers find it cheaper to burn the remnants.Unlike the decreasing landholding size at an all-India level, the operational landholding size in Punjab has increased over the years, making use of larger machines viable, analysts say.Data from the national agricultural census 2011 show that average land-holding size in Punjab has gone up from 2.89 hectares (7.1 acres) in 1970-71 to 3.77 ha (9.3 acres) in 2010-11, much higher than the national average of 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres).As the westerly winds carry the smoke from the burning stubble towards the national capital, air pollution in Delhi spikes to alarming levels  the air quality index often breaches the severe level (400-plus) that is hazardous even for healthy individuals. Though local emissions and weather also lead to pollution spikes through the winter, the first wave exacerbated by stubble fires is the deadliest and most intense.Air pollution kills up to an estimated 30,000 people in Delhi annually, according to a 2015 report of New Delhis Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).HOW SOLUTION WORKSScientists at IARI started on a research project two years ago for a solution to burning of non-basmati straw, a programme involving some of its top scientists and droves of PhD scholars, Singh said.The Pusa decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi. I cant make the strains public because it is a proprietary formulation and we are in talks with private firms to market it in exchange of royalty, the principal scientist added.To prepare a solution of 25 litres, enough to cover one hectare of paddy, farmers need to add five capsules of the propreitory decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed.According to A. Amarender Reddy, the principal scientist at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (Crida), microbial agents in the solution act on the straw to make it soft, break down its components and release nutrients into the soil.Singh said scientists were gleaning lessons from actual trials in Delhi. Field results are promising, but we are analysing the results to see if we can customise the product further to adapt to different soil environments, Singh said.According to Reddy, the findings of trial results  like the one by the Delhi government panel -- are always represented in average terms. Any average doesnt account for variations in individual farms, so it is possible that not every farm has uniform results, he added.OTHER STEPS NEEDEDThe scientist said that use of the solution across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  two other states that add to the Capitals pollution woes  could help control the problem, but added that the solution wasnt a silver bullet.It is not a magic solution which you spray and stubble vanishes. It works best as part of integrated stubble-management approach, Singh said.For instance, scientists pointed out that farmers should carry out laid-down drills, leaven the stubble with additional equipment, and adhere to prescribed temperatures while storing and spraying.In Punjab, which reports far more fire incidents than Haryana (cumulatively between October 1 and November 3, Punjab saw 79093 fire incidents this year compared to 50738 in the corresponding period last year, according to Indian Agriculture Research Institutes satellite surveillance), the government has authorised the use of eight farm equipment, including the so-called happy seeder. Individual farmers can avail 50% subsidy to buy these machines, while farmer groups are eligible for up to 80% subsidy. These machines cost between Rs1.40 lakh to 1.60 lakh. The tractor-mounted happy seeder can be used to sow wheat without the need to clear the straw.But the problem is farmers still prefer burning because of lack of awareness and cost issues, said HS Sidhu of the Borlaug Institute for South Asia, who was one of the developers of the happy seeder.Analysts say more studies of the Pusa decomposer should be conducted urgently across various farm zones. If the results are encouraging, the decomposer should be included among farm technologies that are eligible for subsidy, they add.Any technology, to be successful, needs scalability. Therefore, the government should invest in any solution that is promising. Testing across agroclimatic zones should be the way forward. Look at Covid-19. Afterall, humankind was successful in developing a vaccine in such a short time, said Rohini Mali, an independent consultant, who was formerly advisor of food systems, FAO in Rome","indiaupdated: dec

2020-12-05,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/kundlis-tryst-with-farmers-destiny/articleshow/79574741.cms,Punjab: Kundli’s tryst with farmers’ destiny,"CHANDIGARH: For a traveller from Punjab , Kundli had so far been a non-descript town on way to the national capital, after a five-minute drive from the famous dhabas in Murthal. Many would have not even noticed the rural-urban (rurban) locality in Haryana s Sonipat district, but all this has changed over the past week on the Kundli-Singhu border .Thousands of farmers from Punjab, and some from Haryana, have been camping on a 7km stretch of the National Highway 44, which runs through the towns periphery and connects Punjab, north Haryana and Chandigarh to Delhi, since November 27.For the laidback town in Sonipats Rai tehsil, this has meant a carnival-like chaos of tractor-trolleys, tents, makeshift kitchens, medical camps, impromptu poetry recitations and music performances, and a main stage from where organisers deliver speeches and volunteers host film screenings. There is a separate tented area for prayers too.The highway itself is the venue and reaching the centre requires one to drive five kilometres through a maze of vehicles parked haphazardly on either side of the road. The last bit is nearly inaccessible because of the rush.While Haryana Police divert Dehi-bound traffic on to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway a little away from near Rai Sports University, any vehicle which crosses the police barricading is greeted by joyful young men handing out mineral water bottles and fruits. Community kitchens to cook langar are common once the tractor-trailers, nearly all turned into makeshift dorms, begin. It is a town of its own, says Gurdeep, an activist of Ambedkar Students Association from Chandigarh while giving a tour of the venue.Around 5pm, while a group of farmers from Haryana smoke a hookah in front of INLDs Kundli border office, members of Delhi-based NGO Shaheed Bhagat Singh Youth Brigade (SBYB) sit cross-legged on the road and sing a song dedicated to farmers from a loudspeaker. Shehnaz Hindustani, a poet and a member of SBYB, says he and the members of his group are not farmers and live in Delhi, but had come to the protest because they wanted to stand by farmers. They have made so many sacrifices to feed the nation and this is the least we could do, he says.After the performance, Shehnaz and his team get up and thank a group of farm leaders for standing up to the Centre and showing the way to other farmers.Medical camps set up by charitable organisations are nearly as common as community kitchens. Apart from Khalsa Aid, medical camps have been set up by United Sikhs, Ludhiana-based Gurmat Gian Missionary College, International Punjabi Foundation, a team from Derabassi sent by Sethi Dhaba in Zirakpur, and more. At some camps, medical teams are also checking the blood pressure of protesters. Gurmat Gian Missionary College principal Gurbanchan Singh says they are also providing blankets and bedding to the protesters.We will be sending more supplies as many protesters are aged, he adds. Even flags hoisted across the protest are of various hues  white, green, saffron, yellow, red, and the Tricolour too. Punjabi music, especially the recently released bass-heavy protest songs on farm laws , blare on music systems from tractors and SUVs all day. Gurjeet Singh, who had come to the protest from Sangrur and was driving a tractor playing one such song, says the songs are not provocative. Our livelihoods are at stake. The Centre is the provocateur, not the songs, he says.The protest venue has been divided into two parts. The last sit-in, where a tent has been pitched for reciting Sikh prayers, comes after an area where CRPF and police personnel have been deployed. The group was going to Burari grounds, but decided to stop on the Haryana side only.The main stage turns into a source of entertainment by evening. On Thursday, National Award-winning director Rajeev Kumar screened his movie SIRI. I wanted to show the protesters, through the movie, that the problem is not just in the ruling party, but government policies. As long as we are signatories to the World Trade Agreement, laws will stay. They should understand it is the corporate world-friendly policies which they need to oppose. I am happy people understand this, he says.Muslims from Malerkotla pitch inA group of Muslims from Malerkotla have also set up a community kitchen at the Singhu border protest site. Advocate Mubeen Farooqi, president of Muslim Federation of Punjab, said he had promised help to farmers and was now on ground zero because of that. Malerkotlas sweetend rice is famous and that is the dish for today evening, he says.","chandigarh: for a traveller from punjab , kundli had so far been a non-descript town on way to the national capital, after a five-minute drive from the famous dhabas in murthal. many would have not even noticed the rural-urban (rurban) locality in haryana s sonipat district, but all this has changed over the past week on the kundli-singhu border .thousands of farmers from punjab, and some from haryana, have been camping on a 7km stretch of the national highway 44, which runs through the towns periphery and connects punjab, north haryana and chandigarh to delhi, since november 27.for the laidback town in sonipats rai tehsil, this has meant a carnival-like chaos of tractor-trolleys, tents, makeshift kitchens, medical camps, impromptu poetry recitations and music performances, and a main stage from where organisers deliver speeches and volunteers host film screenings. there is a separate tented area for prayers too.the highway itself is the venue and reaching the centre requires one to drive five kilometres through a maze of vehicles parked haphazardly on either side of the road. the last bit is nearly inaccessible because of the rush.while haryana police divert dehi-bound traffic on to the eastern peripheral expressway a little away from near rai sports university, any vehicle which crosses the police barricading is greeted by joyful young men handing out mineral water bottles and fruits. community kitchens to cook langar are common once the tractor-trailers, nearly all turned into makeshift dorms, begin. it is a town of its own, says gurdeep, an activist of ambedkar students association from chandigarh while giving a tour of the venue.around 5pm, while a group of farmers from haryana smoke a hookah in front of inlds kundli border office, members of delhi-based ngo shaheed bhagat singh youth brigade (sbyb) sit cross-legged on the road and sing a song dedicated to farmers from a loudspeaker. shehnaz hindustani, a poet and a member of sbyb, says he and the members of his group are not farmers and live in delhi, but had come to the protest because they wanted to stand by farmers. they have made so many sacrifices to feed the nation and this is the least we could do, he says.after the performance, shehnaz and his team get up and thank a group of farm leaders for standing up to the centre and showing the way to other farmers.medical camps set up by charitable organisations are nearly as common as community kitchens. apart from khalsa aid, medical camps have been set up by united sikhs, ludhiana-based gurmat gian missionary college, international punjabi foundation, a team from derabassi sent by sethi dhaba in zirakpur, and more. at some camps, medical teams are also checking the blood pressure of protesters. gurmat gian missionary college principal gurbanchan singh says they are also providing blankets and bedding to the protesters.we will be sending more supplies as many protesters are aged, he adds. even flags hoisted across the protest are of various hues  white, green, saffron, yellow, red, and the tricolour too. punjabi music, especially the recently released bass-heavy protest songs on farm laws , blare on music systems from tractors and suvs all day. gurjeet singh, who had come to the protest from sangrur and was driving a tractor playing one such song, says the songs are not provocative. our livelihoods are at stake. the centre is the provocateur, not the songs, he says.the protest venue has been divided into two parts. the last sit-in, where a tent has been pitched for reciting sikh prayers, comes after an area where crpf and police personnel have been deployed. the group was going to burari grounds, but decided to stop on the haryana side only.the main stage turns into a source of entertainment by evening. on thursday, national award-winning director rajeev kumar screened his movie siri. i wanted to show the protesters, through the movie, that the problem is not just in the ruling party, but government policies. as long as we are signatories to the world trade agreement, laws will stay. they should understand it is the corporate world-friendly policies which they need to oppose. i am happy people understand this, he says.muslims from malerkotla pitch ina group of muslims from malerkotla have also set up a community kitchen at the singhu border protest site. advocate mubeen farooqi, president of muslim federation of punjab, said he had promised help to farmers and was now on ground zero because of that. malerkotlas sweetend rice is famous and that is the dish for today evening, he says."

Within them, rice and wheat dominate cereal production and it's also known that they are intensely water-consumptive crops. For this study, the researchers relied on mathematical modelling and used data-sets from 2011-12the most updated they saythat had information on interstate trade of cereals, domestic cereal production, cost of transportation by rail and road between states. From this the 'water footprint' of producing and transporting cereals were estimated.Previous studies of embedded-water flow in agricultural production have usually focussed on international movements, for instance the amount of water that was lost when a country imported a food crop from another, whereas this focussed on domestic movements and incorporates the role of the public distribution system as well as international outflows, the authors note.Trade patterns varied between PDS (Public Distribution System) and non-PDS cereals. The majority (58%; 58.0 Mt) of interstate cereal trade occurred through the PDS. The total volume of embedded water traded through PDS rice and wheat amounted to 54.3 cubic km of green water and 36.7 km3 of blue water. As the main PDS contributors, the States exporting the most water through the PDS were Punjab (20.9 km3), Andhra Pradesh (12.6 km3) and Madhya Pradesh (9.9 km3). In addition, 35.8 Mt of non-PDS cereals were traded between States, corresponding to 45.1 km3 of green water and 17.3 km3 of blue water.'Green' and 'blue water' refer to the volume of precipitation water that is consumed during crop production, either from evapotranspiration, transpiration, or incorporated into the final crop product. The blue water is that withdrawn from ground- and surface-water sources and consumed during crop production, or incorporated into the final crop product.Our findings reiterate the substantial potential for balancing water resources through the trade of crops in India, either in addition to or in place of large-scale infrastructure projects, say the authors.

2020-12-06,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/the-politics-behind-the-farm-protests/story-52oB5K9KHcoKk09OYcq3YO.html,The politics behind the farm protests,"columnsUpdated: Dec 06, 2020, 22:41 ISTThe question of representation in India is usually seen through the prism of caste, religion and region. But the question of sharing political power between rural and urban areas has attracted scanty scrutiny.For too long India has been romanticised as a rural civilisation. This has roots in colonial rule, when nationalists uncritically accepted European characterisation of India as an unchanging, timeless, rural society. Instead of questioning its very basis, most of the anti-imperialist responses sought to prove the superiority of this spiritual and rural India over the industrial, materialistic West.While Mahatma Gandhi exemplified the extreme end of this reaction, even socialists and Hindu nationalists were not immune from this delusion. They failed to see that decline of urban centres and industry was itself the by-product of colonial rule, and historically, India had one of the highest rates of urbanisation.Most things we know of and take pride in Indian history comes from the cities and urban milieu and not some timeless village. This is also not surprising because it is the rise of cities that heralds the rise of civilisation  for it is when a society has reached a certain threshold of social and economic sophistication, driven by technical advances, that it becomes distinct from subsistence existence.However, the post-Independence Indian polity remained attached to agrarianism and ruralism with ceaseless eulogies to the Kisan as Annadata. Instead of recognising that farming is just another source of livelihood, the polity has converted it into the essence of India with excessive sentimentality nurtured over decades. It is reflected in a policy that privileges the farmers not just over urban dwellers but also the other sections of rural society, most notably agrarian labourers. The demands at the centre of the current farmer protests demonstrate this distortion in the Indian polity.Those spearheading the protests belong to the class of capitalist farmers that rose during the Green Revolution in north-western India. Government support in the form of subsidies, Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), free water, electricity, credit, among other measures, was critical to the formation of this class  apart from the expansion of landholding either through forced purchase or outright land-grab from the Dalit castes and small farmers.This segment of farmers also acquired interests in moneylending and trade and commerce, which they think is under threat from the entry of the agri-business companies. But since no one wants to be seen as anti-farmer and to question complex politics within an agrarian society, the cause has gained wide traction in the public, intelligentsia, and political parties.However, do note that 86% of farmers in the country are small and marginal farmers who are net-buyers of the food grains. Forcing the State to sustain artificially high prices feeds into inflation and hurts these farmers, apart from the large population of landless labourers.In Punjab alone, Dalits are around 32% of the population, but hardly own 3% of the agricultural land. The higher MSP and perverse incentives it creates has distorted cropping patterns, destroyed biodiversity and caused environmental and ecological havoc with depletion of water tables, degradation of soil and smog engulfing the entire north India as arid Punjab is now cultivating rice.We refuse to accept that agriculture is the private sector and farmers are private producers. There is no obligation on the part of the State to ensure desired prices and profits to one class of private producers over others. Why only farmers then? Why not carpenters, potters or traders?But to understand why the political system is hesitant to call out the problems that lie at the heart of these protests  including the fact that meeting the demands are harmful for the rest of the country  turn to the disproportionate political power vested in the rural areas where these affluent farmers hold the levers of power.The majority of Indians already lives in urban areas, but the distribution of seats in Parliament and legislatures favours the rural areas. It creates an incentive for political parties to pander to the dominant section of the rural society  farmers.Moreover, no party has sought to reshape the political landscape by focusing on cities as the centre of political power despite them being the engines of economic growth.And it here is that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contesting the Hyderabad municipal elections as a mini national election and succeeding signifies a turning point in Indias political trajectory. It has signalled the emergence of urban governance as the new focal point of political power. The impact is potentially far-reaching  as urban centres gain in political importance, a new powerful political leadership emerges, and there is delimitation of constituencies based on current demographic realities, it will automatically force politicians to accord urban centres their due importance, leading to a decline in the political power of the rural areas.It will also resolve a major contradiction in the Indian polity where a minority population has disproportionate political power and help enable India re-embrace its historical trajectory of an urban-centric civilisation.Abhinav Prakash Singh is an assistant professor, economics, Sri Ram College of CommerceThe views expressed are personal","columnsupdated: dec 06, 2020, 22:41 istthe question of representation in india is usually seen through the prism of caste, religion and region. but the question of sharing political power between rural and urban areas has attracted scanty scrutiny.for too long india has been romanticised as a rural civilisation. this has roots in colonial rule, when nationalists uncritically accepted european characterisation of india as an unchanging, timeless, rural society. instead of questioning its very basis, most of the anti-imperialist responses sought to prove the superiority of this spiritual and rural india over the industrial, materialistic west.while mahatma gandhi exemplified the extreme end of this reaction, even socialists and hindu nationalists were not immune from this delusion. they failed to see that decline of urban centres and industry was itself the by-product of colonial rule, and historically, india had one of the highest rates of urbanisation.most things we know of and take pride in indian history comes from the cities and urban milieu and not some timeless village. this is also not surprising because it is the rise of cities that heralds the rise of civilisation  for it is when a society has reached a certain threshold of social and economic sophistication, driven by technical advances, that it becomes distinct from subsistence existence.however, the post-independence indian polity remained attached to agrarianism and ruralism with ceaseless eulogies to the kisan as annadata. instead of recognising that farming is just another source of livelihood, the polity has converted it into the essence of india with excessive sentimentality nurtured over decades. it is reflected in a policy that privileges the farmers not just over urban dwellers but also the other sections of rural society, most notably agrarian labourers. the demands at the centre of the current farmer protests demonstrate this distortion in the indian polity.those spearheading the protests belong to the class of capitalist farmers that rose during the green revolution in north-western india. government support in the form of subsidies, minimum support prices (msps), free water, electricity, credit, among other measures, was critical to the formation of this class  apart from the expansion of landholding either through forced purchase or outright land-grab from the dalit castes and small farmers.this segment of farmers also acquired interests in moneylending and trade and commerce, which they think is under threat from the entry of the agri-business companies. but since no one wants to be seen as anti-farmer and to question complex politics within an agrarian society, the cause has gained wide traction in the public, intelligentsia, and political parties.however, do note that 86% of farmers in the country are small and marginal farmers who are net-buyers of the food grains. forcing the state to sustain artificially high prices feeds into inflation and hurts these farmers, apart from the large population of landless labourers.in punjab alone, dalits are around 32% of the population, but hardly own 3% of the agricultural land. the higher msp and perverse incentives it creates has distorted cropping patterns, destroyed biodiversity and caused environmental and ecological havoc with depletion of water tables, degradation of soil and smog engulfing the entire north india as arid punjab is now cultivating rice.we refuse to accept that agriculture is the private sector and farmers are private producers. there is no obligation on the part of the state to ensure desired prices and profits to one class of private producers over others. why only farmers then?

(File photo)A delegation of the Shiromani Akali Dal, the BJPs ally in Punjab that quit the alliance protesting the farm Bills, met Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray Sunday to secure Shiv Senas support for the ongoing farmers agitation.The meeting took place at the CMs official bungalow Varsha in Mumbai. The Akali team was led by its vice president and MP, Prem Singh Chandumajra.Uddhav Thackeray has assured us that the Shiv Sena will support all the programmes pursued in the interest of farmers. The Maharashtra CM also promised to come to Delhi and attend a coordination committee two weeks later to draw up a future plan, said Chandumajra.Akali Dal veteran Parkash Singh Badal will lead the coordination committee. Ahead of its meeting, SAD leaders were meeting several regional political parties across states to seek their support. High on their agenda is a meeting with NCP president Sharad Pawar, too.Indeed, before the Sena-Akali meeting, NCP veteran and former Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, accompanied by Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and Social Welfare minister Dhananjay Munde, met Shiv Sena (MP) Sanjay Raut at his Bhandup residence.Said Sharad Pawar: When farmers from Punjab and Haryana take to protest in the streets, the Centre should have taken it seriously. Unfortunately, it was not tackled with the required urgency to defuse the protest at the very beginning, he said.Underlining the crucial significance of Punjab and Haryana as the two states which provide rice and wheat on a large scale to the country and play a key role in foodgrain exports to many countries, Pawar said: The role of Punjab and Haryana is immense. Any unrest in these states does not augur well for nation. As the unrest is not going to be restricted to Delhiit has the danger of spilling all over country.Maharashtra is among the non BJP-ruled states which has refused to implement the three Central laws. But its response has been marked by confusion.In the Lok Sabha, the Sena had supported the Bills but its members expressed reservations and abstained from voting in Rajya Sabha. Unlike in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers took to streets backed by political parties including the Congress and Akali Dal, in Maharashtra leaders have been more cautious.Initially, the response from various farmers organisations was lukewarm with little unanimity among various groups. Significantly, this was reflected in the coalitions response as well with Maharashtra being the first state to implement the ordinance before these Bills were passed in Parliament.Deputy Chief Minister and NCPs Ajit Pawar was upset and the ordinance was withdrawn attributing it to bureaucratic bungling.However, Congress and NCP in Maharashtra are now determined not to accept these three laws. Maharashtra has over 302 APMCs. Any attempt to implement these would make these redundant, said a senior Minister.Then there is politics, too. The Congress and NCP have a stronghold on APMCs and will resist any erosion of these.Where will small and marginal farmers go to sell their crop? said the Minister. The nearby APMC provides them an assured market and income based on real-time market rates. In the absence of APMCs, the small and marginal farmers, who constitute 78 per cent of the 1.56 crore farmers in Maharashtra, will become vulnerable to traders and big-business owners, said the Minister.

2020-12-06,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/crop-burning-season-over-why-is-delhi-air-still-bad-7094604/,"‘Crop burning season over, why is Delhi air still bad?’","Stubble burning in northwest India pushes Delhis already strained air quality into emergency levels in Oct, Nov. (Express Archive)As air quality remained close to severe levels Sunday, farmers protesting at Delhis Singhu border said stubble burning does not have an impact on air pollution in the national capital. Doing away with the environmental compensation fines for stubble burning is among the demands made by protesting farmers from the Centre, in addition to their main demand of repealing all three new farm laws.The paddy harvest season is over, fields are not on fire anymore, but why is Delhis air quality still bad? asked Balkar Singh (61), a farmer from Punjabs Patiala district. There are so many vehicles in Delhi, so many factories, and new construction work has been happening  that is the cause of pollution here, not stubble fires. We have lived in Punjab all our lives, we are not troubled by the smoke, he said.The post-monsoon practice of stubble burning in northwest India pushes Delhis already strained air quality into emergency levels in October and November. Every year, the Ministry of Earth Sciences air quality monitor SAFAR publishes daily figures on the contribution of stubble burning in northwest India to Delhis PM 2.5 levels. On a single day this November, the contribution peaked to 42% and remained above 15% on 12 days, which could be the result of a higher number of stubble burning cases in Punjab this year.Using force will always cause resistance. Farmers need to be inspired to prevent burning of stubble The government has been forcing fines on us just like they have forced these new laws, said Nirmal Singh (80), a farmer from Punjabs Rupnagar district.In Punjab, so far the largest stubble burning state, there were 76,000 fire counts between September 21 and November 24, as per satellite data from the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre. This was the highest number of fire counts for the season since 2016, when there were over 81,000 instances.Referring to the recently formed Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas, which may impose a penalty of up to Rs 1 crore or a jail term of up to five years, or both for stubble burning, Singh said:  does a small-scale farmer have that much money?Punjab government officials also agreed that the reason behind more fires this year was the protest against the new laws.Unlike many other farmers, Singh uses a machine that chops and tills the paddy straw back into the soil  an in-situ stubble management method that states have pushed heavily over the last few years. These machines are being offered to individual farmers at 50% subsidy and to custom hiring centres (CHCs) at 80% subsidy in Punjab and Haryana under a 100% centrally funded scheme.But Singh said that despite the subsidies, small-scale farmers cannot afford these machines, even if one has to take them on rent from the CHCs.A solution to move farmers away from the practice, said Satgur Singh (29), a farmer from Patiala, is to increase their income. Growing paddy has also affected groundwater levels in Punjab, in addition to the air pollution from straw burning. But it is being done since years and cannot be stopped immediately. Perhaps if we focused on organic farming, which may give farmers more profit on their crop, and move them away from machineries and pesticides manufactured by corporates, then they will stop the practice gradually on their own, he said.Another long term alternative is providing job opportunities to younger people to reduce dependence on farming, said Ram Singh (29), a farmer from Moga district. If we need to stop the fires, farmers have to be compensated. The quality of our rice is among the best in the world and we make a lot of effort in growing it, but removing stubble from the field is a difficult task, he said.

(express archive)as air quality remained close to severe levels sunday, farmers protesting at delhis singhu border said stubble burning does not have an impact on air pollution in the national capital. doing away with the environmental compensation fines for stubble burning is among the demands made by protesting farmers from the centre, in addition to their main demand of repealing all three new farm laws.the paddy harvest season is over, fields are not on fire anymore, but why is delhis air quality still bad? asked balkar singh (61), a farmer from punjabs patiala district. there are so many vehicles in delhi, so many factories, and new construction work has been happening  that is the cause of pollution here, not stubble fires. we have lived in punjab all our lives, we are not troubled by the smoke, he said.the post-monsoon practice of stubble burning in northwest india pushes delhis already strained air quality into emergency levels in october and november. every year, the ministry of earth sciences air quality monitor safar publishes daily figures on the contribution of stubble burning in northwest india to delhis pm 2.5 levels. on a single day this november, the contribution peaked to 42% and remained above 15% on 12 days, which could be the result of a higher number of stubble burning cases in punjab this year.using force will always cause resistance. farmers need to be inspired to prevent burning of stubble the government has been forcing fines on us just like they have forced these new laws, said nirmal singh (80), a farmer from punjabs rupnagar district.in punjab, so far the largest stubble burning state, there were 76,000 fire counts between september 21 and november 24, as per satellite data from the punjab remote sensing centre. this was the highest number of fire counts for the season since 2016, when there were over 81,000 instances.referring to the recently formed commission for air quality management in ncr and adjoining areas, which may impose a penalty of up to rs 1 crore or a jail term of up to five years, or both for stubble burning, singh said:  does a small-scale farmer have that much money?punjab government officials also agreed that the reason behind more fires this year was the protest against the new laws.unlike many other farmers, singh uses a machine that chops and tills the paddy straw back into the soil  an in-situ stubble management method that states have pushed heavily over the last few years. these machines are being offered to individual farmers at 50% subsidy and to custom hiring centres (chcs) at 80% subsidy in punjab and haryana under a 100% centrally funded scheme.but singh said that despite the subsidies, small-scale farmers cannot afford these machines, even if one has to take them on rent from the chcs.a solution to move farmers away from the practice, said satgur singh (29), a farmer from patiala, is to increase their income. growing paddy has also affected groundwater levels in punjab, in addition to the air pollution from straw burning. but it is being done since years and cannot be stopped immediately. perhaps if we focused on organic farming, which may give farmers more profit on their crop, and move them away from machineries and pesticides manufactured by corporates, then they will stop the practice gradually on their own, he said.another long term alternative is providing job opportunities to younger people to reduce dependence on farming, said ram singh (29), a farmer from moga district. if we need to stop the fires, farmers have to be compensated. the quality of our rice is among the best in the world and we make a lot of effort in growing it, but removing stubble from the field is a difficult task, he said. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest delhi news, download indian express app. the indian express (p) ltd"

2020-12-17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/by-jan-grain-stock-to-be-2-7-times-more-than-needed/articleshow/79770001.cms,"By Jan, grain stock to be 2.7 times more than needed","NEW DELHI: Government figures show that Food Corporation of India procurement has far exceeded the buffer stock limit and by January 1,2021, India will have foodgrain reserves 2.7 times more that what is required, reflecting sustained procurement but also a massive problem of plenty.Figures show procurement continued even after FCI stocks met the demands of the countrys food security and other welfare schemes. The stock is high despite the government offloading a large quantity of wheat and rice under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna. Even the high offloading during the Covid-19 pandemic to help the poor and migrants could not deplete Indias foodgrain mountain, underlining a robust procurement system as also the costs of pruchase and storage.Analysis of past data shows that the MSP of paddy increased by 43% in 2020-21 crop year compared to 2013-14, while the support price for wheat recorded an increase of 41% during the period. The hike can be attributed to the Centres decision to put the MSP of crops at a minimum 50% over the cost of production which also include imputed cost of family labour.These figures were also shared with farm unions by agriculture ministry officials during the first two round of talks, explaining how the mechanism will continue to sustain food security in the country without compromising on farmer incomes.Officials said the increase in MSP and procurement of two major crops paddy and wheat  reflected the intent of the government to continue it without disruption. Though procurement of pulses and oilseeds has also gained momentum in past two-three years, its extent will depend on the states proposals.Procurement of paddy and wheat too recorded substantial increase during the 2013-14 to 2020-21 period. Though the procurement is mainly concentrated in few states including Punjab , Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh, it has more to do with the marketable surplus and robust government-regulated mandi system.The intentions of the incumbent government regarding MSP and procurement should be better judged from its actions. During the last six years, the current government at the Centre has given three major pushes to the MSP regime, said Ramesh Chand, member, Niti Aayog, in his working paper on new farm laws and its implication.These three major pushes include a new benchmark for MSP, which ensures 50% or higher margin on cost; expansion of procurement for ensuring MSP to some other crops such as oilseeds, and a new scheme to extend financial support and share cost/losses to states that pay MSP to farmers for pulses.","new delhi: government figures show that food corporation of india procurement has far exceeded the buffer stock limit and by january 1,2021, india will have foodgrain reserves 2.7 times more that what is required, reflecting sustained procurement but also a massive problem of plenty.figures show procurement continued even after fci stocks met the demands of the countrys food security and other welfare schemes. the stock is high despite the government offloading a large quantity of wheat and rice under pm garib kalyan ann yojna. even the high offloading during the covid-19 pandemic to help the poor and migrants could not deplete indias foodgrain mountain, underlining a robust procurement system as also the costs of pruchase and storage.analysis of past data shows that the msp of paddy increased by 43% in 2020-21 crop year compared to 2013-14, while the support price for wheat recorded an increase of 41% during the period. the hike can be attributed to the centres decision to put the msp of crops at a minimum 50% over the cost of production which also include imputed cost of family labour.these figures were also shared with farm unions by agriculture ministry officials during the first two round of talks, explaining how the mechanism will continue to sustain food security in the country without compromising on farmer incomes.officials said the increase in msp and procurement of two major crops paddy and wheat  reflected the intent of the government to continue it without disruption. though procurement of pulses and oilseeds has also gained momentum in past two-three years, its extent will depend on the states proposals.procurement of paddy and wheat too recorded substantial increase during the 2013-14 to 2020-21 period. though the procurement is mainly concentrated in few states including punjab , haryana, madhya pradesh, telangana and chhattisgarh, it has more to do with the marketable surplus and robust government-regulated mandi system.the intentions of the incumbent government regarding msp and procurement should be better judged from its actions. during the last six years, the current government at the centre has given three major pushes to the msp regime, said ramesh chand, member, niti aayog, in his working paper on new farm laws and its implication.these three major pushes include a new benchmark for msp, which ensures 50% or higher margin on cost; expansion of procurement for ensuring msp to some other crops such as oilseeds, and a new scheme to extend financial support and share cost/losses to states that pay msp to farmers for pulses."

One such place is social media.Ask me. I should know.A few days ago I posted a photograph of a biryani with boiled eggs and potatoes mixed with the rice and meat on Twitter. This was enough to set off a storm. On one side were ranged the Bengalis on Twitter (often the most articulate group on social media) who recognized the biryani as one of their own. And on the other was nearly everybody else. This included biryani purists from Lucknow and others from Hyderabad who claimed that their versions were the only real biryanis.If you are unfamiliar with the biryani wars, then heres some of the background. Biryani was invented in Delhi. (Dont believe all that nonsense about it being a Persian dish. There is no rice dish called biryani in Iran.) It travelled from Delhi to Lucknow (Awadh) where it attained what many people (mainly people from Lucknow, admittedly) consider its most sublime form --- though in Lucknow, chefs prefer to call it a pulao. When the Mughals sent a Governor to the South, to set up a court in Hyderabad, the dish travelled with him and took on a new form. This was the creation of the tangier Hyderabadi Biryani.Till recently, most Indian restaurants served either Awadhi biryani or Hyderabadi. As time has gone on though, a hybrid (Awadh style but with some Hyderabadi flavours) biryani created by ITC for its Dum Pukht restaurants (in which each portion of biryani is served in an individual pot, its top sealed with flour), has become the reference biryani for many upmarket restaurants.This is well and good but it obscures the fact that there are biryanis all over India which are just as good. Many of them, I suspect, are rice-and-meat dishes that predated the Mughals but which we now call biryani. The biryanis of Kerala are one obvious example.But because we think of biryani as a North Indian dish, chefs struggle to find nawabi origins for every biryani. In Bengal, they say that when Wajid Ali Shah was exiled there he asked his chefs to recreate his favourite Awadhi biryani. Just as the Hyderabadi biryani may have had its roots in Delhi or Awadh but is quite distinct and different, the Bengal Biryani now has little to do with the biryanis of Lucknow (Awadh) or Delhi.A key point of difference is the potatoWe can be sure that when Mughal cooks made biryani, they did not use potatoes because the vegetable itself was only introduced to India by Europeans. (It was discovered in South America.) But by the time Wajid Ali Shah was exiled to Bengal (1856), the British had planted potatoes in many parts of India even though they had not yet become part of the general diet.There are two versions of how the potato became an integral part of the Calcutta biryani. The nice-nice version is that Wajid Ali Shah was so delighted by a biryani with potatoes that he made it the Court recipe. The more cynical version is that his family did not have the money to put lots of meat into biryani. So it settled on the cheaper potato as a way of extending the biryani. (There is some dispute over the stage at which boiled eggs became part of the recipe.)For over a century the meat and potato biryani has become the standard biryani in Bengal and in parts of neighbouring Bihar (where many of the biryani cooks in Calcutta come from). If Wajid Ali Shahs original intention had truly been to enjoy the biryani of his native Awadh, then his legacy does not reflect that. The Bengal biryani is as much like an Awadhi biryani as an eagle is like a penguin: they may both be birds but thats about it.Till recently, the Bengal biryani was a local delicacy but now, fortunately, regional biryanis are entering the culinary mainstream and challenging the hegemony of the North Indian biryani. This has caused immense grief to so-called biryani purists who rage against the Bengal biryani. And Bengalis are almost fanatically loyal to their own biryani. Hence the conflict and the fireworks.At the centre of the objection to the Bengal biryani is the potato. It is not authentic, say the purists. If authentic means that it was not part of the original recipe when biryani was invented, thats fair enough. But rare is the recipe that has remained static for centuries so I dont think that this is much of an objection.There is another problem. The addition of the potato is not a purely Bengali thing. There are other communities that add potatoes to their biryani. Many Gujarati Muslims (Khojas, Memons and Bohras) add potatoes to their biryani. (As a matter of interest there were Muslims in Gujarat when the Mughals were still living in the trees. The first mosque in India was built in Gujarat in the seventh century.)It is possible that, as is the case in Kerala, the Gujarati Muslim rice dishes were not called biryanis till the term gained popularity a thousand years later but they are certainly not recent inventions. And because many of these Gujarati communities lived on the coast and worked as traders, it is possible that they had greater access to new vegetables and ingredients from abroad.Even Sindhis add potato to their biryani. Just as so many North Indians are now fulminating against Bengali biryani, there has been a Punjabi vs Sindhi divide in the Pakistani city of Karachi where the Punjabis have complained about the Sindhi love of a biryani with potatoes.So a potato packed biryani is not a novel concept restricted only to Bengal and popularized by the descendants of an exiled nawab. You find it all over the sub-continent.But why hasnt it penetrated very far into the Hindu heartland?I asked Kurush Dalal, the culinary sociologist , about this.He said he found it interesting that there were bizarre similarities on both the coasts.Dalal is right. While people rave and rant about Bengal biryani, they forget that biryani with potatoes is also found at many biryani-restaurants in Mumbai. The reason is simple enough. Many of the great Mumbai Muslim restaurants have Gujarati Muslim owners.Sadly many of them dont serve the food of their own communities but prefer a faux  North Indian menu. They give themselves away however when you try their biryani which often include potatoes, which is not a very North Indian thing to do.Dalal suggests that many Gujarati Muslims are shrewd businessmen and recognized long ago that you could slash the costs of making a biryani if you replaced some of the meat with potatoes.One consequence of this is that Mumbai people are not as horrified by the idea of a biryani with potatoes (or even boiled eggs) because they have regularly eaten such biryanis and have been told that they are North Indian in origin. (It is still hard to get authentic Awadhi biryanis in Mumbai.)Nor do people in Mumbai have much interest in the Court cuisine traditions that surround biryani elsewhere. Even in Calcutta where biryani places sell inexpensive versions of the dish, they go on and on about Wajid Ali Shah and claim that the founders of all the restaurants were Court cooks. Mumbais biryanis are made by members of a trading community and while they may not be true to the cuisine of any one community, they are totally egalitarian.It is possible that some of the contempt people who claim to be biryani purists have for potato-biryanis is because they feel they deviate from the traditions of the Emperors, the Nawabs and the Nizams.At a Mughal feast, a biryani was just one of the many dishes served. In Calcutta, biryani is the whole meal. And that may be crucial.Anjan Chatterjee who makes a Bengali biryani at his very successful Oh Calcutta chain of restaurants, emphasises that in Bengal, a biryani is one pot meal. Because it is often all you will eat, the emphasis is on heartiness. The potato and the egg bulk out the dish and make the meal more complete.Most modern chefs do not look down on a potato biryani, despite all the social media snobbery. I asked Asma Khan (who was brought up in Calcutta) if she put potatoes into her famous biryani. She said she did but added that this was not so unusual. I believe Sindhis add it too --- also many Kashmiris living in Pakistan say they add aloo. So it is not just Bengali biryani.Atul Kochhar, another famous Indian chef argues that potatoes actually add to the appeal of the dish. Meat used to be expensive, he said and potato is an excellent alternative to absorb the flavour of rice and spices.I tend to agree with Atul. I love both Awadhi and Hyderbadi biryanis but I think the potato adds an extra something to biryani. Normally, there is just meat and rice but the texture that the potato adds gives the biryani another dimension.As Kurush Dalal says, cooks who add potatoes to biryani are more concerned with the texture than flavour. He points out that the potato is almost always fried before being added. The frying ensures that it keeps its shape and retains its texture through the cooking process. It is the bite that the potato adds that the chefs want to preserve.So: potato or no potato?Well, frankly, why should we have to choose? Why should anybody? Do we really want to become a society where there is just one kind of biryani? One kind of dal? One kind of roti?The great thing about biryani is that it is a name given to a family of dishes from all over India that reflect the glory of the region they come from.People who say that a biryani with potatoes is not a biryani are foolish and narrow-minded. So are all the agitated Bengalis who say on Twitter that theres only one biryani: theirs.This is India. We speak many languages. But we are one. So it is with our biryanis and pulaos. They take many forms.But they are our very own.To read more on The Taste With Vir, click hereFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter","the taste with vir: to potato or not to potato with biryaniart-and-cultureupdated: dec 17, 2020, 16:35 istits a very simple question: should you put a potato in your biryani?there are places where this seemingly innocuous question will provoke such strong emotions that you may regret having asked it. one such place is social media.ask me. i should know.a few days ago i posted a photograph of a biryani with boiled eggs and potatoes mixed with the rice and meat on twitter. this was enough to set off a storm. on one side were ranged the bengalis on twitter (often the most articulate group on social media) who recognized the biryani as one of their own. and on the other was nearly everybody else. this included biryani purists from lucknow and others from hyderabad who claimed that their versions were the only real biryanis.if you are unfamiliar with the biryani wars, then heres some of the background. biryani was invented in delhi.

(there is some dispute over the stage at which boiled eggs became part of the recipe.)for over a century the meat and potato biryani has become the standard biryani in bengal and in parts of neighbouring bihar (where many of the biryani cooks in calcutta come from). if wajid ali shahs original intention had truly been to enjoy the biryani of his native awadh, then his legacy does not reflect that. the bengal biryani is as much like an awadhi biryani as an eagle is like a penguin: they may both be birds but thats about it.till recently, the bengal biryani was a local delicacy but now, fortunately, regional biryanis are entering the culinary mainstream and challenging the hegemony of the north indian biryani. this has caused immense grief to so-called biryani purists who rage against the bengal biryani. and bengalis are almost fanatically loyal to their own biryani. hence the conflict and the fireworks.at the centre of the objection to the bengal biryani is the potato. it is not authentic, say the purists. if authentic means that it was not part of the original recipe when biryani was invented, thats fair enough. but rare is the recipe that has remained static for centuries so i dont think that this is much of an objection.there is another problem. the addition of the potato is not a purely bengali thing. there are other communities that add potatoes to their biryani. many gujarati muslims (khojas, memons and bohras) add potatoes to their biryani. (as a matter of interest there were muslims in gujarat when the mughals were still living in the trees. the first mosque in india was built in gujarat in the seventh century.)it is possible that, as is the case in kerala, the gujarati muslim rice dishes were not called biryanis till the term gained popularity a thousand years later but they are certainly not recent inventions. and because many of these gujarati communities lived on the coast and worked as traders, it is possible that they had greater access to new vegetables and ingredients from abroad.even sindhis add potato to their biryani. just as so many north indians are now fulminating against bengali biryani, there has been a punjabi vs sindhi divide in the pakistani city of karachi where the punjabis have complained about the sindhi love of a biryani with potatoes.so a potato packed biryani is not a novel concept restricted only to bengal and popularized by the descendants of an exiled nawab. you find it all over the sub-continent.but why hasnt it penetrated very far into the hindu heartland?i asked kurush dalal, the culinary sociologist , about this.he said he found it interesting that there were bizarre similarities on both the coasts.dalal is right. while people rave and rant about bengal biryani, they forget that biryani with potatoes is also found at many biryani-restaurants in mumbai. the reason is simple enough. many of the great mumbai muslim restaurants have gujarati muslim owners.sadly many of them dont serve the food of their own communities but prefer a faux  north indian menu. they give themselves away however when you try their biryani which often include potatoes, which is not a very north indian thing to do.dalal suggests that many gujarati muslims are shrewd businessmen and recognized long ago that you could slash the costs of making a biryani if you replaced some of the meat with potatoes.one consequence of this is that mumbai people are not as horrified by the idea of a biryani with potatoes (or even boiled eggs) because they have regularly eaten such biryanis and have been told that they are north indian in origin. (it is still hard to get authentic awadhi biryanis in mumbai.)nor do people in mumbai have much interest in the court cuisine traditions that surround biryani elsewhere. even in calcutta where biryani places sell inexpensive versions of the dish, they go on and on about wajid ali shah and claim that the founders of all the restaurants were court cooks. mumbais biryanis are made by members of a trading community and while they may not be true to the cuisine of any one community, they are totally egalitarian.it is possible that some of the contempt people who claim to be biryani purists have for potato-biryanis is because they feel they deviate from the traditions of the emperors, the nawabs and the nizams.at a mughal feast, a biryani was just one of the many dishes served. in calcutta, biryani is the whole meal. and that may be crucial.anjan chatterjee who makes a bengali biryani at his very successful oh calcutta chain of restaurants, emphasises that in bengal, a biryani is one pot meal. because it is often all you will eat, the emphasis is on heartiness. the potato and the egg bulk out the dish and make the meal more complete.most modern chefs do not look down on a potato biryani, despite all the social media snobbery. i asked asma khan (who was brought up in calcutta) if she put potatoes into her famous biryani. she said she did but added that this was not so unusual. i believe sindhis add it too --- also many kashmiris living in pakistan say they add aloo. so it is not just bengali biryani.atul kochhar, another famous indian chef argues that potatoes actually add to the appeal of the dish. meat used to be expensive, he said and potato is an excellent alternative to absorb the flavour of rice and spices.i tend to agree with atul. i love both awadhi and hyderbadi biryanis but i think the potato adds an extra something to biryani. normally, there is just meat and rice but the texture that the potato adds gives the biryani another dimension.as kurush dalal says, cooks who add potatoes to biryani are more concerned with the texture than flavour. he points out that the potato is almost always fried before being added. the frying ensures that it keeps its shape and retains its texture through the cooking process. it is the bite that the potato adds that the chefs want to preserve.so: potato or no potato?well, frankly, why should we have to choose? why should anybody? do we really want to become a society where there is just one kind of biryani? one kind of dal? one kind of roti?the great thing about biryani is that it is a name given to a family of dishes from all over india that reflect the glory of the region they come from.people who say that a biryani with potatoes is not a biryani are foolish and narrow-minded. so are all the agitated bengalis who say on twitter that theres only one biryani: theirs.this is india. we speak many languages. but we are one. so it is with our biryanis and pulaos. they take many forms.but they are our very own.to read more on the taste with vir, click herefollow more stories on facebook and twitter"

But what is the genesis of the prolonged agitation and why farmers, primarily from Punjab and Haryana, are so unhappy with the agriculture reforms?In years since the Green Revolution, farmers from Punjab and Haryana have become relatively more affluent than those elsewhere in the country - mainly due to higher yield and assured income for their produce.According to Nabard's all India rural financial inclusion survey of 2016-17, the average monthly income of an agricultural household in these two states was more than double the national average.In fact, data shows that an average farmer in Punjab earns over twice as much as a farmer in Gujarat, a state that ranks fourth in terms of monthly agriculture income.Moreover, the Nabard data shows that the rural economy in these states is heavily farm-dependent since the average monthly income of agricultural households is way higher than the average income of rural households.In both states, the monthly income of an average farming family is nearly Rs 6,000 more than the average monthly income of rural households. This gap is in stark contrast to the national picture. The average Indian farming family earns just under Rs 900 more than an average rural family.Thus, farmers from these two northern states are important stakeholders when it comes to making any changes to laws related to agriculture.Coming back to the ongoing protests, the agitating farmers fear that the new laws could potentially hurt their income and leave them at the mercy of corporates. How? With the gradual end of the Minimum Support Price ( MSP ) system and exploitative bargaining by companies.MSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers.Punjab and Haryana farmers mainly grow wheat and paddy, two crops for which government offers assured procurement at MSP. This system allows farmers - both small and large - to sell their produce at guaranteed prices to government agencies. It also gives them a safety net that farmers growing crops not covered by MSP don't have.The Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) - which is the main state-run grain procurement agency - largely buys only paddy and wheat at MSP.The FCI then sells these food grains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses.Data suggests that farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been the principal beneficiaries of the government's procurement system over the years.To put things in perspective, more than 95% of paddy growers in Punjab benefit from MSP compared to only 3.6% in Uttar Pradesh.However, there is also a negative impact of the present system. Due to guaranteed procurement, most Punjab farmers don't have the incentive to diversify to other crops.Moreover, experts point out that rice cultivation is depleting the water table by as much as 0.7 metres a year in central Punjab and there is going to be the question of unsustainable agriculture in the state.But is MSP the primary fear of these farmers? Largely, yes.While farmers have raised a few other concerns with the new laws, the fear that the MSP system might eventually go away lies at the heart of the protest.The government has maintained that the MSP is an administrative decision and will stay as it is. It has also said that it's ready to give a written assurance that the system will continue under the new laws. However, it has refused to provide legal assurance for the same.The farmers, meanwhile, are not buying the Centre's assurances and have said that they won't budge until the government withdraws all the three laws. Some farmer leaders are claiming that they have come prepared for an agitation that could last ""several months"".","here's understanding the farm law protest in 5 charts:the ground situationwhy punjab, haryana farmers love msphere are some of the key concerns of the protesting farmers:so will the msp really end?new delhi: the farmers ' agitation against the centre's three new agriculture laws is well into its third week with no end of the stalemate in sight.the matter has reached the supreme court, which said that the protests should be allowed to continue and asked the government to consider putting the contentious laws on hold.however, the centre has refused the apex court's suggestion and hopes to resolve the impasse through talks. but what is the genesis of the prolonged agitation and why farmers, primarily from punjab and haryana, are so unhappy with the agriculture reforms?in years since the green revolution, farmers from punjab and haryana have become relatively more affluent than those elsewhere in the country - mainly due to higher yield and assured income for their produce.according to nabard's all india rural financial inclusion survey of 2016-17, the average monthly income of an agricultural household in these two states was more than double the national average.in fact, data shows that an average farmer in punjab earns over twice as much as a farmer in gujarat, a state that ranks fourth in terms of monthly agriculture income.moreover, the nabard data shows that the rural economy in these states is heavily farm-dependent since the average monthly income of agricultural households is way higher than the average income of rural households.in both states, the monthly income of an average farming family is nearly rs 6,000 more than the average monthly income of rural households. this gap is in stark contrast to the national picture. the average indian farming family earns just under rs 900 more than an average rural family.thus, farmers from these two northern states are important stakeholders when it comes to making any changes to laws related to agriculture.coming back to the ongoing protests, the agitating farmers fear that the new laws could potentially hurt their income and leave them at the mercy of corporates. how? with the gradual end of the minimum support price ( msp ) system and exploitative bargaining by companies.msp is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers.punjab and haryana farmers mainly grow wheat and paddy, two crops for which government offers assured procurement at msp. this system allows farmers - both small and large - to sell their produce at guaranteed prices to government agencies. it also gives them a safety net that farmers growing crops not covered by msp don't have.the food corporation of india ( fci ) - which is the main state-run grain procurement agency - largely buys only paddy and wheat at msp.the fci then sells these food grains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses.data suggests that farmers from punjab and haryana have been the principal beneficiaries of the government's procurement system over the years.to put things in perspective, more than 95% of paddy growers in punjab benefit from msp compared to only 3.6% in uttar pradesh.however, there is also a negative impact of the present system. due to guaranteed procurement, most punjab farmers don't have the incentive to diversify to other crops.moreover, experts point out that rice cultivation is depleting the water table by as much as 0.7 metres a year in central punjab and there is going to be the question of unsustainable agriculture in the state.but is msp the primary fear of these farmers? largely, yes.while farmers have raised a few other concerns with the new laws, the fear that the msp system might eventually go away lies at the heart of the protest.the government has maintained that the msp is an administrative decision and will stay as it is. it has also said that it's ready to give a written assurance that the system will continue under the new laws. however, it has refused to provide legal assurance for the same.the farmers, meanwhile, are not buying the centre's assurances and have said that they won't budge until the government withdraws all the three laws. some farmer leaders are claiming that they have come prepared for an agitation that could last ""several months""."

From farmers of a particular village cooking by their tractor-trolleys to feed themselves and share with the public, to large-scale langars  sewa through feeding runs throughout the protests. And some of the largest langars give an idea of the organisations involved.* The largest support set-up at Singhu border appears to be by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. With their tents close to the stage at the very front of the protest, at any point of time, over a hundred people can be seen lined up to receive cooked food. They have also set up separate night shelters for men and women with a total area of 6,000 square feet, medicine distribution, and other essential supplies such as tarpaulin sheets.* At Tikri border, the langar organised by the Baba Kashmir Singh ji Bhuriwale sect,located on the Rohtak highway, seven kilometres from the border, is among the largest, catering to thousands every day. While tea is available round the clock, the volunteers, including many who have flown in from abroad, also serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at the tent. The organisation had made news during the lockdown after the Amritsar administration praised it for feeding hundreds of people daily. Anand Jot Singh, a high school graduate from Canada who has been volunteering at Tikri, said supplies are sourced from districts across Punjab, where the organisation has a large presence. While the tent was already overflowing with vegetables and grain supplies, more freshly-arrived items were being offloaded from a mini truck. A senior member of the organisation said donations are all being made voluntarily.* While other organisations have been focusing on cooked meals, at both sites, international organisation Khalsa Aid has been focusing on providing daily essential items from toothpaste to blankets. We have not yet sought donations for running protest-related initiatives. In our case, money donated for a particular cause is spent only towards that cause. For example, funds collected to help the Rohingyas in Bangladesh will not be used here, said Gurcharan Singh, in charge of its makeshift centre at Tikri. At Singhu, they have created a timetable for distribution of items throughout the day  with separate time-slots for essential items such as toothbrushes, soap, mosquito repellent, undergarments and warmers; for tarpaulin sheets; for shawls; for vegetables. They have also, famously, installed foot massaging machines and have set up a night shelter with a capacity for 350 people equipped with fire extinguishers for safety. Professionals are available at its Tikri centre to apply joint pain relieving oil to the elderly.*A few kilometres into the Singhu border protest, a massive langar has been set up by Dera Baba Jagtar Singh of Tarn Taran and its various branches. According to Baba Joga Singh, a Jathedar of the organisation, supplies have been arriving at all three borders, including Ghaziabad, from various centres of theirs such as in Shahabad Markanda in Haryanas Kurukshetra district, Gurudwara Jamni Sahib in Punjabs Ferozepur district, Panjokhra Sahib Gurudwara in Ambala and their primary centre in Tarn Taran. Everything that is being sent from the centres has been donated in large quantities by people of villages surrounding them. Everyone involved in the donation, transportation, cooking and serving are all performing kar sewa, he said. Spread around their tent are piles of bags of vegetables, vessels of milk, and even bags of supplies such as nail-clippers.*At Tikri, the Jamindara Student Organisation, which claims to be active in Haryana and parts of Delhi, is running one of the biggest langars and medical centres. Mann, who identifies himself as the general secretary of JSO, said they are receiving a steady supply of vegetables, milk, rice, flour and pulses from rural Haryana. A portion of the JSOs sprawling tent, near the main stage at Tikri, also doubles up as a night shelter for many protesters. Mann, who claims to have been associated with the ABVP as well as the SFI during his college days, says JSO has over 25,000 registered members.*Smaller but still substantial langars have been set up by individual gurdwaras, such as the langar set up by Gurudwara Head Darbar Kot Puran in Ropar, Punjab, who have been at Singhu border since December 4. Everything we have, we are getting in donation from villagers and city dwellers. We have 25 people from our side on the site at all times, and fresh supplies of ingredients keep coming from our centre. We are here not because anyone has asked us to but because it is our moral duty. We are completely tied to them. We eat from what they give us which is why it is our duty to be with them, said Avtar Singh, who was overseeing the langar.*Also running a large centre, with a night shelter, two medical desks and a langar at Singhu border, is International Panthic Dal, a Sikh volunteer organisation which claims to be aligned to Damdami Taksal, which has branches in the UK, Canada, the USA, Australia and the Middle East.

for tarpaulin sheets; for shawls; for vegetables. they have also, famously, installed foot massaging machines and have set up a night shelter with a capacity for 350 people equipped with fire extinguishers for safety. professionals are available at its tikri centre to apply joint pain relieving oil to the elderly.*a few kilometres into the singhu border protest, a massive langar has been set up by dera baba jagtar singh of tarn taran and its various branches. according to baba joga singh, a jathedar of the organisation, supplies have been arriving at all three borders, including ghaziabad, from various centres of theirs such as in shahabad markanda in haryanas kurukshetra district, gurudwara jamni sahib in punjabs ferozepur district, panjokhra sahib gurudwara in ambala and their primary centre in tarn taran. everything that is being sent from the centres has been donated in large quantities by people of villages surrounding them. everyone involved in the donation, transportation, cooking and serving are all performing kar sewa, he said. spread around their tent are piles of bags of vegetables, vessels of milk, and even bags of supplies such as nail-clippers.*at tikri, the jamindara student organisation, which claims to be active in haryana and parts of delhi, is running one of the biggest langars and medical centres. mann, who identifies himself as the general secretary of jso, said they are receiving a steady supply of vegetables, milk, rice, flour and pulses from rural haryana. a portion of the jsos sprawling tent, near the main stage at tikri, also doubles up as a night shelter for many protesters. mann, who claims to have been associated with the abvp as well as the sfi during his college days, says jso has over 25,000 registered members.*smaller but still substantial langars have been set up by individual gurdwaras, such as the langar set up by gurudwara head darbar kot puran in ropar, punjab, who have been at singhu border since december 4. everything we have, we are getting in donation from villagers and city dwellers. we have 25 people from our side on the site at all times, and fresh supplies of ingredients keep coming from our centre. we are here not because anyone has asked us to but because it is our moral duty. we are completely tied to them. we eat from what they give us which is why it is our duty to be with them, said avtar singh, who was overseeing the langar.*also running a large centre, with a night shelter, two medical desks and a langar at singhu border, is international panthic dal, a sikh volunteer organisation which claims to be aligned to damdami taksal, which has branches in the uk, canada, the usa, australia and the middle east. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest india news, download indian express app."

The post says in this Kharif season, the purchase of crops on MSP is continuing. Government agencies have bought rice worth Rs 77,957.83 crore at the price of MSP so far and 49% of the purchase is from Punjab alone. But some forces are misleading farmers and running their agenda, the post said.In a video message, the actor warned of sending a legal notice to the party. They have been shameless by using my picture in their poster, while Im protesting against the farm laws at Singhu border. They have made me a poster boy of the BJP without my permission. I oppose the farm laws and can never be a part of their promotion. They have used my Sikh identity to show people are happy but thats not the case.

The laws will allow farmers to trade freely without any license or stock limit and lead to increase in availability of buyers for the produce, the report states. However, the farmers fear the laws will lead to the end of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and want them to be withdrawn.The SBI Ecowrap report suggests five ways that could end the impasse over the new laws:The report suggests that the government can insert a quantity guarantee clause for a minimum period of 5 years instead of MSP as a price guarantee. This would ensure that procurement to production percentage of crops is at least equal to last years' percentage except in events like droughts, floods, etc.""Historical procurement trends indicate that only 25 to 35 per cent of total wheat production has been procured over the years, with largest procurement happening through Punjab and Haryana. While, in case of rice, procurement has been in range of 30 to 40 per cent with significant procurement by Telangana, Punjab, Haryana and Kerala,"" the report noted.In the recent kharif procurement regime, Punjab has witnessed a staggering procurement of 55 per cent even though it ranks third in paddy production. While, procurement from top paddy producing states of West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh has been nil and 8 per cent, respectively.However, most government procurement centres in Punjab, Haryana and a few other states are located within the notified APMC mandis. Farmers fear that encouraging tax-free private trade outside these mandis will make these markets unviable and thereby lead to reduction in government procurement.The SBI report further suggested that MSP regime be converted to floor price of auction on National Agriculture Market (eNAM) portal.eNAM is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. These were formed to provide a common online market platform to facilitate trade and provide better price discovery through transparent auction process based on quality of produce.At present, there are about 1,000 APMC mandis, 1.45 lakh traders and 1.67 crore farmers registered on eNAM.However, the report admits that converting MSP to a floor price of auction on the eNAM portal will not completely solve the problem as the current data shows that average modal prices in e-NAM mandis is lower than the minimum support price in all commodities except urad.Efforts must also continue to strengthen APMC market infrastructure, the report said. As per estimates, the monetary loss for cereals is almost Rs 27,000 crore due to harvest and post-harvest losses. While the losses for oilseeds and pulses are Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, respectively.After production, the produce undergoes multiple rounds of post-harvest operations, handling stages and storage before finally reaching the consumer. Each stage results into some losses which in turn leads to decrease in food availability.A 2015 report showed that 4.6-6 per cent cereals, 6.4-8.4 per cent pulses, 3.1-10 per cent oilseeds, 6.7-15.9 per cent fruits, and 4.6-12.4 per cent vegetables are lost during harvest, post-harvest operations, handling and storage.Contract farming involves an agreement between a farmer and a buyer which outline conditions for production, quality or grade of product required, terms and timeline for delivery at a pre-determined price.Establishing a contract farming institution in India that will give the exclusive right to oversee price discovery will prove beneficial, especially for small and marginal farmers as they often tend to get crowded out from the growth process, the report suggests. It will enable them to deal with large buyers as large firms often attract small growers with favourable conditions and later tightens them.Contract farming has been instrumental in providing growers access to supply chains with market and price stability, as well as technical assistance. For example, Thailand had the most extensive and widest range of crops by early 1990s. Its market certainty (52 per cent) and price stability (46 per cent) were prime factors due to which farmers participated in contract farming.The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for issue of KCC to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks.The KCC enables farmers to obtain short term loans at an interest rate of 4 per cent. On timely payment of the loan, the limit can be extended up to an amount of Rs 3 lakh. The card holder also get the facility of insurance which can provide protection to the notified crops.As of March, about Rs 7,09,500 crore KCC loans were given to 6.7 crore active KCC card users, which constitute about 40 per cent of the total agricultural loans given by them. During February-April, banks received 75 lakh KCC applications out of which 36 lakh have been issued.However, the KCC portfolio of banks has come under increasing stress due to a variety of factors like crop losses, unremunerated prices, debt waivers and the rigidity of the KCC product. Therefore, SBI Ecowrap suggests that RBI, in conjunction with the government, must introduce an operational flexibility in the structure and direct the banks to allocate a specific percentage of their loans to particularly agri start-ups to give a boost to agri supply chains in India.As per the model calculations, the SBI believes that income of farmers will rise by a sharp 35 per cent by revisiting the current scheme.","1) provide quantity guarantee instead of price2) convert msp into floor price on enam3) strengthen apmc market infrastructure4) establish contract farming

2020-12-22,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/isb-moots-brand-building-for-telangana-sona-rice/article33395427.ece,ISB moots brand building for Telangana Sona rice,"The premier business school says there is little awareness among consumers about the low-glycemic riceThe Indian School of Business (ISB) has found that there is very little awareness about Telangana Sona variety of rice among consumers and suggested implementation of an awareness building strategy for image building involving digital, television and retail outlets.Working in association with the Agriculture Department and Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) for the last six months, the premier business school has come out with a report on brand-building and marketing strategy for Telangana Sona rice. The report was released here on Tuesday by Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy.Along with the Minister, Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, Vice-Chancellor of PJTSAU V. Praveen Rao, Prof. Madhu Viswanathan, Prof. D.V.R. Seshadri, Sundeep Jammalamadaka and Sridhar Bhagavatula of ISB were present on the occasion. The report prepared by the ISB is of the view that the awareness about Telangana Sona variety rice among consumers within Telangana was only 50% and it is even lesser outside the State. The report recommended implementation of an awareness strategy by involving digital, television and retail (kirana stores) platforms along with branding it as as a healthy as well as tasty alternative to daily consumption of rice.Speaking at the event, Mr. Niranjan Reddy said the objective of the effort being made was to take the farm produce of Telangana to national and international level and help the farming community realise maximum returns to their hard work. He stated that the idea of branding Telangana farm produce was being made for the first time by the government. He pointed out the success story of Basmati variety rice stating that it was the Punjab government that had taken the variety to international level by branding it about 25 years ago. He wished that Telangana Sona variety too should be taken to similar level as it had low glycemic index (51.5%), high protein (8%) and high fibre (3%).Further, he stated that it would require lesser water for cultivation compared to several other traditional and popular varieties and would reach harvesting stage 30 days earlier compared to them. Besides, it was suitable both for Vanakalam (Kharif) and Yasangi (Rabi) seasons. Earlier, it was cultivated only in 4 lakh acres, but this Vanakalam season it was raised in 10 lakh acres in Telangana and another 5 lakh acres in seven other States.The Minister also proposed to take up similar branding for cotton, red-gram and groundnut varieties cultivated in Telangana. He explained that redgram cultivated in Narayanpet, Tandur, Makthal, western parts of Mahabubnagar and Rangareddy district would have good taste due to the soil quality there. Similarly, aflatoxin-free groundnut raised in Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool and Jogulamba-Gadwal districts has also good demand.On the quality of cotton, the Minister said Chairman and Managing Director of Cotton Corporation of India Pradeep Kumar Agarwal had himself showered praises on it. A meeting was also conducted on the occasion on taking the farm produce of Telangana to international level by involving NRIs and creating awareness among them on the produce.","the premier business school says there is little awareness among consumers about the low-glycemic ricethe indian school of business (isb) has found that there is very little awareness about telangana sona variety of rice among consumers and suggested implementation of an awareness building strategy for image building involving digital, television and retail outlets.working in association with the agriculture department and professor jayashankar telangana state agricultural university (pjtsau) for the last six months, the premier business school has come out with a report on brand-building and marketing strategy for telangana sona rice. the report was released here on tuesday by minister for agriculture s. niranjan reddy.along with the minister, secretary (agriculture) b. janardhan reddy, vice-chancellor of pjtsau v. praveen rao, prof. madhu viswanathan, prof. d.v.r. seshadri, sundeep jammalamadaka and sridhar bhagavatula of isb were present on the occasion. the report prepared by the isb is of the view that the awareness about telangana sona variety rice among consumers within telangana was only 50% and it is even lesser outside the state. the report recommended implementation of an awareness strategy by involving digital, television and retail (kirana stores) platforms along with branding it as as a healthy as well as tasty alternative to daily consumption of rice.speaking at the event, mr. niranjan reddy said the objective of the effort being made was to take the farm produce of telangana to national and international level and help the farming community realise maximum returns to their hard work. he stated that the idea of branding telangana farm produce was being made for the first time by the government. he pointed out the success story of basmati variety rice stating that it was the punjab government that had taken the variety to international level by branding it about 25 years ago. he wished that telangana sona variety too should be taken to similar level as it had low glycemic index (51.5%), high protein (8%) and high fibre (3%).further, he stated that it would require lesser water for cultivation compared to several other traditional and popular varieties and would reach harvesting stage 30 days earlier compared to them. besides, it was suitable both for vanakalam (kharif) and yasangi (rabi) seasons. earlier, it was cultivated only in 4 lakh acres, but this vanakalam season it was raised in 10 lakh acres in telangana and another 5 lakh acres in seven other states.the minister also proposed to take up similar branding for cotton, red-gram and groundnut varieties cultivated in telangana. he explained that redgram cultivated in narayanpet, tandur, makthal, western parts of mahabubnagar and rangareddy district would have good taste due to the soil quality there. similarly, aflatoxin-free groundnut raised in wanaparthy, nagarkurnool and jogulamba-gadwal districts has also good demand.on the quality of cotton, the minister said chairman and managing director of cotton corporation of india pradeep kumar agarwal had himself showered praises on it. a meeting was also conducted on the occasion on taking the farm produce of telangana to international level by involving nris and creating awareness among them on the produce."

(Express)THERE must have been a moment, a point in the ongoing agitation led by Punjab farmers, when a line was crossed. When men and women began talking less about the three Central farm laws that sparked small dharnas at petrol pumps and toll plazas across the state and more about those who started travelling to Delhis doorstep to huddle together in the cold.That moment, when the protests became a character in their own right, was missed by the BJP-led government at the Centre. Thats where it will need to go back to, to find a resolution.What is more, as The Indian Express found in a week-long journey through villages and cities across Punjabs three regions of Malwa, Doaba and Majha, talking to scores of farmers and their families, the image of the un-seeing Centre is compounded by the spate of name-calling.The protests are misguided, it was said, driven by a lobby of Leftist Modi-baiters, professional malcontents. Or hijacked by the Khalistanis, who are always seen  and imagined  in the nooks and shadows of a state that fought and defeated extremism in the 1990s and lived to tell the tales.But to many here, especially Jat Sikh farmers, at the centre of the economy, politics and culture of the state which has historically nurtured an anti-Centre streak, the Centre is again talking down to Punjab. And forcing its way.Nobody is a leader in these protests, everyone has minus-ed themselves and the farmer has taken centrestage, says Balkar Singh, who retired as professor in Punjabi University, Patiala. Look at them, sitting there in the cold. The person who is leaving behind his children and the comfort of home is not doing it at anyones bidding, says Baljit Singh in Malwas Kotra Lehal village. The government has a point, says Amritpal Singh, a farmer who also runs a shop in village Dhesian, district Hoshiarpur, in Majha region, from where the largest numbers migrate abroad and which is less roiled by the agitation than Malwa. But how can it not listen to those who are sitting out in the open?And in Amritsar, Ginni Bhatia, president of a textiles traders association, marvels Itna jazba, itni thand(such emotion, in such intense cold), and asks: Why did you not ask the beneficiary if they want the reform in the first place?To get a sense of this agitation that is assuming a life of its own with every day that passes without a resolution, you could begin with two men and a woman.Meet Sardara Singh Johl in Ludhiana, Bibi Jagir Kaur in village Begowal, and Narendra Modi in-the-Punjab-fray.Theres no point arguing the merits of the farm laws now, says 92-year-old Johl, the grand old man of agriculture economics in the state. I have supported the Bills, I can answer all the questions, but if I do it now, it will be Dr Johl versus Rest of Punjab.Over a storied 60-year career, the Padma Bhushan awardee has had one of the longest and most influential engagements with the issue of agriculture reform in Punjab  as vice chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University, member of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council.His report on crop diversification in 1986 made diversification a part of policy lexicon. I was looking ahead 50 years government did not even turn the page (of the report), he says.Johl speaks with regret about opportunities lost, being appointed to boards which did not meet, leading discussions that reached nowhere.My plan was that 1 million hectares of 2.6 million hectares under rice could be diverted to other crops to restore the water table Rs 1,600 crore could be given to farmers to compensate for the shift (to oilseeds, among other crops, which would eventually cut down the oil and pulses import bill of up to Rs 14,000 crore) There was a lack of interest in the political bosses and bureaucrats I tried again but nothing happened.Today, the question is not whether laws are good or bad. They (agitators) are saying yes or no. The old system they want to go back to is the one that pushed so many farmers to suicide. But now, government should withdraw the bills, begin again by bringing the farmers concerns into Parliament.A trust deficit stands in the way, says Johl. These are serious laws, they affect the lives of people. What was the hurry? They should have put the bills in the public domain, through Select Committee In the interest of the economy and of peace, the government must take them back, he says.At the sprawling and well-appointed Sant Prem Singh Murale Wale Dera that she heads in Begowal village of district Kapurthala, Akali Dal leader Bibi Jagir Kaur says: We are all kisans (farmers), those who are sitting there are ours. The government is looking nirdayi (hard hearted). Things should not have reached this point, we need a quick solution.In November, Kaur made a comeback as chief of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the first woman to hold that position.The SGPC, central to the management of Sikh religious affairs intricately entwined with Sikh politics, is contributing with sewa (service) at the protest sites, she says. SGPC has set up continuous guru ka langar, put up waterproof tents, provided medicines and 250 mobile toiletsFour ambulances are working, our doctors are taking turns. We are giving Rs 1 lakh to the family of those who have died during the protest, and Rs 20-25,000 to those injured in accidents on the way.What Bibi Jagir Kaur wont say is that both the SGPC and her party are playing catch-up.But you can read between her lines: I want to go there, but the first line of SAD leadership is not going to the protest sites, because we dont want to do politics. The rest, from MLA to sarpanch, are going. The Stree Akali Dal went too o assi haan (we are them, the protesters).The SAD, which walked out of the NDA on the farm bills issue, tried and failed to be the bridge between the farmers and the Centre, she says. Now the government should take the laws back, at least to begin with, so that people can come back to their homes.Dhakka nahi karna chahida hai dukh lagda hai, nuksan na ho jaye (there must be no force, we are apprehensive that things may not worsen), the SGPC chief says.The term dhakka is commonly used in Punjab, and you hear it again and again in the context of this agitation  the Centre, many say, is trying to get its way, dhakke naal(with force). But more and more, the Centre is replaced by Modi.In the course of these farmers protests, PM Modi is on the ground and in the fray in Punjab in a manner in which he has not been seen to be in other states, even during an election.One of the stand-out features of the Modi phenomenon has been his ability to establish his dominance by lifting himself above the fray  and therefore insulated from the tug and pull of accountability for failures and issues even where the BJP is the incumbent.In Rajasthan, this took the shape of a slogan, Modi tujh se bair nahi, Vasundhara teri khair nahi (We have nothing against Modi but we will not spare Vasundhara), in the election lost by the BJP and won by the Congress. Most recently, in Bihar, it was visible in the final tally that saw the BJP become the larger partner in the BJP-JD(U) alliance that was voted back to power.In Punjab, however, most of those who speak of the Centre trying to impose the farm laws on the state  dhakke naal  take Modis name. The BJP is a smaller player in Punjab and the state never whole-heartedly participated in the Modi wave that swept other states in 2014 and then again in 2019.Yet, in the battle of anakh (self-respect, honour, pride), the Jat farmers zid or insistence is pitted directly against Modis. The viral video of a song, Fer dekhange (then well see), in which a Modi-like animated figure clad in white and saffron is surrounded by youth on tractors and eventually forced to throw up his hands, speaks of larger things.

(express)there must have been a moment, a point in the ongoing agitation led by punjab farmers, when a line was crossed. when men and women began talking less about the three central farm laws that sparked small dharnas at petrol pumps and toll plazas across the state and more about those who started travelling to delhis doorstep to huddle together in the cold.that moment, when the protests became a character in their own right, was missed by the bjp-led government at the centre. thats where it will need to go back to, to find a resolution.what is more, as the indian express found in a week-long journey through villages and cities across punjabs three regions of malwa, doaba and majha, talking to scores of farmers and their families, the image of the un-seeing centre is compounded by the spate of name-calling.the protests are misguided, it was said, driven by a lobby of leftist modi-baiters, professional malcontents. or hijacked by the khalistanis, who are always seen  and imagined  in the nooks and shadows of a state that fought and defeated extremism in the 1990s and lived to tell the tales.but to many here, especially jat sikh farmers, at the centre of the economy, politics and culture of the state which has historically nurtured an anti-centre streak, the centre is again talking down to punjab. and forcing its way.nobody is a leader in these protests, everyone has minus-ed themselves and the farmer has taken centrestage, says balkar singh, who retired as professor in punjabi university, patiala. look at them, sitting there in the cold. the person who is leaving behind his children and the comfort of home is not doing it at anyones bidding, says baljit singh in malwas kotra lehal village. the government has a point, says amritpal singh, a farmer who also runs a shop in village dhesian, district hoshiarpur, in majha region, from where the largest numbers migrate abroad and which is less roiled by the agitation than malwa. but how can it not listen to those who are sitting out in the open?and in amritsar, ginni bhatia, president of a textiles traders association, marvels itna jazba, itni thand(such emotion, in such intense cold), and asks: why did you not ask the beneficiary if they want the reform in the first place?to get a sense of this agitation that is assuming a life of its own with every day that passes without a resolution, you could begin with two men and a woman.meet sardara singh johl in ludhiana, bibi jagir kaur in village begowal, and narendra modi in-the-punjab-fray.theres no point arguing the merits of the farm laws now, says 92-year-old johl, the grand old man of agriculture economics in the state. i have supported the bills, i can answer all the questions, but if i do it now, it will be dr johl versus rest of punjab.over a storied 60-year career, the padma bhushan awardee has had one of the longest and most influential engagements with the issue of agriculture reform in punjab  as vice chancellor of punjab agricultural university, member of the prime ministers economic advisory council.his report on crop diversification in 1986 made diversification a part of policy lexicon. i was looking ahead 50 years government did not even turn the page (of the report), he says.johl speaks with regret about opportunities lost, being appointed to boards which did not meet, leading discussions that reached nowhere.my plan was that 1 million hectares of 2.6 million hectares under rice could be diverted to other crops to restore the water table rs 1,600 crore could be given to farmers to compensate for the shift (to oilseeds, among other crops, which would eventually cut down the oil and pulses import bill of up to rs 14,000 crore) there was a lack of interest in the political bosses and bureaucrats i tried again but nothing happened.today, the question is not whether laws are good or bad. they (agitators) are saying yes or no. the old system they want to go back to is the one that pushed so many farmers to suicide. but now, government should withdraw the bills, begin again by bringing the farmers concerns into parliament.a trust deficit stands in the way, says johl. these are serious laws, they affect the lives of people. what was the hurry? they should have put the bills in the public domain, through select committee in the interest of the economy and of peace, the government must take them back, he says.at the sprawling and well-appointed sant prem singh murale wale dera that she heads in begowal village of district kapurthala, akali dal leader bibi jagir kaur says: we are all kisans (farmers), those who are sitting there are ours. the government is looking nirdayi (hard hearted). things should not have reached this point, we need a quick solution.in november, kaur made a comeback as chief of the shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee, the first woman to hold that position.the sgpc, central to the management of sikh religious affairs intricately entwined with sikh politics, is contributing with sewa (service) at the protest sites, she says. sgpc has set up continuous guru ka langar, put up waterproof tents, provided medicines and 250 mobile toiletsfour ambulances are working, our doctors are taking turns. we are giving rs 1 lakh to the family of those who have died during the protest, and rs 20-25,000 to those injured in accidents on the way.what bibi jagir kaur wont say is that both the sgpc and her party are playing catch-up.but you can read between her lines: i want to go there, but the first line of sad leadership is not going to the protest sites, because we dont want to do politics. the rest, from mla to sarpanch, are going. the stree akali dal went too o assi haan (we are them, the protesters).the sad, which walked out of the nda on the farm bills issue, tried and failed to be the bridge between the farmers and the centre, she says. now the government should take the laws back, at least to begin with, so that people can come back to their homes.dhakka nahi karna chahida hai dukh lagda hai, nuksan na ho jaye (there must be no force, we are apprehensive that things may not worsen), the sgpc chief says.the term dhakka is commonly used in punjab, and you hear it again and again in the context of this agitation  the centre, many say, is trying to get its way, dhakke naal(with force). but more and more, the centre is replaced by modi.in the course of these farmers protests, pm modi is on the ground and in the fray in punjab in a manner in which he has not been seen to be in other states, even during an election.one of the stand-out features of the modi phenomenon has been his ability to establish his dominance by lifting himself above the fray  and therefore insulated from the tug and pull of accountability for failures and issues even where the bjp is the incumbent.in rajasthan, this took the shape of a slogan, modi tujh se bair nahi, vasundhara teri khair nahi (we have nothing against modi but we will not spare vasundhara), in the election lost by the bjp and won by the congress. most recently, in bihar, it was visible in the final tally that saw the bjp become the larger partner in the bjp-jd(u) alliance that was voted back to power.in punjab, however, most of those who speak of the centre trying to impose the farm laws on the state  dhakke naal  take modis name. the bjp is a smaller player in punjab and the state never whole-heartedly participated in the modi wave that swept other states in 2014 and then again in 2019.yet, in the battle of anakh (self-respect, honour, pride), the jat farmers zid or insistence is pitted directly against modis. the viral video of a song, fer dekhange (then well see), in which a modi-like animated figure clad in white and saffron is surrounded by youth on tractors and eventually forced to throw up his hands, speaks of larger things. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest india news, download indian express app."

(Representational)Amid the farmers protests against Centres farm laws, the Union government has decided to set up silos with a capacity for storage of 21 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains in Punjab.While all eyes are on who would get the tenders for the silos, the allottee would have a 32 year contract under which two years would be given to set up the silos. After this, the allottee would be allowed to operate the silos for 30 years. The government would have to pay the sustenance allowance if it would not have enough grains to store in these silos.The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has sent the file regarding the setting up of silos to the Union Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies, Government of India after identifying 57 sites where these silos would come up.In a drift from its existing policy, under which the silos were set up near a railway track for easy movement of rakes containing foodgrains, the Centre has now allowed hub-and-spoke policy under which a main silo (hub), would be rail-fed and have 3-4 spokes, which would be away from the hub and also the rail tracks. These spoke silos will be connected to the hub silos through the road network.The tendering process will start after a green signal by the Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies, Government of India. The storage in silos is costlier at Rs 90 per tonne every month while the storage in other types of storage is cheaper at Rs 14 to 17 under covered godowns and Rs 4.50 per tonnes under uncovered godowns. However, the storage in silos is considered safe as it is pest and moisture resistant.In Punjab, granaries have been overflowing with wheat and rice. As many as 110 lakh tonnes of wheat from the last procurement season was lying in the open and covered godowns. The granaries still have 55 lakh tonnes of rice from last paddy procurement season. The state only has 110 lakh tonnes of capacity under covered space. These still have 25,000 metric tonnes from 2017-18 procurement season and 30 lakh tonnes from 2018-19 procurement season.Ever since the other states, including Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, have started contributing to central pool, the movement has been affected from Punjab. While the state averages outward movement of 6-7 lakh metric tonnes of rice every month, it averages 2-3 lakh metric tonnes of wheat every month from the godowns.

Nimona means mattar. Large salan mirch is filled with peas puree and cooked along with aged basmati rice. This one pairs wonderfully with kheera and anar raita, says the chef.From South, there is Konaseema Kodi Pulao, a robust chicken and rice preparation, best enjoyed with onion pachdi.Among the options from East, the collection features Metiabruz Biryani, a rice and mutton combination, cooked in onion and spices with potato and boiled eggs. It derives its name from the historic Metiabruz locality (implying Mud Tower) in Kolkata, where Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh had created his own miniature version of Lucknow after being deposed by the British.Another preparation that stands out is Bibi Ka pulao from undivided Punjab.

2020-12-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farmers-protest-farm-laws-punjab-7117524/,Farmer-mother with 3 kids to Arhtiya Boss: a growing coalition of fears and anxieties,"Patiala: Women family members of farmers protesting in Delhi, work in fields in their absence, at Daun Kalan village, in Patiala. (PTI)Jasbir Kaur, 37, is a farmer with seven acres in Chohan village off the Jalandhar-Amritsar GT Road. She grows wheat and rice, potatoes and peas. The first two are picked up by the government procurement agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and she sells the latter two crops to private traders.While the wheat and rice rates are at least pucca (predictable), she says, there is high fluctuation in the prices of non-MSP crops. Tukka chalda hai jaise jua(it is a gamble, a roll of the dice). One month ago, peas were Rs 102 a kg in the market, today she sells them to the trader at Rs 13-Rs 14 a kg.You get good prices if you stay ahead, but there are more lows than highs, no guarantee of recovering even input costs, and price fluctuation is mostly a plunge, rarely a spike. On the other side, the rates of khaad, beej, spray (fertilisers, seeds, other inputs) only rise.Also Read | Open to talks, but need a more concrete proposal, not just tweaks: Farm unions to GovernmentShe would have gone to sit at Delhis borders, says Jasbir, but she will let the protesters gathered there speak for her, they are sitting there in the cold for all of us, not just for themselves.She is held back by her circumstances. Her husband is unable to speak or hear, and after the death of her father-in-law and brother-in-law, she is the provider for her family of six which includes her mother-in-law and three school-going children.The farm laws are Modis mann ki baat, not ours, says Jasbir. Bigger private players will give us good prices for the first one or two years, and then  If Modi is worried about me, he should give more jobs here first.Also Read | Add to our offer or subtract: Narendra Tomar to farm unionsJasbir fears for her older daughter Anureet, who has just completed Class 12, and son Jashanpreet, 16  both study in the more expensive private school because it is English-medium.They will take the IELTS, she says with an air of resignation  the IELTS, prominently advertised on hoardings in the Doaba-Majha region, which also teems with IELTS centres, is a popular English language proficiency test for international study and migration. Australia is, more and more, a favoured destination from Punjab.Many young people from this village have settled abroad in Canada and the US. I dont want my children to do kisani (farming), aithe kujh nahi rakheya, theres nothing in it for them. I dont want them to go so far away from home either. But do I have a choice? There is no sarkari naukri or any other jobs here The young in my village and surrounding areas have become drug addicts Dar lagda hai, malik bacha ke rakhe(may god keep my children safe), she says.Jasbirs fear of being left alone to strike unequal bargains with large and powerful corporates, bigger than the traders she already deals with and is often exploited by, her anxieties about jobs and her childrens future, her lack of alternatives, are real. And they have gathered around the new laws that the government is seen to be pushing through and which the protesters at Delhis borders are resisting.Also Read | Chorus on ground: Dhakka from Delhi wont work, protest now has life of its ownSimilar anxieties and fears, which need to be engaged with, if not countered or addressed, echo as a refrain in conversations with several farmers across the state.You hear them most in Malwa, the largest farming belt with 14 of Punjabs 22 districts, home to a majority of the small and marginal farmers (land holdings of 1 to 5 acres), rampant farm debt and above 90 per cent of its farmer suicides.Here, concerns about the three farm laws, grounded in what they see and hear, and drawing from their own struggles and experience, are expressed most insistently by the smaller farmers.Many cite what they call the example of Jio-BSNL to illustrate their suspicion that Ambani-Adani, large corporates with deep pockets, will take advantage of the opening up. They will pay well for the initial couple of years, their story goes, only to withhold later, leaving farmers nowhere else to go  the sarkari mandi would have withered away due to neglect.The reference is to the disruption of the telecom market by Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio Infocomm by launching low-cost 4G services, driving tariffs low, its subsequent hiking of rates and growing dominance  even as the government-owned BSNL, already in a downward spiral, went further into decline.Many cite their own experience with the non-MSP, non-wheat-rice crops that they already sell to private players and traders, on which they are unable to recover input costs. Or which are bought dirt cheap from them and sold by the trader for a huge profit.Basmati, purchased from the farmer last year at Rs 3,000 per quintal but this year at Rs 1,700. Cauliflower bought from the farmer at Rs 5/kg sold in the market at Rs 50/kg. Potato bought last year at Re 1/kg sold at Rs 50-60/kg.They point to UP and Bihar. Bihar revoked the APMC Act in 2006, but fell visibly short of the stated goal of attracting private sector investment in marketing infrastructure, and creating more efficient markets for better price discovery  rice in Bihar sells at less than half the Punjab MSP.In village Kotra Lehal, in Sangrur district, from where a fresh trolley-load of men and provisions is leaving for the protest site at Delhis border, Gurtej Singh says, We see rice shellers from here go to buy rice at lower rates in UP-Bihar and make a killing by selling it here in Punjab  upto Rs 2 lakh per truck, even after accounting for transport costs.And Sandeep, whose husband has just come back from the Delhi border protests after a week, says: Farmers who have land of their own in UP-Bihar come to work as labourers on the wheat and rice fields of smaller farmers like us in Punjab. Now they are saying to us, we came here, but where will you go?Her husband Bahadur Singh articulates another anxiety: If the factories come, like some are promising, the machines will work, or the highly educated, not people like us. Till recently, not many in this village studied beyond Class 12.The government is seen not just to be unresponsive to these anxieties and fears about what is, and what might change for the worse, but also in a tearing hurry to brush these aside and bring in the new laws.Reform the flaws of the existing procurement system first, says Amarinder Singh, who has an agro-processing centre on his farm in village Lakhowal. First address its corruptions, explore more export options. Then bring alternatives to us. Show us a successful pilot experiment, where farmers have benefited from similar changes in the marketing system, he says.Baljit Singh in Kotra Lehal points to the growing sense of dissonance and disconnect: It is like we have fever and you insist on giving us medicine for stomach pain.For now, on the new laws, the farmers, farm labourers and commission agents or arhtiyas are largely speaking in the same voice. The perceived threat posed to the existing marketing regime is not just papering over their discontents with the old system, but also relegating the differences and conflicting interests within and between these three groups.The arhtiya gives timely loans in an emergency, without asking them, like the bank, to mortgage their land, say farmers  they gloss over the extortionate rates of interest that he also charges.In this agitation, the arhtiya has been accused of instigating the farmer, using him as a front. His substantial commission, protected in the government mandi, may not be assured in the new regime that promises to do away with bicholia or middlemen.At Khanna mandi, the largest grain market in Punjab, Harbans Singh Rosha, president of the Khanna association and vice president of the state association of arhtiyas, says that commission agents are supporting the farmers agitation, not driving it. Our association has set up a separate tent at the Singhu border, but we have not contributed any money  in fact, when we offered money, farmers refused it.For the arhtiyas, too, it is a larger fear.

Like the small farmer, the small arhtiya will also be finished when the big players come in, says Rosha.From the vulnerable young mother and farmer in Chohan, Jasbir Kaur, to Rosha, stodgy upholder of an older way in the mandi  the new farm laws are bringing together unlikely partners, forging new bonds of insecurity.","patiala: women family members of farmers protesting in delhi, work in fields in their absence, at daun kalan village, in patiala. (pti)jasbir kaur, 37, is a farmer with seven acres in chohan village off the jalandhar-amritsar gt road. she grows wheat and rice, potatoes and peas. the first two are picked up by the government procurement agencies at the minimum support price (msp) and she sells the latter two crops to private traders.while the wheat and rice rates are at least pucca (predictable), she says, there is high fluctuation in the prices of non-msp crops. tukka chalda hai jaise jua(it is a gamble, a roll of the dice). one month ago, peas were rs 102 a kg in the market, today she sells them to the trader at rs 13-rs 14 a kg.you get good prices if you stay ahead, but there are more lows than highs, no guarantee of recovering even input costs, and price fluctuation is mostly a plunge, rarely a spike. on the other side, the rates of khaad, beej, spray (fertilisers, seeds, other inputs) only rise.also read | open to talks, but need a more concrete proposal, not just tweaks: farm unions to governmentshe would have gone to sit at delhis borders, says jasbir, but she will let the protesters gathered there speak for her, they are sitting there in the cold for all of us, not just for themselves.she is held back by her circumstances. her husband is unable to speak or hear, and after the death of her father-in-law and brother-in-law, she is the provider for her family of six which includes her mother-in-law and three school-going children.the farm laws are modis mann ki baat, not ours, says jasbir. bigger private players will give us good prices for the first one or two years, and then  if modi is worried about me, he should give more jobs here first.also read | add to our offer or subtract: narendra tomar to farm unionsjasbir fears for her older daughter anureet, who has just completed

advertised on hoardings in the doaba-majha region, which also teems with ielts centres, is a popular english language proficiency test for international study and migration. australia is, more and

have become drug addicts dar lagda hai, malik bacha ke rakhe(may god keep my children safe), she says.jasbirs fear of being left alone to strike unequal bargains with large and powerful corporates, bigger than the traders she already deals with and is often exploited by, her anxieties about jobs and her childrens future, her lack of alternatives, are real. and they have gathered around the new laws that the government is seen to be pushing through and which the protesters at delhis borders are resisting.also read | chorus on ground: dhakka from delhi wont work, protest now has life of its ownsimilar anxieties and fears, which need to be engaged with, if not countered or addressed, echo as a refrain in conversations with several farmers across the state.you hear them most in malwa, the largest farming belt with 14 of punjabs 22 districts, home to a majority of the small and marginal farmers (land holdings of 1 to 5 acres), rampant farm debt and above 90 per cent of its farmer suicides.here, concerns about the three farm laws, grounded in what they see and hear, and drawing from their own struggles and experience, are expressed most insistently by the smaller farmers.many cite what they call the example of jio-bsnl to illustrate their suspicion that ambani-adani, large corporates with deep pockets, will take advantage of the opening up. they will pay well for the initial couple of years, their story goes, only to withhold later, leaving farmers nowhere else to go  the sarkari mandi would have withered away due to neglect.the reference is to the disruption of the telecom market by mukesh ambanis reliance jio infocomm by launching low-cost 4g services, driving tariffs low, its subsequent hiking of rates and growing dominance  even as the government-owned bsnl, already in a downward spiral, went further into decline.many cite their own experience with the non-msp, non-wheat-rice crops that they already sell to private players and traders, on which they are unable to recover input costs. or which are bought dirt cheap from them and sold by the trader for a huge profit.basmati, purchased from the farmer last year at rs 3,000 per quintal but this year at rs 1,700. cauliflower bought from the farmer at rs 5/kg sold in the market at rs 50/kg. potato bought last year at re 1/kg sold at rs 50-60/kg.they point to up and bihar. bihar revoked the apmc act in 2006, but fell visibly short of the stated goal of attracting private sector investment in marketing infrastructure, and creating more efficient markets for better price discovery  rice in bihar sells at less than half the punjab msp.in village kotra lehal, in sangrur district, from where a fresh trolley-load of men and provisions is leaving for the protest site at delhis border, gurtej singh says, we see rice shellers from here go to buy rice at lower rates in up-bihar and make a killing by selling it here in punjab  upto rs 2 lakh per truck, even after accounting for transport costs.and sandeep, whose husband has just come back from the delhi border protests after a week, says: farmers who have land of their own in up-bihar come to work as labourers on the wheat and rice fields of smaller farmers like us in punjab. now they are saying to us, we came here, but where will you go?her husband bahadur singh articulates another anxiety: if the factories come, like some are promising, the machines will work, or the highly educated, not people like us. till recently, not many in this village studied beyond class 12.the government is seen not just to be unresponsive to these anxieties and fears about what is, and what might change for the worse, but also in a tearing hurry to brush these aside and bring in the new laws.reform the flaws of the existing procurement system first, says amarinder singh, who has an agro-processing centre on his farm in village lakhowal. first address its corruptions, explore more export options. then bring alternatives to us. show us a successful pilot experiment, where farmers have benefited from similar changes in the marketing system, he says.baljit singh in kotra lehal points to the growing sense of dissonance and disconnect: it is like we have fever and you insist on giving us medicine for stomach pain.for now, on the new laws, the farmers, farm labourers and commission agents or arhtiyas are largely speaking in the same voice. the perceived threat posed to the existing marketing regime is not just papering over their discontents with the old system, but also relegating the differences and conflicting interests within and between these three groups.the arhtiya gives timely loans in an emergency, without asking them, like the bank, to mortgage their land, say farmers  they gloss over the extortionate rates of interest that he also charges.in this agitation, the arhtiya has been accused of instigating the farmer, using him as a front. his substantial commission, protected in the government mandi, may not be assured in the new regime that promises to do away with bicholia or middlemen.at khanna mandi, the largest grain market in punjab, harbans singh rosha, president of the khanna association and vice president of the state association of arhtiyas, says that commission agents are supporting the farmers agitation, not driving it. our association has set up a separate tent at the singhu border, but we have not contributed any money  in fact, when we offered money, farmers refused it.for the arhtiyas, too, it is a larger fear. for them, it is not simply about the end of a lucrative commission, but about a larger waning  they are part of a mandi regime that sustains small allied armies of pre-computer age munims (accountants) and unskilled labourers. it is about losing a way of life.already, you will not find anyone below the age of 50 in our profession. our children do not want to do this work. like the small farmer, the small arhtiya will also be finished when the big players come in, says rosha.from the vulnerable young mother and farmer in chohan, jasbir kaur, to rosha, stodgy upholder of an older way in the mandi  the new farm laws are bringing together unlikely partners,

As we move towards more robust energy consumption figures, the country faces the unique challenge of fusing together disparate needs: A ballooning appetite while cutting dependence on imports; greening the grid while ensuring affordability; and replacing old forms of energy production while boosting employment, and the human and economic capital of the people. Then theres the fact that the energy sector is closely intertwined with issues related to climate change.Needless to say, a vigorous ideation needs to undergird such energy transitions. The question is particularly cardinal for the sector I am in charge of: Petroleum and natural gas. We import about 84% of our oil and 56% of our gas for domestic use  and this in itself tends to negate the deliverables  delineated above  that we aspire to achieve.In this context, biofuels have become a tool for achieving these delicate balance of outcomes. In the past few years, progress made in the use of ethanol, compressed biogas and biodiesel  all different forms of biofuel  will have a direct positive impact on both farm incomes (and the prosperity of agricultural communities), even as it cuts down our import dependence for energy.Currently, the aim is to achieve 10% ethanol blending in petrol by 2022 and 20% blending by 2030  something that will cut down carbon emissions in vehicles.In 2019, in a first for the Republic Day parade, the Indian Air Force flew aircraft in a Vic formation, with the lead plane using a mix of traditional fuel and biofuel, symbolising the governments determination to seek alternative sources of fuel. The primary raw material for ethanol production in India is sugarcane and its by-products, accounting for more than 90% of fuel ethanol supplies under the ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme of the ministry. This programme injects liquidity into the stressed sugar sector and provides an alternative revenue stream to farmers. This programme also encourages diversion of sugarcane for ethanol production, which results in a decrease in the sugar glut in the country.Ethanol supplies have improved from 380 million litres in 2013-14 to 1.89 billion litres in 2019. Offers of about 3.5 billion litres from both sugar/molasses and grain-based distilleries are expected this year. In addition to sugarcane, ethanol is also produced from damaged food grains, B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice. This translates into a sum of nearly Rs 35,000 crore in the past six years  money that has flown back to farmers through sugar mills and distilleries as oil marketing companies (OMCs) provide off-take guarantee at fixed prices. This arrangement also improves the health of the payment cycle to farmers since OMCs settle their ethanol dues to distilleries in 21 days instead of the months that the farmers had to wait for their payment from sugar mills.The recent decision to utilise surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India and maize as an additional source of feedstock for ethanol production, starting this year, means farmers will now have an alternative market for their produce.With regards biodiesel, the National Policy on Biofuels in 2018 targets 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The policy encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil and short-gestation crops. These crops can be easily cultivated in various states on land that is barren or not fit for edible crops, thus boosting farm incomes. Biodiesel procured by OMCs for blending high speed diesel has increased from 11.9 million litres in 2015-16 to 105.5 million litres last year.The Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme launched in October 2018 aims to establish an ecosystem for production of compressed biogas (CBG) from various waste biomass sources in the country. Under SATAT, 5000 CBG plants with a total production capacity of 15 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA), which is equivalent to 54 MMSCMD of gas by 2023, has been planned. This initiative offers a potential for investment of about Rs 1.75 lakh crore, generating about 75,000 direct employment opportunities.Many of the proposed plants will use crop residue such as paddy straw and biomass as feedstock for production of CBG, especially in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The SATAT scheme will not only stanch greenhouse gas emissions, but will reduce burning of agricultural residue, which results in significant air pollution in cities like Delhi, generate employment in rural and waste management sectors, and boost income for farmers from their unutilised organic waste. One of the byproducts of CBG plants is biomanure, which can be used in farming.The components of a biofuel supply chain create a circular rural economy that results in substantial environmental, socio-economic and health benefits for communities. A total of Rs 1 lakh crore worth of biofuel will be purchased by OMCs every year in the near future for blending. This money will be ploughed back to the rural economy, thus doubling farmers incomes. Keeping in mind international climate commitments and domestic requirements, Prime Minister Narendra Modis emphasis has been on energy availability, accessibility and affordability; efficiency in energy use; energy sustainability; and energy security for mitigating global uncertainties. The quest, therefore, has been to shift the perception and the functioning of my ministry from one focused on international trade to one that strengthens the human development indices of the poorest standing in the queue.Dharmendra Pradhan is Cabinet minister for petroleum and natural gas and steelThe views expressed are personal","analysisupdated: dec 28, 2020, 09:26 istindia currently consumes

Those who oppose these Acts have focused mainly on threats and adverse effects and refrained from talking about the potential benefits of the new Acts; they are also ignoring the reasons for changing the regulatory system of agriculture. Another set of reputed experts such as Kaushik Basu have reiterated their support for changing archaic laws in agriculture but opposed the new Acts.Basis for reformsThere are quite a few major reasons for undertaking the reforms in agriculture (https://bit.ly/3nYjqVN). The gap between the agri-income of a farmer and that of a non-agriculture worker increased from 25,398 in 199394 to 1.42 lakh in 2011-12. There is widespread feeling of agrarian distress. Aggregate food demand has fallen short of domestic production necessitating the export of a large quantity to prevent domestic prices from falling very low. We are already sitting on excess stock of 60 lakh tons of sugar and nearly 72 million tons of extra buffer stock of wheat and rice which is causing a huge drain on fiscal resources.Indias agri-exports are getting difficult to push, imports are turning attractive as domestic prices are turning much higher than international prices. Rural youth including farmers children are looking for jobs outside agriculture and there is a serious problem of unemployment in the countryside. There are numerous instances of market failure to the detriment of producers and consumers. This is turning farmers to look at the government for remunerative prices through MSP for most agricultural products.Indian agriculture production and the market are not moving to the next stage of development. The growth rate in agriculture is driven by heavy support through various kinds of subsidies and output price support. Net revenue receipt of the Central government is below 9% of GDP. If farmers are to be ensured remunerative prices for their produce through procurement at MSP, as per the demand put up by the protesting farmers, these costs and losses and subsidies will take away most of the tax revenue of the central government. Such facts need to be shared with the farmers leaders. I do not think they will ask for something which will lead to a collapse of the fiscal system of the government.The way forward then for ensuring remunerative prices to farmers is through increased competition for sale of their produce, development of modern value chains, value addition, export, and processing as a part of rural economic revitalisation.There is also a need to understand that the APMC has nothing to do with payment of the MSP. Crops other than paddy, wheat and cotton are selling at prices below the MSP in the APMC mandis of Punjab on an almost regular basis. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the MSP are procurement by the government, with or without the APMC.Experience shows that even after fruits and vegetables were de-notified from the APMC, they continued to arrive at APMC mandis in large quantities while farmers got additional options. The threat to the APMC comes from the action of States to use these mandis for extra revenue generation. The protesting farmer leaders have raised a genuine concern to keep the level-playing field for the APMC and private players, and the Agriculture Minister has shown agreement to address this fully.Some of the criteriaAnother provision of the New Trading Act under attack is the simple requirement of a PAN card for a trader. Protesting farmers favour stringent criteria and registration for traders in a trade area. As in the existing provisions, after having a PAN card, even a farmer can go for trading, his son can do agri-business and other rural youth can undertake purchases of farm commodities for direct sale to a consumer or other agribusiness firms. If a stringent criteria such as bank guarantee, etc. are included in the registration of traders then agriculture trade will remain in the hands of the trading class and the spirit of the new law to facilitate farmers and rural youth to become agribusiness entrepreneurs will be lost.On contract farmingThe experiences of contract farming which is already going on in various pockets in India show the critics and protesting farmers are mixing contract farming with corporate farming. The new Act intends to insulate interested farmers (especially small farmers), against market and price risks so they can go in for the cultivation of high-value crops without worrying about the market and low prices in the harvest season. The Act is voluntary and either party is free to leave it after the expiry of agreement. It prohibits the farming agreement to include the transfer, sale, lease, mortgage of the land or premises of the farmer. The Act will promote diversification, quality production for premium price, export and direct sale of produce, with desired attributes to interested consumers. It will also bring new capital and knowledge into agriculture and pave the way for farmers participation in the value chain.The policy reforms undertaken by the central government through these Acts are in keeping with the changing times and requirements of farmers and farming.

2020-12-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sharad-pawar-govt-bulldozed-three-farm-laws-agriculture-cant-be-run-sitting-in-delhi-7125066/,Sharad Pawar: Govt bulldozed three farm laws; agriculture can’t be run sitting in Delhi,"NCP supremo and former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Tuesday accused the Centre of bulldozing three new farm laws without consulting states and asserted that agriculture cannot be run sitting in Delhi as it involves farmers toiling in distant villages.As farmers protest on Delhi borders against these laws has entered its second month and five rounds of talks so far have failed to resolve the crisis, Pawar also raised questions about the composition of the three-member ministerial group negotiating with the unions, saying the ruling party should have put forward leaders with in-depth understanding of agriculture and farmers issues.In an interview with PTI, the former Union minister said the government needs to take the protests seriously and it was unfair on the part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to blame opposition parties for the agitation by farmers.He said opposition parties will take a call on their future course of action on Wednesday if the government fails to resolve farmers issue in the next scheduled meeting with representatives of 40 protesting unions.On Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomars claim that Pawar as the then agriculture minister during the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government also wanted farm reforms but failed to do so due to political pressure, the NCP leader said he certainly wanted to bring some reforms in the sector but not in the way BJP government has done, and they were different from the current ones.Pawar said he consulted all state governments before initiating the reforms and didnt move forward until all their reservations were resolved.Also Read | Government calls for talks on Dec 30, says pressure will not work on PM ModiI and Manmohan Singh also wanted to bring some reforms in the agriculture sector but not in the same way as the current dispensation did.

So, when a majority of agriculture ministers had some reservations, it was the duty of the central government and mine to take them in confidence and resolve their issues before moving ahead, he said.Narendra Singh Tomar interview | Informal talks on with farm leaders, willing to send invitation for more talksIn comparison, Pawar alleged, the Centre neither consulted states this time, nor it called any meeting with state agriculture ministers before preparing these bills.He said the Centre has passed farm bills on the basis of their own strength in Parliament and thats why all the problems started.In politics and democracy, dialogue should take place, Pawar said.Stressing that dialogue should have happened earlier, he said the government should have talked earlier to resolve farmers reservations about these laws.How can a government say in a democracy that it wont listen or it wont change its line? In a way, the government bulldozed these three bills. If the Centre had consulted state governments and taken them in confidence, then such a situation wouldnt have arisen, Pawar said.He said farmers are worried that these laws would end the MSP procurement system and the government needs to do something to address such worries.And for the talks, they should have put those leaders in the front from BJP who understand the agriculture sector better. If those who have an in-depth understanding of agriculture, farmers issues and agri-economy were negotiating with farmers, they might have found a way to resolve this issue.I dont want to name anyone but then there are those who dont understand the sector that well, Pawar said.Alleging that farmers are not a priority for the Modi government, he said it is not appropriate to suggest that only farmers from 2-3 states are protesting against these laws and there is a sizable number of people who are not happy.Explained | Point-by-point, why farmers still oppose the Centres proposal to end stalemateIf farmers would have been the priority of the government, this problem would not have continued for so long. Then they say there are farmers only from Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh who are protesting. Have they not contributed to the overall food security of the country? he said.He said farmers do not want any political party to be associated with their agitation, but the government has been continuously blaming opposition parties for the protests.Prime Minister says that some political parties are behind this No political party is behind this agitation and farmers have clearly told political leaders not to come to their protest sites as representatives of any political outfit and if anyone wanted to join the agitation, they must come as farmers.They dont want political parties or opposition parties to associate with their agitation, but for no reason, the prime minister and others are blaming political parties and that is unfair, Pawar said.Talking about his tenure as agriculture minister, Pawar said when he assumed the office in 2004, the first file which came to him for signature was related to import of wheat and he had got very upset.But, then we accepted the challenge, that too with the help of farmers only, by giving them a better price for their produce, by infusing confidence in them and by interacting with them and India became the second-largest exporter of wheat, cotton and sugar and the highest exporter of rice. All this was done by farmers of our country, he said.On the future course of action of opposition parties, Pawar said, We are waiting for what will happen on December 30.

But FCI has racked up huge debts from the purchases required to meet its role as a buyer of last resort and to supply India's food welfare program.For years, the government, across different administrations, has ordered FCI to purchase grain in excess of its requirement to run the world's biggest food welfare programme as a buyer of last resort to placate farmers.FCI's safety net encourages farmers, especially from states such as Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to grow tonnes of rice and wheat.FCI supplies grain to more than 800 million beneficiaries entitled to receive 5 kg (11 pounds) of rice and wheat every month at Rs 3 (4.1 US cents) and Rs 2 a kg, respectively.Robust output in many states and rising purchases by FCI have led to overflowing warehouses.By the end of the crop year to June 2020, FCI's rice and wheat stocks surged to 97.27 million tonnes against its requirement of 41.12 million tonnes.According to official estimates, the value of the extra grain lying at state warehouses comes to about $39 billion.FCI cannot export the grain as its rice and wheat are more expensive than world prices. Also, World Trade Organization (WTO) rules restrict exports of grain meant for welfare programmes.Punjab and Haryana were at the forefront of India's Green Revolution in the 1960s and have traditionally accounted for the bulk of FCI's purchases.But in the past two decades farmers from other states such as Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have ramped up rice and wheat output, increasing FCI's purchases.In 2020, Madhya Pradesh sold 12.94 million tonnes of wheat to FCI against 351,000 tonnes in 2000-01. FCI's purchase of rice from Chhattisgarh totalled 5.2 million tonnes this year, up from 857,000 tonnes two decades ago.In the past decade, FCI's expenses have risen as the guaranteed price for common rice has climbed by 73% and for wheat by 64%.However, the prices at which FCI sells rice and wheat to the food welfare programme have remained unchanged.The government is supposed to pay the difference between FCI's procurement prices and sales prices. But for the past few years, it has not fully compensated FCI, forcing it to borrow every year. FCI's total debt has ballooned to Rs 3.81 lakh crore ($51.83 billion).For the current fiscal year to March 2021, the government earmarked Rs 1.15 lakh crore in food subsidies, but FCI is likely to spend about Rs 2.33 lakh crore, partly because of free grain distributions during the coronavirus lockdown, stretching its debt further.","how have fci's purchases created massive grain stockpiles?why fci's purchases have risen in the past two decades?why has fci run up debts?new delhi/mumbai: food corporation of india (fci), the state grain procurement agency, buys rice and wheat from growers every season at guaranteed prices but farmers fear that those purchases may end under new agricultural laws at the centre of recent protests.farmers say the new laws will shut the regulated wholesale markets they depend on to take their produce. but fci has racked up huge debts from the purchases required to meet its role as a buyer of last resort and to supply india's food welfare program.for years, the government, across different administrations, has ordered fci to purchase grain in excess of its requirement to run the world's biggest food welfare programme as a buyer of last resort to placate farmers.fci's safety net encourages farmers, especially from states such as punjab, haryana, madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh to grow tonnes of rice and wheat.fci supplies grain to more than 800 million beneficiaries entitled to receive 5 kg (11 pounds) of rice and wheat every month at rs 3 (4.1 us cents) and rs 2 a kg, respectively.robust output in many states and rising purchases by fci have led to overflowing warehouses.by the end of the crop year to june 2020, fci's rice and wheat stocks surged to 97.27 million tonnes against its requirement of 41.12 million tonnes.according to official estimates, the value of the extra grain lying at state warehouses comes to about $39 billion.fci cannot export the grain as its rice and wheat are more expensive than world prices. also, world trade organization (wto) rules restrict exports of grain meant for welfare programmes.punjab and haryana were at the forefront of india's green revolution in the 1960s and have traditionally accounted for the bulk of fci's purchases.but in the past two decades farmers from other states such as madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh have ramped up rice and wheat output, increasing fci's purchases.in 2020, madhya pradesh sold 12.94 million tonnes of wheat to fci against 351,000 tonnes in 2000-01. fci's purchase of rice from chhattisgarh totalled 5.2 million tonnes this year, up from 857,000 tonnes two decades ago.in the past decade, fci's expenses have risen as the guaranteed price for common rice has climbed by 73% and for wheat by 64%.however, the prices at which fci sells rice and wheat to the food welfare programme have remained unchanged.the government is supposed to pay the difference between fci's procurement prices and sales prices. but for the past few years, it has not fully compensated fci, forcing it to borrow every year. fci's total debt has ballooned to rs 3.81 lakh crore ($51.83 billion).for the current fiscal year to march 2021, the government earmarked rs 1.15 lakh crore in food subsidies, but fci is likely to spend about rs 2.33 lakh crore, partly because of free grain distributions during the coronavirus lockdown, stretching its debt further."

Here is all you need to know about the protests, the talks and the laws: The fresh talks are being held after agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal wrote a letter to farm leaders on Monday in response to their e-mail on December 26 in which they agreed to restart negotiations. 40 leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of over 400 farm organisations involved in the month-long agitation, have been invited for the talks. Three Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash are likely to represent the government. The farmers have stuck to their demand that talks must be oriented towards a repeal of the laws.Also Read: Amid protests over farm laws, BJP seeks to build support base in rural Punjab The laws essentially change the way Indias farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old government marketplaces. They allow traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming. The laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and erode the governments procurement system whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed rates known as minimum support prices (MSP). The farm unions want mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative MSP recommended by the National Farmers Commission a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities. The demands are the trickiest and are likely to be a test of the fate of negotiations. The government has made desperate attempts to restart negotiations with the unions, but it is not prepared to scrap its reformist agenda. The government has proposed a set of concessions and amendments including greater oversight of proposed free markets and a written assurance on continuing the MSP. The farmers also want amendments in an ordinance to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of pollution.","centre, farmers to hold sixth round of talks today: heres all you need to knowindiaupdated: dec 30, 2020, 10:46 istthe centre will hold the sixth round of talks on wednesday as part of attempts to end the agitation by farmers, who have encircled the capital demanding scrapping of three laws enacted in september to liberalise the sector. here is all you need to know about the protests, the talks and the laws: the fresh talks are being held after agriculture secretary sanjay agrawal wrote a letter to farm leaders on monday in response to their e-mail on december 26 in which they agreed to restart negotiations. 40 leaders of the samyukt kisan morcha, a platform of over 400 farm organisations involved in the month-long agitation, have been invited for the talks. three union ministers narendra singh tomar, piyush goyal and som parkash are likely to represent the government. the farmers have stuck to their demand that talks must be oriented towards a repeal of the laws.also read: amid protests over farm laws, bjp seeks to build support base in rural punjab the laws essentially change the way indias farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old government marketplaces. they allow traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming. the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and erode the governments procurement system whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed rates known as minimum support prices (msp). the farm unions want mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative msp recommended by the national farmers commission a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities. the demands are the trickiest and are likely to be a test of the fate of negotiations. the government has made desperate attempts to restart negotiations with the unions, but it is not prepared to scrap its reformist agenda. the government has proposed a set of concessions and amendments including greater oversight of proposed free markets and a written assurance on continuing the msp. the farmers also want amendments in an ordinance to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of pollution."

Undeterred, the university went on to embrace the virtual medium, promote alternative techniques of sowing, win national and international recognition and support the farmers cause.After the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March, the university reached out to students virtually. It also successfully organised the first-ever virtual Kisan Mela in September. When travel restrictions led to paucity of trained farm labour across the state, experts from the university, under the aegis of director agriculture MS Bhullar, proposed the direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique for sowing, which was met by widespread scepticism. However, all detractors were silenced when the farmers reported a bumper crop. The university is on the verge of expansion with the state government deciding to set up PAU Colleges of Agriculture at Ballowal Saunkhri village in SBS Nagar and Kalanaur in Gurdaspur.Teaching and non-teaching unions staged agitations against the varsity authorities and demanded regularisation of contractual employees , implementation of the old pension scheme for employees recruited before July 9, 2012, bringing the grade pay of library and meteorological attendants at par with lab attendants, promotion of employees, and filling up of vacant positions. Though the employee union staged a 60- day strike, and Punjab Agricultural University Teachers Association (PAUTA) president HS Kingra went on a marathon eight-day hunger strike, no committee has been set up to consider the demands so far.With the ongoing agrarian agitation on the border, principal soil chemist Varinderpal Singh refused an award, a gold medal and citation during a function in New Delhi and PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon submitted a report compiled by the economics department to the Punjab government, highlighting flaws in the three farm laws.Seed scamIn June, the universitys name cropped up in a seed scam after it was found that Brar Seed Store near the universitys Gate Number 1 managed to procure and sell a large quantity of uncertified paddy variety seeds (PR-128) from the institutes Ladhowal Seed Farm. This raised questions over the sales protocols followed by the institute. An investigation was ordered and a few were arrests made.Varsity challenges Delhi on issue of farm firesAmid hue and cry over farm fires in Punjab contributing to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), a study carried out by department of climate change and agricultural meteorology head Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu found that stubble burning in Punjab was a localised problem that did bot add to air pollution in New Delhi or the NCR. Rather, the practice affected the health of farmers and their kin, especially children, the study found.Rebuts Capitals microbial solutionIn November, days after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in New Delhi announced it had found a solution to the paddy stubble menace in the form a bio-decomposer, PAU scientists said microbes in the form of a decomposer were not the answer. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, had developed the decomposer. Microbe-based technologies, promoted and widely advertised, are being offered as stand-alone interventions. It is, however, clear that the application of microbes needs to be integrated with machine-based solutions, said Shammi Kapoor, dean, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, PAU, in its study. Kapoor and additional director research GS Manes have also submitted a study to the vice-chancellor, which says a multipronged approach is the only way to manage stubble burning.The varsity inked several MoUs for commercialisation of different technologies amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Virtual fairThe universitys first virtual Kisan Mela that was held on September 18 and 19 was carried out successfully. Punjab chief minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh inaugurated the fair, in which 2,65,740 men and women participated. Panel discussions (paddy straw management and direct seeded rice technology), technical sessions and field demonstrations were some of the major highlights.Facebook programme:A hit across bordersThe PAU Live Programme, which takes place every Wednesday on Facebook and YouTub, has received an overwhelming response from farmers of Punjab and adjoining states. Over 40,000-50,000 farmers view it. The programme was started to apprise and guide farmers about improved crop varieties, their production-protection technologies, allied agriculture occupations, and weather forecast. Interestingly, the programme also became a hit in Pakistan, where several agricultural science students and farmers have become avid viewers of this programme and routinely post questions to experts. Training programmes on diverse aspects of agriculture such as integrated crop production, crop residue management, mushroom cultivation, beekeeping, jaggery making, preservation of fruit and vegetables, soybean processing, bakery and confectionery products were also held.Hall of famePAU alum and United Nations World Food Programme Representative and Country Director to India Bishow Parajuli won the Nobel Peace Prize for his world food programme.

2020, 23:50 istconfronted with a contagion, labour crisis, staff strike and contentious farm reform bills, the year 2020 was no walk in the park for panjab agricultural university (pau) officials. undeterred, the university went on to embrace the virtual medium, promote alternative techniques of sowing, win national and international recognition and support the farmers cause.after the nationwide lockdown was imposed in march, the university reached out to students virtually. it also successfully organised the first-ever virtual kisan mela in september. when travel restrictions led to paucity of trained farm labour across the state, experts from the university, under the aegis of director agriculture ms bhullar, proposed the direct seeding of rice (dsr) technique for sowing, which was met by widespread scepticism. however, all detractors were silenced when the farmers reported a bumper crop. the university is on the verge of expansion with the state government deciding to set up pau colleges of agriculture at ballowal saunkhri village in sbs nagar and kalanaur in gurdaspur.teaching and non-teaching unions staged agitations against the varsity authorities and demanded regularisation of contractual employees , implementation of the old pension scheme for employees recruited before july 9, 2012, bringing the grade pay of library and meteorological attendants at par with lab attendants, promotion of employees, and filling up of vacant positions. though the employee union staged a 60- day strike, and punjab agricultural university teachers association (pauta) president hs kingra went on a marathon eight-day hunger strike, no committee has been set up to consider the demands so far.with the ongoing agrarian agitation on the border, principal soil chemist varinderpal singh refused an award, a gold medal and citation during a function in new delhi and pau vice-chancellor bs dhillon submitted a report compiled by the economics department to the punjab government, highlighting flaws in the three farm laws.seed scamin june, the universitys name cropped up in a seed scam after it was found that brar seed store near the universitys gate number 1 managed to procure and sell a large quantity of uncertified paddy variety seeds (pr-128) from the institutes ladhowal seed farm. this raised questions over the sales protocols followed by the institute. an investigation was ordered and a few were arrests made.varsity challenges delhi on issue of farm firesamid hue and cry over farm fires in punjab contributing to pollution in the national capital region (ncr), a study carried out by department of climate change and agricultural meteorology head prabhjyot kaur sidhu found that stubble burning in punjab was a localised problem that did bot add to air pollution in new delhi or the ncr. rather, the practice affected the health of farmers and their kin, especially children, the study found.rebuts capitals microbial solutionin november, days after the aam aadmi party (aap) government in new delhi announced it had found a solution to the paddy stubble menace in the form a bio-decomposer, pau scientists said microbes in the form of a

Negotiators for both sides are to meet on Jan. 4 to try and break the deadlock.GRAIN PREFERRED TO OILSEEDSGovernment purchases, initially meant to promote self-sufficiency in domestic staples, have spurred farmers, especially those with access to better irrigation, to favour grain over the years, rather than oilseeds and pulses.That has pushed India to the rank of the worlds second-biggest producer of rice and wheat, but caused a glut. At the same time, lower oilseed output has made it the worlds biggest importer of oils, to meet nearly 70% of consumption.Such imports have surged to 15 million tonnes from 4 million two decades ago and could touch 20 million by 2030, boosted by a growing populace with higher incomes to satisfy a penchant for calorie-laden curry and deep-fried food.India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.Oilseeds are now mainly grown in rain-fed areas with low crop yields, but Punjab, with efficient irrigation, can expect higher yields, experts say.Farmers in the state and neighbouring Haryana can produce 6 million tonnes of rapeseed if they divert half the area now under wheat, bringing a domestic supply boost of 2.5 million tonnes, Mehta estimated.Farm economists say India should create a transition fund.Both central and state governments should work out a financial package that will get this crop diversification rolling, said former government adviser Ashok Gulati.","indiaupdated: dec 31, 2020, 17:49 istindian farmer shingara singh has grown grain for 35 years and is one of thousands of protesters against
