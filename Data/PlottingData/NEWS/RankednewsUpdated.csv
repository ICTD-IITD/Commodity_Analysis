being infected by the coronavirus.a large proportion of the residents relies on food donations from organizations, with even milk now being a luxury item, kholoud says. her sister always liked making rice pudding, she adds, but that is no longer possible. the lebanese economy was already in big trouble even before the pandemic. the lebanese pound went down massively in value. and the devastating explosion in beiruts port in august 2020 was the final straw.i get only 50% of my pay, she says. her husband, her son and her stepson have all lost their jobs amid the economic crisis in lebanon. her daughter is still working. the two of us feed the family, she says.financial problems at the unrwathe united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa) is responsible for the palestinian refugees in the 12 official camps in lebanon. this is because lebanon does not accept any costs for the palestinians.but the un organization frequently becomes a pawn of political interests, as happened, for example, when former us president donald trump withdrew financing from the agency and made a dent in its finances to the tune of $300 million (255 million)  his successor, joe biden, has announced he will commence payments again. the main criticism leveled at the unrwa is that by looking after 5.7 million palestinians in the region, it creates incentives for them not to integrate in other arab countries so that they remain permanent refugees instead.the background to this argument is the palestinians right of return enshrined in the un resolution 194, which is one of the big issues in the quest for a resolution to the middle east conflict between israelis and palestinians. while israel declared its independence on may 14, 1948, for palestinians, may 15 of that year marked the start of their flight and forced displacement to todays palestinian territories and bordering countries, including lebanon. however, what was initially considered to be a temporary solution for the palestinians has now become a home for several generations. the unrwa needs more than a billion us dollars each year to keep up its regular, emergency and lifesaving services.erosion of rightsthe palestinians in lebanon have never been recognized by a lebanese government as having equal rights. this is partly because the palestine liberation organization (plo) was involved in fighting in the lebanese civil war, something that angered various political groups in the country. in lebanon, palestinian refugees pass on their refugee status to their children. they are not allowed to work in academic professions and are worse-paid than lebanese with the same qualifications.the lebanese side has always officially justified this exclusion with the argument that a complete integration of the refugees in lebanon would make it harder for them to return home. so while the us, for example, would like to see the palestinian refugees settle permanently in the country, lebanon does not want them to.the burj barajneh camp was originally meant to house 3,500 people. but the unrwa has officially registered 20,000 palestinians in the camp, and, with the arrival of more refugees from war-torn syria, the actual number of residents is believed to be twice as high as that.no room for quarantinethe lanes in the camp are narrow. residents often cynically say that not even a coffin can get through them. wherever you go, a tangle of telephone wires and uncovered electrical cables hangs above your head  residents regularly die from electrocution when it rains.here in the camp, and in the houses, too, you cant really keep any distance, says kholoud hussein. sometimes, as many as seven people share two rooms.coronavirus testsmedical care is mostly provided by the un aid agency. one day a week, the unrwa, doctors without borders (msf) and the southern lebanese al hamshari hospital each carry out tests in the camp, which means there is testing on three to four days out of seven. that is quite well organized now, says kholoud, recalling that it was not always that way: particularly during the first days of the pandemic, she says, people had to pay a lot of money for tests in lebanese hospitals  money that wasnt there.the coronavirus committee in the camp, which consists of ngos and the palestinian red cross, says that there were around 670 people in the camp infected by the coronavirus in february and march. but the unofficial number is likely to be higher, as not everyone takes a test.anyone who becomes severely ill with covid-19 is taken to the al hamshari hospital. it is located near the city of sidon, about 45 minutes drive to the south of beirut. kholoud has often worked as an interpreter there as well. a covid ward has been set up at the hospital, partly paid for with money from germanys federal ministry for economic cooperation and development. patients are transported there by ambulances.the unrwa has also set up a quarantine center with 96 places for those people who have milder cases of the disease and are unable to isolate because of cramped living conditions. this so-called medical isolation center is in siblin.one of the people who went into quarantine there is rayan sokkar. she was infected by the coronavirus and was worried about passing it on to her family.this young palestinian journalist was born and grew up in the shatila refugee camp but now lives outside it. we were examined three times a day  mostly, they measured the oxygen level in our blood and our blood pressure or listened to our lungs with a stethoscope. we were well looked after.the coronavirus pandemic has put more financial pressure on the unrwa. that is why its director, philippe lazzarini, does not tire of appealing to the international community for financial support. unprecedented levels of despair with growing hunger & anger, he recently tweeted, adding that money was needed for food, the covid response and dignified shelters.kholoud hussein has almost given up hope on this score. the world has forgotten us, she says. she doesnt expect much more from the international community. but at least she has a small reason to be pleased: she has already had her first coronavirus vaccination.",RICE,5,0.6508308019845573,NA,NA

therein hangs a tale.now, west bengal may well be renamed nandigram. you must of course overlook a few distractions like amit shah claiming a clean sweep, in arid purulia. or mamata banerjee actually demanding that the pms visa and passport be cancelled for having visited orakandi in bangladesh. those distractions are quite a handful for an assembly election, you think? yes. but then, this is west bengal.a little detour: orakandi is revered by the matua community, quite a vital component of the voters in three bengal districts. nobody here, among the intelligentsia, quite likes the fact that the name of caste has been taken. bengals politics has always avoided it. and thats the bjps opening. bengal still speaks a universal language. it still responds to resonating phrases like amar naam, tomar naam, nandigram, nandigram...thats not just a slogan, by the way. kolkata, howrah, hooghly, burdwan, birbhum, 24 parganasdistricts which vote in the third and fourth phases or later seem somewhat indifferent about what happens to their own constituencies. but theyre not indifferent about nandigram. anywhere and everywhere, its difficult to get people focused on any other issue. the small talk all around the small tea shops, the small man walking back after his days work in those rich rice fields invariably focuses on that one thing.its the big fight. the questions are: is didi panicking? will suvendu adhikari pull it off ? will nandigram again be the turning point of bengals political history? its quite the local thriller. if you so much as mildly declare that you have been to the epicentre and have come out in one piece, you may very well get a discount at a sweet shop, or at sonajuri haat, santiniketan.old stories form part of new narrativewhat did you see there? tell us, please. you can pay me later! dulal basak, with that incredulous look on his face, could be the face of the rest of bengal. he has that look of having accidentally met an astronaut just back from the moon.myths abound. that the adhikaris virtually own nandigram. that didi is liberating it the second time over. or just the opposite: that tmc atrocities have touched such heights that only the bjp can save the people. nandigram, seven years since the violence against that old farmland acquisition felled even a left government, is back haunting public memory.for all the contrary feelings that thought may evoke, its also influencing voting decisions across districts. perhaps not even the voter knows where her finger may pass, such are the sentiments here. its rich political drama.even the long-forgotten laxman seth, the erstwhile cpi-m mla, the villain of the piece in 2007, under whose watch the police firing took place in which over a dozen got killed in 2007, the man you could arguably blame for the lefts near comatose state in indiaeven he has come out of the woodwork. and hes not even contesting, but thats half the story.now, laxman seth was called a harmand (goon) those days, maybe not without reason. and he was not heard of after a failed attempt to revive his political career in 2019, when he contested the tamluk parliamentary seat on a congress ticket. congress? yes. the cpi-m had expelled him in 2014, and he had then joined the bjp, before his compass shifted again. tamluk is his old fort, the place where hed defeated sisir adhikari in 2004. no relation to suvendu, you ask? of course, hes the father, also old congress stock, was mos for rural development by the way under manmohan singh.why are these old stories important? because theyre part of the narrative in 2021. its not so much party politics, as much as the underlying economic issues. laxman seth has been giving interviews. and been touching a chord with a rural bengal that, contrarily, also wants industrialisation. a bengal that doesnt want to go to kerala and bangalore just to have a job.all political parties are the same. when they first come to power, they make promises of a better system, but later the same bad elements come to rule the roost, says ranjit das, a voter in bolpur constituency in birbhum. he cites the nandigram trajectory and draws parallels with the local politics in his constituency.this disillusionment is commonly heard in and around the visva bharati campus, perhaps even more keenly in the crafts markets adjacent to santiniketan. the artisanal markets that dot the now burgeoning campus city may have only an ironic resemblance with things that tagore said. the poet is mostly to be found caged in photo frames, sold at every street corner. he wanted the world to come to the country. in a way, the country wants the same.the elections themselves are a local mahabharataa distraction, almost. who has joined whom? thats the talk everywhere. the protagonists of nandigram or the general trend of tmc mlas and other sundry heavyweights switching camps, thats what everyone talks about. this is the place that gave india mir jafar.if purba medinipurof which nandigram is one of the 16 assembly constituencies is seen as adhikari turf, birbhums 11 assembly constituencies are considered a stronghold of the tmc. if suvendu, and his father sisir in particular, have a deep hold over that neck of the woods, birbhum is the playfield of tmc district in charge anubrata mandal, a local toughie.the adhikharis were perceived to be the last word in their bastion, while they were in tmc mamata allowed their writ to run. (its just coincidental that they happen to be on the other side now.) but that federal approach is true about birbhum too, they say. whether in rampur, siuri or santiniketan, the refrain is that shes too indulgent of  anubrata mandal. in short, what the adhikaris are or were to nandigram, mandal is to birbhum. not a leaf moves without him raising his finger, they say.didis allegation that it was the adhikaris who got the police in chappals into nandigram in 2007 and thats what led to the mayhemfinds odd resonance here. its almost a mythological narrative that gets repeated everywhere. facts? they belong to another planet. myths have a self-sustaining life of their own. there are stories about how many got killed, about dead children filled into sacks, about truckloads of dead bodies hidden under vegetables. the mass hysteria around has been reignited, in different ways.didi allows anubrata to manage this outpost in the same way, quips a visva bharati lecturer, who would rather not be named. the current v-c here, bidyut chakrabarty, makes no secret of his support to the bjp and the prime minister. its fairly overt. but theres tangible tension on the ground. its often, but not necessarily party-related.the young, for one, have no qualms at all. deepak, a biotech student from the nearby puralia, feels a change would be good for bengalit would bring industry and jobs. we dont want to go out of the state to look for employment. bengal should be an industrial leader again. we cant be doing artisanal work or cottage industry like our parents for all time. theres no future in small scale, he says. maybe mahatma gandhi should have been alive to hear his idea of paribartan.birbhum is of course a tmc fortress, controlled by mandal with an iron fist. everyone agrees its impregnable. but local street cred is not the only factor. the caa is an issue here, and it gives the tmc a fillip. both the hindus who migrated from then east bengal and the original muslim settlers here cite the assam nrc fiasco. we may also be thrown out or our names may go missing! most of us dont have old papers, says subhas. its not about religion here, as the national narrative goes, but about the precarity of life that all have faced equally.the students at kalabhavan still have a whiff of left idealism, and have their own story to tellone of resistance, and of standing to safeguard bengals cultural ethos. anirban ganguly, the bjp bolpur candidate, rubbishes those as wayward western thoughts. tagore? keep him to a side. our central leaders have closely studied culture and thought process, claims ganguly.thats where the aspirational middle class is, even if theyre not big in numbers. one of them, an old neighbour of tmcs anubrata mandal, predicts that the bjp will get 4 out of 11 seats here, and three more after the elections are over! khela hobe, he quips.",RICE,4,0.679856986979165,KOLKATA,WEST BENGAL

minister of west bengal in 2011 by ending the 34-year-long cpi(m) regime, one of the longest-serving elected governments in the world. now after ruling the state for two successive terms, the 2021 poll battle is surely not a cakewalk for her. it is the bharatiya janata party (bjp) that trespassed her dominion after gaining overwhelming results from the state in the 2019 lok sabha polls. and, the emergence of the left-congress-isf alliance has made the situation more complicated for her.banerjee endorses her governance as the rule of three 'm's, that is, 'maa', 'mati' and 'manush' (mother, soil and people). but, the bengal elections have another 3m factor this time, that is, 'mamata', 'modi' and 'muslim'. so, banerjee's challenge is to counter prime minister narendra modi's popularity in bengal at one side and regain her support base of the minority community that might step out with the left-congress-isf alliance.now making the battle of power more interesting, mamata has chosen nandigram over her home turf bhabanipur seat this time to test her fate in the 2021 elections. it was the agitation in nandigram and singur against the left government's land acquisition policies that made mamata banerjee the chief minister of west bengal.now not just bengal, but the country's eye is on nandigram that will witness the most high-profile contest on april 1 with the chief minister taking on her former ministerial colleague suvendu adhikari, who had joined the bjp in december last year.further, banerjee's poll campaign this time got a new dimension with a wheelchair after she suffered an injury earlier this month while campaigning in nandigram.not to mention, the west bengal chief minister spared no poll stage to launch scathing attacks on prime minister modi. however, the modi-mamata battle was quite visible even before the 2019 lok sabha elections. she played an instrumental role in bringing together all opposition parties against the centre prior to the 2019 general elections. the seventh-term mp also has been among the first key figures who heavily criticised the central government in issues starting from demonetisation to citizenship amendment act (caa) and lockdown to fuel prices. her fighting spirit and mass appeal have made her one the tallest opposition figures in the current political arena.mamata banerjee started her political career as a youth congress worker in the 1970s. she quickly rose the ranks and became the general secretary of mahila congress and later all india youth congress. in 1984 she was elected as a member of parliament in the 8th lok sabha becoming one of india's youngest parliamentarians. she founded the all india trinamool congress in 1997 after a disagreement with congress.mamata banerjee worked with three prime ministers including pv narasimha rao, atal bihari vajpayee and dr manmohan singh. she had been a union minister in both national democratic alliance (nda) and united progressive alliance (upa) governments and held portfolios like human resource development, youth affairs and sports, women and child development, coal and mines and the railways. notably, she was the first woman to become a railway minister in the country. the time magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012.hailing from a lower-middle-class family, mamata banerjee worked as a milk booth vendor to battle poverty. her father passed away due to the lack of treatment when she was just 17. the fighter in her never let the barriers dominate her. she continued her education and earned a bachelor's degree in history, a master's degree in islamic history and degrees in education and law from the university of calcutta. she also worked as a stenographer and a private tutor before joining full-time politics.another disposition of mamata banerjee is her minimalist lifestyle. despite being the chief minister, she still lives in her ancestral terracotta-tiled roof house at kolkata's harish chatterjee street. white cotton sarees having mono-colour borders and slippers are all that define the fashion statement of mamata banerjee.the west bengal chief minister is also a self-taught painter, poet and writer. she has authored more than 100 books. she is also tech-savvy and remains active on social media. the trinamool supremo is also known for her walkathons or marches. here it needs to be mentioned that she walks five-six kilometres on a treadmill every day. when it comes to evening snack time, she likes to have tea, puffed rice and 'aloo chop'.the second phase of the west bengal assembly polls is scheduled for april 1. in phase-ii, 30 seats covering a segment of south 24 parganas, bankura, purba medinipur and paschim medinipur will go to polls to decide the fate of 171 candidates including 19 women.meanwhile, the first phase of the west bengal assembly elections concluded with an estimated 79.79 per cent voter turnout on saturday.in the first phase, 30 seats covering all assembly constituencies from the districts of purulia and jhargram and a segment of bankura, purba medinipur and paschim medinipur went to

square one homemade treats, a popular bakery in thiruvananthapuram.marina says that since cakes are easier to make, many of the ethnic snacks that were traditionally made during the holy week have

steamed, either in leaves like an ela ada or in a vessel. the cross that we got for palm sunday is pressed into the middle. in the evening, after prayers, the eldest in the family would bless the appam, cut it and serve it to the others for dinner. it is dipped into a syrup that we called kuruma, also called paal in some places. the paal is made with jaggery and coconut milk, says preethi.

(it is also a great way to use up any extra melted chocolate).you can use icing sugar paste that can be coloured for brighter designs. just fill up a piping bag and use different nozzles to make a variety of patterns.if you dont have a piping bag: find a small plastic bag that is of a sturdy quality, roughly about the size of your palms. fill it halfway with your icing of choice. squeeze the filling to a corner of the plastic bag, giving it a conical shape and secure the opening with a rubber band or tape.finally, cut the tip of the cone  you now have a home made piping bag. keep in mind the surface area you will be working on. snipping out a biggish piece of the corner will leave you with a lot of icing gushing out; which might be difficult to manage on a small egg.if you are fairly confident of your skills and/or have a steady hand, you can also roll up butter paper or parchment paper into a cone and use it instead of a piping bag.if not chocolate...easter eggs can be made with marshmallows too, says sunita rebecca. melt marshmallows and add crushed rice krispies to the mix and you get a pliable, colourful medium you can use to shape eggs.rice cereal is required to bring stiffness to the melted marshmallows, which would otherwise be too runny to use.moisten your hands with water or dab butter on your palms to make the moulding easier, advises sunita.according to srivatsan s of sris cake lab, bengaluru, marzipan is a great medium to make easter eggs as you can use a lot of colours on them. srivatsan, who has been creating themed easter eggs this season, uses cashew paste instead of the traditional almond paste for his marzipan.you have to realise this is a very delicate material and an oily substance as well, so dont be discouraged if it doesnt turn out well the first few times. youll eventually get the hang of it, he says.once you do, it is almost as versatile as edible play dough, and can be moulded into any shape on its own without casings.though marzipan eggs are not hollow, srivatsan says people have been known to customise them by placing useful items like stationery instead of candy inside. once you have your fillings decided, all that is left is icing. pour some icing sugar into a piping bag and just have fun!",RICE,1,0.6969251661754147,NA,NA

facilities: Madras High Court","by ptichennai: deploring the freebies culture in tamil nadu to woo voters, the madras high court on wednesday advised leaders of the political parties to stop this and engage in promoting infrastructural facilities.the court's observations came while admitting a writ petition from m chandramohan from tirunelveli district praying for a direction to the authorities concerned to convert the reserved vasudevanallur assembly constituency into a general one.the petitioner wanted enabling of all communities to be candidate in the upcoming election and uphold the spirit of the constitution of india.""each party tries to outdo each other in terms of populist promises. if one party promises monthly assistance of rs 1,000 to women household heads, there is a counter offer of rs 1,500. it goes on. the result is people started having a mindset that they could make a living out of freebies,"" a division bench of justices n kirubakaran and b pugalendhi said.a trend has been created that whoever avails loan from banks does not repay them, expecting waiver of loans during election.in this way, people themselves get corrupted by the political parties.the way in which the parties throw their promises, which are unreasonable and unworkable, are really unwanted.""unfortunately, freebies are not connected with job creation, development, or agriculture. voters are lured to cast votes in their favour by these magical promises. once in 5 years, this tamasha is being continued for decades together. promises have always remained as promises. most of them except freebies are not implemented,"" it said.the bench noted that every candidate has to shell out about rs 20 crore in the election, as many of the people have become corrupt by selling their votes for one or a few thousands, biriyani and liquor.""it is a stark reality. if that is so, how could the people expect good leaders. do people, who sell their votes, have any moral right to question their leaders,"" the bench wondered.the judges opined that if money spent for freebies is utilised constructively by creating job opportunities, building infrastructure like dams and lakes and better facilities and incentives to the agriculture, which has become an 'orphan' in the country as most of the people have quit it as it does not provide a secure income, definitely, there will be social uplift and progress of the state.the political parties should be prohibited or prevented from giving election promises, which are capable of adding burden on the public exchequer, especially, the state facing a financial crunch, it said.otherwise, for the sake of finance, the state has to increase the number of liquor shops.every political party is bound to make promises to voters giving their social policies and plans for improving the standard of living of the people by providing clean governance, infrastructure, especially, providing basic amenities like water, transportation and health.but, the promises made by the political parties are aimed at clinching power, it said.in addition to colour televisions, laptops, mixers, fans and grinders among others, every family cardholder in the state is given 20 kgs of rice free every month.that apart, during festival seasons like pongal and diwali, public money is drained.in fact, the celebrations are being taken care of by the government by providing free dhoties, sarees and items necessary for cooking and making pongal and expenses for celebrations.""these kinds of freebies and money given during festivals, though it would be justified that the government is taking care of the people's needs, in fact are making the people lazy and dampening their working culture,"" it said ""in the process, the honest tax-payer is made a mute spectator of these expenditures by the government,"" it said.consequently, even for any normal work, no force is available in tamil nadu and it has to depend on the migrant workers from northeast and northern states like manipur, meghalaya, assam, bihar, uttar pradesh, west bengal and odisha, the bench said.most of the north indian workers are employed in agriculture work, hotels, industries, shops and saloons in tamil nadu.""it is not as if everyone in tamil nadu have become an entrepreneur or persons with resources and if we go into details, most of the persons including the wealthy are expecting freebies,"" the court said.the way in which things are happening today, one would not be surprised to see that migrant workers would be owners of the properties in due course and the sons of the soil will become workers working under them.it may be the only achievement, probably, the political parties have attained through election promises by providing freebies for the past 20 years, the judges said.",RICE,1,0.6205122400972739,KOLKATA,WEST BENGAL

2021-04-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pinarayi-vijayan-kerala-cm-assembly-elections-7257638/,Pinarayi Vijayan: Captain comrade who led Kerala in crisis,"on a sweltering afternoon on march 30, at a public ground in kanhangad in keralas kasaragod district, a car halts near a waiting crowd. as chief minister pinarayi vijayan alights from the vehicle, the crowd surges ahead, mobile phones go up as if in salute, slogans pierce the air and cpi(m) central committee member p karunakaran announces: keralas captain is here  the captain who led kerala in crisis.unlike neighbouring tamil nadu, which has monikers for its leaders (kaliagnar, thalaivar and captain)  kerala hasnt had that tradition, with a rare exception probably being the late congress leader k karunakaran, who was called leader in party circles. but as kerala votes on april 6, the ruling left democratic fronts (ldf) entire campaign has revolved around this branding of vijayan as captain, as the man in charge.as the ldf hopes to buck the trend of voters alternating between the cpm-led front and the congress-led united democratic front (udf), vijayan is its only headliner and, amazingly for someone known to deliver the most tepid of speeches, its principal crowd puller.pinarayi vijayan interview: | pinarayi vijayan interview: the anti-kerala stand of congress, bjp, their communal overtures are our main challengethe crisis managervijayan as the man-in-charge is an image that has been steadily building over the last few years with his governments handling of successive challenges  cyclone okhi of 2017, nipah outbreak of 2018, the devastating floods of 2018 and 2019, and last years pandemic.during the floods, vijayan operated as a commander of a rescue mission would. the temporary war room he set up coordinated with uniformed forces, state machinery and volunteer groups. every evening, he would address the media and update the public about the magnitude of the calamity and the governments efforts towards restoring normalcy.read | in kerala, modi raises sabarimala chant, says ldf destabilising sacred placesvijayan also activated the three-tier local bodies, mostly party-ruled, to

crisis manager was in display again during last years covid lockdown.while images of migrant workers left high and dry came from across the country, in kerala, around 4 lakh migrant workers were under the care of the government or entrusted in the care of their employers.explained a five-decade-old tradition not after c achutha menon, the cpi leader who took over as cm in 1969, has kerala had a chief minister with two consecutive terms in the state. which is why, pinarayi vijayan, the ldf's cm candidate, is being watched for whether he will end up breaking the state's tradition of alternating between ldf and udf governments.the humanitarian crisis triggered by the lockdown saw the government stepping in with two welfare measures  free food kits and advance payment of welfare pensions. an estimated 87 lakh pds card-holders in kerala were given free kits with rice, wheat, pulses, tea, sugar, cooking oil, spices, suji and soaps. the monthly pension scheme to six categories, including elderly farm workers, single women and the elderly, covers an estimated 61 lakh people, with the government spending rs 32,034 crore over the last five years.mullappally ramachandran interview:  | bjp can grow in kerala only by splitting the secular vote it is a dangerous schemein december, the government announced that the food kits would continue to be distributed for another four months. besides, in the budget for 2021, the government increased the monthly welfare pensions from rs 1,500 to rs 1,600  a move seen as taken with elections in mind.from northern malabar region to thiruvananthapuram in the south, these welfare measures have been a talking point among voters.pinarayi should come back to power. he ensured we didnt starve. he ensured food reached families in their most difficult times  the floods and now, during the pandemic. we cannot be ungrateful to him, says basheer, a daily wage worker in kozhikode town.p kumar, who runs a small textile shop in nemom in thiruvananthapuram, enthusiastically shows text messages from the bank of the rs 1,600 credited into his account as old age pension.during the pandemic, vijayan emerged again on television with his 6 pm covid bulletin, his measured updates on the pandemic and its spread reassuring people and sending trps soaring. besides sharing data on testing and positivity rates, vijayan would speak about the governments relief measures, the need to care for each other and the destitute.as this bulletin became a staple in almost every home, vijayans image as a cold, impassive comrade underwent a makeover, especially among women.also read | the world citizen as boy next door: in palakkad, tharoor and tharoorismsduring those days, his was the only voice that emerged from the governments side. though two ministers and the chief secretary shared the dais with the chief minister for the daily press briefings, it was only vijayan who fielded questions and offered clarifications, never once turning to his colleagues or the top bureaucrat.but while these moves and public appearances helped build vijayans image, they also invited criticism around the personality cult building around him. he has also been called mundu udutha modi (modi in dhoti) with reference to his autocratic style of functioning and alleged lack of consultation with allies.c p john, chief of the communist marxist party (cmp), a faction that broke off from the cpm and is now part of the udf, said vijayan is not guided by the politburo but pr agencies.instead of addressing issues such as landlessness of weaker sections and tribals, the government speaks about the food kit. ration is a basic right. vijayan talks as if it is charity from a feudal king to his subjects. his emergence as captain shows the crisis in the party, said john.cpi(m) politburo member m a baby, however, dismisses the idea of the personality cult. vijayan has not taken any credit for the achievements. the idea of captain emerged from the public in kerala. people of the state have seen how vijayan led them through crises, be it floods or pandemic. the party didnt bestow that title on him, he said.also read | congress banks on a

projects. they protested against the gail pipeline calling it a bomb ticking underground. they led protests against land acquisitions, delaying highway-widening work. but now they have no problem taking credit.people wearing mask while attending a rally. (photo: ap) people wearing mask while attending a rally. (photo: ap)in 2019, kerala became the first indian state to tap into the market for masala bonds, with the state-owned kerala infrastructure investment fund board (kiifb) debuting on the london stock exchange to raise development funds. a decade ago, the cpi(m)-led government was divided over taking loans even from the asian development bank.while the kiifb has come under the scanner of the comptroller and auditor general, with the auditor saying its borrowings have no legislative nod, the government has raised money from the domestic and international market to finance 900-odd projects worth rs 7,000 crore.so while the relief and welfare measures were mainly targeted at the lower rungs of society, for the middle- and upper-middle classes, vijayan had his development agenda to showcase in the form of a massive infrastructure push with funds routed through kiifb  primary health centres to rival private hospitals and high-tech classrooms in government/aided schools.last month, union finance minister nirmala sitharaman had accused the kiifb of corruption, saying, what is this organisation? we also make a budget in the union government. we dont give all money to one particular agency total questionable operation. if this is budget-making, no wonder kerala is going into a debt trap.baby dismisses these criticisms: there are detractors who say the states debt liability is going up. there is nothing wrong in availing loans for development. even the us has huge debt liability.even as vijayan earned the image of a doer, his office and the departments he handled faced several scandals and controversies, with the gold smuggling case landing right at the cmos door  vijayans principal secretary m sivasankar was arrested in the gold smuggling case.but while critics point to this case and a string of other allegedly high-handed decisions under vijayan  the mou for deep-sea trawlers signed despite opposition from fishermen, slapping of uapa charges against two cpm cadres in kozhikode for alleged maoist links, encounter killings of eight alleged maoists, besides others  his supporters point to the governments decision to put on hold the amended kerala police act as sign of its responsiveness.days after the government brought in a controversial amendment to the act that mandated a jail term for any offensive social media post, it withdrew the law following a hailstorm of criticism from across the political spectrum.according to n p chekkutty, a leading political analyst, vijayan is the only leader after karunakaran to find acceptability across all regions of the state  malabar, central kerala and travancore. pinarayi knows keralas politics. he is undoubtedly the tallest politician in the states recent history. in fact, his image has a teflon coating now, said chekkutty, explaining why the string of recent controversies and scandals havent dented his image.the politiciansceptics say that if vijayan looks good, its in no small part due to the incoherence and confusion in the opposition udf camp.especially for the youth, vijayans image of a bold, decisive leader is a definite plus over the udfs seemingly messy, out-in-the-open contradictions.ashley joy, a 23-year-old marketing professional from chalakudy in thrissur, says about the udf, who is their leader? will they find time to govern the state after sorting out all differences? they are always busy pulling each other down.with every passing moment in the cpi(m), vijayans hold on the party and his cabinet has got stronger. never before has the party or the ldf been controlled by an individual as in the last five years.vijayans tenure has also been marked by a tense relationship between allies cpm and cpi, with the latter accusing the bigger party of sidestepping it.while taking the kerala congress (m) on board the ldf, vijayan brushed aside the reluctance of the cpi, eventually setting aside 12 seats for regional christian party and making it the third largest constituent of the ldf behind cpi.a cpi leader says, the party had to sacrifice to make space for the kc(m). we were opposed to the decision, but remained silent only because our aim is to come back for another term.ahead of the elections, vijayan made it mandatory for legislators who have had two consecutive wins to stay away from the electoral battle.besides being aimed at blunting the anti-incumbency factor, the move helped keep out candidates who were proving to be a liability. for instance, by using the rule to keep out speaker p sreeramakrishnan, vijayan reduced the dollar smuggling case, allegedly involving the speaker, into a non-issue.similarly, by denying tickets to p jayarajan, e p jayarajan and m v jayarajan, the party heavyweights of his home district kannur, vijayan has once again underlined his supremacy.yet, this chop-and-change style also saw unprecedented protests by cpi(m) workers and sympathisers against the official candidates, forcing the party to change candidates at least on two seats.but one issue that could prove to be a factor this election is the intensifying conflict between the christians and muslims over sharing minority rights.the church leadership, which has expressed its displeasure over the increasing influence of the iuml in the udf, has shown signs of getting close to the ldf. on his part, vijayan has been keeping the church leadership in good humour with measures such as providing 10 per cent reservation for economically backward classes and hiking msp for rubber from rs 150 to rs 170 per kg, a major source of income in the christian-dominated belts.he gives muslims a sense of security. he has proved that he would stand by our rights, said c p sirajudhin, manager of the markaz orphanage in kundamangalam near kozhikode.while vijayan and the ldf are positioning themselves as the only effective bulwark against the communal politics of the bjp, the governments position on sabarimala, and its series of flip-flops, have only served to underline a lack of clarity. from what was seen as an all-too-eager rush to implement the supreme courts decision on temple entry for all to expressing regret over the 2018 police action against devotees, the party has travelled a long way. the issue has returned to haunt the government with the upper-caste hindu outfit, nair service society, lashing out at vijayan and accusing him of taking believers for a ride.his supporters, however, see this too as a sign of flexibility, an essential tool for political survival. they point to the results of successive elections to make their point. in the 2019 lok sabha elections held in the aftermath of the anti-temple entry protests, the ldf lost 19 of 20 seats to the udf. since then, the ldf has gone out of its way to woo devotees. in the local body polls held last year, the ldf came back with a big win. while the bjp hopes to pin down the government on sabarimala, the game is up in the air.amidst this and all the other uncertainties that make up an election, what is certain is vijayans near complete hold on the party and its apparatus. will a win or a loss change that?
