It is now left with a stock of 38 lakh tonne.To dispose of the huge pulses stocks, the Centre in October 2018 had approved a scheme to sell pulses at a subsidised rate of Rs 15 per kg over the issue price to states for distribution only under the welfare programmes of both state and central governments.""In a short span of three months, the scheme has been utilised by 10 states and one union territory, indenting stock of around 5.50 lakh tonne,"" Nafed Managing Director Sanjeev K Chadha said.The pulses have been allocated to states such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Daman and Diu besides Kerala, he said.The states have already made payment for 3.22 lakh tonne of pulses and more states are showing interest, he added.Elaborating more, Nafed additional Managing Director S K Singh said the states are distributing subsidised pulses mostly through Public Distribution System (PDS), also called ration shops.For instance, the Karnataka government is selling tur dal at Rs 38 per kg, while Maharasthra is distributing chana dal and urad at Rs 35 per kg through the PDS, he said.""Jharkhand has placed its order for urad. We are in talks with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal,"" Singh said, adding that there is no cap on states for buying subsidised pulses from Nafed but they have to justify the demand.Stating that the sale of subsidised dals to states has lifted mandi price of pulses, he said there is an increase in wholesale rate of chana by Rs 3-4 per kg, tur and moong by Rs 10 per kg and masoor dal by Rs 4-5 per kg, which will help farmers.It may be noted that pulses prices have fallen below the MSP levels owing to record output and huge buffer stock with the government.Besides, Nafed has disposed of 12.22 lakh tonne pulses through open market and supplied over 12,000 tonne milled pulses to army and paramilitary force, Singh added.Nafed's primary business activities entails procurement of notified oilseeds and pulses at the minimum support price either under two government schemes the PSS and the PSF.It is also into production and marketing of certified seeds, bio-fertilisers, sale of milled pulses, organic products, among others.The cooperative said it had achieved a gross profit of Rs 252 crore during the 2017-18 fiscal with a turnover of Rs 3,213 crore.

The retail prices of per kg tur have increased by Rs 10 in the last couple of days.Per kg prices of moong dal in the wholesale market have also increased by Rs 4 in the last 20 days. The impact on retail prices has been more, said sources. Wholesalers said tur was likely to get pricier in the coming days, with an increase of Rs 8-10 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 10-15 per kg in the retail market.Dhaval Shah, director of Jairaj Group in Market Yard, told TOI that prices of all pulses, except tur and moong, were stable in the wholesale market.Tur dal has recorded the highest spike in prices in the last 20 days, as arrival of the new crop has dipped by 30% in comparison to the same period last year. Moong dal prices have gone up by Rs 4 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 5 in the retail market during this period. The rise in the tur prices has been to the tune of Rs 6-7 per kg. It may rise by another Rs 8-10 per kg in the wholesale market during the next one month. The rise in retail price may be around Rs 10-15 per kg during the next one month, Shah said.Tur dal production in the state has been hit the most because of shortage at the farm level, as the state has the highest acreage under this lentil, he added.Khushal Unecha, owner of Ganpat super market in Gokahlenagar, said, The retail prices of tur dal went up by Rs 10 on Friday. The tur crop has dipped considerably this time, as not only sowing was delayed but rain was also deficient in 2018. With the sudden surge in price, customers may get panicky and cut down on buying tur.In the last 15 days, he said, tur prices in the wholesale market have gone up by 10% as the government had last year also hiked the minimum support price (MSP) of moong, tur, urad, masoor and chana or gram.The MSP of tur was hiked from Rs 5,450 per quintal to Rs 5,675 per quintal. The government has also stopped the import of pulses since a year, which is creating further shortage at a time when around 50% of the tur crop has failed, he said.An Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) official said tur prices in the Pune APMC market have gone up by Rs 6-7 in the last seven days, while that of moong by Rs 2-3 in the last four to five days.Vijay Rathod of Mulchand and Sons, a wholesale firm in Market Yard, said tur prices in the wholesale market have shot up by Rs 500 per quintal since Monday. The new tur crop arrivals are 40% less than what they were during the same period last year, he said.Nitin Nahar, a wholesaler and director of the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra , said pulse prices in the wholesale market were expected to rise further during the next one month.In 2017, over-production of tur in Maharashtra had led to a grave situation for farmers, compounded by what they considered a faulty government procurement system. Consequently, numerous farmers in the pulse growing belt of Marathwada and Vidarbha had planned to cut down on tur sowing.The production of tur during the few years preceding 2017 was quite low. This led to an increase in the prices of the commodity. But the good rainfall in 2016 and government initiatives to increase production of pulses led to a glut in tur production. Both the areas and productivity of tur increased significantly, causing a crash in its prices. In 2018, a drought-like condition caused an opposite situation with a shortage of the pulse."

But, with three years of research at a private college here, students of first and second year Hotel Management and Travel and Tourism departments have come up with more than 100 varieties of halwa pizza.Have you heard of halwas like paan, maize, butterscotch, crunchy caramel, rum ball, coffee? These were among the jaw-dropping ones for world-renowned food critics and chefs who were there to taste them at an event in the college on Wednesday. Then, there were halwas catering to exotic tastes and mouth-watering ones for kids, prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables. And what about non-vegetarian halwas? Gotta be kidding! Well, well, they are those made of egg, theres also Shahi Mutton Halwa, and Chicken Halwa, to name a few.It is very difficult to convert mutton into a sweet dish, and cook it without onion and garlic. It took me almost six hours to prepare it, as it is a slow cooking procedure, said Hritik Rawar, student of first year hotel management at the college. Dev Kartik, another first year student, said: Egg bhurji and egg toast are passe in breakfast. When it comes to sweets, one can have egg halwa with mix fruit. Consuming a lot of time, rajma halwa was prepared by Aditi, another first year student. She said: Instead of sugar, I have used stevia leaves and rajma. This halwa is rich in protein content, but it took me almost three hours to cook.Halwas of fruits like mango, pomegranate, dragon fruit, coconut, papaya, cheeku, guava, apple, caramel, banana, plum, raw mango, blueberry, strawberry, and water chest were made by students with the puree of fresh fruits. Same goes for vegetables like potatoes topped with sweet French fries, spinach, cauliflower, and raddish. Bitter gourd  a vegetable that has less demand in the market  was also used to make halwa.Halwas for kidsKeeping nutritional values alive and the varying mood of kids in mind, students have also made halwas for children from cherry, gems, toffee pudding, and custard vanilla halwa.Payal Bassi, a first year student, used multi-vitamin bread, jam, nuts, and desi ghee to make halwa. She said: I have used this because my nephew loves jam, but he gets bored of carrying bread and jam to school on a regular basis. Thus, I chose this ingredient so that they can remain healthy by eating this halwa.Anirban Gupta, dean, Hotel Management and Aviation & Tourism at the college, said: In todays generation, everyone is after fast food. It is especially difficult for parents to feed them nutritious food like spinach, gooseberry, broccoli, woodapple (bel), bitter gourd, and pumpkin. We have made them in the form of halwa with a pizza base.Exotic halwasOther exotic halwas include dry fruits like pista, almonds, rawa kesari, mix fruit, khuskhus, walnut, khajoor, sesame, kaju, and kiwi, which were inspired by the Mughal period, as these ingredients are known for valour and strength.For health-conscious people, there were halwas made of oats and cornflakes, and mix root halwa (made of red and black carrot, and beetroot). Sweets with high sugar like chamcham, mix barfi, gulab jamun, milk cake, rabri, panjiri, balushahi, white rasgulla, and cottage cheese were also used with a donut base, so that they can relish both the sweet and the halwa.To make it to the international market, students have come up with innovative ideas like use of orange brownie, cookies, red velvet, cheese cake, tiramisu, Kit Kat, Oreo, fudge cake, and chocolate. Simran, a second year student, said: I have a bakery, but I am unable to serve an Indian sweet dish like halwa to people. So, to make it to the international market, I have tried an orange brownie.Students have also attempted acid-based ingredients like pineapple for making halwa. As milk gets curdled due to high acid content, they found processing could be done by tossing it into a sugar cane syrup or stevia leaves. The same process goes for lemon and orange.With their hard work to push a typical Indian dish into the international market, students have planned to sell it in the open market. They said hotel chefs could also approach them for recipes. Interestingly, these halwas will be served in the campus at reasonable prices through canning.WAH! KYA HALWA!* Some of the varieties included Exotic Halwa, Rasgulla Halwaizza, Cornflax Halwaizza, Pan Gulkand Halwaizza, Tiramisu Halwaizza, Mughal Gosht Halwaizza, Orange Brownie Halwaizza, Sarso Ka Saag Halwaizza, Murg Halwaizza, and Karachi Halwaizza.* The guests at the event were Kavita Bahuguna, famous food and hotel reviewer-writer, chef Sudhanshu, general manager from Maharaja Grand, celebrity chef Neelu Kaura, chef Shibiraj Saha, executive chef from Park Plaza, and chef Paramjeet Singh, executive chef from Keys Hotel.* The students showcased a lot of creative and innovative ideas for the event, where Hritik Rawat from BHMCT first year bagged the First Prize for Gosht Halwaizza, followed by Aditi from BTTM first year who bagged the second prize for Rajma Halwaizza, and the third prize was bagged by Gurkaran from BHMCT second year for Pan Gulkand Halwaizza."

The party had fielded its candidates in 57 constituencies and contested the polls without any alliance.Mr. Beniwal said here on Tuesday that the RLP had not only won three seats, but also obtained a considerable vote share and made an impact on the results in about two dozen Assembly constituencies.The party won Khinvsar and Merta seats in Nagaur district and Bhopalgarh seat in Jodhpur district.The RLP president said the party was trying to enter into an alliance with other parties and discussing the framework of accord with Bahujan Samaj Party, Bharatiya Tribal Party, Communist Party of India and some other smaller political outfits. He said a decision on his own candidature in the Lok Sabha election would be taken after consultations with the party workers and Assembly poll candidates.No relief yetMr. Beniwal said the Congress, which was elected to power in Rajasthan following its promises made to farmers and youth, had yet to extend relief to vulnerable sections of society. The loan waiver has not benefited all the eligible farmers, while moong (lentil) procurement is yet to start and the contractual workers in government offices are still waiting for regularisation, he said.The RLP chief said several promises made in the Congress manifesto could have been fulfilled before the elections model code of conduct came into force. Evicting the BJP from power has not served the purpose. The ruling Congress is yet to take meaningful action for people's welfare.Though the Congress had declared earlier this month that it would have no truck with allies in the Lok Sabha polls, its stance has been perceived as a strategy to put pressure on the smaller parties to accept an alliance on its terms and agree to a limited number of seats."

The unseasonal rain has poured water on the hopes of farmers who said the moong crop was in harvesting stage and the coming two weeks were crucial before reaping the produce.Some of the farmers, who reaped a part of their crop, are distraught. I have lost vegetable crop which I had reaped in the last few days. With all the harvest destroyed, I am at a loss over repaying bank loan that I had taken to cultivate summer crop, said Natabara Jena, a farmer of Pattamundai. Another farmer, Giridhari Behera of Patkura, said the unseasonal rain and hail damaged black gram and green gram saplings on two acres of land.Farmer leader and secretary of district unit of Krusak Sabha Gayadhar Dhal said crop damage has been reported from almost all coastal pockets of the district. Farmers fear that another round of shower would completely damage their crop.Apart from vegetable crop growers, the hailstorm has ruined betel farms on large tracts of land across Kendrapara and its nearby areas. Hundreds of betel leaves in several farms have been damaged by sudden rain and hail, said Narayan Mandal, a betel grower of Kandaripatana village.Betel farmers of the district are facing hard times because of the Governments indifference and non-implementation of various beneficiary projects for the growers, said Mandal. Neither the government nor any insurance company is extending helping hand to the betel growers of the district, as a result, many growers are unable to insure their farms, added Mandal. Though the quantum of damage is yet to be ascertained by the farmers, Deputy Director of Agriculture Department in Kendrapara Mitrodoya Das said."

They have been persecuted and killed for this reason. Many people in Marayur village, in Idukki, too believed in the omen, but not any longer. The owls are being conserved and looked after, thanks to the efforts of a set of environmentalists and local people, who convinced all how they are of big help to farmers in keeping pests away.And the forest eagle owl (kattu moonga), which otherwise could be spotted only in dense evergreen forests, has become a regular sight on Marayurs roadside, evoking curiosity of tourists and nature buffs alike. I spotted a pair of SBE owls, nestled in the cavity of a large tree on the highway side at Melady, Marayur, last November. A few local people had called me to see off the owl, as it has been considered the viceroy of Yaman (lord of death in Hindu mythology); a sign of bad luck or death, said Rajadurai, a naturalist and tourist guide working at Marayur.I was so surprised to see this rare species of nocturnal bird, found normally in dense forests, nestled alongside the highway. Instead of shooing them away from their habitat, I started creating awareness among the local settlers on the importance of conserving these species and how we human beings can benefit from them, said Rajadurai.As a first step, he convinced the farmers, who comprise 90 per cent of Marayurs population, how these owls weighing 1.3-1.5 kg help them, especially in rodent elimination. An SBE owl pair with a family of owlets can consume a total of 2,500 voles and other rodents over the course of a year making them effective pest controllers. A few people were hesitant to let the SBE owls live in their neighbourhood due to superstition, but most others came forward offering support to conserve them. As people stopped disturbing them, the birds started laying eggs in the tree cavity, said Rajadurai.Naturalists from Bengaloru, Pune, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have come to see the rare sight of SBE bird nestled on trees with its hatched young ones. It has also attracted foreign tourists, national and international photographers, other than mediapersons.And the local people are doing small business, thanks to the tourists. That is the kind of turnaround made by the owl, which was once considered a bird of bad omen."
2019-04-16,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/name-change-speedier-than-development-in-hathras/story-HR76u4mIBifIoBh31FHakL.html,Lok Sabha Elections 2019: Name change speedier than development in Hathras,"After Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati took over as UP chief minister in 1997, she renamed Hathras (a city falling under Aligarh district) as Mahamayanagar and accorded it the status of a district.This triggered a name changing game between the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) which continued for years.The SP government led by Mulayam Singh Yadav restored the districts name to Hathras but this was short-lived as the first thing that Mayawati did after returning to power 2007 was to rename the district as Mahamayanagar.Once again after coming to power in 2012, Akhilesh Yadav restored the original name Hathras which continues till today.However, the repeated naming and renaming of the district brought little relief to the people to continue to struggle.A reserved parliamentary seat, Hathras is known for colours of Holi which are supplied far and wide.The heeng (asafoetida) of Hathras is famous internationally. The constituency also houses Pudil Nagar which is known for the trade of artificial beads (moonga and moti).Hathras comprises potato belt but due to the lack of adequate processing units, potato farmers are left complaining year after year.POLITICAL HISTORYHathras parliamentary constituency went to the Congress in the 1962 general elections but it was the Republican Party of India (RPI) which won thereafter.Congress bounced back in 1967 and 1971 but the JP Movement swept the nation and the Bharatiya Lok Dal candidate Ram Prasad Deshmukh won the seat in 1977 when the Janata Party formed the government at the Centre.The Bharatiya Janata Party began its winning spree with the Ram Temple wave in the 90s.Lal Bahadur Rawal of the BJP won the seat in 1991 after which Kishan Lal Diler (BJP) won it for four consecutive terms between 1996 and 2009.Supported by the BJP, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) Sarika Baghel won the seat.LOK SABHA ELECTION 2014The BJP once again bagged the Hathras seat in 2014 when its candidate from Jatav community Rajesh Diwakar garnered 5,44,277 votes (51.87%) to defeat Manoj Kumar Soni of the BSP who received 2,17,891 votes (20.77%).Samajwadi Party candidate Ramji Lal Suman got 1,80,891 (17%) votes and stood third. RLD candidate Niranjan Singh Dhangar and AAPs Sunhari Lal secured the fourth and fifth spot with 86,109 (8%) and 5,043 votes (0.48%) respectively.LOK SABHA ELECTION 2019This time around, BJP has replaced its sitting MP Rajesh Diwakar, a Jatav, with Rajvir Singh Diler, son of four-time MP Kishan Lal Diler.Diler belongs to the Valmiki community and may face resentment from Jatavs.The SP-BSP-RLD alliance has fielded Ramji Lal Suman who is a four-time MP from Firozabad. Suman stands a chance with added vote power of alliance partners with a healthy number of Scheduled Caste and Jat votes coupled with the Muslim support.Congress candidate Triloki Ram Diwakar had been an MLA from Iglas.First Published: Apr 16, 2019 14:05 IST"

The procedure for import of 2 lakh tonnes of pigeon peas/toor dal, 1.5 lakh tonnes of urad dal, 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong dal and 1.5 lakh tonnes of peas (including yellow peas, green peas, dun peas, and kaspa peas) is laid down, the circular said.All India Dal Millers Association chairman Suresh Agrawal has welcomed the decision.However, the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) already has a stock of 35 lakh tonnes of pulses in its godowns, its managing director Sanjeev Chaddha said recently. The state-run agency also planned to buy 15-20 lakh tonnes of pulses in the ongoing rabi harvest season, he said.In light of this surplus, the decision to open import of pulses, even if it is limited to 6.5 lakh tonnes, may reduce prices and impact Indian growers, say some farmers groups."

A lizard had fallen into the dal during preparation, making the food poisoned, police said.Rajpur sub-divisional officer (police) DS Baghel told TOI that Barkha (16) daughter of the man, Panna Lal, had prepared gram dal. She was unaware of the fact that lizard could make food poisonous, so, she took out the reptile from the dal. Later, she served that dal to Panna, her 14-year-old sister Varsha, brother Sumit and consumed it herself too.Soon after consuming the dal, Panna and his kids complained of stomach ache and started vomiting. Locals took them to district hospital, where Panna died during treatment, while his kids were shifted to a private hospital, the SDO (P) said.Doctors said that condition of the kids was stable"

The plan was to make Maharashtra a drought-free state by 2019 through reviving streams, constructing stop dams, working on nullahs and digging farm ponds. As the state reels under severe drought four-and-a-half years later, Singh tells The Indian Express why the project failed and the shortcomings on part of the government.AdvertisingHow do you look at the recurring drought in state?The drought in Maharashtra is the worst in the entire country. Of the total 36 districts, 32 have been affected. I firmly believe that the drought in Maharashtra is manmade. The state has 42 per cent of the countrys major dams. More than Rs 70,000 crore have been invested in irrigation over the decades. Still, if there is recurring drought, it shows there is a gap between your plans and their implementation. I am not here to criticise any party or government. My concern is drought, which is a serious issue.Under Jalyukt Shivar, five lakh works were executed. Still, why did it fail in drought mitigation?AdvertisingJalyukta Shivar is a very good project to tackle drought. I have repeatedly cited its example at national and international forums. In 2015, when the government launched the project, I was closely associated with it. I had travelled extensively to promote the project and create awareness among villagers.The government has created five lakh water structures. But if the monsoons fail, how can we store water?Critics have questioned the project.The problem is not with the project. Problems arise if we fail to executive projects properly. Somewhere, after a headstart, contractors started driving the scheme. Now, when you involve contractors, their concern is not about water but profit. Secondly, wherever local residents helped in the execution of Jalyukt Shivar, it has worked very well. In Sangli, we revived rivers Mahakali and Agrani. Even now, when the state is reeling under drought, there is plenty of water in these rivers. There are thousands of such examples where Jalyukt Shivar has helped villagers cope with water scarcity.What explains the current drought in 151 of the 355 talukas?It is the lack of political will to push tough policies. How can the government allow high water intensive sugarcane cultivation in drought-prone districts? Somehow, I get the sense that the government lacked the courage to take bold decisions. By now, it should have clearly come out with a holistic drought plan. Crop pattern (proportion of area under different crops at a particular period of time) should be linked to rainfall. There should be a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in 60 per cent of the rain shadow area. It has to adopt stricter guidelines on agriculture and water. Why is the government afraid of the sugar lobby?Farmers prefer sugarcane cultivation as it brings assured income.True, sugarcane brings better results financially. It requires less investment and labour. But apart from guzzling more water, it does not percolate deep into the soil. Sugarcane farming has its drawbracks, as it adversely impacts soil health. Policies should be made to enforce change in crop pattern. Farmers in Marathwada can switch from sugarcane to pulses and cereals. Cultivating tur (yellow dal) along with urad and moong is a good combination. There is always a way forward. Alternative cultivation can bring financial rewards for farmers.Crop pattern theoretically sounds good. But is it practical?If we have to tackle drought, it is essential. The problem is partly to do with mindset and culture. Those advocating sugarcane cultivation in drought-prone areas are concerned about their vested interests. Else, they are oblivious about the water crisis. You cannot continue to exploit water without worrying about falling groundwater levels. Recurring drought is an outcome of excess water mining. People are digging borewells at a depth of 1,000 feet.How would you compare the water crisis in Maharashtra with Rajasthan?Geographical conditions make Rajasthan more vulnerable, as it has large stretches of deserts. Yet, we have never seen farmers committing suicide in Rajasthan. But Maharashtra has always topped the suicide list. Many factors may be responsible, including culture and lifestyle. Also, migration in Rajasthan, from rural to urban, is temporary and much less. In Maharashtra, largerscale migration takes place during drought and it is also permanent."

Muslims around the world have begun their fasting for 30 days, in remembrance of the Quran being revealed to Prophet Mohammed the first time. The dawn-to-dusk fasting begins after the 'suhoor' (pre-dawn meal) and is broken with 'Ifthar' in the evening. Haleem, which is known as the 'complete meal', plays an important role in Ifthar.Prepared with mutton, varieties of dal and spices, haleem is a stew-like meal rich with proteins and carbohydrates. ""Because of the day-long fasting, the dish helps boost the energy of the faithful. Also, the lentils in the dish replenish one's protein levels,"" says Ravinder Singh Panwar, executive chef, Kochi Marriott Hotel.The dish, which has the semblance of oatmeal, takes long hours and is traditionally prepared in mud containers under firewood. ""It usually takes seven to eight hours to prepare. As haleem needs to achieve a batter-like consistency, the entire chunk of meat and lentils have to be broken down. Because of the presence of the dal and broken wheat which has a lesser cooking time, the dish cannot be prepared on a high flame,"" says the chef. Furthermore, the quantity of the dish plays a deciding factor in the cooking time.While many choose to have haleem as it is, some choose to savour it with accompaniments such as dates and salad.RECIPELamb HaleemThe complete mealIngredientsLamb boneless: 500 gMoong dal: 50 gMasoor dal: 50 gChanna dal: 50 gUrad dal: 50 gTuvar dal: 50 gBroken wheat: 200 gOnion: 50 gBay leaf: 1 gCinnamon: 2 gGreen cardamom: 2 gAllspice: 5 gGinger: 5 gGinger garlic paste: 50 gGhee: 300 gLemon: 2 nosGreen chilly: 2 nosSalt: 10 gMilk: 1 litreMint: 10 gPreparationHeat ghee.

2019-05-23,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/may/23/the-keeper-of-traditional-recipes-1980693.html,The keeper of traditional recipes,"Deepthi Parthasarathy ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The sweet, fragrant and warm smell of spices, ghee and jaggery fill 43-year-old Chella Rojas kitchen. She meticulously whisks the batter, turns the stove on and stirs the mix to prepare Kavuni arisi halwa, one of her signature dishes. The cooking enthusiast-cum-foodie loves experimenting with traditional rice varieties and herbs, to give healthy dishes a modern twist.After garnishing the halwa with fried cashews and grated coconut, she says, Honestly, I started cooking because it was a need, rather than genuine interest. Twenty-two years ago, after marriage, I learnt the art from scratch. My grandmothers knowledge and my mothers tips and tricks on basic cooking helped me. But after a year, I was bored with regular food and started experimenting from cookbooks and cookery shows.Cut to present, Roja tries out a new dish every week and shares her recipes with friends and family on WhatsApp. Her focus is always about making any dish healthy using alternative ingredients without compromising on quality and taste. This homemaker and a mother of two believes that healthy eating is the key to a healthy life. I can cook cuisines from Kerala, Andhra, Karnataka, Thailand and Italy. For example, pizza is not a junk food by itself. It is the ingredients we use that make it unhealthy. I have tried making pizzas using millet flour to make it healthier. After two to three times of trying, it came out well, she shares.The herbs that one can find in Rojas kitchen are used to make more than just kashayams. She uses tulsi (Holy Basil) in juices and soups; karpooravalli (Indian Borage) in bajji and rasam, vetrilai (Betel leaf) to make rice, aavarampoo (Tanners Cassia) in dosai and curries, flaxseed chutney and idli podi, vallarai (Centella Asiatica) in dosai and pakoda, and sembaruthi in milkshakes and tea.She lists down the alternatives that can be used  honey, brown sugar, jaggery and karupatti, in place of white sugar; vaazhakkai, sakkaravallikizhangu instead of potato; millet flour, ragi, kambu and cholam instead of wheat flour.She also gives details on different rice varieties which can be substituted in place of white rice. For instance, kavuni arisi (black rice) which is rich with antioxidants, B-vitamins and Anthocyanin helps prevent cancer; kattu yanam helps control diabetes; poongar arisi increases the haemoglobin content and restores hormone imbalances; red rice has B-vitamins and helps prevent cancer; maappillai samba rice improves stamina and moongil arisi (Bamboo rice) increases bone strength.I dont use white rice in my house. I use kavuni arisi and make biryani, dosai and halwa which my kids love. I get the satisfaction of serving them food that is both, healthy and enjoyable. I switch between different varieties of rice each month, says Roja.Roja was part of two reality cooking shows, recently. My idea was to spread awareness about traditional rice varieties to people. After it was telecast on TV, many asked me about the availability of these varieties and the recipes, beams Roja.There is a notion that these varieties have been newly introduced in organic stores. But the rice varieties have been around for a very long time. The high price of the unpolished rice is due to the lack of demand and harvest by the farmers. Once people start buying these from stores, the demand will increase and the prices will eventually reduce. This can change the face of the thriving white rice economy, she says.Rojas mantra to healthy eating is a balanced diet. She believes that it is the cooks responsibility to ensure that the right proportion of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and fibre are included in the diet.Earlier, the joint family system meant that there were more people to cook dishes. But now, there is not much time. The key is to incorporate various ingredients into one dish. Five different vegetables can be used in sambar. I use at least ten vegetables in kootu. The nutrient content can easily be identified with the colour of the vegetables, says Roja.Before she heads back into the kitchen, she reiterates an old Tamil saying, marundena vendam yakkaikku, atradhu arindhu potrumin which translates into, man doesnt need to have medicines if he is aware of the nutritious food which he can have in place of medication."
2019-05-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-agriculture-dept-warns-farmers-not-to-sow-crops-early-5753631/,Pune: Agriculture dept warns farmers not to sow crops early,"The Maharashtra Agriculture department has advised farmers to delay their sowing operations as the onset of monsoon is likely to be delayed in the state. If the onset of the monsoon is delayed beyond the second week of June, the crops of udit (urad) and moong are likely to be hit as farmers normally finish sowing operations by then.AdvertisingThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has tentatively fixed the onset date for monsoons as June 6 for Kerala with an error margin of four days. This is a seven-day delay from the normal date of onset, which historically is around June 1. Within seven days of its onset in Kerala, the monsoons sweep into Maharashtra and other parts of central India. As the date of onset is delayed, the monsoon is expected to hit Maharashtra only in the second week of June.Suhas Diwase, commissioner of agriculture, said farmers are advised to delay sowing in accordance with the delay in monsoon. Also, sowing of pre-monsoon crop of cotton has been strongly dissuaded as part of the integrated pest management programme to control the pink bollworm infestation in the crop. The department has even banned the sale of cotton seeds till the end of May to prevent early sowing. Even the IMD is yet to come out with its first sowing advisory for the season.Kharif is the major season for farmers in Maharashtra with crops like soyabean, tur, wheat, moong, udit and cotton dominating the landscape. Of these, moong and udit are early sowing, short-duration crops with farmers normally sowing them in June and harvesting after three months. Normally, the state records around 8 lakh hectares of sowing of both these lentils. In case the monsoon is delayed, the sowing of both the crops will be hit. Nitin Kalantri, a dal miller and trader operating from Latur, said in case states like Rajasthan receive good rainfall, the national moong acreage might not suffer much.What is more of a concern for farmers is the scarcity of drinking water and fodder for their animals. Milk production in the state has dipped by around 20 per cent and cost of dry fodder has escalated multifolds. If the rains fail to come on time, the scarcity will only aggravate in the days to come. What can be a further concern for farmers is the possible loss of vegetable crops. Jagdish Apshunde, a trader from the Nashik market, said the present vegetable crop is suffering from pest infestation. A price escalation is in the offing in the vegetable markets as the crop will be delayed. If the monsoon is delayed by more than seven days then things will be very difficult, he said."

The glimpse into the familys regal tradition was shared by Yaduveer Wadiyar of the Wadiyar dynasty of Mysore at a panel discussion held on the significance of satvik food in the city on Sunday.The discussion was organised by B.E.S.T Innovation University, Andhra Pradesh, and Heritage at Taj West End as a part of the Ahara series, a workshop that focussed on the aesthetic angle of food and its benefits to the body by keeping Ayurveda, yoga and spiritualism in sync. Moderated by Rakesh Raghunathan, food writer and commentator on the tele-series, Dakshin Diaries, the scions of four erstwhile royal families of India spoke about the cuisine that thrived during their ancestors time and their childhood, and the way they have adapted to the modern trend of eating out at restaurants or ordering in.In Thanjavur, we have two books from the late 1700s - Sampradayika Pakashastra, which mainly deals with recipes and special ingredients to be used while cooking, and Sarpendra Bhojana Guduburam, which gives an in-depth description of nutritious quality and medicinal values of food items, revealed S Babaji Raja Bhonsle of the Thanjavur Maratha dynasty, adding that they had a vegetarian satvik kitchen and a non-vegetarian Maratha kitchen with a Continental butler in the house.Kumbakonam Kadappa, a dish which brings out the Thanjavur-Maratha history, is like potato kurma but it has moong dal, and it bears the seasonings of sambar but also contains poppy seeds, coconut and cashew. Raghunathans interest on how these cuisines have evolved and their ancestors influence in the South brought Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagar Tulava dynasty and his wife Rathna Krishnadevaraya to talk about the evolution that came about in his family.There was a particular cuisine that was prepared for the Vijayanagara kings, which was low on spices to soothe the digestive system. This gave enough strength to their body to fight battles. Back then, there was a time when the whole village was fed one meal of the royal cuisine. The utensil used to cook it is still with us. This is one interesting part of history that we preserve. The prasadam, Naivaidya, still continues to be distributed at Hampi Virupaksha temple. The rice is soaked and ground, and we use chana dal, cashews, raisins and ghee, she said, adding that the wild boar recipe was also an interesting part of the familys culinary history.Recently, the growth of restaurants has peaked. Chefs have the time and patronage to be really creative and take inspirations from ancient texts and revive the recipes of princely states, and add the current trends. We do use ancient recipes during poojas, so in a way, we are keeping the royalty alive. New recipes were always a craze and thats how Mysore Pak came into the scene. It was born out of the urge that one of my ancestors had to bring out a new sweet, said Wadiyar, adding that the legacy is something that makes our Indian heritage richer."
2019-06-11,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/11/a-milky-way-to-health-1988495.html,A milky way to health,"SP Kirthana ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Milk is vital for both physical and mental growth. It is a nutrient-rich liquid extracted from farm animals. One cup (250 ml) of 2% fat cows milk contains 285 mg of calcium, which represents 22% to 29% of the daily recommended intake (DRI) of calcium for an adult. According to Recommended Dietary Allowance ICMR 2010, a human needs 1,000 mg to 1,200 mg of calcium per day which can be received from two or three glasses of milk, says Coimbatore-based dietician Pradeepa DS.Milk is a rich source of protein, providing approximately one gram in 240 ml. It contains whey proteins that can decrease blood pressure and stress. It is also excellent for growth of muscles. Milk is good for people across age groups. A few people avoid milk fearing weight gain. But, it is not true. It is a must for bone health. It is better to consume milk without sugar, she says, adding that one should have at least two glasses of milk, preferably cows milk, twice a day.Having milk after a meal or immediately before going to bed will lead to weight gain. It is always advised to drink a cup of milk one hour before going to bed. Milk is high in B12 and calcium. Dairy products are a good source of phosphorus, an essential mineral for the body.Diabetics can also consume milk. People who are lactose intolerant can have coconut milk or badam milk, she says.The by-products of milk include buttermilk, cheese, curd, ghee, paneer and yoghurt. Ghee and paneer are good for a healthy living. Consuming cheese in limited quantity is recommended, she says.SAFFRON RICE KHEERBy chef Kanchan J ValechaIngredientsGhee: 2 tsp, Basmati rice:  cup (pre-soaked and drained), Warm milk: 4 cups, Mawa: 100 g, Cane sugar: 7 tbsp, Cardamom: 2-3 (crushed), A pinch of saffron strands, Sliced assorted nuts (almond and pista), Rose water: 2 tsp, Dried rose petals: 1 tbspMethodSoak saffron in one tablespoon of warm milk and keep aside.Heat a heavy bottomed non-stick pan and add ghee.

This is mainly a fallout of the severe cyclonic storm Vayu at present hovering near the Mumbai coast. Dr A Kashyapi, head, weather monitoring and air pollution, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said heavy cloud cover will be reported in next 48 hours in Pune.AdvertisingFollow Cyclone Vayu LIVE UPDATES hereThe severe cyclonic storm Vayu is at present active around 260 km off the Mumbai coastline. The storm is expected to move north, making landfall on the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva on Thursday afternoon. Goa, Konkan and other coastal areas have been witnessing heavy rainfall for the last 24 hours and the rain is expected to continue for the next 48 hours or so. The rain will help in recharging the groundwater table in these areas, he said.However, the cyclone has halted the progress of the monsoon, which hit the Kerala coast last week. The northern limit of the monsoon continues to remain over Madurai and Kannur and Aizwal in Mizoram. Only after the mid week of June will the monsoon pick up speed, but the progress will be slow, he said. While the rain is likely to continue in coastal areas, the parched regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha will have to wait longer for the pre-monsoon showers.The cyclone will be detrimental to the Southern Peninsula, which is likely to witness the return of heat waves. Similarly, Vidarbha and Marathwada will also see the return of severe heat waves, although there is some prediction of scattered rain in the regions. The monsoon has started on a weak system, so its progress will be delayed, Kashyapi said.Meanwhile, the delay in the monsoon will further push the start of the sowing activity. Farmers of moong and urad in Maharashtra and Karnataka are likely to forego their crops in favour of long-duration crops like cotton and soyabean in the days to come."
2019-06-14,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cashews-chilli-coconut-kunal-vijayakar-on-the-holy-trinity-of-karwari-cuisine/story-QJap7AjpLYBjBEwbpZ4y0L.html,"Cashews, chilli, coconut: Kunal Vijayakar on the holy trinity of Karwari cuisine","This is a battle that is worth the fight. Oh no, the battle is not between countries, clans or communities; its a war between coconut, chilli and cashews. Let me put forth the question at the outset. Is the food that comes from Karwar (a tiny village in Karnataka, just across the border from Goa) closer to Malwani, Goan or Mangalorean food? The simple answer is that it is all three.Like all three, the Karwari cuisine revels in the abundance of fish, the lusciousness of coconut and an anthology of spices. I have had the privilege of eating in several Karwari homes, and have devoured classics like Gavathi Kombdi (desi chicken curry) with Vade, Kurlya Suke (crab masala) with the classic Karwari Kaala Vatana (or black pea) Usal and the daily Upkari (dry vegetable with coconut) with a spicy Muga Ambat (sprouted moong in coconut and spices).Everything, vegetarian and non-vegetarian, fish and poultry, root and vegetable, is considered incomplete without coconut. I have devoured this food with great rapture and gluttony, and on deliberation I have to confess that Karwari cuisine is profoundly kindred to Mangalorean food, and is less like the individualistic, fearless and diverse cooking styles of Maharashtra and Goa.Like all intimately regional cuisines, the Karwari too has thrived only because of the recipes, methods, formulas and rubrics handed down by generations of grandmothers, mothers and cooks. Till I bumped into Sudha Kamat and her beautifully photographed and detailed cookbook, The Karwar Palate. Each page systematically and comprehensively illustrates the variety, nuances and amplitude of Karwari food.Karwar is on the coast of Northern Karnataka, and unlike Goan cuisine, Karwari cooking did not succumb to the influence of the Portuguese. Karwari food has one hero and one heroine without whom there would be no drama. The hero is coconut and the heroine is the Byadagi chilli.Coconut is paramount and is used in all its forms. It is sometimes ground with spices, often just grated and added to vegetables; usually the milk is extracted and used in curries.The Byadagi chilli is a sweet, not-so-spicy thing grown in the Bellary, Haveri, Shimoga and Chitradurga regions of Karnataka. It is long and crumpled and imparts such a bright red colour that the oil of the chilli is also used to tint confectionary, beverages, nail polish and lipstick.No Karwari dish is complete without the flaming colour of the Byadagi chilli, and in her book Kamat lists recipes from her mother that pair it with native ingredients like jackfruit, raw mango, cucumber, drumsticks, cashews, and of course meat and fish.The book starts with concoctions for the variety of masalas that form the base of most of the dishes  like the localised garam masala, aamti masala, Malwani masala and kholombo masala. Kholombo is actually a vegetable and lentil preparation and the masala (a mixture of spices used commonly in Karnataka and Goa) is a bit like the south Indian sambhar powder.Next, in the book, come the chutneys, or as they are called in Konkani, Tond Lanvache. One such chutney is the Saasam, starring fried mustard seeds; it goes very well with neer dosa.The chutneys are followed by Fodis or fritters and it seems like the Karwaris make fritters out of everything, including brinjal, doodhi, raw bananas and jackfruit.The Pachadi is next. This is a mildly spiced coconut and yogurt-based raita made with vegetables and tempered with curry leaves and dried chillies. Much like the Pachadis cooked in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.Sudhas book then goes on to unravel the treasure trove of Karwari accompaniments, starting with the spicy Sungta Lonche or prawn pickle, and a unique recipe for red Karwari papads. There are also recipes for snacks like Biskut Ambada (a Karwari version of the Medu Wada made from urad daal); sweet rice pancakes called Dashmis; and Kalingad Dosa, made with freshly grated watermelon.Fish frying is an art in this coastal cuisine. The fish is usually shallow fried after being marinated in the right amount of spice, sourness and salt. Lightly coated with coarse flour, it emerges soft on the inside and crisp and fluffy on the outside.The most popular Karwari fish curry is the Ambat. Whether it is made with mackerel or pomfret, prawn or crab, the recipe for an Ambat is the same  spices, Byadagi chillies, coconut, kokum and triphal. Its a fiery red, but not-so-spicy coconut curry that must be eaten with rice and a slice of fried fish and washed down with a glassful of Sol Kadhi.Sudha Kamats book on the Karwar palate is quite encyclopaedic, and I have to confess that the cuisine is elaborate but at the same time simple to make. All you need is a recipe, the right spices, some coconut and the craving for something new.First Published: Jun 14, 2019 21:29 IST"

The memorandum alleged injustice and discrimination by the Centre which is not sending dues for implementation of agricultural and farmer welfare schemes. The memorandum was submitted to Governor Anandiben Patel at the Raj Bhavan on Saturday evening.The memorandum to the President said, The Union government had authorised Madhya Pradesh government for acquisition of 75 lakh tons of wheat. But so far has allocated funds for 67 lakh tons. Funds for acquisition of remaining eight lakh ton amounting to Rs 1500 crore should be allocated so that farmers can be paid without any further delay. The memorandum also alleged that payment of Rs 1000 crore for last years Bhavantar Scheme is also due and Centre should send that payment also.Speaking to TOI, state Kisan Congress president Dinesh Singh Gurjar said, Today the Kisan Congress held its state-level meeting at the PCC office. We discussed the Lok Sabha elections and its results. There were discussions held on the state governments loan waiver scheme, reduction of power bills for the agrarian sector, farmers pension scheme and availability of fertilisers and seeds for the rabi harvest season. Minister for agriculture Sachin Yadav also attended the meeting and he said that agricultural loans at zero per cent interest will continue.Ministers Omkar Singh Markam and PC Sharma were present and listened to the demands made by the Kisan Congress leaders and office-bearers. We also have a demand that the Narendra Modi government should stop import of lentils.

The memorandum alleged injustice and discrimination by the Centre which is not sending dues for implementation of agricultural and farmer welfare schemes. The memorandum was submitted to Governor Anandiben Patel at the Raj Bhavan on Saturday evening.The memorandum to the President said, The Union government had authorised Madhya Pradesh government for acquisition of 75 lakh tons of wheat. But so far has allocated funds for 67 lakh tons. Funds for acquisition of remaining eight lakh ton amounting to Rs 1500 crore should be allocated so that farmers can be paid without any further delay. The memorandum also alleged that payment of Rs 1000 crore for last years Bhavantar Scheme is also due and Centre should send that payment also.Speaking to TOI, state Kisan Congress president Dinesh Singh Gurjar said, Today the Kisan Congress held its state-level meeting at the PCC office. We discussed the Lok Sabha elections and its results. There were discussions held on the state governments loan waiver scheme, reduction of power bills for the agrarian sector, farmers pension scheme and availability of fertilisers and seeds for the rabi harvest season. Minister for agriculture Sachin Yadav also attended the meeting and he said that agricultural loans at zero percent interest will continue.Ministers Omkar Singh Markam and PC Sharma were present and listened to the demands made by the Kisan Congress leaders and office-bearers. We also have a demand that the Narendra Modi government should stop import of lentils. In Madhya Pradesh, a large portion of the state grow lentils and farmers are not getting fair price for their produce because of the Centres import policy.

2019-06-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/govt-drought-cover-record-stock-pulses-food-inflation-monsoon-fci-5782717/,Govt has drought cover: a record stock of pulses,"As India stares at the prospect of a sub-par monsoon  cumulative rainfall so far this season (June-September) has been 43 per cent below normal, on top of a 25 per cent deficiency in the pre-monsoon period (March-May)  it can take heart from two things that can significantly combat any threat of food inflation.AdvertisingThe first is the stocks of wheat and rice with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the Central pool. That, at 741.41 lakh tonnes (lt) plus another 120.08 lt of unmilled paddy (equivalent to roughly 80.45 lt of rice) as on June 1, is highest ever level for this date since 2012.It is also nearly twice the normative minimum operational-cum-strategic buffer of 411.20 lt to be maintained at the beginning of July.But what is perhaps more heartening is the large stocks of pulses held by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed). As on June 11, these, on its own account, totalled 27.46 lt  comprising 20.35 lt of chana (chickpea), 3.02 lt of urad (black gram), 1.47 lt of moong (green gram), 1.42 lt of arhar/toor (pigeon-pea) and 1.19 lt of masur (lentil).AdvertisingIn addition, the apex produce marketing cooperative was holding another 13.90 lt as buffer stock on the Centres behalf. That included 7.05 lt of arhar/toor, 2.41 lt of urad, 2.37 lt of chana, 1.43 lt of moong and 0.57 lt of masur.Never before have we had so much of pulses stocks (41 lt-plus) before the beginning of the agricultural year. This should help us comfortably tide over any domestic production shortfall in the event of a poor monsoon, said Sanjeev Kumar Chadha, managing director, Nafed.The prices of pulses went through the roof in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the first two years of the Narendra Modi governments first term, which also witnessed back-to-back droughts. Retail prices of arhar, which scaled Rs 180-200 per kg levels in October 2015, were seen to have contributed to the BJPs defeat in the Bihar Assembly polls that year.Wholesale inflation in pulses has climbed from 2.11 per cent to 18.36 per cent year-on-year between December and May this year. But most pulses, barring arhar/toor, are still trading in mandis at below their official minimum support prices (MSP).Also, unlike five years ago, government agencies have sufficient stocks to allow market intervention. The Modi government, for the first time, in October 2015, decided to create a buffer stock of pulses, initially through imports and later, by domestic procurement.From 2014-15 to 2019-20 (until June 12), aggregate procurement of pulses under the Centres price support scheme and price stabilisation fund programmes, at 87.86 lt, has been more than 12 times the 7.16 lt bought during the preceding 13 years. The bulk of this procurement has taken place after 2016-17 (see table).The stocks that we have built through our MSP-based procurement operations should also enable keeping imports within limits, Chadha said.Indias imports of pulses soared from 36.55 lt in 2013-14 to 66.09 lt in 2016-17. Subsequently, they fell to 56.08 lt in 2017-18, and to 25.30 lt in 2018-19, on the back of increased domestic production and procurement by Central agencies. For the current fiscal, the Centre has imposed quantitative restrictions, limiting annual imports to 2 lt of arhar/toor and 1.5 lt each of urad, moong and peas. Chana imports, too, now attract 60 per cent customs duty.Besides pulses, the Centre is seeking to create a 50,000-tonne buffer stock of onions, which has also recorded a spike in wholesale inflation from minus 63.83 per cent to 15.89 per cent year-on-year between December 2018 and May 2019. Out of the 50,000 tonnes target, Nafed has already procured 46,000 tonnes.On June 11, the Commerce Ministry withdrew the 10 per cent MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) subsidy on onion. The move was intended at discouraging exports of the bulb, which rose from 16.92 lt (valued at Rs 3,359.60 crore) in 2017-18 to 22.04 lt (Rs 3,521.33 crore) in 2018-19.In its first term, the Modi government was very hawkish on food inflation, invoking the Essential Commodities Act to clamp stockholding restrictions on pulses, onion, and sugar, apart from practically banning their exports while permitting unlimited duty-free imports.AdvertisingThe general expectation is that it may be more circumspect in the current term, despite wholesale inflation for food articles shooting up from minus 0.42 per cent to 6.99 per cent between December and May. One reason for this could be that in Maharashtra, which is slated to go to polls in October, the votes of sugarcane, onion and pulses growers may count just as much as those of urban consumers."
2019-06-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/monsoons-drought-water-crisis-marathwada-farmers-crops-narendra-modi-if-the-rains-fail-5783494/,If the rains fail,"Its early days yet, but the prospects of a failed monsoon loom large in the first year of the Narendra Modi governments second term, as in 2014 and 2015. The first half of this month has seen the country receive 43 per cent below-normal rainfall, on top of a 25 per cent deficiency in the pre-monsoon season (March-May). Moreover, Gujarat, Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, coastal Andhra Pradesh and large areas in the Northeast have been experiencing an extended dry spell since the last post-monsoon period (October-December). If current conditions persist  the US Climate Prediction Center has forecast an 81 per cent chance of El Nino, the abnormal warming of the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean waters known to adversely impact rainfall in India, continuing till July and 66 per cent up to August  kharif crop production will take a hit. The agriculture ministrys data already shows a 9 per cent fall in plantings so far this kharif season compared with last years corresponding acreage, with even sharper declines for pulses (51 per cent) and coarse cereals (26 per cent).AdvertisingThere is a difference, though, in the situation now relative to five years ago. In May 2014, retail food inflation was at 8.89 per cent year-on-year. In May 2019, it was only 1.83 per cent, while ruling below general consumer price inflation for an unprecedented 33 months in a row. Also, this time, government agencies are holding huge stocks of not just wheat and rice, but also pulses. While most pulses, barring arhar, are still trading below their minimum support price levels, even the little inflation now building up in many vegetables, milk or poultry products should not ring alarm bells. If anything, they represent a healthy price correction after a prolonged bearish phase in agricultural commodity markets, triggered both by global factors (collapse of exports) and domestic policies (inflation targeting and demonetisation).Given the delayed onset of monsoon and likely rainfall deficit, farmers should be advised to sow short-duration pulses (moong and urad), soyabean, groundnut, sesame, guar and fodder crops, apart from maize and cotton that need less water than paddy or sugarcane. More important, however, is to think beyond the immediate. That would mean freeing up agricultural markets by totally abolishing stocking, movement and export restrictions on produce; giving farmers the freedom to sell their crop to anybody and anywhere; and replacing all input and output subsidies with per-acre direct benefit transfers. The farm sector must no longer be viewed as a source of wage-goods for meeting industrialisation or inflation-targeting goals, but a potent instrument for raising rural incomes and reducing poverty."

An official of the agriculture department said that company offered Rs 258.59 crore against the claimed amount of Rs 1,034.36 crore -- Rs 120.20 crore less than the premium paid, Rs 378.79 crore.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the PM Crop Insurance Scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, in 2015. As per the scheme , a farmer has to pay only 2 percent of total premium, while the state and central government bear the rest of the amount equally.Local authorities refused to accept companys pared down offer and demanded a full compensation, after which in January this year the firm approached the Union agriculture ministry, claiming that no crops were sown in Barmer district before the cut-off date of August 15, which entitles it to offer only 25% of the insurance claim.Based on the crop assessment report submitted by a central team, the state government has declared drought in 2,741 of total 2,775 villages in Barmer. As per the report, due to erratic monsoon, crop has been damaged across 1,266,418 hectares, out of total cultivated area 1,518,190 hectares of land.Barring the financial year 2010-11, Barmer has been facing severe drought over the last 10 years.In the crop assessment report, 100% crop damage has been reported in 2,191 villages and 75% in 503 villages.After we refused to accept the 25 percent claim as offered by Insurance company, it had approached the agricultural ministry. Now ministry has refused the companys argument and the technical advisory committee of agricultural ministry has issued the final order and soon compensation will be disbursed to the farmers, said Kishorilal Verma, deputy director in the agricultural (Extention) department in Barmer.First Published: Jun 19, 2019 13:59 IST"
2019-06-20,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/slow-monsoon-progress-delays-sowing-of-soyabean-cotton-crops-5789650/,"Slow monsoon progress delays sowing of soyabean, cotton crops","The late arrival of monsoon has delayed the sowing of major kharif crops across the country. While the sowing of cotton has been delayed by two weeks, there has been almost no sowing of soyabean. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said monsoon will arrive in Maharashtra on June 21.AdvertisingThe monsoon has already arrived in parts of south India, like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, but the rest of the country, except parts of east India, is yet to receive rainfall. The IMDs agrimet department has not issued any sowing advisory, though it has asked farmers to prepare the land for sowing.In Maharashtra, barring paddy nurseries in parts of Kolhapur, there has not been any significant sowing of crops. The sowing window for kharif crops like moong and urad is closing fast with farmers likely to divert land for other crops like cotton, tur and soyabean.Atul S Ganatra, president of the Cotton Association of India (CAI), said the delayed sowing of cotton by two weeks will affect seed prices. Kapas (seed cotton) prices will rise after a month, he said. But farmers are more concerned about the possible effect of the delayed sowing on production. While the sowing window of cotton is till July 15, delayed sowing can cause a 20-30 per cent dip in final production, farmers said. Last year, cotton was sown in more than 126 lakh hectares across India, which resulted in production of 337 lakh bales each weighing 170 kg.AdvertisingDelayed monsoon has also resulted in almost no sowing of soyabean, although the area under the oilseed is expected to increase in Maharashtra by 10 per cent. Last year, Maharashtra reported 36.39 lakh hectares of soyabean sowing, while the number was 108 lakh hectares across India.Naresh Goenka, vice-chairman of the Soyabean Processors Association of India (SOPA), said the three important states  Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh  have not reported any sowing. But soyabean is a sturdy crop and late sowing will not have any effect on yield or state of the crop, he said. Farmers of moong and urad, said Goenka, will prefer growing soyabean due to the delayed rains.Soyabean is expected to trade above its government-declared Minimum Support Price of Rs 3,399 per quintal this season. Prices at wholesale markets will be at least Rs 3,400-3,500 per quintal in the next season also, said Goenka.The higher prices, he added, will be mostly because of increased demand from the domestic poultry industry, which has turned towards deoiled cake (DOC) of the oilseed for feed. Millers generally extract 18-12 kg of oil from every 100 kg of bean (1 quintal). The remaining protein rich solid mass and other materials serve as protein source for the animal feed industry. The poultry industry has reverted back to DOC of soya as its protein source given the steep rise in price of other alternatives like DOC of rice bran, cotton seed. We expect the momentum to stay, he said."
2019-06-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dry-june-hits-kharif-sowing-area-25-less-than-normal-5805856/,"Dry June hits kharif, sowing area 25% less than normal","With 31 of Indias 36 meteorological sub-divisions recording deficient-to-scanty monsoon rainfall so far, sowing by farmers in the current kharif cropping season has been over 25 per cent below the normal levels for this period.AdvertisingAccording to the Agriculture Ministrys latest sowing data released Friday, the total area planted under all crops during this kharif season has been only 146.61 lakh hectares (lh), as against last years corresponding coverage of 162.07 lh and the normal five-year-average of 196.66 lh for the same period. The season roughly begins from June 1 with the onset of the southwest monsoon.Pulses have taken the maximum hit, with a mere 3.42 lh being planted, which is way below the 8.86 lh and 18.18 lh area sown during this time in 2018 and 2017, respectively.All major kharif pulses have reported huge declines: arhar or pigeon-pea (0.84 lh versus 3.69 lh and 5.82 lh for the preceding two years), urad or black gram (0.62 lh versus 1.05 lh and 2 lh) and moong or green gram (1.04 lh versus 2.75 lh and 6.58 lh).AdvertisingOilseeds and coarse cereals, too, have registered significant shortfalls relative to their normal acreages for June. Even these would have been worse, but for a somewhat decent monsoon in Rajasthan and the Saurashtra region of Gujarat receiving showers during the second and third week of this month, thanks to the effects of Cyclone Vayu.As a result, the area under groundnut is up (9.81 lh, against 4.40 lh in 2018 and a normal average of 8.56 lh for this time), especially so in the two states.On the other hand, soyabean acreage has witnessed huge contraction (2.75 lh versus 8.56 lh and 14.10 lh), with the bulk of planting happening only in Rajasthan and very little in Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra. Rajasthan has, likewise, seen good progress in sowing of bajra (pearl-millet) and maize  in contrast to Karnataka, which is a major producer of maize.According to the Met Department, the all-India area-weighted rainfall during June 1-28, at 97.9 mm, was more than 35 per cent lower than its corresponding long period average of 151.2 mm.While June has been practically dry, a revival in monsoon can still enable sowing in most kharif crops, for which the window extends till mid-July.The Met has forecast the formation of a low pressure area over the north Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around June 30, which is likely to become more marked and concentrate into a depression during the subsequent 48 hours. That should favour the further advance of the monsoon into the remaining areas of central India and more parts of western and northwest India by early July.The other heartening feature is that the Food Corporation of India currently has over 82 million tonnes (mt) of wheat and rice stocks, which is nearly twice the required minimum buffer. Also, government agencies for the first time are holding around 4.1 mt of pulses, which should be sufficient insurance against any possible drought situation."
2019-06-30,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/as-sowing-drops-by-97-per-cent-in-maharashtra-concerns-about-rising-prices-of-vegetables-and-other-commodities-5808194/,"As sowing drops by 97 per cent in Maharashtra, concerns about rising prices of vegetables and other commodities","The dismal situation for most farmers in Maharashtra continues as, even days after the arrival of monsoon, the rainfall is inadequate and farmers have little to cheer about. Sustained absence of rains has resulted in little or no sowing activity.AdvertisingUrban consumers can feel the brunt of the delayed monsoon and sporadic rains as the steep rise in prices of vegetables like tomatoes and onions, and the high prices of tur and chana daal, have hit them. At the same time, almost all dairies in the state have increased the retail price of milk in plastic pouches by Rs 2 per litre. This has stoked fear about the return of food inflation. But all of it is not bad news. Once monsoon rain finally finds its momentum in the next few weeks, sowing activities are expected to pick up. The prices of vegetables and milk, however, may take some time to drop to normal levels.The impact on sowing activityData released by the state Agriculture Department has revealed that there has been a 97 per cent dip in sowing this year, when compared to the sowing activity in this period last year.As on June 18, only 39,176 hectares of farmland have reported sowing of any kind. Last year, on June 22, sowing had been completed on as much as 12.04 lakh hectares in the state. Due to lack of moisture in the soil, farmers had put on hold the sowing of pulses, soyabean, sugarcane, cotton, paddy and some vegetables. Some portions of Konkan and southern Maharashtra have seen nursery plantation of paddy and some millets, but most farmers are yet to begin their operations.AdvertisingThe silver lining is that in the last 72 hours, there has been a good spell of rain and if the rainfall remains consistent, sowing activity will pick up in the coming days, but farmers may decide not to cultivate some short-duration crops.The crops affectedThe main crops which may have missed their sowing window are pulses like moong and urad. Grown within a period of 90-100 days, the sowing window of both pulses ends by mid-June. If sown later than usual, there is a possibility of rain at the time of harvest and subsequent crop loss. Usually, Maharashtra has nearly 8 lakh hectares of area for both crops, with farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha predominantly cultivating the crop. While reduction in the area of cultivation in Maharashtra may not have much of an effect on the national basket, as produce from Rajasthan and Telangana would compensate for any shortfall, this may lead to a slight rise in the prices of moong and urad daal.Once the sowing window gets over, farmers prefer to opt for long-duration crops like tur, soyabean and cotton. Soyabean is the sturdiest of the lot and is resilient towards the many vagaries of nature.Maharashtra reports around 37-38 lakh hectares of land under oilseed and this year, the acreage is expected to go up by 10 per cent. Throughout the last season, the oilseed had traded above its government-specified minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,399 per quintal, giving farmers an incentive to opt for the crop.Another crop that may see more cultivation is cotton, given the better realisation farmers have received in wholesale markets. But farmers are also wary of yield loss due to delayed sowing.Delayed sowing can cause up to 20-30 per cent less yield as rains, during the crucial picking time, can harm the produce. Maharashtra reports around 40 lakh hectares of cotton area, which is likely to see a slight dip due to delayed rains.The prices of pulses, which had earlier been on the higher side, have corrected themselves in the last few weeks. Several steps, such as the Centres approval for an additional quota for import, directions to NAFED to offload its stock and a veiled attack on black-marketers and hoarders have led to a correction in prices, both in wholesale and retail prices. Tur daal, which was retailing in Laturs wholesale markets for Rs 85-86 per kg, has since then settled at Rs 81-83 per kg. Similarly, the retail price of daal in Pune, which had crossed Rs 120 per kg, has since then dropped to Rs 95-100 per kg.Rising pricesOf immediate concern for urban consumers, however, is the higher prices of vegetables and milk. In Punes retail markets, the price of tomatoes (Rs 50-60 per kg), onion (Rs 20-25 per kg) and beans (Rs 120 per kg) have caused much concern for retail consumers. The price rise ia a result of the falling production of summer vegetables, due to the water scarcity. The present trend may continue as the delayed monsoon will take a toll on the arrival of the new crop. As of now, the new crop of vegetables is expected to arrive by the end of July and prices are expected to fall only after that. Similarly, it will take some time before the price of milk, which have seen a Rs 2 per litre increase, corrects itself."

Thanks to over 15 lakh tubewells in Punjab and availability of canal water mainly in Malwa region.AdvertisingPunjab Agriculture Department had targeted to sow 36 lakh hectares area under Kharif crops which included sowing of rice on 29 lakh hectares, including six lakh hectares Basmati rice and 23 lakh hectares paddy, four lakh hectares under cotton, 1.60 lakh hectare under maize, one lakh hectare under sugarcane, and around 40,000 under pulses, ground nut and sesamum.The data sourced from the Punjab Agriculture Department, till June 24, Punjab had completed Kharif sowing on 18.68 lakh hectares, which is nearly 52 per cent of the total sowing, against the 11.50 lakh hectares on the same date last year which was around 32 per cent of the total kharif crop sowing. Mainly Paddy, pulses (moong, mash and arhar), maize, sugarcane, cotton, groundnut and sesamum crops are sown during kharif season.Till June 24, the transplantation of paddy was completed on 12.87 lakh hectares, which is a way higher the 6.87 lakh hectares sown during this period in 2018. It also implies that Punjab has already completed paddy sowing on 56 per cent of the targeted area.AdvertisingWe have completed paddy sowing at least four lakh hectares more between June 25 to June 29 and now only 25 per cent sowing of paddy is left, said a senior Agriculture Department officer.The cultivation time of Basmati would start from the second week of the July month.Among other kharif crops sugarcane too had shown upward trend as 95,002 hectares had been sowing against 95,000 last year, pulses too had recorded over 5000 hectares sowing against 4000 hectares last year.Cotton too has recorded sowing on over four lakh hectares against 2.67 lakh hectares last year. Only maize has show little downward sowing with trend at 67,000 hectares against 84,000 hectare last year.As far as paddy sowing goes, Sangrur district topped with 1.91 lakh hectares sowing till June 24. Patiala is at the second place with 1.39 lakh hectares, while Ferozepur is third with 90,000 hectares.Only Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Mohali and Ropar districts have been doing slow transplanting and covered the area close to its last years corresponding figures which is good for state.Rest all districts have achieved double the area putting huge pressure on the ground water as paddy sowing needs stagnate water up to two to three inches for over six weeks continuously.According to the Indian Meteorological Department, Chandigarh office, Punjab has received 50 per cent less rain during June. Only Fathegarh Sahib for 46 per cent surplus rain in June, while Ludhiana and Bathinda got Normal rain. All other districts are facing deficit rain.Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) officials said that due to heavy sowing of paddy in June month the toll on ground water is too big.No doubt that canal water is available in the Malwa region, but most of the farmers in Punjab prefer tubewell water because power supply to run over 14 lakh electrical tubewells is free to them, said another PAU officials, adding that they had already suggested to extend the date of paddy sowing till June 25 but government instead had advanced it by one week this year which is not a wise decision. Running of 15 lakh tubewells on a single day would extract 4.80 lakh million liter in a day.Agriculture Director, Punjab, Dr Sutantra Airy said that though there are several short paddy varieties available now in the state which can be sown in the month of July, but still farmers prefer varieties that require early sowing."

There has been just two per cent MSP increase (from Rs 5150 per quintal last year to Rs 5255 per quintal this year) in medium cotton, which is grown in Punjab.AdvertisingWe are concerned about the depleting ground water of Punjab and want to diversify paddy area to other crops like cotton, which takes less water than paddy, but it seems that government has no concern about the water problem of Punjab. To decrease area under paddy it is important to enhance the MSP of other crops to a compatible level, said Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda, general secretary Jagmohan Singh, adding that in past one year due to hike in diesel, fertiliser, insecticide prices, Rs 100/quintal hike in cotton would not meet the input cost.We were expecting that after seeing the poor plight of the farmers in its first term, Modi government will do something better this time but it has again cheated farmers, said BKU Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan. He said that along with cotton, just one per cent MSP increase for moong dal was increased was a joke.Paddy growers said that with just Rs 65 increase per quintal from Rs 1750 to Rs 1815 per quintal, is just 3.6 per cent increase in MSP. While input cost has gone up 10 to 15 per cent.The per quintal input cost of paddy has gone up more than Rs 65 in past one year and how can this hike be justified, said Harjeet Singh, a paddy grower of Kapur village in Jalandhar."

But the delayed monsoon is expected to leave its mark in the overall sowing, which by June-end was 82 per cent less compared to the same period last year.AdvertisingSowing has lagged behind for most of June in the state because of the late arrival of the monsoon. Especially hit have been Marathwada, Nashik and Vidarbha with the first two already reeling under a severe drought.

Farmers in western Maharashtra also undertake the sowing of sugarcane crop in June and July.AdvertisingOilseeds and pulses have reported the largest dip with the state reporting 92 per cent and 93 per cent dip in both the crops respectively. Tur, urad, moong and other pulses have reported more than 90 per cent dip. Similar is the case with oilseed soyabean (93 per cent dip) and sunflower (94 per cent dip). Barring moong and urad, farmers are expected to increase their acreage of all other crops as their sowing period extends till June 15.Cotton sowing has been reported over 4.56 lakh hectares, which last year was 16.57 lakh hectares. While the sowing window of cotton theoretically can be extended till July 15, yield is reported to be affected by late sowing.

But have you ever sat down to think of what an ayurvedic diet could do for your body? Chef G Muthu Kumar, executive chef at Novotel-IBIS OMR came across Ayurvedic principles of cooking by chance. It was mere curiosity at first but in no time he deep-dived into the fascinating and rich world of Ayurvedic diets and cooking. He took it upon himself to not only practice but also educate others on these simple yet beneficial methods of eating and cooking, that he believes can go a long way to not only understanding the spices in your masala dabba better but also to recognise their significance in your diet.Eight years back, when I was going through recipes to create new dishes, I stumbled upon the fact that Indian cuisine is based on Ayurvedic principles, he says. I was curious about how something as ancient as Ayurveda is affecting our food habits and cuisine even today. When I began reading, there was not much reference available, so I started delving deep.Last year, I was asked to do a health talk, but went as a judge instead because I felt that to deliver a talk like that you need to have some fundamentals in place. At this point, I checked for some Ayurvedic courses and enrolled in the Kerala Ayurveda Academy for a two-week Ayurvedic diet and cookery course to understand the context and significance of each ingredient. It was a truly transformative course.Know your prakritiThe course had a profound impact on his understanding of food. It taught me to be more appreciative of the seasons. I understood why it is important to use seasonal food and also developed an understanding of different prakriti (body types/composition) and what food is suitable to which prakriti, he says. Ayurvedic understanding is based on the inner workings and balancing of the doshas, it is about understanding your bodys software, and how your eating habits can help have a good life.He explains that prakriti is the determination of dominant biological energies such as vata, pitta and kapha that govern mind-body process that underlies individual health. These three pillars are derived from the five elements  vata is a combination of space and air; pitta of fire and water, and kapha of earth and water. According to chef Muthu, the road to wellness begins with the process of aligning internal energies with the external environment. Even within the family, he says, each member could have a different prakriti and it is important to analyse it.Sharing knowledgeIn the last six months, he has shared his knowledge with over 150 enthusiasts including hotel guests as well as neighbourhood corporate employees of UST Global, Cap Gemini, where he has passionately nudged people to realise the magnitude of benefits in small dietary changes based on choices of food along with changing seasons. Our ancestors were very smart and knowledgeable. They ingrained certain aspects of our culture and roots that we blindly follow today as customs, but there is much more to it than that. Why is it that we eat particular foods during different festivals?There is a reason for everything. We are unaware of the science behind the custom. Ugadi pachadi is a good example. It is made with many ingredients and has six different tastes  sweet, salty, bitter, tangy, spicy and sour  that are meant to depict the highs and lows of life. But more than that, it is one dish that gives you everything that you need, he says. The biggest problem today is that people are unaware of this ancient yet relevant science of eating.He says that even most chefs do not realise why every ingredient in the spice rack has its own purpose. I see a huge gap in the understanding of ingredients and ayurvedic principles of cooking among modern chefs, he says. No culinary school is teaching students why we are using certain ingredients in our cuisine. It is imperative for chefs to have this knowledge and even people at large to understand their prakriti and eat accordingly.Chef Muthu will host a sit-down four-course dinner on July 26 at the Novotel, OMR where participants will interact with the chef and deduce their body type through prakriti analysis.

Over the years, Samiyathals interest in herbs and their immense healing potential has taken her to many parts of the State, scores of people seeking and providing medical care, and a great many adventures. And she plans on being of service to the society, the herbal way, for the rest of her life.Samiyathal is also the proud recipient of the Mooligai Thai (Mother of Herbs) award in 2012; it was the late President A P J Abdul Kalam who had given it away in recognition of her work in the field. She is known for collecting many rare herbs like mudakathan, nochi, aad thinnapalai, kallumulliyan, serupadi, eswaramuli, thavasimurungai, gopuramthangi, moongriratti, virali, thazhuthalai, veliparuthi and neela aavarai. She distributes these to Siddha practitioners at fairs, meetings, veterinary camps, etc. She has also helped cure a few disease with the help of herbal medicines.While her formal education may have ended at the primary school level, she has been honoured by many colleges (including the Puducherry government college), institutions, and Siddha doctors, for her interest and work in herbs collection. All her work would have been lost to the world if not for the untimely death of her husband Shanmugam.Of death and new beginningsThe woman, who was born in Ganapathypalayam, moved to Saminathapuram after marrying Shanmugam. Though she had been interested in learning about herbs, it took a back seat when her husband asked to stay home and help him with farm work.Thus went her life through the years of marriage till 2004, when her husband died. Her children Sivanandam (47) and Srinivasan (45), in an effort to help move forward with their grief, gifted her a book on herbs. And there has been no turning back since. Samiyathal dived deep into this fascinating world of high-power flora and travelled to places like Ezhumathur, Arachalur hills, Yercaud, Kolli Hills, Sangagiri and Edappadi to collect them. Soon enough, she started supplying these herbs to Siddha doctors in Erode district. The success led her to extend the service to doctors in Chennai, Chengalpattu, Theni, Madurai, Tiruchy and beyond.When word got around, doctors from across the State began asking for her to supply specific herbs. Since 2010, this work has kept her busy .What started as a hobby, quickly grew into a passion that also helped pay the bills. While she does not put a price on the produce she supplies, doctors paid her what they could for the raw material. A few practitioners covered her train fare. This work brings in around Rs 5,000 a month and helps her remain self-sufficient, living alone in the house she had shared with her husband in Saminathapuram.Just another work dayAs easy as it may sound, this work is not without pitfalls. Initially, she met with some resistance when she tried collecting herbs in forest areas. When she was allowed to do so, she had the wild side to contend with. Encounters with snakes are among the chief occupational hazards. She has been bitten by snakes at least thrice.Another unexpected hurdle she has to negotiate through is the number of people who seek her medical expertise. Though the herbs she supplies and eventually used as medicine and she is well aware of the properties of her collection, she refrains from treating people directly.Rarest of the rareSamiyathal specialises in rare herbs. Karisalanganni, seruppuadai, ezhuthanipudu, eswara mooligai, aaduthandapalai, vellai erukku, arasngizhangu, thanneervittan kizhangu, etc., are some of the rare ones doctors demand."

Nandurbar district tops the chart with 88.75% sowing followed by Jalgaon (88.23%), Dhule (73.10%) and Nashik (70.84%).According to an official from the agriculture department, the remaining sowing operations are expected to be completed within a week. ""In Nashik district, paddy plantation is yet to speed up. The gap of 10-15% is because of this. Now, paddy plants are ready for plantation and it will soon pick up pace now,"" the official said.""Although Nandurbar district tops the list in kharif sowing, belts like Sakri and Pimpalner still lags behind to some extent due to inadequate rainfall,"" he added.The agriculture department has projected kharif sowing area of 21.72 lakh hectare for the current season. Of this, sowing has so far been completed on 17.40 lakh hectare.Maize, cotton, bajra, moong, urad, soybean, jawar and bajra are the major kharif crops grown in the region.Of the total projected cotton acreage of 8.50 lakh hectare for cotton, 100% sowing has been completed - 5.10 lakh hectare in Jalgaon, 1 lakh hectare in Nandurbar, 1.93 lakh hectare in Dhule and 45,000 hectare in Nashik district.""Last kharif season was bad for us due to inadequate rain , but this year has been comparatively better due to good rainfall. Cotton is the major crop in our area and the sowing target has been completed,"" Bapu Badgujar, a cotton farmer from Dhule district, said.The average area of maize plantation in the region is estimated at 3.44 lakh hectare. Of this, sowing has been carried out on 3.15 lakh hectare, around 92%. In Nashik district, of the projected area of 1.43 lakh hectare for maize, sowing has been completed on 1.54 lakh hectare. Jalgaon and Dhule are also the major belts were maize is cultivated.Sowing of bajra in the region has been around 55%. Of the total average area of 2.86 lakh hectare, bajra has been sown on 1.5 lakh hectare so far and it's expected to gain momentum following recent bout of good rainfall.About Soybean, another major crop of the region, 88% sowing has been completed in the region.""Last year was terrible for us as all the kharif crop in the village had dried due to lack of rain. The condition is totally different this year. The rain got delayed this year by three weeks. We had good rain in the last week of June and farmers had completed sowing operations thereafter. Now, sowing activity is 100% completed,"" Bharosa Ahire, a farmer from Nimbayati village in Malegaon taluka, said."

But one project promises to stand out  mock meats. At the event on September 21, the project will be served with a side of eggs, sausages and salami  albeit all plant based.AdvertisingOver the past six months, researchers at the top institute have been experimenting with various material to develop a plant-based substitute for eggs. Having come up with a substitute they are satisfied with, they will now move on to chicken sausages and salami. Once they achieve that target, they will start looking at replicating the taste and texture of more complex meats such as fish, mutton and beef.The idea is to offer high-protein vegetarian and vegan options to those who either are vegetarian or have turned so because of ethical and health reasons.Across the world, mock meats have been gaining popularity as a niche product aimed at a very specific buyer. Most mock meats, however, use soy proteins as their base. At IIT-Delhi, the main source is the humble moong bean.AdvertisingWe started off with eggs because they have more acceptability in the general population. A lot of people, who do not eat meat, would eat eggs. Launching the brand with such a product made sense, said Dr Kavya Dashora, assistant professor at the Centre for Rural Development and Technology, who is heading the research.Her team includes Poonam Desai, food advisor, along with whom Dashora and several students have spent hours perfecting the recipe. We tried out chickpea flour (besan) and refined flour (maida), but finally settled on moong beans as it has the best protein content and was able to match the texture of an egg the best, said Desai, as she prepared yet another batch of scrambled eggs in a makeshift kitchen in a laboratory in the institute.The project is being funded by Rahul Dewan, founder of Four Pursuits Ventures, which funds innovation.So far, close to 100 people have tasted the end product over a period of 3-4 months and they are happy. The product that has been developed is more nutritious than an egg. We will eventually move into other spaces as well, Dewan told The Sunday Express.According to Dashora, the protein content of an egg is around 4% while that of a mock egg is around 8%. The team has sent products to independent bodies to set a benchmark nutritional figure of the product. We are waiting for the test results. The product is industry-ready and the process of deciding packaging and branding is ongoing. The plain scrambled egg version should be ready to hit the market soon, she said."
2019-08-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/monsoon-revival-spurs-kharif-sowing-recovery-5886942/,Monsoon revival spurs kharif sowing recovery,"Good rains in July and this month so far, following a very dry June, have led to a recovery in kharif sowing.AdvertisingThe Agriculture Ministrys latest data, as on August 2, shows the total area planted under all crops in the current kharif season at 788.52 lakh hectares (lh), which is 6.6% below the cumulative coverage of 844.20 lh last year at this time. Hardly a month ago, on July 5, the gap between the present years and last years progressive sowing was 26.7%.The closing of the gap has clearly to do with the monsoons catch-up. In June, the country as a whole received an area-weighted rainfall of just 112.1 mm, almost a third below the normal long period average (LPA) of 166.9 mm for this month. But in July  the southwest monsoon season extends from June to September  the rains were 4.6% above normal. The current month, too, has registered a 28.2% surplus up till now (see table). The cumulative rainfall deficit has also narrowed from 32.8% in June to 9.2% till July and a mere 4.6% as of August 7.As a result, there has been a significant pickup in sowings.AdvertisingFarmers have actually planted more area this time relative to last year under cotton (115.15 lh versus 109.79 lh) and maize (69.27 lh versus 69.03 lh). Expectations of remunerative realisations  kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) and maize are now trading at Rs 5,900-6,000 and Rs 2,200-2,300 per quintal, respectively in most wholesale mandis, way above their minimum support price levels of Rs 5,550 (for long-staple varieties/hybrids) and Rs 1,760  have, no doubt, played a part here. But the monsoons revival has been equally important; acreages under both crops were lagging only till a month ago.In other crops as well, there has been a significant reduction in acreage gaps over the last one month. The progressive area sown under paddy has been 223.53 lh (down from last years 255.48 lh at this time), while at 105.14 lh (113.74 lh) for pulses, 149.41 lh (157.39 lh) for oilseeds and 136.17 lh (145.16 lh) for coarse cereals. The individual crops to have recorded major declines include moong (green gram; down from 29.34 lh to 25.81 lh) and bajra (pearl millet; from 55.08 lh to 49.16 lh), which have their main sowing window in June. In all others, there could be a further narrowing of area deficits in the coming days.The India Meteorological Department has forecast rainfall during August to be 99% of LPA, which is based on expectations of neutral to borderline El Nino alongside continuation of positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions during the remaining part of the monsoon. El Nino (the abnormal warming of the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean waters, leading to concentrated cloud-formation activity around South America) is considered bad for the Indian monsoon, while a positive IOD (wherein the western Indian Ocean sees higher-than-average sea surface temperatures, with a corresponding cooling of waters in the eastern part off Indonesia and Australia) is good.A weakening of El Nino to neutral, in combination with positive IOD, is what has brought down a 32.8% monsoon deficit in June to below 5% at the close of the first week of August. This is a remarkable turnaround. There has been only one year (2012), where the monsoon ended up being normal despite a massive June deficit, notes Jatin Singh, managing director of Skymet Weather Services Pvt. Ltd.The private forecaster, however, anticipates a fresh dry spell after about August 13 and which may last for two weeks. According to Singh, no active weather systems are likely during this period, except for a trough that will shift closer to the foothills and remain confined there. That could have implications for the already-planted kharif crop."
2019-08-20,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-sowing-picks-up-as-rain-batters-state-5919098/,Pune: Sowing picks up as rain batters state,"Sowing has accelerated across Maharashtra due to good rainfall activity, and farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada have reported an increase in cotton sowing. Maharashtras total sowing area as of August 9 has crossed 131.06 lakh hectares, which was almost the same last year in August.AdvertisingThis increase in sowing activity follows a lag in June and July. Barring the divisions of Aurangabad, Nagpur and Amravati, other parts of the state have reported good rain, with Konkan, Nashik and Pune reporting more than 100 per cent of normal rain. Last year, rainfall across the state substantially was normal.Farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada have reported 43.49 lakh hectares of cotton sowing as against 39.94 lakh hectares last year. Maharashtra normally reports 41.91 lakh hectares of cotton acreage. Traders point to the higher returns from the crop as a reason why farmers are preferring cotton.Similarly, sowing of oilseeds have picked up with Maharashtra reporting 40.72 lakh hectares under oilseeds, which last year on the same date was 40.78 lakh hectares. Soyabean, the most widely grown oilseed in Maharashtra, has been sown over 38.51 lakh hectares, which last year was 38.63 lakh hectares. Wholesale prices of the oilseed were above the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) throughout last season, which can be a reason for the good sowing.AdvertisingHowever, pulses seem to have fallen off the radar of farmers, as Maharashtra reported 18.68 lakh hectares of sowing as compared to 20.13 lakh hectares last year. Of pulses, tur sowing is at least 11.84 lakh hectares as compared to 11.92 lakh hectares last year. For the last two years, pulses acreage has been on the slide as farmers have shifted to better paying crops like oilseeds and cotton. This year, the dry June and July months saw a dip in moong and urad, which are shorter duration crops.Maize and bajra acreage have also increased due to the better prices the commodities are fetching in wholesale markets. As against the 7.77 lakh hectares of maize last year, Maharashtra has reported 8.23 lakh hectares of maize acreage this year. Crop conditions have been good with farmers expecting a good yield in the coming days."
2019-08-22,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/as-maharashtra-records-excess-rain-some-villages-await-first-heavy-shower-5928782/,"As Maharashtra records excess rain, some villages await first heavy shower","Amid the ongoing monsoon in Maharashtra, a clutch of villages is still awaiting its first heavy spell of rainfall. Having recorded less than 150 mm of rain since June, the mood in these 50-70 villages scattered around Beed districts Georai and Kaij talukas is dark, clouded by the fear that they may be moving from one drought to the next.AdvertisingTheir wells and borewells are offering only muddy water, they are still queueing up with plastic drums for the water tankers daily rounds, some of their animals are still at government-aided cattle camps, and the possibility of a severely stunted crop swells with every passing day.The water tankers never stopped coming, weve needed them since the winter months of January-February, says Krishna Khedkar, a farmer and resident of Chaklamba. Located barely 40 km from Marathwadas biggest dam, Jayakwadi, which is now overflowing, the Chaklamba circle comprising about 15 villages recorded 146.6 mm of rain until August 21, as per state government data. Meanwhile, the statewide average rainfall has already crossed 930 mm  24 per cent higher than the norm for this time of the year.Satish Patil, who owns 16 acres of land and did not sow in the 2018 rabi season owing to acute water scarcity, says this years rains arrived in Chaklamba only to cruelly draw farmers to sow.AdvertisingThere was one small spell of rain and the saplings grew a bit, and after that, theyre only managing to remain green from the occasional drizzle, he says.Khedkar has invested Rs 60,000 in his 7-acre plot this season, and if there isnt a heavy shower within the next week, he expects to incur deep losses on top of last years losses.Hirabai Shitole, a woman in her sixties who lost her eldest son last year to a sudden heart attack, has spent Rs 2.5 lakh since the failed 2018 monsoon on tanker-supplied water to keep her 450 sweet lime trees alive. Things were never so bad even in the 1972 drought. We have a well and four borewells dug to the depth of 200-300 feet. Theyre all dry, she says.The Shitoles own 12 acres and their moong and urad crop are almost entirely lost, while the cotton crop is in danger of being severely stunted. My dead sons three children are in school and college and we have no income, says Hirabai.As per government data, Beed district has received an average of 212.5 mm rain since June, about 54.8 per cent of its average for this time of the year. Scores of villages have received less than 200 mm, with the talukas of Ashti, Georai, Kaij, Ambajogai and Wadavani all recording average rain of less than 200 mm. In Kaij, where the overall taluka average is currently 174.6 mm, the Kaij, Hanumant Pimpri, Hol and Bansarola circles of villages have recorded between 138 mm and 142 mm until August 22. In Georai, where the overall taluka average is 192.5 mm, the Chaklamba circle received 146.6 mm (35.4 pc of the average for this time of the year), Sirasdevi circle received 138.8 mm (33.5 pc of the average) and Talwada circle has 143.6 mm (34.6 pc of the average).According to Talwadas sarpanch Radhakrishna Shingane, the release of water from Jayakwadi through its right bank canal, which is barely a couple of kilometres outside the village, has led to some groundwater percolation and healthy crops across some stretches. But that canal water is not meant for us, were not allowed to pump it to our fields, he says.The water is headed to Majalgaon dam in the district, which is still at dead storage. Shingane says some residents of nearby villages chose not to sow their fields at all, preferring to look for work as labourers.In Chaklamba, villagers say the complete neglect of decentralised irrigation solutions is to blame. A 130-acre water tank, built by erecting an embankment wall to dam the water gushing down northward from the surrounding hill-slopes near the Sindphana river, is now derelict, its walls having collapsed a year after it was built in 2001. I lost 1.5 acres that would be submerged due to the construction and I received just Rs 16,000, says Shahdev Ashruba. And now I have neither land nor irrigation.Chaklambas villagers have repeatedly undertaken relay hunger strikes to press for a sub-canal from Jayakwadi to their villages, where the average rainfall in the 2018 monsoon was just about 300 mm. With their largest local water structure collapsed for nearly two decades, and groundwater severely depleted, a few healthy showers will suffice for an average crop this season. But the areas water crisis looks set to deepen in the long run. In the state Groundwater Survey and Development Agencys summer survey, more than half the villages where it found depletion by over 3 metres from the five-year average are in Marathwada (1,467 villages).At the cattle camp in Chaklamba, water is still purchased from 20 km away while fodder is imported from outside the region. The number of animals has reduced to 307  villagers are depending on state aid for fodder and water are the worst off.AdvertisingKishanlal Lahoti, a senior citizen whose family lost land when the irrigation tank was built (in 2001), says a court order to authorities to consider the villagers grievance is being ignored. He says, Its a pattern now that until something terrible happens, the local government doesnt act. How many more suicides must occur in our village for the state to reconstruct a simple structure?"

Come September and India explodes with colour, light, fireworks, and food. The two big festivals just round the corner are Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam, to be followed by the gaiety of Dussehra and the explosion of Diwali.Both Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam are festivals that tug at the emotional bonds of people, Maharashtrian and Malayalam people in this case. Weary form a years work, Malayalis from all over the world rush back to their native towns and villages for the festival of Onam. Maharashtrians do the same, going from cities like Mumbai and Pune back to their villages and hometowns. This is a time to bond with family and friends and celebrate culture and heritage as our people have, for centuries.Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival close to my heart, and Ive often written about how it was celebrated in our homes, and the special foods that were so typical of the festival. But I havent delved much into a classic Onam celebration. Onam is primarily a harvest festival, celebrated all over Kerala to commemorate the golden rule of king Mahabali, a fabled asura ruler. Jealous of his acclaim, the legend goes, the Gods conspired to end his reign. They sent Lord Vishnu to earth in his Vaman (dwarf Brahmin) avatar, and he trampled Mahabali into the netherworld, but granted his last wish  to visit his land and people once a year.That day is celebrated as Onam. With Onam come banana leaves, colourful Kathakali masks, the aroma of incense and the beats of the Panchavadyam and Chenda drums. Onam is the emotional string that binds all Malayalis together.And nothing brings together all Malayalis like the Sadya does. Sadya is the Malayalam word for feast and it is Keralas most popular and revered Vegetarian Thali. Sadya is not only served during Onam, a Sadya can also be the traditional meal served during a wedding or on Vishu (another festival celebrated in Kerala and in parts of coastal Tamil Nadu).I am an ardent worshipper of food from Kerala, especially of Mapla and Syrian Christian delicacies, but the Sadya has a special place in my heart. Its the one vegetarian meal that I adore. Maybe its the coconut that features in the Avial and Payasam or the crisp south Indian papadams or all the lovey fritters that go with a traditional Sadya.Normally the Sadya served on Onam is cooked without onions or garlic. A full-fledged Sadya should have at least 23 items. The meal is usually had sitting on the floor; cutlery is definitely avoided. A Sadya must comprise of Avial (curd curry), Thoran (dry vegetables), pickles, lemon, salt, boiled rice and Payasam (a sweet dish).It starts with Kaya Varuthathu (crisp banana chips fried in coconut oil), Sarkara Varatti (jaggery-coated banana chips), at least two kinds of pickle, raw mango or lime. Along with that is served a Pachadi (a sour curd curry made with cucumber and ash gourd cooked in coconut, mustard seeds and curry leaves). Then comes the classic Avial, the nectar of Kerala  soft and creamy vegetables cooked with coconut, curd, coconut oil and curry leaves. The omnipresent Sambar and a pepper-spiked Rasam. Then there is Parippu (a thick moong dal curry cooked with grated coconut and seasoned with spices and drizzled with ghee).Thoran can be made from any vegetables that are fresh and available  carrots, cabbage, beans, tomatoes or leafy veggies. The curry is flavoured with coconut and green chillies.You can take the Sadya to whatever level of fanciness you wish. You can add dishes like Erissery (a coconut curry of pumpkin and black-eyed peas), Kaalan (a sour dish made with bananas or yam cooked in yogurt, and coconut) and Olan (spiced black peas in coconut milk).As with most meals, you end with a sweet dish. Here, Palada Pradhaman (a sweet dish made with rice, milk and dry fruit) or Pazham Pradhaman (rice with coconut pieces and jaggery) is typically the last dish served.If you truly want to understand what an Onam Sadya means to a Malayali, there is a saying that describes it best. They say in Malayalam: Kanam vittum Onam unnanam, which means We should have the Onam Sadya even if we have to sell all our land.First Published: Aug 30, 2019 19:23 IST"

Gaayathri the title of Master Chef of Tamil Nadu in the second season of The Hindu Our State Our Taste Cookery competition here on Sunday.The secret vegetable that I got in the finals was chakravalli kizhangu and I used it in the kadhamba rice and in the pepper roast. I had to think of dishes on the spot. I have a lot of interest in cooking and I like to cook for my husband and daughters, said Ms. Gaayathri.The first runner-up was Gayatri Devi Gunaseelan and the second runner-up was G. Selvarani from Nagapattinam.Presenting the titles to the winner and runners-up of the competition that was conducted in 15 locations in the State, Minister for Tamil Official Language, Tamil Culture and Archaeology K.

Now we can realise that we were being cheated since years. Beneficiaries were not only subjected to short supply of ration, quality was also compromised more often,"" said Niyati.The committees having five members each as per the prescribed guidelines now not only demand rations as per their entitlements from the supplier, but also raise their voice if they find any discrepancies. ""We are now empowered. Nobody can cheat us,"" said Rubi.In another Anganwadi centre at Harijan Sahi, nearly one km from Berhampur, neither the beneficiaries nor the members of the two committees have any clue about their entitlements and the guidelines. Moreover, the centre doesn't have its own building and runs in the nearby Rajiv Bhawan building.""Forget about the entitlements, I came to know that I am member of MC two months back when the Anganwadi worker invited me for a meeting. While children in the centre are served half egg each, beneficiaries of THR have never received more than one packet of chhatua and eight eggs per month,"" said Sujata Behera, mother of a three-year-old.Two Anganwadi centres located in close proximity present a picture of contrast. A recent social audit conducted in six districts in KBK region revealed that only 39 per cent (pc) beneficiaries have got their entitled THR and there is a substantial 60 pc increase in number of beneficiaries getting entitled THR from the previous year.What is shocking is that even 44 years after the launch of ICDS, the largest nutrition scheme of the country, for early childhood care and to meet health and nutritional needs of pregnant women and lactating women, many beneficiaries are not yet aware of their entitlements.This is the State of affairs when as per National Family Health Survey - 4, 35.3 pc of the children under 5 years of age are stunted and 35.8 pc of children are underweight in rural Odisha.While primary responsibility of JC is to ensure that all feeding programmes maintain prescribed standards of quality and quantity, the MC is supposed to ensure proper management of ICDS services in Anganwadi centres.More than 2000 members of MCs and JCs have been trained under the APPA campaign in Angul district so far, but it is not enough as the model should be replicated in all 30 districts. Convenor Bidyut Mohanty said things are changing after the members of the committees were sensitised on their roles and responsibilities.""The State Government should take initiative to make the committees active after thorough sensitisation to address the nutritional deficiency among children and nursing mothers. Mobilisation of resources on training and monitoring is the need of the hour,"" he suggested.Know your entitlementsICDS beneficiaries are supposed to get six services including supplementary nutrition, non-formal pre-school education, immunisation, health check up and nutrition and health educationPre-school children are entitled for raggi/besan/atta/ground nut-jaggery ladoo or sprouted moong as morning snacksCooked rice with egg and vegetable curry for five days a week and rice and dalma on Monday in lunch with lemon a must for all six daysPregnant and lactating women and children are entitled for 12 eggs a month besides 4.9 kg and 2.45 kg of chhatua respectively under THRAnganwadi centres are supposed to display the names of members and menu"
2019-09-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/mahafpc-to-commence-price-support-scheme-operations-from-september-15-5987599/,MahaFPC to commence Price Support Scheme operations from September 15,"MahaFPC, the umbrella body of Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs), will start its operations to procure urad and moong under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) programme from September 15. Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MahaFPC, said the organisation plans to start its operations in 18 districts in the state.AdvertisingUnder the PSS programme, the state governments agencies start procuring commodities under government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) once the wholesale price slides in the mandis. Farmers have to register at procurement centres to sell their produce, and their payment is credited directly to their bank accounts. MahaFPC has been accorded State Level Agency (SLA) status, which allows them to participate in this programme.Thorat said in the first phase, MahaFPC will procure moong and urad and, post discussions, it will take a decision on the procurement of soyabean. We will be procuring 9,000 tonne of moong and 10,700 tonne of urad, he said. Ninety-four FPCs from Vidharbha and Marathwada will be participating in procurement in the first phase. FPCs will procure at farm gate levels, which will save farmers transportation charges, he added. Registration will start from September 15 and the actual procurement will start in the next fortnight.FPCs have grading and cleaning facilities and will give preference to their members for procurement of commodities under Fair Average Quality. Thorat said the total cost of the operation is slated to be around Rs 250 crore. FPCs hope to rope in 50,000 new members in the new procurement season. We will be commencing operations for the first time in districts like Dhule, Satara, Sangli and Pune, he said.Other than FPCs, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and Vidharbha Cooperative Marketing Federation will also participate in the operation. Last year, the state had a target of around 70,000 tonne for both commodities. At present, moong and urad are trading below their MSP of Rs 7,050 and Rs 5,600 respectively. Large stock with government agencies and subdued demand has ruled out any chances of price rise in the wholesale markets."

But Namma Provision supermarket in Upanagara, Kengeri, is taking the lead and hopes to be that face of change in the city.The store is packing items such as moong dal, green gram, sugar, ground nuts, ragi and toor dal in disposable paper bags. We are all aware of the ill-effects of plastic and the environmental degradation it causes. Introduction of brown paper covers is a way to protest against the use of plastics. We are trying our best to promote green initiatives, even though its a small beginning, says GP Deshpande, operations manager, Namma Provisions.The store began replacing plastic bags a month ago and has been sourcing the paper covers from Yeshwanthpur, which are given to customers at no extra cost. But shifting from plastic bags was not easy for the shop, which, in 2018 tried to put in place cotton bags that cost Rs 10 each.But nobody bought them. Now, a 5-kg brown paper cover costs around Rs 5. A 1-kg cover costs Rs 1 to Rs 1.5 per piece. It is four times costlier than plastic bags. In this area, there are around 150 grocery shops. How many can afford the loss because of this rule? questions Anil Chalageri, the shop owner."

Officials said the move was also cost effective for the airline that was grappling with a debt of over 58,300 crore.As per GM [General Manager] Catering, initially the changed menu will be introduced only on ex-Delhi/Mumbai flights with effect from September 15, 2019, midnight on all domestic and international flights, said an order issued by Air India.The same is applicable to all flying crew i.e. cockpit and cabin crew. A copy of the menu is attached herewith for reference, stated the order dated September 11.Low-fat diet meals like nutri peas bhurji, dal arhar, pudina raita, dry chapattis, murg dhaniya, fresh green salad, chaunk ki subz, dal kabila, boondi raita and palak corn tikki will be be prepared for the crew on the flights.Some of the other dishes that the flight crew would be getting during operations are: vermicilli upma, beetroot ki tikki, saute spinach, bhanu kebab, tinda masala, dal malka masoor, cucumber raita, murg methi, dal hara moong and khus (Veg.) kebab.In view of the above, special low fat diet meal for crew has been worked out on day wise basis in order to provide light and healthy meal with a home [Indian] touch, the order explained.An Air India spokesperson said, We are introducing healthy special meals for all crew. The new menu is also cost effective.In 2018-19, Air India incurred losses of around 7,600 crore. By the end of 2018-19, it had a debt burden of around 58,300 crore."
2019-09-16,https://www.news18.com/news/india/what-fares-well-welfare-in-cash-or-work-2311355.html,What Fares Well: Welfare in Cash or Work?,"New Delhi: Pushpa Devi joins her hands and bends forward completely on the mat in her villages community hall, her forehead touching the floor. This is how we used to bow down to touch their feet, she says, demonstrating how till a few years ago people from the scheduled castes (SCs), scheduled tribes (STs) and other backward classes (OBCs) used to greet the Thakurs and the Brahmins in Khaira Siyanagar village of Madhya Pradeshs Rewari district.With no water to irrigate their own fields, small farmers who are mostly from the marginalised castes in the village, could barely grow one round of crop. While the men would leave for Surat, Mumbai and Delhi in search of work for eight to nine months a year, the women would labour on the farms of the landed, mostly upper caste families, for 12 hours a day starting six in the morning.They would be handed two kilograms of jowar or bajra for the days labour. It was for this financial dependence on the upper caste houses that the SC, ST and OBC households would not question the formers dominance.If an upper caste woman was fetching water from the village well, the other women were not allowed to step on the parapet till they left, explains another local resident, Anarkali, sitting next to Pushpa.The surrounding areas were no better. Tilon village used to have at least 10 silicosis cases each year, says Chandra Mani, yet poverty would drive men to silica mines in Allahabad, 80 kilometres away.In the neighbouring district, Umaria, the summer months were a curse. The wells, ponds, handpumps and canals would dry and the fields be left barren. Men would leave the villages in search of work and women would be left behind to fetch water and care for the children and the elderly.The union governments Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which guarantees 100 days of work to each household to counter this kind of economic and resource distress, had rusted and was almost dead in these villages.In Madhya Pradesh, the schemes performance was one of the worst. Out of more than 31 lakh households that demanded work in 2014-15, only 1.5 lakh received 100 days of work. More than 8,000 works were incomplete in the state in that year. Total payment due for the works for the same period was Rs 9.3 crore.Poverty and childrenA direct impact of unstable income in homes and limited resources in villages could be seen on childrens health. Malnutrition was high in these villages and, to address it, Bhopal-based non-profit Vikas Samvad Samiti (VSS) along with Germany-based child rights group Terre Des Hommes (TDH) tied up with NGOs working with marginalised communities in four districts  Rewa, Umaria, Panna and Satna.The project, called Dastak, ran in 100 villages between 2015 and 2018 with the aim to strengthen existing welfare schemes by making the villagers self-sufficient in food security. One of the ways was by tackling grievances from the bottom up.To address malnourishment directly, the project introduced creches in eight villages which provided nutritious meals to children and seeds for kitchen gardens at home so that the families could grow their own vegetables. But as work began, the NGOs realised that the basic needs of food, water and timely income of families were unmet.We needed to address the immediate priorities of families. Pending wages in MGNREGA was a big problem. People had stopped asking for work because they hadnt been paid for more than two years. Our first step was to ensure the pending wages are paid, says Sachin Jain, secretary at VSS.In the villages where the NGOs worked, residents had no information of MGNREGA allocations and how the panchayat was using it. They alleged that barely 10 days of work in a year was reaching each household, registration of muster rolls was haphazard and the wages were always cut.If the work was for 14 days, we used to only get seven days money, says Santalesh Devi from Rewa.Gram sabha meetings were only on paper and participation of women in any village decisions was absent. If they ever attended, they would sit at the back with their faces covered with their sarees. In village after village it was the same story.We lost faith in MGNREGA and stopped demanding work. Even if work was offered by the sarpanch, no one would opt for it, adds Santalesh.Bottom to topThe NGOs started organising the women and the youth into vigilance committees to oversee the functioning of government schemes. Within a year, women who would earlier not speak in their own homes, became the loudest voices in the gram sabhas, says Ramnaresh Yadav, secretary, Rewanchal Dalit Adivasi Seva Sansthan, a non-profit in Rewa associated with the Dastak project.In Kohka-47 village of Umaria, 143 workers had not been paid wages for three years amounting to Rs 3.36 lakh. Women from 25 villages organised a rally and, with the district collectors intervention, the money was released within three months. In 2017-18, a total of 1,823 families received MGNREGA work for 80 to 120 days each in 25 villages. Money worth Rs 2.14 crore was received within a month.In Rewas 26 villages, between 2015 and 2018, more than 700 written applications were sent to offices demanding wage recovery. In the same period, 904 families received work under MGNREGA for 48,160 man-days worth more than Rs 83 lakh. In three years, 1,421 job cards were made.We now give written applications to the panchayat, the block and the district collectorate or dial 181 Chief Minister helpline. If nothing works, we can even sit on a dharna in Bhopal and Delhi, says Rajni Baiga from Kohka-47 village.In a 2010 study in four states by the Institute for Human Development, researchers found how when women started earning under MGNREGA, they had a say in decision-making and their confidence levels increased.In the villages of MP, a similar trend was noticed. Women became active participants in the village development plans, for which villagers were never consulted earlier. They started demanding the assets most needed in their villages.In Rewa, 22 village development plans were prepared by the people and discussed in gram panchayats. MGNREGA works were a big part of it. People asked for medh bandhan (building farm bunds) work on fields, pond, drain and well cleaning and deepening, cement roads and levelling of playgrounds and community sitting spaces. More than 35 works were conducted in three years besides plantation of 10,000 trees of amla, mango, sheesham, sagwan, neem, karonji, moonga and guava. Work came for 100 days a year and money was transferred to the bank accounts of the workers.Similarly, in 2017-18 Umaria created cement roads, repaired ponds, built new ponds and wells besides medhs and crematories. Majority of funds under MGNREGA were converged with the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and money for constructing homes were transferred to peoples bank accounts.Keep or discard?While the villages in MP were reviving a programme which had gone dysfunctional, policy debates at the Centre were taking a new direction.In 2015, a year after forming the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in the Lok Sabha that his political instincts tell him to continue MGNREGA because it is a living example of the UPAs monumental failure.Mocking the Opposition and the scheme, he said, After 60 years of independence you had to send people to dig ditches. He, however, added that since he wants to work for the betterment of the country, he will add whatever is needed to make this scheme better for the poor.In the years that followed, the scheme did see higher budgetary allocations. From Rs 34,699 crore in 2015-16, to Rs 60,000 core in 2019-20.Yet, low wages, delay in payments, corruption, quality of assets and no demand for work remain setbacks of the scheme. Social audits which are a means to bring transparency in the scheme are not taking off in many states, say experts.In MP, for instance, the wage rate under the scheme in 2015-16 was Rs 159 per day per person. In 2019-20, it was only increased to Rs 176. In 2018-19, payments worth about Rs 144.3 crore were due under the scheme. Only 76,771 families received 100 days of work in that year. On an average only 47 days of employment is provided to a household in a year.Adding to this debate, the Economic Survey in 2016-17 mentioned the idea of universal basic income (UBI). It said, In India in particular, the case for UBI has been enhanced because of the weakness of existing welfare schemes which are riddled with misallocation, leakages and exclusion of the poor.A guaranteed basic income, it argued, can provide a form of insurance and since an individual, and not a household, will be a unit of beneficiary, UBI can enhance agency, especially of women within households.Cash worksEven before the Economic Survey brought UBI into the discussion, a trade union for women, Self Employed Womens Association (SEWA), in partnership with UNICEF, had conducted pilot projects in MPs Indore district to see how basic unconditional income every month is utilised by households in tribal and non-tribal villages.Every adult and child received Rs 200 and Rs 100 each, respectively, for a year in eight villages in 2011. The amounts were raised to Rs 300 and Rs 150 for seven more months. Twelve other similar villages received no basic income. Two tribal village were also selected where one received money and the other did not. The amounts were Rs 300 and Rs 150 for one year.Six years after the trial run ended, Malibadodia village is bustling with goats. The families saved money and a few of the households bought the animals, which have now multiplied. Many more homes invested in the asset and have sold them when needed for over Rs 5,000 apiece.Fifty-five-year-old Savitri Bai saved the money she and her husband received for six months and bought a gas stove. Others fixed their falling house roofs, bought bicycles for their children or admitted them in private schools.In its reports, SEWA noted, The basic income had a strong positive welfare impact, in terms of living conditions, nutrition, health and schooling, and a strong economic impact, in terms of increased earnings, more work and productive labour and more assets.When the pilot project started in the village, Leela Bai Kevat, 59, was bedridden with a paralytic attack. Instead of buying an asset, her family pooled in the income on Kevats treatment and medicines, which was their immediate need. Had the money not come, we would have to take loans, Kevat says.The studies also note that though families did receive a cushion with the income for their immediate needs, some of them had dropped back to their previous condition, mainly as a result of health shocks.Just like Radha Bai, 45, who first bought food with the income as her family with eight children used to go through days when they would sleep hungry. While the money gave temporary relief, the death of her husband and mother-in-law within a month pushed the family back into grave poverty.After each death, she explains, following customs, she had to hold feasts for the entire village. She took a loan for a lakh in 2014 from a local moneylender and each month she is only able to pay the interest amount. The debt on her now is Rs 1.5 lakh. With her uncertain daily wage work, she says, it is impossible to arrange two meals for the family, let alone repay the loan.A few lanes away, 30-year-old Suman Yadav bought a sewing machine and took classes to learn stitching, hoping that she would use the skill and the asset to earn an income. But she now feels that the money was wasted. There is no work. No one comes to the village to get clothes stitched, she says.While the SEWA reports noticed individual gains of the money, it failed to note the power dynamics within Malibadodia. The women allege that all the households in the village gave their first income as donation for the Hanuman temple that was being built. Chander Singh Yadav, an unofficial caretaker of the shrine, asked for it, they say.Sitting on the ledge of the Hanuman temple, Yadav said he never forced anyone to give the money. Each family was only supposed to give Rs 200. Many families did not donate, he says, hesitatingly.Yadav has no account of how much total donation he received, or how much was spent on painting or decorating the temple. In the village, no one asked him to give accounts.The individual assets collected in the village are visible. But the women complain that the village development has come to a standstill. There are no gram sabha meetings, no proposals are prepared and, despite demands, no building or road repair works are ever taken by the sarpanch.The roof of the villages crematory has broken. When it rains, it is hard to keep the funeral pyre burning. Tyres were used recently to keep the pyre aflame at a womans last rites, Shanti Bai lashes out.She adds that when the government-assigned auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) visits the village for immunisation, she doesnt even have a room. Several requests to repair the old abandoned anganwadi building has fallen on deaf ears.About two kilometres away, sarpanch Suresh Bagwan from Badi Kalmer panchayat, under which Malibadodia village falls, is inspecting the construction of a watershed tank. This work, he says, falls under MGNREGA but he has hired a contractor who has brought his own labour. He has made seven such structures in two villages, all through local contractors.MGNREGA doesnt work here, says Bagwan. He adds, the wages under MGNREGA are low and no one works for that much money. He admits that he never proposed this work in the village meetings. No one in Malibadodia village knows this work is ongoing.No clear solutionsWill replacing welfare schemes with a nominal income pull people out of poverty? Can cash in bank accounts enhance resources or bring social empowerment in a village economy? Those working at the grassroots say there are no clear answers.This premise that poverty is only because people dont have money itself is flawed, says Jain. He adds that while debating how to end poverty, resource poverty must also be factored in.Besides, cash handed to households will only be put back into the markets as people will buy clothes, mobile phones, motorcycles. This will boost the market. Demand will be generated and it will lead to more production. Demand in the market will also generate employment, explains Jain.But this may also prompt market distortions. Wheat and rice prices will go up. And if all households start investing in same assets, the value of that commodity will drop, causing a glut in the market. Who will regulate all this? asks Pushpendra Singh, district coordinator, Dastak project, Rewa.Shikha Joshi, general secretary, SEWA MP, agrees that UBI should start as an experiment first by the government. And while the welfare schemes such as subsidised grains and MGNREGA should not be stopped, an additional personal income must be added.People in pilot villages are still taking benefits of the assets created back then. If other programmes could alleviate poverty then there would have been no discussions around UBI. But I dont mean every scheme should shut. There are many schemes which are dead. People have never benefitted from them. These should be shut, says Joshi.The debate around UBI is only going to grow more nuanced. But back in the Dastak villages, percentage of malnourished children declined from 55 per cent to 25 per cent by the end of 2018. Khaira Siyanagar village now has no malnourished child. By 2017, the villages had produced vegetables worth Rs 61 lakh in their kitchen gardens.The project has stopped now, but women in Rewa continue to enjoy their new status. We go to the markets, buy our own clothes and are no longer beaten with sticks, says Phool Kumari.If they toil on others fields, their work starts only at 9am and ends at 4pm, with a lunch break in between, and nothing less than 10 kilograms of grain.(The author is a 2019 Promise of Commons Media fellow)Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

But we bet that nothing made Prime Minister Narendra Modi happier than the sight of his favourite dishes arranged neatly in shiny copper thali, and served to him lovingly by his mother.He is super busy handling the reins of the nation but, on his birthday, PM Modi always finds the time to meet his mother and seek her blessings. His 69th birthday on Tuesday was no different. After an action-packed day including a visit to Sardar Sarovar dam, the PM  clad in white kurta-pajama and a saffron Nehru jacket  visited his mother Hiraba and had a simple but sumptuous lunch with her at Vrundavan 2 in Raysan village in Gandhinagar, where she resides with his younger brother Pankaj Modi.The PM is known for his austerity. Its well-known that he is strictly vegetarian and loves simple Gujarati food. So, the thaali had sliced cucumber-tomato-carrot salad, kachcha-paka tindora nu salad (stir-fried ivysalad), alu-mattar sabji (potato-peas), fangavela mag (sprouted moong) and mixed kathol (pulses), tuvar daal, rice and Gujarati rotli. It also had puran polis (flat bread stuffed with a sweet lentil filling)  another favourite of the PM.The PM was to meet his mother early on Tuesday before the Sardar Sarovar event but there w a s a change in the schedule and he decided to have lunch with her. The food was cooked by Unnati, daughter-in-law of Pankaj Modi, who along with his wife Sarita were out of State when the PM came visiting. After sharing some light moments with his mother, the PM left 35 minutes later.An old-timer who has worked closely with the PM when he was Gujarat CM said sukhdi was his alltime favourite sweet. Every time, a close friend or relative met Narendrabhai, he would carry the simple Gujarati sweet made with wheat flour, jaggery and ghee. Narendrabhai also loved Gujarati farsan such as bhajiyas, handvo, dhokla, fafda and gathiya and used to have them during state- or national-level meetings with BJP leaders, he said.Though the PM enjoyed the lavish fare at meetings, his daily diet was restricted. His breakfast comprised green tea and rotis made out of bajri. He did not have ghee in his daily diet. He would have rotis made of some grain during lunch with vegetables, lots of leafy vegetables and salads. Wheat was a big no. Dinner comprised of khichdi or porridge, very light food, he added.After PM Modis White House visit in 2014 its a well-known fact that he also observes a fast during. And during this time he consumes only lemonade and a cup of tea during the day.I love Gujarati thali. Since it is difficult to make at home, we go out to have it at least once or twice a month. If I have to chose one thing from the thaali, it will be Gujarati daal. I love it. We have it at home several times as we have a Gujarati cookGUJARAT CHIEF SECRETARYI relish Gujarati food as there is a wide range of texture in the dishes. The Gujarati daal is my favourite as it has a complex yet subtle flavour because of the multi-layer taste. I also like bhakri. We try to make Gujarati daal quite regularly in our kitchen if possible as it is thinner yet full of richness.ABAD POLICE COMMISSIONERGujarati thaali has a lot of variety and offers a wide spread of dishes. I have been on a diet for long, and I also travel a lot. Thought all kinds of Gujarati dishes are prepared in my kitchen, bajri no rotlo,and ringan bhartha find prominence.RIL GROUP PRESIDENT (CORPORATE AFFAIRS)I am a big fan of the Gujarati dinner thaali, especially bajra no rotolo, adad daal and ringna nu shaak. Since I found out that bajri is good for diabetes, I have incorporated bajra no rotlo and daal in my daily meal schedule. Besides being yummy, it is highly nutritious too.MP AND DELHI BJP CHIEFGujarati thaali is a well-balanced meal. Phulka gives carbs, daal gives protein and vegetables give fibre. Ghee on roti or as tadka on daal is good fat. None of the items have heavy cream, hence its light on stomach and low in calories. I love dhokla. I have thepla daily but nothing beats fada ni khichdiNUTRITIONIST AND AUTHORThe Gujarati thaali has a perfect blend of flavours, I just love the assortment. Looking at one gives me a sense of wholesomeness because you can tell that all the food has been prepared with so much love. I love all the dishes, but I would pick the Gujarati daal over everything. In fact, chundoo (a sweet mango pickle) is a regular delicacy in our household.ACTOR"

At least 200 project prototypes created by faculty members and researchers were put on show.AdvertisingWith moong dal as its main ingredient, the vegan mock egg was developed by a team led by Dr Kavya Dashora of the Centre for Rural Development and Technology from IIT-Delhi. It is made up of five lentils and the price is the same as that of a brown egg: Rs 20-25 per dozen, and 250 ml of this would equal at least five eggs, said a team-member.A nano composites-infused fabric for inflatable balloons, which can be used for aerial surveillance and security purposes, has been developed by Dr Mangala Joshi from the Department of Textile Technology as a part of a DRDO-sponsored Joint Advanced Technology Centre initiative. India imports this fabric. It is more resilient to UV radiation, has more holding capacity and doesnt allow leakage of helium or hydrogen gas. So they asked us to develop it indigenously. This has been a five-year-long project, said Joshi. Other projects by the IIT-Delhi faculty included a personal body armour and bioresorbable vascular stents or dental implant systems, among others. A new corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding policy decision was announced by Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul, to boost research funding at IITs.The new policy is meant to help India become an innovation-led economy, said Professor V Ramgopal Rao, Director, IIT Delhi. We are not only looking for collaborations with the industry but we also want the industry to treat them as a part of their innovation ecosystem, said Rao, adding that the policy will boost research funding in institutions like IIT-D and promote collaborations between academia and industry."
2019-09-21,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/sep/21/still-hitting-high-notes-2036653.html,Still hitting high notes,"Shevlin Sebastian ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: The evening bhajans were coming to an end at the Vasudevapuram Sree Krishna Swamy temple at Perunna. A group of boys were standing and singing loudly. Suddenly, it started raining. Lets go home, one boy shouted. And the group ran out of the temple at high speed. At the back, there was a six-year-old. As he tried to catch up, he slipped and fell on the muddy road and fainted.But in his minds eye, he saw Lord Krishna. He was in black and had a tulsi garland, apart from a gold necklace. With a soothing smile on his face, he helped the boy to stand up and led him towards a bend in the road. Then he vanished.When Ganesh Sundaram regained consciousness, he was lying on the lap of his grandmother. He quickly told her about his vision. She patted him soothingly on the head.Ganesh, the senior Mollywood playback singer, was recounting this incident at his newly-opened music academy called Jani at Tripunithura. The Krishna I saw was the same as the idol in the temple, he says. I may have produced this image out of my subconscious mind.At Perunna, living with his grandmother, now and then he would stand at the door and see whether his mother was coming. A teacher, she stayed at Tripunithura with Ganeshs younger brother. Ganesh had been sent to Perunna when he was three years old because his mother could not handle two children at the same time. Their father worked in the Indian Army and lived mostly in North India.Although I pined for my mother, I was surrounded by music, he says. My grandmother had a very sweet voice, and my uncles and aunts sang, too. They would make me go to sleep by singing lullabies. I believed I discovered my destiny there.Later, when Ganesh returned to Tripunithura, he began formal coaching lessons in Carnatic vocals, which lasted for several years, through different teachers.Ganesh began playing for orchestras and brought out an album. But his major break happened, in 1994, when the owner of Amma Cassettes, Babu Koyiputath, a distant relative, asked him to sing for a devotional album. He did so. Thereafter, about 50 albums came out.However, it was only in 1999, that he had his first hit through the album, Guruthipooja. The songs are in praise of Bhagawathy Devi of the Chottanikkara temple, says Ganesh. It has simple lyrics and catchy tunes, and the public liked it a lot. They feel a sense of peace when they listen to those songs. The album is still selling.Thus far, he has sung over 5000 devotional, love and patriotic songs in Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Hindi and Bengali languages.Along with that, he has had a thriving playback career in Malayalam films. Some of the films he has sung for include Violin, Venicile Vyapari, Kudumbasree Travels, Loudspeaker, Minnaminnikoottam, Kayamkulam Kanaran, Sree Rama Rajyam, Mayakkazhcha, Parankimala, Daivathinte Swantham Cleetus, Vikramadithyan, Vellimoonga, Love 24/7, and Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum. He has also sung in Jibu Jacobs upcoming film Adyarathri, in which Biju Menon plays the lead.But he says that singers are rarely recognised. When radio jockeys play our songs they only name the composer and the actors, says Ganesh.As a result, he had some bitter-sweet experiences. Once he had gone for an event in Muscat. Before his performance, Ganesh was sitting in the front row with a Mollywood director. They started chatting. I told him I am a singer, says Ganesh. He said he liked a few songs and named a few. I replied that I had sung those. He looked shocked and said, I thought Bijibal had sung them. (Bijibal was the composer).Then the opposite happened. One day, a man called up Ganesh and said his son was a big fan of his and wanted to talk to him. Ganesh agreed and the boy said, Sir, I loved your Idukki song in Maheshinte Prathikaaram. Ironically, it was sung by Bijibal.Often, when Ganesh is sitting in a restaurant, the mobile phone will ring at a neighbouring table. And the ringtone would be one of my songs, says Ganesh. But the man would not know that the singer is sitting at the next table.After 25 years in the trade, Ganesh admits the competition is getting stiffer. There are so many singers these days, he says. And young composers prefer singers of their generation.Asked how music trends have changed, Ganesh says, People dont like to hear big words or sombre thoughts, he says. The words should be simple and direct. There is a lot of electronic music. Of course, purists say the music lacks soul, but like in any era, there are good songs too like Hemanthamen from Kohinoor and Paripparakkum Kili in Aby.Meanwhile, to diversify, Ganesh had opened his academy on August 23 with the help of two partners, Balram Ettikkara and Ramakrishnan K G, who are music lovers. There are classes in Western vocals, guitar, violin, keyboard and piano, apart from Carnatic vocals, violin, mridangam, Hindustani vocals and tabla.There are a total of 11 teachers, he says. I am happy to say that young people are interested in music. So I hope to develop many new talents.Asked what Jani means, he says, A start or beginning."

Mothers fast for the entire day without even taking a drop of water.The festival is observed on Ashwina Krushnapakhya Astami (eighth day of dark fortnight of Odia month Ashwina). On the day, a group of mothers gather at an open space in their respective localities and perform the puja in the evening.During the festival, Lord Dutibahana is worshipped at the open space, which is decorated with mango leaves and flowers.Mothers worship Lord Dutibahana with 108 duba (strands of green grass) and 108 unbroken arua rice (non-boiled rice) wrapped in fresh sal leaf besides the juintia (thread), jugar (made of puffed paddy and jaggery) and tikhri (made of moong and sugar) as prasad.On the wee hours of next day, mothers take a holy dip in nearby river or tank and perform ritual before they break their fast."
2019-09-25,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/sep/25/try-coastal-flavours-in-delhis--2038844.html,Try Coastal flavours in Delhi,"Ornella Dsouza ByExpress News ServiceAbout two decades ago, my mother used to spend hours at the kitchen perfecting the Chicken Coconut Curry, when occasions called for a big fat Goan meal. As with Goan dishes of Portuguese origin, the dish was a test in patience and muscle-flexing.Shed get down on her haunches to rhythmically maneuver a halved coconut over the spiky metal head of the bulky wooden scraper for a fresh mound of desiccated white flakes speckled with brown. Then roast ingredients in order of their weight: cumin, clove, cinnamon, pepper, ginger and garlic, scraped coconut, onion, red chilies.And coarsely grind these into a wet masala using a pestle (the size of a mini club) over a 2-ft long mortar; the aroma hanging heavy around the house long after.I was kept away from these kitchen aids (imagine the coconut shell accidently slipping off and your hand meeting the scraper). But after many moons of such toiling, shes settled for ready-made grated coconut and masala pastes/powders.Its the story of many households, when consumed by minimalism (sleek, lightweight gadgets) and millennialism (apps over appams  its cooking process crosses 10 hours). The result: the recipes of yore now lack their original punch.Culinary expert in such grueling but delicious recipes is Bengalurus Karavalli restaurant at The Gateway Hotel, under the Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) banner.It specialises in south-west India (Kerala, Karnataka and Goa) cuisine, after its chefs learnt each of its 85 dishes firsthand at the kitchens of, as noted on its website, Mangalorean Bunts and Konkanis, Kodavas from Coorg, Malayalees, Calicut Muslims and Syrian Christians of Travancore, Havyaka Brahmins of Vitla and the Portuguese of Goa.This year, few Delhi restaurants under IHCL marked milestones (Thai Pavilion completed 25 years and House of Ming, 40), where in-house chefs switched places and hosted pop-ups. And now Varq, the premium Indian cuisine restaurant at Taj Mahal Hotel, is celebrating its 11th anniversary and is hosting a pop-up by 29-year-old Karavalli for a few days.Naren Thimmaiah, executive chef at Karavalli, says the pop-up will benefit Delhities, underexposed to the south Indian coastal cuisine. Hes also full of trivia. Like how the one traditional food item thrives under different names in different regions of India.Like the Coorgi staple souring agent kachampuli (Malabar tamarind) is balsamic vinegars doppelganger, look and taste-wise.Keralas rice-noodle dish of idiyappam is called shavige in Mangalore and nooputtu in Coorg, with slight variations to the steaming process, informs chef Thimmaiah.An example of this trivia was the first starter we sampled at the pop-up  Keralas Meen Eleittad (black pomfret fillet shallowed fried with Malabar masala and wrapped in banana leaf). When unopened, its identical to the Parsi Patra-ne-Macchi.But when done so, you find a red masala slapped onto the fillet, which lends it a medium-spicy flavour. Quite unlike the Parsi fish dish steamed in fresh, green coconut chutney. About the juicy Tiger Prawn Roast, it might seem the chef forgot to add the salt till you mix it in its own gravy of spices, vegetables and coconut slivers and then bite in.The Koli Barthad chicken is a good introduction to the tart Coorgi kachampuli. As a light palate cleanser, the Pachakkari Stew (vegetable chunks in coconut milk) works best.The desserts made an impression. The Bebinca was soft, warm, and nearly perfect, but could do with more caramelised layers.The soft, brownish-black banana-jaggery Dodol topped with banana ice-cream was a bite-sized wonder. But the highlight was the creamy Ada Pradhaman  thick mix of rice flakes, coconut milk and jaggery  quite identical to Goas Godshem, only without chana/moong dal the latters made of.Till: September 28At: Varq, Taj Mahal Hotel, One Mansingh Road"
2019-09-26,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-house-members-enjoy-lavish-spread-at-taxpayers-expense/,Chandigarh: MC House members enjoy lavish spread — at taxpayers’ expense,"From Chinese to Italian, South Indian to Punjabi, not to mention the endless varieties of dessert, the lavish spread on offer during proceedings of the General House in the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation could compete with the menu of any grand wedding party.AdvertisingWhile ministers and chief ministers go in for simple rajma rice or kadhi rice during proceedings of the Haryana and Punjab Assemblies, members of Chandigarh civic body gorge on an elaborate meal  all at the cost of public money  even as the civic body claims to be in a deep financial crisis.Each House meeting costs around Rs 1.75 lakh to Rs 2 lakh, which means around Rs 20 lakh annually. There is even a separate snack menu for the finance and contract committee meeting.Apart from south Indian delicacies like dahi wada and idli sambhar, two types of pastas with broccoli and bell peppers are cooked to order at the eating hall as per convenience of the members.AdvertisingThe Chinese menu includes Manchurian dishes, noodles and fried rice. There is also a live vegetable station which has all types of vegetables cooked as per choice. Shahi paneer, mushroom matar, malai kofta, chana masala, dal makhani, dahi bhalla, white chana and rice, missi roti, tandoori roti and tawa roti are also included in the spread.For dessert, members can choose from moong dal ka halwa, kulfi or icecream, rasmalai etc. during winters. There are a variety of salads as well.While seated in the House, stuffed samosas, rasgullas, tea and are served as snacks.In 2018, former Mayor and councillor Davesh Moudgil had completely cut down the menu, reducing it to a minimal dal, vegetable, rice, chappati and salad. The move had met with much grumbling from certain councillors of both BJP and the Congress. After Daveshs term, the lavish menu returned.Speaking to Chandigarh Newsline, Moudgil said, I was always against this lavish menu. When we all take simple food at home, the same should happen here in the corporation as well during meetings. It is tax payers money after all.Satish Kainth, Congress councillor told Newsline that this is a complete waste of funds. And the worst part is that you have to sit for around eight hours and it is not even good for health that you eat 50 dishes and keep sitting, he added.Add to this the honorarium to councillors to attend meetings. Every councillor  nominated or elected  is paid Rs 500 to attend the meetings, which include House meetings, finance and contract committee meetings and other sub-committee meetings. There are 26 elected councillors and 9 nominated ones. Each councillor is a member of around 5-6 sub-committee meetings. Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman of the Federations of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh said this provision of payment for every meeting should be scrapped.Other than this, the monthly honorarium of the Mayor is now Rs 30,000 now. The mayor gets Rs 15,000 constituency allowance.The senior deputy mayor gets a monthly honorarium of Rs 24,000 and Rs 15,000 as constituency allowance. The deputy mayor gets Rs 18,750 and Rs 15,000 as constituency allowance. The honorarium of the councillors is Rs 15,000 for each meeting."
2019-09-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/how-maharashtras-farmer-field-schools-are-teaching-prosperity-6039581/,How Maharashtra’s Farmer Field Schools are teaching prosperity,"Like other farmers in Karate, a village in the Baramati taluka of Pune, Vijay Salunkhe was mildly surprised when the agricultural assistant of his area talked about a Farmer Field School and asked him to attend it. Salunkhe, who grows mainly maize, and partly onion and bajra, in his 2.5 acres, is thankful that he agreed because these lessons in the school helped him to take preventive measures against the dreaded Fall Army Worm (FAW) for his maize crop. During the school which is held every Sunday, the agricultural assistant talked about the new pest and how to identify it. He also provided the package of practices to save ones crop, Salunkhe says. It was this knowledge that alerted Salunkhe to press the alarm bottom during the early growth stages of his crop after he realised that like other fields his too had fallen prey to the FAW. He quickly applied his learnings from the school to fight the pest and save his crop. Salunkhe admits that without this hands-on knowledge he would not have been able to either identify or save his crop.AdvertisingAt the start of the Kharif season, FAW had presented a serious challenge. First identified in India in 2018, this pest, which feeds on over 80 different kinds of crops, is responsible for the dip in the maize production last year. Worldwide FAW has caused havoc in countries with the pest being seen as a threat to food security in some African countries.Salunkhe is not alone. Vinayak Jadhav, who grows maize over 2.5 acres of his total 5 acres of land in the same village, too benefited. Maize is an important crop for Jadhav as it provides the fodder necessary for maintaining his herd of 15 animals and maintain his daily milk production of around 200 litres. Jadhav has managed to control the infestation on around 70 per cent of his crop with the help of measures like mass trapping of male FAW moths, erecting bird perches and application of other biological control measures.Explained What are Farmer Field Schools? These schools were developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization as an alternative to the top-down way of providing extension under the Green revolution. This has been in practice for a few decades in Southeast Asia. It involves giving focused guidance to small groups of farmers in their fields by way of learning-by-doing exercises.While FAW infestation has been reported on 2.67 lakh hectares of the total 8.60 lakh hectares of maize area, most farmers have reported success in controlling the infestation to a great degree. Agriculture Commissioner Suhas Diwase says the government decided to launch a multi-pronged approach to combat FAW. This included a massive farmers education programme. Along with posters, information kiosks etc., we also decided to start this unique concept of Farmer Field School (called Shetishala in Marathi) as means of reaching out to the farmers, he says. Held right at the farms, this school has officers and staff of the agriculture department get farmers together on a fixed day to discuss issues related to their crops and fields. Unlike bigger seminars or workshops, these schools are held much more regularly and with much smaller groups of farmers. For example, in Karate, every Sunday morning around 10 farmers religiously come to school.AdvertisingThe topics discussed vary depending on the local conditions. Thus, the schools in Baramati had mainly focused on ways to control pests for maize and sugarcane  the crops most commonly cultivated here. In districts of Marathwada, on the other hand, such schools are providing guidance for crops such as cotton, tur, and moong etc. And the success against FAW in Maize is replicated in other crops as well such as cotton which attracts the dreaded pink bollworm. Information dissemination to farmers through various channels including that of the Farmer Field School is to be credited for better pest control.While pest control might be a major thrust area of the schools at present, they also focus on better agricultural practices to help farmers improve their yields. For example, in Baramati, the schools guide farmers towards scientifically preserving the fodder to help them tide over periods of scarcity. Similarly in Kolhapur, farmers are guided on reducing the usage of chemical fertilizers for their cane crop and better management of the crop to increase yield."

Of the incentive provided by the Centre, the seed growers will get `2,000 per quintal while the balance `500 will go to OSSC.Under the scheme, the Government provided mini kits of pulses seed varieties not older than 10 years free of cost among seed growing farmers."
2019-10-02,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-story-of-the-mahatmas-experiments-with-food/articleshow/71401794.cms,The story of the Mahatma’s experiments with food,"4 Items Bapu Loved To EatIn late 1888 a hungry young Indian man could be found roaming the streets of London. Mohandas Gandhi was there to become a barrister, but his more urgent need was to find food to eat. He had promised his mother never to eat non-vegetarian food, but in his lodgings that meant a dreary diet of oatmeal porridge and bread.Gandhi was searching for the few vegetarian restaurants in the city and finally found the Central Vegetarian Restaurant quite close to Fleet Street. The sight of it filled me with the same joy that a child feels on getting a thing after its own heart, he wrote in My Experiments with Truth. He entered and had his first proper meal in the UK.Gandhi also bought a book at the restaurant: Henry Salts A Plea for Vegetarianism. Salt was a pioneer advocate for animal rights and his book made a deep impression on Gandhi. Vegetarianism in the UK then was not just about food, but brought together many alternate causes, like feminism, nature therapy, sexual liberation, theosophy, animal rights and, crucially for Gandhi, anti-colonialism.Gandhi went to the restaurants (there was another called The Porridge Bowl) to eat but started getting interested in the ideas he found there. He made a friend in Dr Josiah Oldfield, the editor of the journal of the London Vegetarian Society who encouraged the shy young Indian to meet people through vegetarianism  one was Sir Edwin Arnold, the translator of the Gita, which Gandhi had just started reading  and also to contribute his first published works, on Indian vegetarianism, to the journal.Another vegetarian contact in London was the Gujarati writer Narayan Hemchandra. He had arrived in the UK recently, but spoke no English and sought out Gandhi to help him communicate  and find food. But when Gandhi offered him Westernised food like carrot soup Hemchandra turned up his nose. He insisted he needed dal and once he somehow hunted out moong, cooked it and brought it to my place. I ate it with delight. Hemchandra was unapologetically Indian, even wearing a dhoti in the street, despite being jeered at, and his self-confidence in his own identity was to have a profound influence on Gandhi.Gandhis link with the Vegetarian Society continued in South Africa. He became their agent to promote vegetarianism there and, while converts were few, people were generally interested enough to hear the young Indian talk passionately the subject, and this helped Gandhi overcome his shyness. And it was at a vegetarian restaurant in Johannesburg that he met Henry Polak and Hermann Kallenbach who would both become vital early supporters of his work.Looking back on those years, while writing Satyagraha in South Africa in 1926, Gandhi wrote: I have been fond for about the last 35 years of making experiments in dietetics from the religious, economic and hygienic standpoints. This predilection for food reform still persists. South Africa was where Gandhi started living in a commune, and for the rest of his life would live in a revolving community of people, many of whose diets he supervised in an extended experiment on eating.It is startling how much food features in Gandhis collected works. He can be writing to the Viceroy or Congress politicians, and the next letters might be instructions to a follower on what to eat, requests to procure the fruit and leafy greens that formed a large part of his diet or suggestions on how to promote village foods, like oil crushed in traditional ghanis. Gandhi was keenly interested in British attempts to improve Indian agriculture and also corresponded with Dr Robert McCarrison, Director of Nutritional Research in India who was doing pioneering work on nutritional deficiencies in diets.Visitors often ended up talking about food, like Paramahansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi, who recommended avocados to Gandhi (and sent him seedlings from California, but they all died on the way). All this interest was strictly on food as fuel for a healthy body, and most visitors also noted how dire the food served in Gandhis ashrams tasted. One of the few to say this was his grand-daughter Ela who once told him in exasperation that Sevagram should be called Kadugram since all they seemed to eat was pumpkins. Gandhi laughed and gave instructions for different vegetables to be cooked.This fascination with food might make it seem odd that Gandhi is famous for his extended fasts. But these extended periods of food denial are extensions of his basic interest in feeding. Gandhi knew that food, like clothing, was one of the few essentials for humans and that gave anything to do with it power. Wilfully refusing to eat affirmed that power, and even just fasting for a fixed time was a kind of self-purification for him.It also meant that what one ate mattered, which was why Gandhi vowed not drink cows milk after he learned how they were ill-treated to produce it. But his body rebelled. Gandhi had few other source of protein  he was suspicious of pulses for forming gas  and needed dairy to survive. So, at Kasturbas suggestion, he agreed to drink goats milk since he reasoned he was not thinking of goats when he made the vow. But Gandhi always felt guilty about such a hair-splitting reasoning  and procuring lactating goats wherever he went would become a major headache for his assistants like Mirabehn.Today, Gandhi would be vegan. He inquired about the potential for plant-based milks and soy proteins, but these were not widely developed in India at that time. Several times in his life he tried raw food diets and tried other foods like caffeine-free tea made from roasted wheat or wheat-free bread made from banana flour that are popular diet options today. But Gandhi also had a larger perspective on diets that might be worth recalling for those who might as food focused as he was.Gandhi spelled this out in a speech he gave in 1931 when he was back in London for the Second Round Table Meeting. He was given a reception by Vegetarian Society, where his journey had begun, and he sat on stage next to Henry Salt, whose book had provided a catalyst. It was a moment to savour yet he used it to recommend his vegetarian friends remember the value of humility. In his experience, he said, I found also that health was by no means the monopoly of vegetarians and that nonvegetarians were able to show, generally speaking, good health.Gandhi recalled debates from his early days at the Vegetarian Society where people argued furiously, even divisively, for the benefit of one diet versus another. He felt this was a problem since one didnt necessarily become a better person because of what one ate. Believing someone was inferior for eating meat was wrong  and also a tactical mistake since it would made it harder to convince them to become vegetarian someday. Gandhi felt what was needed with food was both mindfulness and moderation, which is a message that is still relevant today.For Gandhi, food was about fulfilling a need, not satisfying a desire.

2019-10-13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/stall-owners-cash-in-on-pre-election-chai-pe-kharcha/articleshow/71562996.cms,Maharashtra elections: Stall owners cash in on pre-election chai pe kharcha,"Manohar Bhonsles stall near Dadars Shiv Sena Bhavan boasts VIP fansMUMBAI: A classic piece of Mumbai pantomime played out this Friday when MNS candidate Avinash Jadhav emerged from his bustling party office in Thane at a searing 2.30 pm. Even as he was talking on the phone, Jadhav crinkled his eyes in the direction of shopkeeper Rajesh Rahate and then compressed the air with his index finger and thumb. Sure enough, within seconds, a tiny conical white tea cup--brimming with sweet, buffalo-milk-based, ""non-acidic"" Pandharpur-style chai--landed in the MLA's free hand.""He (Jadhav) drops in at least five to six times a day,"" said a suddenly-reverential Rahate, whose month-old tea shop adjacent to the MNS office has not only been making close to Rs 7,000 instead of the standard daily average of Rs 6,000 the last few days but also has already won a VIP ambassador in Jadhav, who often recommends the Rs-10-per-glass homegrown beverage to others.As pairs of dull footwear multiply outside party offices in the run-up to the Vidhan Sabha elections chai is flowing as generously as charchas across the city. For chaiwallas and stall owners in the radius of outposts, this election fizz is making up for the festive lull between Navratri and Diwali.Among those celebrating is a tea stall owner inside Manohar Bhonsle's 37-year-old vada pao centre near Dadar's Shiv Sena Bhavan which famously binds estranged cousins and political rivals Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray in their gastronomical love of the working class snack. ""Every time there's a meeting, our business booms,"" said Lalji Patel, who runs the tea stall that dispatches around 70 cups of the Rs 10-worth hot milky beverage a day. ""Just yesterday,"" he added, ""I made 50 per cent more than what I make on a regular day.""While PM Narendra Modi's chaiwalla-to-prime-minister narrative has infused chai with political stardust of late, the beverage has long been the preferred fuel of the swarms of men in Modi jackets and all-whites looking to sustain themselves through endless meetings. Last year, in fact, an RTI reply alluded to this when it showed that the money spent on tea in CM Devedra Fadnavis' office had jumped by Rs 2 crore within a year, leading the Congress to allege a 'chai scam'.Many major party offices now boast their own coffee machines, pantries and contractual chai suppliers which means the neighbourhood chaiwalla is not being patronised as much by the pre-election all-white armies. ""Why would people prefer to have chai here when they get their tea inside for free?"" asked Mahesh, a no-nonsense chaiwalla opposite the NCP office in Ballard Pier.Then, there's the other problem peculiar to the Vidhan Sabha elections. ""Candidates are outside the city on rallies and the meetings are mostly done with. So, not many party workers come for chai or snacks,"" said a clerk at the Janta Dal political party office at Nariman Point which has offered the front portion of its premises to a 20-year-old tea and snacks stall. ""In fact, if you come on a Sunday, when our office is shut, this place is dead silent,"" the official added.The proximity to political hotspots pays in other ways though. When the BMC and the cops play villains, regularly fining chaiwallas or whisking away their equipment, party workers come to the rescue. ""The pheriwallas have to pay a hefty fine. Still they return to the spot, buy new equipment and go on. Where will they go? So we help them, "" says an official at a party office in Nariman Point, who recently made a case for a fruit seller hailing from Kolhapur at the Marine Drive police station.Typically, the men running the stalls outside party offices tend to be party workers. Some are even known to have the aura of secret keepers while others can brag about having entered the hearts of VIPs through the stomach. Sixty-two-year-old Manohar Bhonsle--whose vada pav stall in Dadar was born out of street food politics in 1982, a time when the Shiv Sena was trying to instil pride in the Marathi manoos through this home-grown burger--recalled that his seed capital had come from Raj Thackeray who had spotted his potato patties sizzling in a kadai perched precariously on a tiny table by the roadside. He called for me and handed me Rs 15,000 so that I could set up a proper shop, recalled Bhonsle, who attributes the popularity of his vadapaos to the ""magic"" in the hands of his wife who wakes up at 6 to pound the fiery, gavti-dhania-infused mix that lends the ""military batatas"" their fire.These days, while Uddhav Thackeray makes a customary pitstop at his kiosk for tea and bhajji on the way to a nearby temple, Raj Thackeray prefers to get his usual portion of vada pav packed for himself and his mother, and moong bhajji for his sister. Bhonsle's backdrop though is less a poster and more a billboard, that shows various stages of shaking hands and handing over flowers to Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. It was Manohar Bhonsle's VIP namesake and his biggest vada pao fan, Manohar Joshi, who introduced the stall owner to Bal Thackeray on his birthday at the Sena Bhavan many years ago. ""I was tongue-tied, recalled Bhonsle.If not for some unforeseen formatting that his laptop recently underwent, Neeraj Joshi, one of the many men in yellow running errands such as offering chai and sweets in the bustling BJP party office at Nariman Point, too would have shown you similar photos with everyone from Devendra Fadnavis to Yogi Adityanath. With those wiped out, all Joshi--who used to prepare chai for BJP politicians before he became an errand boy and who learnt the art from his grandfather--has now are memories. ""I even saw Amit Shah when he was the BJP president in 2014,"" said Joshi, who recalled fetching Shah a glass of milk with less sugar.Some chaiwallas, though, are estranged political neighbours. ""The leaders are fine but the men working under them never pay us. They have drowned my money many times,"" said Madan, a chaiwalla in Thane who has stopped serving the party office near him, does not have a local voting card and caters only to scrupulous office-goers instead. Dadar's Patel, on the other hand, senses that his political clients are not as close-fisted as they used to be. ""There's less dadagiri now,"" he said. ""Maybe because the PM is one of us."""

This, market sources said, will directly affect the realisation of the farmers.AdvertisingUnder the Price Support Scheme, NAFED procures pulses and oilseeds directly from the farmer at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) declared by the government. As of June, NAFED had a 41 lakh tonnes (lt) buffer stock of pulses, the highest-ever in the history of the cooperative body. This stock of pulses included chana (20 lt), urad (3.02 lt), moong (1.47 lt) toor (1.42 lt) and masoor (1.19 lt). This stock was to act as the buffer for the government to intervene in case of abnormal price rise.At present, NAFED has undertaken the sales of urad, moong, masoor and groundnut. Of these, urad and moong are kharif crops and their arrivals have started in the wholesale markets. Average traded value of urad at Laturs wholesale market is Rs 6,000 per quintal, higher than its MSP of Rs 5700 per quintal. But rates of moong (Rs 6,000 per quintal) and toor (Rs 5,300 per quintal) is lower than their MSP of Rs 7,050 and Rs 5,800 per quintal, respectively. While moong and toor have started arriving in the market, the arrival of toor  a longer duration crop  is yet to begin. While procurement by NAFED has been done at the MSP, it is selling at prices below MSP."

After his death in January 23, 2007, a memorial lecture was initiated in his name. Last year, the memorial lecture was delivered by Esther Duflo, Co-Founder and Director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty action Lab and wife of Abhijit Banerjee.Banerjee was awarded with the prestigious Nobel Prize this year. He along with Duflo and Michael Kremer won the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.Speaking Exclusively to News18.com, Yes, I will be coming to Kolkata in March to attend my fathers memorial lecture at Presidency University.When asked whether Esther will also accompany him, he said, Hopefully...she will.While sharing best thing he likes about Esther, Abhijit said, She is very optimistic. She is always willing to try new things. Excited about new ideas. She has many admirable qualities.Being an excellent chef, Abhijit shared that Esther just love fried moong dal with cauliflower made by him.She likes phoolkopi (Cauliflower) with bhaja (fried) moong dal, Abhijit said while adding that if he was asked to choose between Rosogolla and Ilish (Hilsa), he certainly misses Ilish in US.Abhjit's mother Nirmala Banerjee too believes that Abhijit is a good cook. He is a good cook. He makes everything and eats everything, she said.She said, When we got the news of Nobel, I spoke to Abhijit and he said nothing. Then I spoke to Esther and she said she is very happy. I asked about her mother who is a paediatrician and presently living in Guatemala for some work.On Esther, she said, She is happy and she is happy that I am happy. Its like a win win situation. Esther and I are fond of each other. She is an extremely straightforward person and she is an extremely a good mother as well.On Friday, BJP National Secretary and the partys former West Bengal unit president Rahul Sinha stoked a controversy as he mocked the credentials of Abhijit Banerjee, days after the Indian-American was presented with the prestigious award.Reacting to Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyals comment earlier in the day that people of the country have rejected Banerjee's ideas on NYAY, Sinha said that people whose second wives are foreigners are mostly getting the Nobel Prize.He also wondered whether having a foreigner as the second wife was a degree for getting the Nobel.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-10-21,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/planet-healers-baby-elephant-farm-in-shankarpally-follows-regenerative-farming-to-grow-chemical-free-produce-that-powers-hyderabads-first-farm-to-table-caf/article29757724.ece,The making of good food,"Kavitha and Ravi Mantha use the term food forest to describe the Baby Elephant Farm. Its an indication to not expect a manicured farm. At a given time, different patches of land have fruit, vegetable, pulse and grain-producing plants and trees in various stages of growth. A few segments are dedicated to growing fodder for the farms chickens and buffaloes, a few pockets are left vacant to give sufficient time for soil nourishment after a seasonal crop.The produce from Baby Elephant Farm in Shankarpally powers Kavitha and Ravis pet project, Sage Farm Caf, Hyderabads first farm-to-table caf.Heirloom varietiesKavitha and Ravi set up the farm in 2015, when they returned after living a few years in the US, UK and Singapore, and learnt that it helps to grow produce thats in sync with the local environment. The farm grows many leafy vegetables. Did you know that at one point, 104 varieties of greens were grown in Telangana? asks Vijay Kumar, an electronics engineer turned farmer, who looks after the operations. He wants to grow at least 30 leafy vegetables.A day at Baby Elephant Farm Check sageorganics.in to book field trips to the farm.Soon, weekend yoga sessions will be introduced for small groups. Cottages have been built using eco-friendly hollow clay blocks to keep the premises naturally cool.Sages new endeavour Thrive by Sage will open shortly on road no.2, Banjara Hills, with focus on health food. Think of rajma salad with almonds or palak paneer where the greens arent mashed too much.The penchant for native varieties holds good for grains and pulses as well. Kavita points out that it has increasingly become tough to source heirloom seeds, as the market is flooded with imported varieties.The farm grows approximately 50 vegetables, eight fruits and eight pulses and grains  papaya, banana, guava, lemon, chikoo, pomegranate, badam, toor dal, jowar, peanuts, chickpeas, green moong, black eyed peas, and more. The couple also manages a mango orchard in Gandipet.Walking through the farm, spotting butterflies, dragonflies, colonies of earthworms, ant hills and mycelial networks near the compost area, Kavitha comments that biodiversity is an indicator of a healthy ecosystem.Truly chemical free?If you believe in the adage you are what you eat, its also true that you are what you eat eats, says Ravi, quoting American author Michael Aaron Pollan. Ravis statement comes in the context of the need for chemical-free feed for chickens and buffaloes.One of the indigenous Ongole breed of buffaloes at the farmThe farm places emphasis on natural, chemical-free farming. Ravi and Kavitha state that nothing sold in the market can be trusted easily. They debunk the myth about eggs and meat labelled as chemical and antibiotic-free. They state that some of the ready-made feed for poultry comes laced with chemicals. Hence, they began growing fodder for their animals.What is regenerative farming?Baby Elephant Farm harnesses solar power, harvests rainwater and recycles grey water. Beyond that, it follows regenerative farming. By definition, its the process of creating the right micro and macro life systems to make both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and bio enzymes thrive in the soil. Enriching the soil and improving water systems help enhance the ecosystem. This is done by following diligent steps of composting, using green manure and minimal tilling of soil.Sage Farm Caf divides its waste into nine portions  like separating sea food, meat, vegetable waste, cooked food waste, etc. Though the caf doesnt harp on being zero waste, they strive towards that each day. In addition, they also get ground coffee waste from Roastery Coffee House (approximately eight kilograms per day) and a preliminary compost from hotel Hyatt, which is again worked upon.Vijay Kumar oversees the farm operations | Photo Credit: Sangeetha Devi DundooVijay oversees the meticulous process of composting; he learnt permaculture from Aranya Agricultural Alternatives, and also incorporates a few Korean and other sustainable farming principles. To give an idea of different methods employed, he says that a small quantity of cooked rice when left underground is acted upon by bacteria and fungi and that in turn helps the quality of compost. Waste Decomposer liquid sourced from National Centre of Organic Farming in Ghaziabad, is also used in some processes. Leftover fish, shrimp and even bananas are composted differently. All these generate a range of bio enzymes that enrich the soil. The farm also uses in-house bio-charcoal for soil health.Minimal tillingOne of the guidelines of regenerative farming is to minimise soil tilling, which can disturb the balance of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. How do they work around it? Kavitha shows a row of bamboo plants near which theyve sown nine varieties of seeds  fenugreek, mustard, flax, coriander and others. Until the bamboo grows, theres enough sunlight to nourish the greens. About 45 days later, the greens are cut and left on the spot; they become manure for the bamboo and nourish the soil.The cottage complex at the farm | Photo Credit: Sangeetha Devi DundooSolar dryingA solar dryer is used to process excess seasonal produce. One season they were left with excess chikoo, which was sliced, solar dried and used throughout the year as dry fruit, chips, for jams, kombucha, or made into chikoo flour and used for cakes. Sage Farm Caf has its share of innovative recipes. Why should the multinational pizza chains dictate what goes into a pizza? asks Ravi. Their whole-wheat and ragi thin crust pizzas are topped with mozzarella made from buffalo milk from the farm, an assortment of seasonal vegetables and topped off with sprigs of amaranthus (thotakura) instead of basil. Ridge gourd or Beerakaya chips become the base for innovative bruschetta.This column celebrates eco-conscious initiatives. If you know a Planet Healer, write in to hydmetroplus@thehindu.co.in"
2019-10-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bottoming-out-a-recovery-finally-far-produce-price-monsoon-6084732/,"Bottoming out: A recovery, finally?","Last week, the market research firm Nielsen released data that showed annual sales growth for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in rural India at 5% during July-September, down from 20% in the same quarter of 2018 and 10% in April-June 2019. Moreover, for the first time in seven years, rural FMCG growth, which typically used to be 1.5 times that of urban India, fell below the latters 8% for the latest reported quarter.AdvertisingBut amidst this overall dismal picture, some early signs of green shoots are visible.To start with, we have inflation numbers based on the consumer price index (CPI). For 36 months running, from September 2016 to August 2019, consumer food inflation trailed general CPI inflation. This extended period of low food price increases  an average of 1.38% year-on-year, unprecedented in India  has seemingly ended. For September 2019, CPI food inflation stood at 5.11%, as against 3.99% for overall consumer inflation.The improved price sentiment for farm produce is also borne out by the rates for kharif crops that are arriving in wholesale mandis of the country. In most cases, these, even while ruling below the minimum support prices declared by the Narendra Modi government for the 2019-20 season, are more than what they were at this time last year. The turnaround, as the accompanying table reveals, is most significant in pulses and soyabean. Only for cotton are prices lower relative to last year.AdvertisingHowever, it is not only the MSP crops. Onion in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market is trading at an average of Rs 3,500 per quintal, compared to Rs 1,550 a year ago. Farmers in the state are also receiving Rs 28-29 for a litre of cow milk containing 3.5% fat and 8.5% solids-not-fat, which is better than the corresponding last years levels of Rs 23-24. Prices of red chilli (the high-pungency Teja variety) in Gunturs Mirchi Yard are today around Rs 16,000 per quintal, up from Rs 9,000-10,000 one year back.One reason for prices looking up is heavy rains across central, western and southern India through September and the current month. The monsoons late withdrawal has caused damage to the kharif crop that was at maturity stage (especially soyabean in Madhya Pradesh) and also led to delayed harvesting of urad (black gram), moong (green gram), onion and assorted vegetables. In maize, yields have been impacted by infestation of the fall armyworm insect pest, apart from drought conditions in Maharashtra and Karnataka till late-July. Many farmers in Maharashtra are reported to have diverted their maize crop for fodder well before it had reached grain formation stage.Another reason for price recovery is supply pressures. These, in turn, are a result of sustained low prices in the recent past. In milk, for instance, not getting good prices over the last four years or more has led to farmers gradually reducing herd sizes or underfeeding their animals. The effects of that are being felt now, with dairies having to pay higher procurement prices. They are being forced to do so also because of the drought-induced fodder and feed shortages, which should ease in the coming months with the monsoons spectacular recovery after July.The above firming up of prices is, perhaps, the only heartening piece of news for the Indian economy buffeted by a consumption slowdown on top of a prolonged investment slump. Moreover, the country has recorded its best southwest monsoon since 1994. The excess rains have not only helped substantially recharge the groundwater table and aquifers, but also resulted in water levels in 120 major reservoirs being filled to 89.1% of their full capacities, as against the last 10-years average storage of 71.6% at this time. The positive effect of this will be seen in the upcoming rabi season.The best case scenario will be if the present price uptrend  actually, a recovery from lows  holds and, together with a bumper rabi crop, would deliver the much-needed boost to farm incomes after April. That will, to a great deal, depend on policymakers tolerance to price increases, even of an episodic nature.The Modi governments first term was marked by general hawkishness, reflected in the frequent resort to export restrictions, duty-free imports and imposition of stocking restrictions on farm produce at the slightest hint of inflationary pressures. In its present term, this approach has been witnessed so far only vis--vis onions, where both export ban and stock limits on the trade are in place.It remains to be seen whether the Modi government will be emboldened to look beyond temporary supply disruptions to take the next big reform step  of dismantling all controls on marketing, movement, stocking and export of agricultural produce. The timing cannot be better than now, when farm prices have bottomed out and production prospects for the rabi season seem particularly bright on the back of probably the best monsoon in quarter of a century. This is something that FMCG companies and two-wheeler makers, too, would certainly look forward to."

We may end up with some extra calories by the end of the festivals, which leads to high cholesterol, diabetes, weight gain and to a certain extent, cavities and dental caries as well. Preparing some traditional dishes is healthier than including commercially available sweets and savouries.When we talk about traditional foods, we can prepare some healthy sweets like moong dal payasam, besan ladoo, rajgiira laddoo, which comparatively have some amount of protein and are healthy as compared to maida sweets.Portion controlling is also important during this time because we never restrict to one laddoo or jalebi.Try and avoid deep fried products as much as possible because it will increase the amount of calories.Hydration is also important during this time but restricting to the liquids which gives us less calories is more important like plain water, buttermilk, lime water, tender coconut water.Finally, after the festival season is over, detoxing our body is also important.So what is detox diet?Detox diet is generally done for two to three days to cleanse the body or eliminate the toxins. Detox diet mainly consists of fruits, vegetables, water, fruit juices, tender coconut water, lime water, buttermilk which is light on body with no spices or masala which helps cleanse the kidney. But salt or rock salt can be included in the diet to have electrolyte balance and avoid cramps.In a detox diet, the kidney and liver are generally effective in filtering and eliminating most toxins. Including more fruits and vegetables that acts as high fibre in cleansing the colon is also helpful.What can be consumed in detox diet?Upon waking up in the morning  Warm water with honey and lemon / wheat grass juice/ ginger tea/green tea/chamomile tea/ carrot juice/datesBreakfast  Oats /light porridges/steamed foods/egg whites and fruitsAfternoon  Lots of steamed herbed vegetables like spinach, broccoli and some salads as well.Evening snacks  Fruit Juice /green tea with crackers/ sprouted methi seeds chaat or roll/ sprouts salad with pomegranate/egg whites (boiled/scrambled)/fruit chaatDinner  Vegetable soups/oats or broken wheat porridges The author is chiefdietician, Columbia Asia Referral Hospital Yeshwanthpur"

Topped with tutti frutti dices and basil seeds, the thick dairy shake was soothing enough in the hot weather. While we were enjoying this, the chef sent Dahi Bhalla to our table. An influence of North India and Pakistan, the bhalla is prepared with moong dal, urad dal to make the batter, and later mixed with curd, making it taste much like dahi vada, only a little more filling.The Tawa Aloo Chaat is a proper street food, only with a more refined touch. Popping these diced potatoes mixed with spices was fun. We put an end to the street food section with non vegetarian items like Fried Chicken with Tikhi Hari Chutney and Sigri Roasted Chicken tossed in butter. The fried chicken was more of a modern adaptation of the tangri kabab that is famous in Delhi, but it tasted good, nonetheless. The roasted chicken is a must-try as the butter makes it even more succulent to devour the whole piece. Soft and juicy, the dish had just the right amount of spice that hit our palate. Dahi wale gol gappes are available too, so if you are in the mood for some chatpata roadside snacks, look no further and dig in!The next item  Chole Bhature  gave us the feels of sitting at a roadside Punjabi dhaba. But the music was a letdown, as we expected some Qawwali, Sufi or old Bollywood songs as that would have gone hand-in-hand with the theme of the menu.We ordered for Chicken Korma and Paya Curry, which were flavourful, to say the least. The rich gravy of the chicken leg gave out an aroma of roasted cashews and cardamom, with the soft meat definitely making a mark. The paya curry tasted nice, but the meat could have been softer.Influenced by Persian, Turkish and Afghan food, the dishes have an old-world charm but the food also has a whiff of modernisation, so people from all over the globe can enjoy it.We came to the end of our meal with Rabdi Kulfi Falooda, which I enjoyed to my hearts content, and also recommend. There has also been a heavy use of tutti frutti and basil seeds, making it interesting for guests to savour them.The food festival is on till Oct 28. Cost for two: `1,500 (approx)"

Vaidehi started cooking at the age of 12. Even though she was raised without a mother, Vaidehi always wore a smile on her face, cooking healthy food for her father and siblings  one younger and two elder sisters.She wore the proverbial pants by becoming a home cook to make ends meet. My main motive for cooking all these years was to ensure everyone around me got food. I am taking this dream forward. I am putting a price to the food I give people, but I am not looking for huge profits. I try to give them more food, she says.From her girlhood days, Vaidehi has been praying to her family deity Opilli. Its no wonder then that she decided to name her catering venture  Opilli Catering. She started this business two years back. She wanted to start this venture when she and her family were in Ahmedabad four-five years back but it did not happen. The locals there expect us to speak Gujarati. I dont know the language. That is why I couldnt do it. My actual plan was to give Gujaratis a taste of Tamil food, says Vaidehi who operates from her home in Pallikarnai.While some of her clients are regulars and want day-to-day food, others like the neighbourhood temple, and the school her grand-daughters go to are some special clients as they ask her to put up a stall on some special occasion or order some special dishes to suit the occasion. For such special occasions she makes karumbu rice or something more special.There is a Kamakshi temple near my house. During festivals when I get orders, my daughter-in-law, a software professional, helps me out, she says. Vaidehi is a master in cooking traditional Tamil Brahmin food like parupu thogaial without garlic, soji appam, manoharam, sembu elai parupu usili, puli kootu without parupu and puli nandal.She enjoys making food that is usually made in Brahmin households in Thanjavur, as she is familiar with the place and its cuisine. Most of her clients are Tamil Brahmins who mostly want food without onion and garlic. Some of her favourite foods are tenga saadam, chepankazhangu fry to go with vatha kozhambu. She likes to use molagu jiragam and paitam parupu (moong dal) in her dishes. Sometimes, she says, she substitutes paitam parupu with toor dal in her sambhar at times to make it healthier. Mindful about the health of kids, Vaidehi loves feeding them dry fruit sundal.Dry fruits could be given to children not just from the health perspective but also to satisfy their sweet tooth, she says pointing to her younger granddaughter, who at the time of the interview, attempts to sneak out as many coconut burfis from the kitchen as her tiny hands can carry. While she is keen to prepare more complex savouries like kai murukku, Vaidehis hands are now weak. Ive used my hands too much as a stenographer.Now, they dont move as I want them to and they are no longer flexbile, shares the former stenographer at the State Tax Department. A single-parent, Vaidehi feels cooking gives her an identity, and that gives her the strength to face difficulties. She makes somewhere between Rs 400 and Rs 600 a day. She usually spends the mornings in the kitchen trying to finish all the orders. She then enters the kitchen in the evening for dinner orders. If there is a huge order, she starts planning for it a few days in advance. Vaidehi has had her share of failures in the kitchen. Recalling one such incident, she says, Once a newly married couple was supposed to come over for lunch. I was given just about half an hour to prepare a meal.On the gas were two pots  one for kozhambu and one for payasam. Instead of putting all the masalas in the pot that was meant for the kozhambu, I put it in the milk that was being boiled for the payasam. That day onwards, I stopped making both these dishes together. Vaidehi believes that traditional foods are the best to keep one healthy. Her only advice to everyone is, Use iron vessels to get more iron in the body instead of eating iron medicines. Do not use non-stickWhile the world may be moving towards avocado, quinoa and kale as superfoods to fight uterus-related illnessesVaidehi chooses to cook food with staples available in the kitchen to strengthen the uterus.Gunuku is a special dish that was maderegularly in the earlier days, when a girl hits puberty. It was believedthat gunuku strengthened the uterus. It is aperfect dishfor a dailydose of proteins, shet e l ls us,while stirringthe hotpan on the stove."
2019-11-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/after-drought-marathwadas-farmers-hit-by-untimely-rain-6098730/,"After drought, Marathwada’s farmers hit by untimely rain","Exactly a year since the Maharashtra government declared an early drought in 151 talukas after a poor monsoon, torrential rain over nearly two weeks before Diwali has damaged standing crop on 54.22 lakh hectares of farmland across the state. Almost the entire state is affected, with officials in 325 talukas now receiving urgent requests to assess the crop damage so as to announce relief measures.AdvertisingMarathwadas eight districts, which bore the brunt of acute water scarcity through the first seven months of 2019, are now worst affected by the latest floods, with lakhs of acres of standing crop, including soyabean, cotton and bajra, washed out.There is nobody in our village and nearby areas who is not affected. Every single farmer has suffered damage and complete destruction on one or two acres of land, said Shrikant Gadale, a farmer in Beeds Kaij taluka, where moisture stress in August had already led farmers to anticipate only about 50 per cent of average yield for their soyabean and cotton. Now that too has been destroyed, said Gadale, a resident of Dahiphal Vadamauli village.Gadale on Thursday wrote an application to the Maharashtra governor seeking to be appointed chief minister until the BJP and Shiv Sena resolve their differences  a letter that went viral. Its not to be seen as comedy. It is a serious problem. The Sena and BJP have been voted to power. When farmers are in such a delicate condition, they should form the government expeditiously to give us relief, Gadale told The Indian Express. His 2 acres of land witnessed destruction of soyabean and bajra.AdvertisingIn Georai talukas Chaklamba, where farmers went on relay hunger strike multiple times this year to seek a sub-canal from Jayakwadi, farm animals were in fodder camps, a drought relief measure by the state, for five to six months until early September. My well stayed dry through the first half of the monsoon; we had tankers supplying water even in August. Now our fields are flooded, said Satish Patil of Chaklamba.In Latur, resident deputy collector Anant Gavhane said official panchnamas to assess damage have been slow due to the continuing rain, expected to last till mid-November. Approximately 1,97,857 hectares of crop in 10 talukas of Latur are damaged, but the number may vary once assessment is complete, he said.Soyabean, an important cash crop that has become very popular among farmers, suffered extensive damage across the region. Soyabean (18.69 lakh hectare), cotton (19.73 lakh hectare), tur (1.18 lakh hectare), maize (4.89 lakh hectare) are the main affected crops. State government officials estimate that total losses could be more than Rs 5,000 crore.In Jalnas Math Pimpalgaon village, Babasaheb Jige said he was preparing to harvest his soyabean when the rains began in mid-October. It rained for 12 days without a stop, losses are tremendous, he said. In Nandeds Ardhapur, scores of farmers have been lining up outside the talukas agriculture department office, hoping to get assistance in filling crop insurance claims.After a delayed start, the southwest monsoon this year picked up pace in July. In Marathwada, with districts such as Beed and Jalna suffering a rain deficit until well into August, thousands of farmers delayed sowing. Sowing picked up later, with some regions receiving just enough rain for crops like soyabean, cotton and tur. Barring a dip in sowing of pulses like urad and moong, which are usually sown early in the season, acreage of other crops reported growth.The cyclonic disturbances in the Arabian Sea and revival of the monsoon as it withdrew led to rain towards the end of October. Between June to November 1, Maharashtra reported an average of 1,353.11 mm rain as against the normal 1,199.4 mm. The eight districts of Marathwada have reported the maximum crop damage  22.71 lakh hectare across 6,943 villages. Districts in North Maharashtra and Vidarbha have reported damage on 16.69 lakh hectare and 12.47 lakh hectare, respectively."
2019-11-02,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-its-deep-fried-its-bengali/article29863705.ece,"If it’s deep-fried, it’s Bengali","The main industry / in Kolkata  real estate / and telebhaja: Amit Chaudhuri, from TelebhajaMy friend from Berlin was delighted to discover pumpkin flowers in the markets of Kolkata.You eat pumpkin flowers too? she asked. How do you prepare them?Oh we dip them in batter and deep-fry them, I replied cheerily. She seemed rather crestfallen. She had been thinking she was about to discover the Bengali equivalent of Italian zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese. Just dunking them in besan and tossing them in a kadhai of hot bubbling oil seemed less inspiring.I could see her point. Once you dip something in heavy batter and deep fry it, it didnt much matter anymore whether it was yellow pumpkin blossoms or white bokphool flowers or any other flower to start with.The fact is Bengalis like to deep-fry everything  pumpkin slices, eggplants, greens, even the crunchy seeds of overripe parwals. Everything is fair game  vegetables, flowers, tiger prawns, fish roe, chicken lollipops. I am surprised our fairy tales arent filled with wicked witches who try to deep-fry little children.Pakoras and dumplingsDeep-fried is an adjective in English. In Bengali it acquires the solidity of a noun, telebhaja. Which literally means Things Fried in Oil. It could be begunis, batter-fried eggplant slices; or peyajis, little pakoras made of fine-chopped onion and green chillis; or it could be aloo chops, first cousins to aloo bondas but with thinner besan coatings. Winter lunches mean little florets of batter-fried cauliflower, while deep-fried crispy tiny mourala fish are perfect for any season. In recent years dal-vada wallah carts have sprung up in street corners all over Kolkata, frying up mounds of spicy little lentil dumplings that are served piping hot in newspaper packets, the oil stain spreading deliciously over the newsprint as if tracing a map of illicit pleasures.The Bengali romance with the deep-fried is not new. Pragyasundari Devis seminal cookbook of Bengali recipes from 1902 has over 100 recipes under Bhajibhuji aka Fried-This-And-That. She fries things I did not even know existed  gaandaal leaves, delo and punko saag  as well as things I would have thought defied frying  like pineapples, green papaya and jackfruit. Do not skimp on the oil, she warns. It will become limp instead of crunchy. Fry in batches. Dont overcrowd. Haste makes soggy.She assures us that something fried, whether batter-fried or shallow-fried, can accompany almost everything on a Bengali plate.With rice and khichdi you can try fried vegetables or fuluris, puffy besan dumplings. With pulaos, she recommends koftas and chops, the Bengali answer to croquettes. With puffed luchis (themselves deep-fried), you can have fried eggplant or fried parwal.Fried potatoes pair excellently with mutton or duck roast. And all this does not include the procession of deep-fried treats that accompany the afternoon cup of cha.The devilled eggTea-time snacks or jolkhabar is a Bengali orgy of deep-fried excess, starting with the humble singhara and the simple kalonji-speckled kucho nimki munchies to the vegetable chop, that curious ball of grated beetroot with raisins and peanuts. From here we quickly climb the food chain to diamond fish fries, mutton breast cutlet, fowl cutlets, fish fingers, and the lethal butter-fried Fish Orly. Many of these have colonial roots, though now thoroughly Bengalicised. A devilled egg in the rest of the world is a cold snack made with a boiled egg, its yolk mashed with mustard and mayo. An Egg Devil in Kolkata is a boiled egg wrapped with minced meat, dunked in breadcrumbs and deep-fried.I remember going to a Calcutta Classic Food Festival that celebrated some of Kolkatas most legendary snack shops. Chitto-das Suruchee, Niranjan Agar, Apanjan, Allen Cafe, Mitra Caf, started in 1910-11 not by a Mr. Mitra but by a Mr. Sushil Roy who wanted to create a hangout for friends or mitra. Each eatery has its own iconic dish, deep-fried of course. Allen Kitchen has its gloriously batter-fried Sp. Prawn Cutlet Big (Pure Ghee), though its Fish Fry sticks to refined oil. They say Bengali superstar Uttam Kumar frequented Mitra Cafe for its Chicken Kabiraji  the Bengali version of the British cover egg cutlet  where the chicken fillet is covered with a coating of deep-fried egg batter that makes a lacy egg doily oozing oil. It is not meant for the faint of heart.Iconic brain chopMitra Cafes real speciality, though, is its iconic brain chop. Imagine a deep-fried tennis ball with gooey goat brain inside. For those less daring, theres Chitto-das classic Diamond Fish Fry or Fish Roll, minced fish surrounded by a layer of Kolkata bhetki, then deep-fried.The only vegetables in sight at that food festival were raw onions and slivers of cucumber pretending to be a salad. I did not touch them. After all, you can get E. coli from cut raw vegetables.Perhaps thats the scientific reason behind this love for all things deep-fried. It might clog the arteries but at least no pesky germ can survive that wok of boiling oil.Yet, it is still the humble telebhaja, minus the attraction of a Kolkata bhetki or chicken breast, which remains the true marker of Bengali-ness. The hole-in-the-wall telebhaja shops rarely have names, or if they do, they are names like Potlas Shop or Naren-das Shop, but their clientele is devoted. And some have a hallowed history.Netajis snacksOn a road once named after Lord Cornwallis, theres a telebhaja shop that specialises in the usual favourites along with more exotic offerings like mango chop, soya bean chop and coconut chop. But thats not why its famous. Lakshmi Narayan Shaw & Sons was opened in 1918 by one Khedu Shaw. Back in the day it apparently supplied young Subhas Chandra Bose with all things deep-fried, especially during the secret meetings he held with other freedom fighters. In 1942, Shaw babu started to secretly distribute free snacks on Netajis birthday, a grease-stained act of subversion in our freedom struggle that we remain tragically uninformed about. Somehow, it makes our heroes more human, knowing that on a rainy monsoon evening, between meetings plotting how to throw off the yoke of colonialism, they paused for some aloor chop.But our favourite telebhaja shop was more humble. Nalin-dada was the cook who accompanied my mother as a new bride into the jungles of Madhya Pradesh where my civil engineer father was building a bridge. When they returned to Kolkata, Nalin-dada set up a telebhaja stall outside our house where he fried eggplants and onion pakoras every evening while his children and I played hide-and-seek.I can still picture his little display case lit by the flame of a kerosene lamp, with fresh-fried begunis and peyajis piled in a basket.My great-grandmother was a huge fan of his telebhaja. Actually, she was a fan of all things deep-fried, her appetite undiminished till the very end. Once in her 90s she fell down and bust her head. As the family scurried around trying to staunch the blood, she called out plaintively to the old maid, Jamuna, remember to soak the dal. I want to have dal bada tomorrow. My mother scolded her for her insatiable appetite for fried food but now, whenever we eat dal vada at lunch, she remembers her wistfully.In these parts, even our nostalgia is deep-fried.Moong BeguniAs found in Amish o Niramish, Vol. 1, the cookbook by Pragyasundari Devi.Getty Images/ iStockIngredients60g whole moong dal2 tbsp rice flour15g white sesame seeds75g eggplant1/2 tsp salt3 tbsp gheeMethod1. Soak the moong dal in water. After one hour remove the peels and wash the dal several times and grind to a paste. Rinse the sesame seeds.2. Cut the eggplant into round slices and rub salt on them. You should have 13-14 slices of eggplants.3. Beat the dal paste vigorously. Put a drop into some water, if it floats you do not need to beat it any more. Now add the rice flour, sesame seeds and salt. Smear the eggplant slices with the mixture.4. Heat the ghee. After a few minutes add the eggplant 3-4 at a time and fry till they are crunchy and brown. Each should take about three minutes.The author of Dont Let Him Know, like many Bengalis, likes to let everyone know about his opinions."

On Friday, the average traded price of onion at Lasalgaon wholesale market in Nashik districts Niphad taluka was Rs 4,351 per quintal.AdvertisingDistricts in the Nashik division  Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar  have reported crop damage in over 16.69 lakh hectares, including swathes of onion fields. Onions in kharif season, which usually arrive after Diwali, were either being harvested or were ready to be harvested when rain started battering the state. The harvested crop has been damaged while the late transplanted crop, which was to be harvested in another fortnight or so, has also been damaged, said a trader.The current price rise is likely to continue as overall availability of the produce has been hit.Other than onions, the prices of other kharif crops damaged by the rain, including soyabean, pulses and maize among others, have also started rising. The price of urad (black gram) has seen a 66 per cent increase in the last few days and at Laturs wholesale market  one of the biggest market of pulses in the country  urad is trading at around Rs 7,600 per quintal.AdvertisingGrowers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have also reported crop damage, said Latur-based daal miller and trader Nitin Kalantari. Arrivals have come down, triggering the price hike, he said.Pulses like moong have also seen a price rise, and prices of daals even in the retail markets in Pune and Latur are increasing. Urad daal prices have increased by Rs 40 per kg and its wholesale price currently is around Rs 110 per kg. Similarly, moong daal is now costlier by Rs 10 per kg, with the daal retailing at Rs 90-95 per kg."

The smell of good bread baking can make me irrational, romantic and lose control. And a great warm, crusty, honest white loaf, like a freshly baked baguette, with just a bit of salted butter drives me hysterical, just makes me fall apart.Theres something in warm bread that is evocative, comforting and maternal. Maybe thats because I come from a family of bread lovers. While any normal Indian family would have rotis or rice at the table, we always had bread. Breakfast was never kanda-poha, upma, parathas, idlis, thalippeth or poli-bhaaji, it was always toast and butter. With fried eggs, my mother would shallow-fry slices of bread in ghee till golden brown. With a bit of milk and eggs, wed have French toast; sometimes sweetened, but most often savoury. Creamy scrambled eggs would be dished out with crusty brun pav, and akuri with freshly baked laadi pav. At mealtimes, mutton was always eaten with pav, and Ive gone to the extent of using slices of bread to mop up my prawn curry, instead of the staple steamed rice.Even when eating out, like at one of those old-fashioned continental meals either at The Chambers at the Taj, The Ambassador Hotel, The Willingdon Club or when abroad, the breadbasket with breadsticks and little hard or dinner rolls with frozen curls of butter, for me, is the most blessed way to start a meal. Bread is my go-to meal; even my favourite dessert is a well-made bread and butter pudding.Bakeries still make me light-headed. The smell of fresh bread and the sight of a loaf. My earliest memory of a bakery is of A Palmer and Co at Kemps Corner. It stood in the compound of what is now Om Chambers, which houses China Garden, right next to the Parsi Doongerwadi.Alongside A Palmer and Co was the Italian bakery and confectionery, L Pierotti. Together they made pastries, biscuits, all our birthday cakes, long crusty baguettes and many batches of hot bread. The whole of Kemps Corner smelt of sweet confectionary and bread. Im sure thats when the kilos started creeping up on this then-eight-year-old.A freshly baked focaccia at Foodhall. At outlets across the city, breads emerge on a timetable that is posted on a wall right next to the oven.As kids, a trip to the suburbs always meant that the drive back was timed to catch a freshly baked batch of pav coming off the wood-fired ovens at City Bakery, Worli. Long before Mumbai became so polluted and crowded, you could smell bread coming out of the ovens at City Bakery a mile away. We would jump out of the car and buy hot, crusty brun. Not to take home but to polish off immediately in the car, after stopping at a nearby store to buy butter to pat on.But the real pav-wala was that man on a cycle with a long beard, in skullcap and checkered lungi. The cycle always had a big wooden box mounted on the back, covered with black plastic and held in place by a rubber tube. This wooden box contained hot bread. This was the typical Mumbai pav-walla. He picked up fresh bread from the local bakery and dropped it off at his regulars homes in the neighbourhood, twice a day. Even today you can see this lungi-clad cyclist selling bread in most parts of south Mumbai, including Malabar Hill, Warden Road and Nana Chowk. To add to his income hed also sell sweet toast, sweet buns, khari biscuit and eggs.Bread making in those days was dominated by the Iranis. Bastani, Kayani, Sassanian, Paris and Yezdani tiled six pieces of dough together and baked the laadi. A soft white inside with a crisp brown outside gained the bastardisation brun. Till today, the bread that comes out of the ovens of Yezdani Bakery at Cawasji Patel Road in Fort creates a rush; and their afternoon batch of apple pies finds office-goers queuing in the narrow lane where it stands.The multi-grain sourdough at The Bakers Dozen. They also do brioche, bagels, baguettes, pain aux cereales, cinnamon rolls, croissants, a ragi bread and masala pav.While the Irani bakeries still do brisk business, todays bread has turned artisanal and the interest in bread is hot. The Bombay Baking Company (BBC) at the JW Marriott in Juhu was, for a very long time, my favourite place to pick up a huge loaf of pain au levain (sourdough) or ciabatta. As you enter the BBC, the rack on the right is always loaded with freshly baked breads; the sourdough is lovely, crusty and dense.Indigo Deli in Colaba was an obligatory pit stop before taking a boat from Gateway to Alibaug. At the far end of the deli, the bread section always held small baguettes, freshly herbed focaccia, hard multi-grains and whole-wheat.All Foodhalls offer a huge variety of artisanal home-made breads. At first glance they dont look tempting at all, because theyre wrapped in cling film or plastic bags and weve always been told that thats no way to sell bread. But I took a German rye sourdough home and put it in the oven for a little while and it came out so wonderfully crusty and fresh that I ate the bread and my words as well.Foodhalls breads emerge on a timetable that is posted on the wall right next to the oven, which spews out fresh bread two or three times a day, and theres a lot there  sandwich bread, garlic bread, high-fiber-cereal bread, keto herb bread, gluten-free multigrain / multi-seed, quinoa.Bakers Dozen has three stores in the city. You can walk in and pick from a variety of European and international breads like brioche (a slightly sweet cake-like bread made with more eggs, butter and milk), bagels, baguettes, pain aux cereales, cinnamon rolls and croissants, and they also do ragi bread and masala pav.But the epiphany is Mer Konfekt. Tucked away in a residential building on Sophia Lane at Breach Candy, they make vegetarian breads without any maida. They use ancient grains and seeds like bajra, jowar, rajgira, shingoda, makai, nachni, soyabean, sprouted moong, chia and quinoa, to make just about everything. Breads, kulchas, tea cakes, biscuits, baked snacks, cookies, the lot. Its perfect for those who love bread and cannot give it up. Like me. Such is my love for bread, that when I pray, God appears to me in the form of bread."

As per the plan, land on which moong dal, black gram, groundnut and vegetables are cultivated would be irrigated with these projects.We have repaired all the damaged LI points, said Executive Engineer, Berhampur Lift Irrigation Division Ajit Kumar Sahu. He said the department has put forward a proposal to the Government to execute 106 new LI points in Ganjam during 2019-20 at a cost of Rs 7 crore.Sources said each LI point would facilitate three crops in a year on one-acre land.One LI point would also create more than 6,000 man-days. Many State governments are laying emphasis on LI projects as it helps irrigation, creates man-days and checks migration of labour.It is high time the Odisha Government took it up seriously, opined farmer leaders."
2019-11-20,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-food-fest-in-hyderabad-puts-the-spotlight-on-the-indigenous-specials-of-the-muthuvan-tribe/article30026508.ece,The lesser known food of Muthuvan tribe,"Chef Vellu Murugans pursuance of the hill tribe of Muthuvan in Madurai wasnt as easy as perfecting the preparation of a biryani by a novice in the kitchen. His several attempts included trying to reach them directly, approaching researchers who are studying and documenting the tribe, and when everything failed he, made his father make a few calls.My father knew one of the families in the Muthuvan tribe. With that contact, I reached their settlement, which is usually deep in the forest and requires long and arduous hours of trekking on a predominantly single route jungle trail. However, once you reach their settlement, things are different. The people arent nomads or people living on tree tops. They are people who follow their own rules and governance and are extremely shy, adds chef Vellu.Chatting with us at ITC Kakatiya in Hyderabad during a week-long Masterchef Chronicles food promotion, Chef Vellu presents the cuisine of the Muthuvan hill tribe. There , diners can choose from three options of thali  Saivam (veg), Asaivam (non-veg) and Matsyam (seafood).Chef Vellu | Photo Credit: By arrangementBefore he presents the food, the chef warns, This food is very simple. Its made using spices that are available to the tribes naturally and those which they can grow. However, there is a generous use of green chillies, ginger, raw turmeric, cinnamon and lemon grass.Discussing more about how to reach the tribesmen of Muthuvan, he says, since the village falls in the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border, one has to approach the government of their respective states for permission. Usually, researchers and those who are keen in knowing and understanding their lifestyle ask for permissions. The settlements are not open to tourists all year round and when there are visitors, they are mostly hosted and greeted in their village square by men. The women stay in a sort of purdah system for strangers.Taking the food discussion forward, Vellu says that within a limited menu, he has done his best to divide the menu into categories of soups, starters, main course and dessert. The tribals mostly eat what they grow, so farm to fork is their way of life. They have a rasam called Setsoop, that comes loaded with vegetables. The meats are mostly one-pot dishes. They eat freshwater fish and livestock includes hens, goats and pigs. Goat milk is used in a number of their curries and gravy preparations. They are consumers of millets and ragi, and often depend on red rice for their staple food. Use of coconut milk and water in cooking and fermenting shows their Kerala influence. It took chef Vellu several trips to interact and learn about their food and then tweak it a little to present to urban diners.Dishes like chundum payarum (banana flower with whole green moong), meen varuthatu (fish smeared with spices, rolled in betel leaves and fried) and kodi uppukadi (chicken in fresh spices) were indeed new to taste and flavourful. In the mains, the tangy puzha meen curry (river fish curry) and erachi milagu curry (runny lamb stock pepper dish) with the aatu kari choru (mutton keema rice) was sublime. The steamed rice cake with slivers of lamb was slightly sweet and aromatic.

We relish all his items, especially crispy variations in dosa and puliyogare, says Shoba C, his wife.R Padmanabhan,retired senior assistant sales managerBharat works in Mumbai and gets to visit his family only during the weekends. My wife stocks up the requirements for the preparation and the kitchen is all mine. By cooking, Im able to equally commit and take part in the welfare of the household. One does not get that satisfaction just from earning money for the family but also spending quality time, says Bharat while making lemon-sized balls out of vada batter.He has been cooking for almost 25 years. While growing up, cooking was a necessity for him and his four siblings because his parents used to be away at work. Recipes were learnt from observation. It eventually developed into passion and experimentation.From college to work, there have been several commitments at various stages. I always find time for cooking because it gives me a high and sense of liberation. Im attempting to make different temple cuisines out of interest. Saying that youre busy is not an excuse anymore, try cooking once and youll know how much it helps with your management skills, he shares, adding that colleagues back in Mumbai enjoy his home-cooked food.Kovil DosaIngredientsRaw rice: 1 cup, Black urad dal: 1/3 cup, Black pepper powder: 1 tsp, Dry ginger powder: 1/2 tsp, Curry leaves: as required, Ghee: half a cup, Water as required to mix the batterMethodlWash and soak raw rice for at least two-and-a-half hours l Drain water completely and spread it on a cloth towel l Keep it under the shade and allow to dry for 40 minutes l The rice should be just dry enough for you to feel the moisture in the rice l Grind this rice into a rava consistency and keep it aside l Wash and soak whole black urad dal for three hours, drain water and grind into a smooth paste by adding few tablespoons of water l Dont throw away the husk, you can grind them as well l Now add half a cup of water to the rice flour and mix it welll Then, add the urad dal batter and mix well l You can add water as required l Thick consistency is good for this dosa l Add salt as required, dry ginger powder, black pepper powder and curry leaves and mix it well l Heat the tawa once hot and pour a ladle full of batter and spread ghee around the edges.

He likes innovating, playing with ingredients, and is a perfectionist with following a particular method of preparation. His enthusiasm defies his age. He started cooking under his elder sisters guidance from the age of 16. The desire for perfection and feeding people has only expanded with age. Hes 73 now.Although the women of the house predominantly handle the cooking department, I often like contributing my share. My wife and I work on our timings and cook on alternate days. There are a few delicacies that Im known for in the family. Nobody but I can cook them with efficiency. One need not prepare delicious meals to be a good cook. Even basics help, says Padmanabhan who made pongal and bajji for the day's breakfast.K Anand Bhattar, priestHis level of dedication extends beyond cooking to the cleaning process. No item goes waste. I like arranging things in a certain way. The environment while cooking has to be serene and organised. We grew up in a generation that never relied on outside food. Everything would be made from scratch at home. Ive passed on the cooking skills to my children to take care of their basic needs. My spicy chutneys are peoples favourite. I also like trying out different kinds of kuzhambu and traditional items, he says. To date, he prepares an array of sweets and savouries for festivals and sends it across to relatives.Nenthram pazham raceIngredientsNenthram: 3 (a variety of banana), Jaggery: 1/4 cup, Red chilli: 5, Pepper: 10, Channa dal: two tsp, Dhaniya: 1 tsp, Urad dal: 1 tsp, Aesofittida: 1 pinch, Tamarind: 1 amla size, Salt to taste, Turmeric, Grated coconut: 2 tsp,Methodl Add salt and turmeric to the tamarind water and boil the nenthrams l Take a pan, add oil, chilli, pepper saut and grated coconut l After cooling, grind to a thick paste with water l Add jaggery to nenthram l Add everything and boil l Garnish with mustard and curry leaves in coconut oil.Hymns and ladlesHymns and prayer chanting fill Anands kitchen. Its a delight to watch him slice merakai (Chow Chow) effortlessly, and saut it in a pan with urad dal. A simple vegetable curry for the day is ready. He picked up the art from his father and grandfather who were excellent cooks.My grandfather was a caterer. Id accompany him for marriages and help in laying banana leaves. In one such instance, at the age of 15, I had to make kaju cakes since the head cook fell sick at the last minute. It turned out to be tasty and people loved it. Since then, Ive been equipped to cook in bulk for even 1,000 people, says Anand, who loves to read about ancient cooking practices and regional cooking. He takes turns with his wife for cooking depending on his work timings. Both his kids are also trained to cook.Anands job demands him to travel across the world for different kinds of rituals. Once in Rajasthan, we were gearing up for the days puja. The cook, who had to come, met with an accident and I had to take over. I had to cook in the freezing temperatures without even tasting the food. One needs to identify everything with smell. Its a different kind of experience that not many will get, points out the priest.Anand believes in educating his children on the consumption of organic and healthy vegetables. They never order or buy from outside. Its the homely familiarity that he has passed on to his children.BisibelabathIngredientsRice: 1 kg, Tur dal: 300 gram, Turmeric: 1/4 tsp, Red chilli: 5-8, Coriander seeds: 50 g, Black pepper: two tsp, Cumin seeds: 2 tsp, Hing (Asafoetida): 20 g, Fenugreek: 30 g, Kadala: 50, Urad dal: 50, Mustard seeds: 20 g, Jaggery: 50 g, Tamarind: 50 g, Gingelly oil: 100 ml, Ghee: four tsp, Salt (rock salt), to taste, Green chilli: 2, Salt: 80 g, Vegetables: (100 g each), Brinjal, Ladys finger, Chow Chow, Capsicum, Small onion (if need be), Dry coconut, grated: 100 g, Curry leaves, Coriander to garnishMethodl Boil tur dal, add turmeric and keep asidel Boil rice, mash and keep it asideFor the powderl Pour oil in a panl Add coriander seeds, red chilli, pepper, fenugreek, curry leaves  saut and grind itl If you need more spice then add bay leaves, cardamom (4), anise (2), fennel (4tsp), add jaggeryl Roast all the ingredients, grind and keep it asideFinal mixingl Pour oil, mustard seeds, red chilli, urad dal and channa dall Add capsicum and onion separatelyl Add the other vegetablesl Salt 80 gl Keep it on simmer and close the lidl Add tamarind waterl Add the roasted powder and boil them all togetherl Now add the boiled tur dal and mix them all to rice.

In a time when both men and women are on par in everything, why attach pride to the aspect of cooking alone? Why does it become special when a man cooks for his wife while the latter does it every day?, asks Jagannath R who has too many questions about the kitchen conundrum.Jagannath grew up in Kolkata in a household where everybody cooked. It was a family affair. He forayed into cooking at the age of six under his parents supervision. It helped him during his scouts and guides camps when they were asked to make a basic meal for survival without the luxury of having appliances or ingredients.I spent most of the time in boarding school, college, and now I have a travelling job. During college days in Chennai, my sister and I would cook to unwind from everyday stress. I do the same now. After long hours at work, we find it to be therapeutic, he says.A good set of knives, minimal cooking appliances, and western music in the background  this is the ideal mood for Jagannath to get him cooking. He loves having friends over for parties frequently and likes to prepare multi- cuisine delicacies. Warm appreciation and motivation from friends make him want to cook more food. Im proud that I can cook anything and dont have to be dependent on anyone. My friends envy me for that, he shares.Spaghetti with tomato sauceIngredientsStore-bought spaghetti: 200 gram, Garlic: 10 cloves (finely chopped), Onion: 2 medium size (finely chopped), Tomatoes: 2 medium size, Olive oil, Salt to taste, Oregano to taste, Chilli flakes to taste, Thyme to taste, Fresh/dried basil to taste, Parmesan cheese: 30 gMethodl In a deep vessel, add water and bring it to a boil l Add salt to the water.

From helping his mother out in the kitchen to learning the nuances and tricks of cooking from his aunts, hes come a long way to preparing a meal for an entire household.My father was a flawless cook. Even if its a basic flat beans curry, hed do it with perfection. I admired and liked his cooking better. Hed make roti for me and my grandfather on the terrace under the moon, just the traditional way. He died when I was young and I decided to carry forward his memories through cooking, reminisces Muhilann.The budding architect grew up in a big household. To help his aunt, hed wake up early morning and get started with the days cooking. During his childhood hed leave for school only after washing and drying the used vessels. I appreciate criticism. But if they touch my nerve by finding faults often then Id deliberately prepare it in a way they dont like. Im mischievous in the kitchen, says Muhilann.During his college days in Ooty, Muhilann used to cook and have his friends over whenever they felt homesick. There was always food in his room. My mother used to visit me with traditional sweets and candies. Everybody in college loved it so much that I opened a stall and made money out of it. I also used cooking as an incentive to study better. Whenever I scored low marks, Id make a demand for a kitchen appliance and when my mother promised to buy it for me then I would clear the paper with good scores. Its a lifelong skill that I carry everywhere to make people happy, he says.Vennai puttuIngredientsRice: 1 cup, Bengal gram dal: 50 gram,Jaggery: 2 cup, Coconut:  shell, Cardamom: 5 nosMethodl Soak rice for two hours, finely grind it to a batter consistency l Boil four glasses of water and add Bengal gram dal l Once Bengal gram dal is half cooked, then add rice batter to itl Stir it well until the rice batter is cooked.

2019-12-04,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/dec/04/the-king-size-plate-of-indian-breakfast-2071069.html,The king-size plate of Indian Breakfast,"Neelanjana Singh By""Indian food is terrible and we pretend it isnt,"" reads a recent tweet by American academic Tom Nichols. This statement set off a war on Twitter, and it was interesting to read the variety of responses that followed.Comments ranged from accusing Nichols of lacking taste buds to some offering to cook for him, yet some others pointing him to the restaurants that serve good Indian food. One among these responses explained to Nichols that it was pointless to lump all the diverse cuisines of India into one category. This remark got me thinking about our truly diverse breakfast menus.While it is perfectly possible for someone to dislike the Indian cuisine, it would surprise me if there isnt at least one thing for everyone in our very eclectic breakfast menu. Breakfast options in the west typically include eggs, toast, meats and coffee or tea, but the Indian breakfast menu happens to be far more extensive. Some may argue that the west offers pancakes, waffles and french toast, while we have puris, parathas and kachoris, hence there is little difference.The difference, however, is in how we combine a variety of flavours and incorporate seasonality and region-specific foods into our breakfast menu. In the winter months, parathas are a hot favourite for breakfast in north India. These parathas are almost always stuffed with gobi, mooli or methi. When these veggies go out of season, the quintessential onion or ajwain ki roti/paratha takes over. This is usually eaten with dahi as an accompaniment, which is a perfect combination in terms of taste and nutrition.The breakfast menu in Rajasthan includes millet preparations such as bajra rotis, eaten with pickles made from veggies grown in that region. Venture southwards and the options change to idli, dosa, vada, upma and appams, which are all-time favorites. The millet that finds favour in these parts is ragi.Ragi goes into the preparation of almost all kinds of foods in the region, including dosa. Pittu, another popular dish in the south, is made with rice and coconut, and is eaten with a curry made from chickpea (Kadala curry). The western part of India has a range of completely different breakfast options  thepla, khakra, rotla, poha, dhokla and sabudana preparations.In east India, sattu reigns supreme in various forms  as a sweet or savoury drink or stuffed in roti/paratha. Another staple breakfast food here is dahi-chidwa. The beaten rice is softened by washing and soaking it briefly in water and eating it with dahi. To this, one could add either jaggery or spices and salt for flavour.Interestingly, certain dishes that are popular across all these regions are found under different names. Cheela made with moong dal or besan, paired with chutney, dahi or pickle, is one such dish. Similarly, porridge prepared with different grains (broken wheat/amaranth/vermicelli) is a popular breakfast food in all parts of India. Breakfast continues to be the most important meal of the day, and the extensive Indian menu gives us little reason to skip it."

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Do you consume these Ayurvedic herbs regularly? (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Ayurveda, one of the oldest healthcare tradition in the world, controls and regulates the three basic energies in the body  pitta, vata and kapha. In Sanskrit ayur means life and veda signifies the knowledge to live life. As per ancient Ayurvedic texts, strong immunity is the foundation of healthy living. Immunity protects the body against all external and internal agents of diseases. But maintaining an ideal level of immunity (ojas) is not that easy. It can be achieved by following a healthy lifestyle. Ayurveda focuses on strengthening the immunity through a balanced lifestyle and recommends the consumption of a few herbs, says Mohamad Yusuf N Shaikh, founder of Kudrati Ayurved Health Center.Below, he shares a few Ayurvedic herbs that can help boost the bodys immunity.1. Ashwagandha: Ashwagandha is widely recognized for boosting the bodys immune system as it is rich in biologically active substances, amino acids, peptides, lipids, and the bases of nucleic acids. It also helps reduce blood sugar levels, lowers cholesterol levels and reduces the stress hormone.2. Garlic: With its antiseptic, anti-fungal, and nutritive properties, garlic has been used as an immune booster for thousands of years by Ayurveda. It is a powerful natural antioxidant, which protects the body from bacterial and viral infections, without causing any side-effects. Garlic acts as a natural antibacterial agent when it is fresh and raw as it contains allicin that kills viruses and bacteria. It is a good medicine against coughs, colds and chest infection during the winter.3. Ginger: An ingredient packed with immune-boosting benefits, ginger also helps prevent nausea and soothes an upset tummy. Ginger is also very effective in keeping your body warm and helps break down the accumulation of toxins in your organs. Add ginger to a stir-fried dish or boil it to make a cup of ginger tea with some added lemon for a pleasant and a healing hot drink.Ginger is a great way to keep your body warm.

Amba haldi: Also known as raw turmeric, it is a vital Ayurvedic herb which is mostly found during the monsoon season. Amba haldi helps in revitalising the blood and purifies it by removing the toxic agents. It also helps in maintaining the health of the stomach and digestive system.Apart from all these herbs amla, holy basil and triphala, used in the form of tea and tonics, also help in boosting the immunity.Choose the right foodConsuming fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, dairy and unprocessed products will provide your body with the desirable nutrition and ojas (immunity). However, packaged food items that are processed, canned, and frozen are harder to digest, and thus create ama (toxins), because they are old, denatured by processing, or even include harmful ingredients such as chemical preservatives. Organically grown foods are best because they are not only free from harsh chemicals but also contain all the essential minerals. Vegetarian proteins such as paneer (homemade cheese), milk, and pulses (split-moong dhal, lentils and other small, split beans) help to enhance immunity. But meat is not a recommended protein because it is difficult to digest and creates ama adds Shaikh. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-13,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-tour-of-hindu-goan-cuisine-with-kunal-vijayakar/story-1xMswKtQsqqDmwWqQdqJqL.html,"A tour of Hindu Goan cuisine, with Kunal Vijayakar","mumbaiUpdated: Dec 13, 2019 21:10 ISTThe first time I went to Goa was on a bus. For some reason, the tickets Id booked on Vayudoot (remember that dodgy airline?) for the handsome sum of Rs 250 got cancelled and I couldnt re-book them. All the other flights to Goa were full by then, and I had to get to Goa for a wedding, so I jumped on a bus that took off from Dadar in the evening. It was a terrible bus. The seats were musty and cramped and the windows were dirty and the curtains smelly. The rattling promised to rearrange my insides, and so I thought the only way I could survive this ride was to get smashed and fall asleep.We reached Mahad, on the Bombay-Goa road, at about 10 pm for a dinner and evacuation stop. I headed straight to the bar to find some booze. Dark rum was the only strong alcohol they had. And although I dont really drink rum, I bought a quarter because the rum was available only in quarts and not millilitres. By the time I had decided, paid and settled down with some rum and cola, the bus revved up as if to start and my fellow passengers started clambering back in.I looked at the bus, and then at the bottle. It didnt seem right to carry the bottle on board, so I just knocked the whole quarter down in one go and jumped on. I was knocked out. Nearly 12 hours later I woke up in Mapusa, Goa. I had missed the whole ride, including a couple of stops and the breakfast halt in Kudal. I was hot, hungover and hungry.Looking out of the window, I realised the bus terminated at Mapusa and would not go on to Panaji. Too disoriented to find out more, I went off to try and deal with my hunger. Destiny led me to Caf St Francis Xavier. Its one of the oldest eateries in Mapusa. Here I had my first tryst with real sorpotel, sausage and curry rice. The sorpotel was mature and fiery, the vindaloo sour and spicy and the sausage, an acquired taste that took me a minute to acquire, all eaten with hot poi (Goan bread) a side of beef patties, croquettes and potato-and-egg chops.My life thereafter became one merry ride of vindaloos, sorpotels and chorizo. Occasionally, caldine, cafreal and xacuti. Without even looking back to see whether this small state with a vast Hindu population had another cuisine.It was at the Mandovi Hotel in Panaji, some time later, that I discovered the vast world of Hindu Goan cuisine. With dishes like Hooman, a mild and sour mackerel curry made with grated coconut paste and spices; muddoshya (lady fish), slightly different from the Christian Goan fish curry because of the spice mix; khatkhate, a mixed-vegetable and lentil stew cooked by the states Goud Saraswat Brahmins, spiced with curry leaves, ginger, black pepper, chillies and turmeric. Its a must on days of fasting when the community eats just vegetarian food.Udid Methi is another kind of curry typical of the Saraswats of Goa and Karwar. Its unusual taste comes from a combination of black gram and dried fenugreek seeds that combust excitedly with mackerel. And finally, the kaju biyaam tondak, made with fresh raw cashew nuts, coconut and no onion or garlic; you can add to it almost anything  vegetables, lentils, pulses  because the raw cashew or bibya in this dish is used as a pulse.Unless youre visiting a Saraswat Goan home, though, the Hindu cuisine is hard to find. I just discovered a whole lot of it at Goa Portuguesa in Dadar. My early advertising and theatre days in the 80s and 90s were spent guzzling alcohol, feasting on prawn-stuffed papads and gorging on choriz pav while a merry crooner with a guitar serenaded us with old nostalgic songs and merry Konkani numbers at this fun-filled restaurant. Chef Deepa Awchats menu of Goan Hindu food for me went quite unnoticed amid the haze of vinegar, pork and bread. But then I was invited to a feast last week. A feast to celebrate 31 years of Goa Portuguesa. A feat not many restaurants in Mumbai can boast of.I decide to go, for old times sake, this time determined to concentrate on the food. And Im so glad I did. Of course there was the inevitable pork sorpotel, nearly pickled and the finest Id eaten in a long time; caldine prawn curry with ukade tandool (red Goan rice), artfully flavoured with kismur (dried shrimp roasted crisp, garnished with chopped onion, coriander and spices).But it was the Goan Hindu food that stood out. Tender coconut and cashew nut sukke (juliennes of the two sauteed with tomatoes and spring onion); rajma tondak (rajma and French beans seasoned with Goan spices and simmered in coconut milk); moongacho ghati (sprouted green gram with dry coconut and cashew nut, tempered and cooked in coconut milk); green pea xacuti (cooked in a dark coconut gravy); and tisreo sukke (clams sauted in onion and freshly ground spices, garnished with grated coconut).The meal ended with Amore being belted out in the background and a serving of serradura, a simple dessert which is a combination of sweetened whipped cream, powdered tea biscuits and a chilled bowl of trifle pudding. The evening transported me back to Goa, and did it without a single drop of alcohol. Now thats a feat."
2019-12-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/year-ender-will-2020-be-better-for-agriculture-6185005/,Year-ender: Will 2020 be better for agriculture?,"Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness. Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness.Onion prices, at Rs 100-plus per kg in retail and an average of Rs 6,500/quintal even in Maharashtras Lasalgaon wholesale market, have made headlines in a year that is coming to a close. But its not just onions. There are many other farm commodities whose prices have been looking up, if not soaring, of late.Take pulses: Last year, at this time, arhar (pigeon-pea) was trading at Rs 4,500 per quintal in Latur mandi of Maharashtra. Currently, it is selling at Rs 5,000. Likewise, prices of urad (black gram) in Latur have crossed Rs 7,000 per quintal, compared to Rs 4,500-4,600 a year ago, while that of moong (green gram) in Rajasthans Sumerpur market has gone up from Rs 5,200 to Rs 6,000 levels in the same period. These rates are close to or even higher than the minimum support prices (MSP) of Rs 5,800/quintal for arhar, Rs 5,700 for urad and Rs 7,050 for moong.Read | These farmers who broke the mould point the road ahead for manyThe price increase in pulses would, in fact, have been higher, but for the stocks built from government procurement. During the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 agricultural years (July-June), the Central agencies  National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium  together bought 18.78 lakh tonnes (lt), 44.96 lt and 19.50 lt of pulses, respectively. While stocks in the Central pool with Nafed amounted to nearly 42 lt at its peak in June 2019, the apex agency is still holding 20.90 lt (as on December 21), mainly comprising 16.41 lt of chana, 2.19 lt of moong, 1.99 lt of urad and 0.29 lt of masur (lentil).Those stocks have come useful this year, which saw less area being sown under kharif pulses, courtesy poor monsoon rains till about the last week of July. That, along with excess rains thereafter up to early-November, causing significant damage to the standing crop, has resulted in a decline in kharif pulses production similar to that for onions. The only reason why dal has not gone the pyaaz way is the stocks with Nafed.The absence of such a buffer is now being felt not only in onions, but perhaps also in milk.Last year, around this time, dairies in Maharashtra were paying farmers Rs 19-21 per litre for cow milk containing 3.5% fat and 8.5% solids-not-fat. That same milk is today being procured at Rs 29-31 a litre. In 2018-19 (April-March), India exported 45,082 tonnes of skimmed milk powder (SMP), with the Centre even extending a subsidy of Rs 50/kg to enable dairies to ship out their excess stocks. But with output set to dip in 2019-20, due to the cumulative impact of sustained low producer prices and extended rains, SMP prices have doubled to over Rs 300 per kg in the last one year.Not having created a buffer stock, when dairies were saddled with surplus powder and forced to slash procurement as well as prices paid to farmers, may prove costly soon. The winter and spring months are the flush season for milk. Animals normally produce more during this time because of better fodder and water availability, besides reduced body stress on account of lower temperatures and humidity. This year, though, the onset of flush has been delayed by the late rains, which have not allowed the fodder to grow properly and accumulate sufficient dry matter. Most dairies have recorded negative milk procurement growth so far in 2019-20. It remains to be seen how much of this can be made up for in the next few months before summer, when flush gives way to lean and dairies would need to have sufficient stock of powder for reconstituting into milk.Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness. Soyabean is quoting at Rs 4,000 per quintal in Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh), up from Rs 3,300 a year ago. Prices of maize at Davangere (Karnataka) have similarly risen from Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,900 and that of bajra from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per quintal in Chomu (Rajasthan). The current market prices are higher than the MSPs: Rs 1,760 per quintal for maize, Rs 3,710 for soyabean and Rs 2,000 for bajra.The above price recovery  even sugar seems to be turning around, thanks to a global deficit that has opened up export opportunities for Indian mills  should actually be welcome for an economy desperately looking for good news. The underlying factors here are partly structural (farmers reducing planting or investing less in yield-enhancing inputs in response to low realisations in the past few years) and partly weather-induced (early season drought followed by prolonged unseasonal rains). But to the extent these are helping bring back sentiment in produce markets, badly battered in the post-demonetisation period, there is a strong case for policymakers not to be unduly perturbed.In the days to come, there is bound to be lot of pressure for cutting duties or allowing more import of SMP and pulses. The Narendra Modi government, in its first term, was very hawkish with regard to food inflation. It would be interesting whether it will adopt the same approach in its second term as well  this has already been witnessed vis--vis onions  especially with consumer food inflation in crossing single-digits in October for the first time in almost six years.The one consolation, however, is the prospect of a bumper rabi harvest. The surplus monsoon and post-monsoon rains have recharged groundwater aquifers, apart from filling the countrys major dams close to their full reservoir capacities. That has, in turn, encouraged farmers to aggressively expand the area sown under most rabi crops.If the current price recovery trend holds and rabi production turns out good  there is room for optimism on that count  it would set the stage for a long overdue agricultural turnaround.

The macrobiotic diet was developed in the 1920s by a Japanese philosopher called George Ohsawa who believed that by eating a simple, healthy diet, one could live in harmony with nature. According to Cancer Research UK, Ohsawa also believed that a macrobiotic diet could cure cancer and other serious illnesses.As per a National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)s 2016 study, the analysis of a macrobiotic diet plan indicates the potential for disease prevention and suggest the need for studies of real-world consumption as well as designing, implementing and testing interventions based on the macrobiotic approach.Heres why you can count on the macrobiotic bowl*Its a perfect meal-in-a-bowl and completely nourishing depending on the toppings you choose.*You can easily see your food divided into carbs, proteins and healthy fats.ProteinHummus is a good source of protein.

2019-12-31,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/fusion-mithais-are-the-latest-food-trend/articleshow/73031947.cms,Fusion Mithais are the latest food trend!,"Indias love for mithai is primordial. Refined sugar was first produced in India some 8000 year ago by the people of Indus Valley. In fact the word Sugar in English is a derivative of the Sanskrit word Shakara. The first Indian sweet probably was a close cousin of Malpua which finds mention in Rig Veda as Apupa- a sweet cake made with Barley, deep fried or steamed and then dipped in honey. Western Chalukya king Somesvara III has written an extensive treatise describing the preparation of various Indian sweets. Titled Mansollasa (meaning delight of mind and senses), it mentions various methods involved in making sweets, like steaming, frying, roasting, sauting and assembling.Over the years Indian Mithais saw great evolution with new trends, techniques and methods influencing their make and taste. The Mughals introduced Kulfi for which ice was brought by horse couriers from the Himalayas and are credited for having created rich desserts that made a lot of use of roses, dried fruits, fruits and essence. Thousands of regional varieties exist in the sub-continent today making an unfathomable and arduous list! No wonder India is the heaven of sweet lovers.With global foods making inroads into the traditional Indian palate, the mithai too seems to be adapting to new changes.Indian sweets are not just made for consumption, but they also are prepared for cultural purposes. A sweet is considered a token of love and respect and hence it is offered to Gods, guests who drop in and exchanged as gifts in weddings and festivals. For centuries, a handful of mithais like Laddus, Balushashi, Panjiri. Khaja and Shakarpara topped the list of sweets that were exchanged during celebrations, owing to their longer shelf life. But with time, they became obsolete, at least for those looking for more sophisticated options. Chocolate, although easier to make, could never compete with mithai, considering its lack of cultural validation.Innovation is the prime focus for all recipes and 'Gourmet Mithai' has become the new trend, since it not only entices the taste buds but also uses ingredients innovatively. Guests today want to see novelty in delicacies curated rather than going for traditional desserts, says Anand Panwar, Executive Pastry Chef - Roseate Hotels & Resorts which recently launched its exclusive range of sweets called Mithai by Roseate, which caters to the demand of the new age b uyers. Luxury sweets made with international ingredients and infused with both local and global flavours define this new age concept of Indian desserts.Even Bikanervala, known for its traditional bhujias, mathris, mithais and namkeens has come up with a luxe range called Saugat. Blended with unique flavours and packed exquisitely it is a delicious assortment of sweets that blends together global flavours. It has some unique offerings like Lait Croquer which is a combination of French wafter an doda churned with Turkish hazelnut, Orange Noir a combination of chocolate and zesty orange, Tea Amo which has cookie and milk chocolate combined in flavourful tea, Ispahan, a mixture of rose, lychee chunks and almond and Hazelnut Zvek which mixes together soya, saffron and Turkish hazelnut.My aim was to tap a whole new section of the society which has a more evolved palate. Sahil and I created a line of luxe confectionaries keeping the international flavours and the ever-evolving palates in mind. Taking inspiration from an assortment of flavours from all across the world, we delivered a whole new experience for the Indian market. We have created culinary perfection at Saugaat with perfect blends of indulgent international flavors with an unquestionably traditional ethos.""  says Renuka Aggarwal, founder of Saugaat by Bikanervala who, along with Chef consultant Sahil Mehta curated a line of confectionaries keeping international flavours and the ever-evolving taste palates in mind.The craze for sugar loaded Gulab Jamuns, ghee dripping Jalebis and moong daal halwa has waned for the millennia who is exploring for options that are healthy and sustainable. There has been an increase in demand for naturally sweetened and jaggery based healthy sweets that use whole grains, nuts and seeds and can be consumed guilt free. Ekta Jain, a teaching professional from Delhi decided to quit her full time job to try her hands at making healthy laddus when she realised that the ones she made for the consumption of her own family were in huge demand among friends and relatives. She started her brand Simply Laddoos with her first order of 6 kgs which has now swelled to a whopping 400 kgs in less than three years. The laddoos that she makes use natural ingredients, whole wheat, and sesame and are sweetened with jaggery, palm sugar and dates. They are made in desi ghee and do not pack empty calories but are loaded with taste and nutrition.Another brand Khoya promises sweets made with natural and organic ingredients. It has some unique sweets like Walnut peda, Fig Barfi, Chcoclate Chip Coconut Peda and Brown Sugar Besan Laddu etc that are different from the common mithais that are available in the market. They use a lot of seasonal fruits to give their sweets that natural touch.Credit goes to the new age buyers who are not struck with age old treats but are exploring new options that are healthy, organic and not just obnoxiously sweet and unhealthy. Clearly the 2.0 version of mithai is not just tasty but chic and sexy as well."
