Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Bengaluru /Mysuru: The BJP on Saturday took potshots at Congress for putting up its MLAs at a resort which has been issued notice by the state government for allegedly encroaching land. The BJP said the Eagleton Golf resort owes Rs 982 crore to the state government. A cabinet sub-committee had slapped a penalty of Rs 982 crore on the resort for encroaching 77 acres of land.The issue had figured in the Belagavi legislature session and was raised by JD(S) MLA AT Ramswamy. In reply, revenue minister RV Deshpande said the Supreme Court had directed the resort to pay the guidance value of the encroached land to the government or surrender the same.Congress MP DK Suresh, in whose parliamentary constituency the resort is located, said the party will pay the cost for putting up the MLAs and nothing was free.Twitter war on resort politicsBJP senior MLA S Suresh Kumar (@nimmasuresh): I heartily congratulate all Karnataka Congress MLAs who are on an extended holiday at a luxury resort near Bidadi. Now that they can get sufficiently rejuvenated, lets hope that they are living in a glasshouseKPCC president Dinesh Gundurao @dineshgrao: Sadly, we cannot afford an ultra luxury seven-star resort unlike you because we do not have access to a bottomless pit of black money. But yes, well come back rejuvenated to defeat the BJPs evil designs and show you your place in the Lok Sabha electionsChief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Saturday admitted that sequestering MLAs to a resort is not a good political development, but blamed political exigencies in Karnataka for it.He said theres no need for the JD(S) to protect its MLAs, but defended the Congresss move to shift MLAs to a resort in Bidadi. The BJP has created confusion which forced the Congress to protect its MLAs, he claimed.Stating that hell not poach BJP MLAs, the CM said: The BJP is trying to destabilize the coalition government. But it will not happen. He also hoped that goddess Chamundeshwari will guide the saffron party leaders in right direction. Im blessed by the goddess who is protecting my government, he said.Kumaraswamy, who was part of anti-BJP parties rally hosted by TMC at Kolkata earlier in the day, claimed the BJP will have a herculean task in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP leaders should treat this (rally) as a warning. Like the JD(S) and Congress, other regional parties are coming under the anti-BJP umbrella to fight the BJP in the parliamentary polls, he added."

His home is two tin rooms and his family is among the 58  around 250 men, women and children  who live in a temporary camp in Dinhata, 28 km from Cooch Behar town, that was set up for people from Indian enclaves in Bangladesh when they decided to return in November 2015.AdvertisingIts been three years now, and they are yet to get the promised land.About 60 km from Dinhata, Poaturkuthi, a former Bangladeshi enclave in India, has got new roads, solar-powered tubewells and an under-construction primary school. The process of handing over Indian deeds for land has started. But jobs are still elusive, forcing the youth to fan out across India.Voting on April 11 for the first time to choose a government at the Centre, their expectations are high from both the state and central governments. This is not their first elections though  they had voted for the Assembly poll in 2016 and the Lok Sabha bypolls the same year.In Cooch Behar, TMCs Paresh Adhikari is engaged in a tough fight with the BJPs Nisith Pramanik, who joined the party after being sacked by Trinamool from the post of general secretary of its youth wing in the district. In his affidavit, he has declared 11 pending criminal cases. The Congress has pitted Pia Roy Choudhury and Left Front Gobindo Roy.The Cooch Behar seat has been with Forward Bloc since 1977. In 2014, TMCs Renuka Sinha won with 5,26,499 votes defeating Forward Blocks Dipak Kumar Roy by 87,106 votes. After Sinhas death, TMCs Partha Pratim Roy retained the seat with a huge margin of 4,13,241 against BJPs Hem Chandra Burman. Both TMC (59.03 per cent) and BJP (28.32 per cent) increased their vote share by 19.52 per cent and 11.98 per cent, respectively.Click here for more election newsIt was at midnight on July 31, 2015, that 14,856 people in 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in Indian soil were absorbed in the country following a historic land agreement. Added to this were 921 people who left their homes in Indian enclaves located in Bangladesh  they came in phases that November to three makeshift camps in Dinhata, Mekhligunj and Haldibari in Cooch Behar.During their campaign rallies in the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee claimed credit for the enclave exchange. The land deal with Bangladesh was stuck for decades. We did it, said Modi at a public rally in Cooch Behar town Sunday.I had 9.5 bigha of land in Bangladesh. We were given one month to sell. I could not sell it and therefore left my two sons Gopal and Mithun there. Here my wife and I stay with my third son and his family. Polls come and go, but there is no change in our condition. First, we were promised land, then apartments. Nothing happened so far. However, I will vote. I am waiting for the candidates to come here. Whoever helps us will get our votes, says Burman whose son works as a daily-wage labourer.Burman, like all others in the camp, hailed from the Dasiar Chora enclave in Bangladeshs Kutigram district. No one would buy our land there as they all knew we will be leaving for India. We left everything there, our home and three bigha agricultural land. We have written so many letters to everyone  from the District Magistrate to ministers. Nothing happened, says Osman Gani, who stays in the camp with his wife and two children who have been enrolled in the local government school.Residents claim that apart from their monthly ration, they get 50-55 days of work under the rural employment guarantee scheme. They say they have not been able to access other state or central schemes, such as old-age pension and a youth initiative of the state government.Each family gets free ration, including 30 kg rice, 5 kg masur dal, 5 litres of mustard oil, 5 litres of kerosene, 1 kg packet of salt and 1 kg packet of milk powder per month from the government. There are families which have eight to ten members, some are more. The ration gets over in two weeks, says Mohammed Saheb Ali, 54, who lives with his wife and three sons in the camp.Residents say they had completed the process for Voter ID and Aadhaar cards by 2016, but that discrepancies in details in the documents remain a problem.At Poaturkuthi, 60 km away, the government has provided 20 solar-powered tube wells for irrigation, some of which have gone defunct. The enclave, which has got electricity and a community centre, is one among the 51 Bangladeshi areas that were absorbed in India in August 2015.Just 5 km from the Bangladesh border, Poaturkuthi is spread across 1,200 acres, and is home to 3,037 men women and children from 479 families.There has been some development. But the handing over of our Indian land deeds are yet to be done. We are farmers and the papers are important to us to get loans or avail schemes. The process has started and we have got draft papers. Secondly, most of the youths are forced to work in Delhi, Mumbai and other places as masons and labourers. There is no opportunity here. We will vote for the party who will assure us jobs, says Sajid Khan, 50, whose three sons work as labourers in Delhi.In Puaturkuthi, residents say, there are around 40 youths who have completed secondary school and around two dozen graduates. Most of them venture out of Bengal for jobs as labourers in construction and agricultural fields.I have returned home to vote. Others are on their way. We will vote and leave after April 11. I will not say nothing happened. But those were basic amenities. What about jobs? says Ainul Ali, 27, who works as an electrician in Mumbai.For now though, the residents of these enclaves are at the centre of a tug-of-war for votes.Nearly 1,000 people came from Bangladesh. We are giving them free ration in temporary shelters. We are constructing 1,000 sq-ft apartments for each family. We are also trying to bring them under government schemes. There is ample opportunity of work here as labourers, says Rabindranath Ghosh, North Bengal Development Minister and TMC leader from Cooch Behar.The government not only seems to have forgotten these people, but did not care to make a practical plan for their rehabilitation. Apartments are not a solution for rehabilitation of farmers. Over three years have passed and yet these people stay in camps. The Centre has allotted money for their development, which is being misused, claims Diptiman Sengupta, convenor of the former Bharat-Bangladesh enclave exchange co-ordination committee, who has since joined the BJP."

""The ministry will recommend extension of the deadline on retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US by another 14 days,"" the source said.If accepted by the finance ministry, the revenue department would issue a notification to that effect.The government has already extended this deadline over half a dozen times since June 2018, when it decided to impose these duties in retaliation to a move by the US to impose high customs duties on certain steel and aluminium products.The issue assumes significance with the US deciding to withdraw export incentives being provided by them to Indian exporters for certain goods under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme.The withdrawal is expected to come into force from May 2.

2019-04-30,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-s-data-shows-major-winter-crops-aren-t-fetching-msp-rates/story-H0PE75CYvyO78a2eop8ceM.html,Govt's data shows major winter crops aren't fetching MSP rates,"Trade in three key winter-sown crops  mustard, lentil (masur) and gram (channa)  has got off to a poor start, selling mostly below federally mixed minimum support prices (MSPs) in key agricultural markets of the country, official data shows, highlighting the continuing agrarian crisis.Price data from Agmarknet, the government arm that tracks commodity rates in major agricultural markets, indicate that farmers income could take a hit again this year if prices dont pick up. After poor prices roiled agricultural incomes in 2016-17 and 2017-18 amid bumper harvests, farmers staged protests in several states. This prompted the government to set MSPs, an assured price, at 1.5 times the input costs  or expenses incurred by farmers towards cultivation  so that cultivators get at least 50% returns.Winter harvests began arriving in wholesale markets on April 1, which marks the beginning of the peak rabi or winter-sown marketing season. So far, prices of major crops have barely touched MSP levels, except for wheat. Wheat usually gives higher returns to farmers because it is bought by the government in large quantities at declared MSPs.In October 2018, the Centre raised the MSP of winter lentils (masur) by 5.3% to Rs. 4,475 a quintal (100 kg), while the support price for mustard, the winter oilseed, was raised by 5% to Rs. 4,200 per quintal. Wheat MSP was raised to Rs.1,840 a quintal, a 6% hike over the previous year. The support price for gram or chickpeas was raised by 5% to Rs. 4,620 per quintal.MSP is a floor price set by the Centre to help avoid distress sale and also serve as a benchmark rate, but price trends show farmers will find it tough to sell winter crops at such prices. Experts say the government isnt buying sufficient quantities at these rates (known as procurement) to mop up surpluses and pull up overall rates. This is a key reason stoking the countrys continuing agrarian distress.Mustard has so far on average sold 17% below MSP (between April 1 and 15). In most markets in Rajasthan, the largest grower of winter mustard, the commodity has failed to reach MSP levels.For instance, between April 1-15 in Rajasthans Alwar, which is categorised as a principal market for that commodity, mustard prices ranged between a low of Rs. 3,425 a quintal (on April 1) and a high of Rs. 3,650 a quintal (on April 10), against an MSP of Rs. 4,200, the data showed.Thats 16% below MSP. During this period, about 8,971 quintals were traded in Alwar, with daily arrivals of nearly 1000 quintals, which indicates Alwar is a major mustard trading hub.In Uttar Pradesh, the fourth largest producer of mustard, the commodity sold 15% below MSP between April 1 and 15. In the states Hapur agricultural market, mustard prices last week trended 13% below MSP, ranging between a high of Rs. 3,660 (April 25) and a low of Rs. 3,600 (April 29) against an MSP of Rs. 4,200.This year will end up like last year because most items are selling below MSP. I dont think wheat is doing any better in states where the governments procurement system is weak. That is why we have been demanding a law prohibiting buying of crops below MSP, said Rakesh Tikait, the national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.Farmers arent getting MSP rates for gram, another major winter crop, which on average sold 12% below the MSP rate of Rs. 4,620 between April 1 and 15. In Gujarats Dahod agricultural market, gram sold on average for Rs. 4,250 a quintal (8% below an MSP of Rs. 4,260) in this period.Gram prices continue to be depressed elsewhere. Between April 23 and April 29 in Madhya Pradeshs Dewas and Vidisha market, gram fetched on average Rs. 3,900. In Vidisha, the commodity touched MSP levels on April 27 before dipping again. Lentil prices too were lower than MSP by 9% in the last fortnight. In Madhya Pradeshs Ujjain, for instance, the average price was Rs. 3,400 against an MSP of Rs. 4,475.An official overseeing procurement of oilseeds and pulses said on condition of anonymity that since this is the beginning of the procurement season and prices would improve in the next two months. In states such as Rajasthan, which has a less robust procurement machinery compared to states such as Punjab, even wheat was trending below MSP in some markets. For instance, in Alwar, wheat sold for Rs, 1,725 between April 23 and April 27, about 6% below the MSP of Rs. 1,840. The government procured only about half of maximum allowable limit of 25% oilseeds and pulses in 2018. It must at least procure 25% to effect a change in market rates, said Abhishek Agarwal, Comtrade Ltd.First Published: Apr 30, 2019 07:45 IST"

Your karma awaits you All my love and a huge hug. Through his speech, Modi targeted Rahul without naming him and only referred to him as Naamdaar (dynast).AdvertisingAnd to counter the lies being spread about him, Modi also asked the crowd to circulate his speech on mobile phones and social media saying he was not sure whether the media will have the courage to tell his painful tale.Kurukshetra is the land of truth and that is why I want to tell the nation what their (Congress) dictionary of love actually means and what words they have in this dictionary and how they shower their love on Modi, he said.Ek Congress ke neta ne mujhe gandi naali ka keeda kaha, toh doosre ne mujhe Ganguteli bola, ek neta ne mujhe paagal kutta kaha, toh doosra neta saamne aaya aur mujhe Bhasmasur ki upadhi de di. Congress ke ek aur neta hai, desh ke videsh mantri reh chuke hain, unhone mujhe bandar kaha, inke aur ek mantri ne mujhe virus kaha, toh doosre ne Dawood Ibrahim ka darja de diya, he said.Listing more, Modi said the Congress had also referred to him as  Hitler, badtameez nalayak beta, rabies bimari se peedit bandar, chooha, lahu purash, asatya ka saudagar, Raavan, saanp, bichoo, ganda aadmi, zeher bone vaala and maut ka saudagar.This is their way of showing love. This is their dictionary of love. These are some examples, he said, adding that the Congress resorts to this when he questions their misdeeds and dynastic rule.According to Modi, he never wanted to use such language from a public stage saying it causes a bad impact on youngsters.The Prime Minister then spoke of more saying, This is Chapter no. 2. After I became the PM.Kya bola? Mujhe bataya gaya, most stupid PM. Mujhe kaha gaya, Jawanon ke khoon ka dalal hai, inke prem ki dictionary se, mere liye Gaddafi, Mussolini, Hitler, he said.He claimed Congress leaders called him maansik taur par beemar, neech aadmi and some even asked mera pita kaun the, mere dada kaun the, yeh nahi maaloom.Please never forget, they called me such names after I became the PM. Nikamma, Nashedi, Aurangzeb se bhi kroor tanashah, anpad, gawar, namak haram, nalayak beta, Tughlaq, Natwar Lal, nakara beta, sab kuch. Look at the shower of love by the naamdar or his associates.Asking people to spread his message, Modi said: Can you circulate this on social media, on mobile phones? It is important to tell the nation about this one-sided oppression that I am going throughWill you spread this short message of mine to all your relatives across the country?The PM also attacked the Congress for coining the term Hindu terrorism and said that when the Samjhauta Express blast took place near Panipat, the Congress kept innocent people behind bars in the name of Hindu terrorists, but the conspiracy of the Congress got exposed.Modi said that he wanted to assure people that this Chowkidar is determined to ensure that every drop of water meant for farmers reaches them. With this, not only Haryana but farmers of other states will also get water, he said adding that Kurukshetra got a new identity in the form of Ayush University and the International Gita festival.Modi said that after the Pulwama attack, India conducted the airstrike in Pakistan but the Opposition, including the Congress, felt hurt.AdvertisingDue to the strong action by India, Pakistan was forced to free the IAF pilot within 48 hours, the Prime Minister said, adding that people felt relieved at this action. He said that it was unfortunate that Congress leaders and their associates started praising the Pakistan Prime Minister and also demanded Noble Prize for him."

2019-05-16,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yerwada-jail-didnt-consult-centre-on-dutts-release/article27141749.ece,Yerwada jail didn’t consult Centre on Sanjay Dutt’s release,"In a startling revelation, the Yerwada central prison authorities in Pune have said the Central government was not consulted on granting remission of jail sentence to actor Sanjay Dutt, convicted in the Mumbai serial blasts case. He was sentenced to five-year imprisonment under the Arms Act, a central legislation, and was granted remission on the grounds of good conduct.Replying to questions filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by A.G. Perarivalan, a life convict in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Deputy Superintendent of the prison said there was no record of any correspondence or file noting since the case did not pertain to premature release.The official said the actors release was ordered as per the remission rules of the Maharashtra Prison Manual. There was no rule to consult either the Central or State governments for the release, he said. The relief given to Mr. Dutt was for good conduct as per the prison manual and not derived from constitutional or Cr.PC provisions.However, Perarivalans advocates argue that Mr. Dutts release should have been done only with the concurrence of the Centre since he was convicted under the Arms Act. In 2015, a five-member Constitution Bench in the Sriharan alias Murugan & others vs the Union of India case, ruled that the Centre was the appropriate authority to reduce sentence in cases of offences under the Arms Act.""Centre adopting 'pick and choose' attitude""In a handwritten note to The Hindu sent through his advocate, Perarivalan, lodged in the Puzhal central prison in Chennai, said his intention was not to bring Mr Dutt back to prison to complete his term but amend the apex court judgment in the Sriharan case as it was not being followed in letter and spirit. Though both the cases pertained to an act of terror, the Centre was adopting a pick and choose attitude when it came to granting premature release to prisoners, he said.According to S. Prabu Ramasuramanian, one of Perarivalans counsels, the State of Maharashtra sought to exercise its inherent powers in the matter of granting remission to Mr. Dutt. This would not be legally tenable since the prisoner was convicted under the Arms Act and the Union government alone was the appropriate government to grant remission or suspense of sentence as per the Supreme Court guidelines. That Mr. Dutt was released for good conduct under the provisions of the prison manual was not legally sustainable, he said.Mr. Ramasubramanian said that both his client's and Mr. Dutts cases were investigated by the CBI. While THE Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act was upheld in the case of Mr. Dutt, it was set aside in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The crucial point was that the appropriate government for granting relief for Mr. Dutt was the Union government since his sentence was under the Arms Act. In the case of Perarivalan, the appropriate government was the State of Tamil Nadu as the convict had completed his sentence awarded under the Wireless Telegraphy Act and Passport Act (both Central Acts).Peoples Union for Civil Liberties national general secretary V. Suresh said prima facie it appeared that the State of Maharashtra exercised its power in an arbitrary and non-judicious manner. The tacit concurrence of the Central government was obvious by their inaction after the release. While by no stretch are we advocating the cancellation of Mr. Dutts release, the benefit should also be extended to other prisoners who are similarly placed. The State has strategically used the prison manual knowing well that the provisions under the Constitution Cr.PC are the only two laws in India to deal with the issue of premature release, Dr. Suresh said."

2019-06-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/govt-drought-cover-record-stock-pulses-food-inflation-monsoon-fci-5782717/,Govt has drought cover: a record stock of pulses,"As India stares at the prospect of a sub-par monsoon  cumulative rainfall so far this season (June-September) has been 43 per cent below normal, on top of a 25 per cent deficiency in the pre-monsoon period (March-May)  it can take heart from two things that can significantly combat any threat of food inflation.AdvertisingThe first is the stocks of wheat and rice with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the Central pool. That, at 741.41 lakh tonnes (lt) plus another 120.08 lt of unmilled paddy (equivalent to roughly 80.45 lt of rice) as on June 1, is highest ever level for this date since 2012.It is also nearly twice the normative minimum operational-cum-strategic buffer of 411.20 lt to be maintained at the beginning of July.But what is perhaps more heartening is the large stocks of pulses held by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed). As on June 11, these, on its own account, totalled 27.46 lt  comprising 20.35 lt of chana (chickpea), 3.02 lt of urad (black gram), 1.47 lt of moong (green gram), 1.42 lt of arhar/toor (pigeon-pea) and 1.19 lt of masur (lentil).AdvertisingIn addition, the apex produce marketing cooperative was holding another 13.90 lt as buffer stock on the Centres behalf. That included 7.05 lt of arhar/toor, 2.41 lt of urad, 2.37 lt of chana, 1.43 lt of moong and 0.57 lt of masur.Never before have we had so much of pulses stocks (41 lt-plus) before the beginning of the agricultural year. This should help us comfortably tide over any domestic production shortfall in the event of a poor monsoon, said Sanjeev Kumar Chadha, managing director, Nafed.The prices of pulses went through the roof in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the first two years of the Narendra Modi governments first term, which also witnessed back-to-back droughts. Retail prices of arhar, which scaled Rs 180-200 per kg levels in October 2015, were seen to have contributed to the BJPs defeat in the Bihar Assembly polls that year.Wholesale inflation in pulses has climbed from 2.11 per cent to 18.36 per cent year-on-year between December and May this year. But most pulses, barring arhar/toor, are still trading in mandis at below their official minimum support prices (MSP).Also, unlike five years ago, government agencies have sufficient stocks to allow market intervention. The Modi government, for the first time, in October 2015, decided to create a buffer stock of pulses, initially through imports and later, by domestic procurement.From 2014-15 to 2019-20 (until June 12), aggregate procurement of pulses under the Centres price support scheme and price stabilisation fund programmes, at 87.86 lt, has been more than 12 times the 7.16 lt bought during the preceding 13 years. The bulk of this procurement has taken place after 2016-17 (see table).The stocks that we have built through our MSP-based procurement operations should also enable keeping imports within limits, Chadha said.Indias imports of pulses soared from 36.55 lt in 2013-14 to 66.09 lt in 2016-17. Subsequently, they fell to 56.08 lt in 2017-18, and to 25.30 lt in 2018-19, on the back of increased domestic production and procurement by Central agencies. For the current fiscal, the Centre has imposed quantitative restrictions, limiting annual imports to 2 lt of arhar/toor and 1.5 lt each of urad, moong and peas. Chana imports, too, now attract 60 per cent customs duty.Besides pulses, the Centre is seeking to create a 50,000-tonne buffer stock of onions, which has also recorded a spike in wholesale inflation from minus 63.83 per cent to 15.89 per cent year-on-year between December 2018 and May 2019. Out of the 50,000 tonnes target, Nafed has already procured 46,000 tonnes.On June 11, the Commerce Ministry withdrew the 10 per cent MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) subsidy on onion. The move was intended at discouraging exports of the bulb, which rose from 16.92 lt (valued at Rs 3,359.60 crore) in 2017-18 to 22.04 lt (Rs 3,521.33 crore) in 2018-19.In its first term, the Modi government was very hawkish on food inflation, invoking the Essential Commodities Act to clamp stockholding restrictions on pulses, onion, and sugar, apart from practically banning their exports while permitting unlimited duty-free imports.AdvertisingThe general expectation is that it may be more circumspect in the current term, despite wholesale inflation for food articles shooting up from minus 0.42 per cent to 6.99 per cent between December and May. One reason for this could be that in Maharashtra, which is slated to go to polls in October, the votes of sugarcane, onion and pulses growers may count just as much as those of urban consumers."

But after noticing the scheme received a lukewarm response up to June 15, from the particularly selected areas, the agriculture department extended the scheme for entire areas in the above-mentioned seven districts along with extending the date up to June 24.Now, since the area has been extended, the agriculture officials claim that their registration targets of covering 50,000 hectares under maize will be completed within the allotted period of time.The farmers who are registering under this scheme want the government to fulfill its promise and procure the production of maize, soybean and arhar on the minimum support price (MSP).Pardeep Meel, Kurukshetra deputy director agriculture (DDA) said, we were given a target of registering 7,000 hectares of land under crop diversification scheme, and till June 18, we have registered around 7,200 hectares of land and the figure will jump up till the last date.Dr Girish Nagpal, Ambala DDA said, we have a target of covering 8,000 hectares and till date 4,556 hectares have been registered under crop diversification.Surender Singh Yadav, Yamunanagar DDA said, Our target is covering 3,000 hectares as the rainfall graph of the district is higher as compared to other areas and we have a large flood-prone agricultural area along the banks of Yamuna river. Till date, 950 hectares of area under diversification is registered.Farmers leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said, transparency of any scheme is a must, every scheme is adopted first by the farmers, but its success rate depends if the government fulfills the promises made under it. There are many crops in Rabi and Kharif seasons that require less water like masur dal, mustard, chickpeas, soybean, bajra and other cereals but the difficulty is that the farmers do not get MSP on these crops and there is no guarantee of procurement by government agencies. The government must give a guarantee of the procurement and increase the MSP if they want to promote crop diversification and also invest budget in rainwater harvesting and strengthen the infrastructure to store water getting wasted in seasonal rivers."

We were fortunate enough to not only witness these 70-odd asuras, but also celebrate them at Thejus Swarna Kolu, an exhibition of dolls and idols on the theme Asuras.Seventy-two exhibits, each decked with elaborately handcrafted miniature dolls of asuras, from Ravanan, Akasuran, Bhasmasuran to several lesser-known mythical characters, are on display. This was my six-year-old grandsons idea. He said, Paati, asuras are just different, not bad. Why not exhibit them in your golu this year?. I agreed. We have also added characters like Saguni and Vaali. They werent born in the asura kulam, but had negative shades  a trait that is often attributed to asuras, says Shanthi Chandrasheker of Thejus.It took nearly two months to make the dollsand backdrops for the goluEach exhibit depicts episodes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. While the common thread that connects these characters is the warfare and the eventual end they meet, Shanthi has picked narratives that are not usually depicted through visual imagery and props.The depiction of Ravanan playing the veena made out of one of his ten heads, hands and intestines to please Shiva, warriors trying to wake the mighty Kumbakaranan, and the episode of Kakasuran, the son of Indra disguised as a crow pecking Sitas bosom, are some. I didnt want to choose the war as the backdrop for the storyboard. Every exhibit would have looked similar. So, I decided to pick sub-stories, explains Shanthi.All the dolls have been painstakingly made by Shanthi. Some dolls have been repurposed from our previous Swarna Kolu editions. But most were specifically made for this exhibition. The heads were bought separately, the body and features were weaved, painted and fixed accordingly, she says.To depict the strong and muscular physique of asuras, Shanthi has even used figurines of the Hulk, adding appropriate accessories to turn the green monster-turned-superhero into an Indian asura. I have used Chota Bheem erasers, masks that were bought in different parts of India and smaller elements that I have collected over time to create this, she shares.It took over two months for Shanthi to work on the asuras list, create a storyboard and make the figurines and backdrops. This is an attempt to bring the younger generation closer to the rich stories in our mythology, she says.Visit the Swarna Kolu at Thejus, Park View, GN Chetty Road, T Nagar.

Meet 62-year-old Jogati Manjamma, the first transwoman to be appointed as the chairperson of the Karnataka Janapada Academy by the state government.Sporting a big bindi and a bigger smile, Manjamma says, I learnt Jogati Nritya, a folk dance form, for one square meal. I never imagined that I would he heading such a prestigious academy one day.Karnataka Janapada Academy, coming under the Department of Kannada and Culture, works for protection and conservation of folklore and the welfare of artistes. The chairperson, whose term is for three years, can play a big role in helping state government frame policies in this regard.Manjamma did not have it easy. Her family couldnt come to terms with her sexuality. She was born a boy and preferred to be a girl. They abandoned her. But today, her life has turned for the better. Now, with all this recognition, my family who disowned me, tell everyone proudly that they are my siblings, she says without rancour.Hailing from Kallukambagraama in Ballari, Manjamma belongs to the Arya Vaishya community. Her family moved to Kukwaada village in Davanagere where her father worked in a sugar factory. She studied till SSLC there. Though I was a boy, when I was 16 years old, I realised I was behaving like a girl. Thats when my bad days started. I was beaten up by my parents and other family members. They took me to an astrologer and a doctor. They even stopped talking to me. I felt so helpless, she says.Manjamma then went to a nearby town and started begging to earn a living. She bought poison from that money and consumed it. I dont know what happened. I was hospitalised and not conscious for many days. My family did not take care of me. Instead, they said I was bringing a bad name to them. I still remember what my father said. He said if they had a disabled child, they would have taken care of it but not someone like me. These words wounded me. I stole some saris of my mother and ran away from home, she says.Manjamma went to Mariyammanahalli in Hospet where she learnt Chowdaki Pada (a folk art form). She earned just enough to live on. Then she shifted to Chilakanahalli where Sushilamma, one of the villagers, gave her a place to stay. There I started making idlis in the morning and used to sell 3,000 idlis. In the evening I used to take tuitions for schoolchildren and they used to pay me Rs 5 to Rs 8 per month. This was sufficient to lead my life, Manjamma says looking back.It was during this time that Manjamma met Kalavva Jogati, a Jogati Nritya performer. I learnt this dance form from her. My skin is dark. Every time we used to perform, I used to put makeup and felt I looked beautiful. Performing this folk dance itself gives a lot of satisfaction. Kalavva used to manage the shows. After her death, I took charge. Today, I have 12 Jogatis in my troupe. I have taught Jogati to thousands of people, even those from outside Karnataka, she says with pride. Manjamma later joined the woman theatre group where she started playing male roles like Bhasmasura, Keechaka and Tarakasura. Since I am well built, I usually was asked to play male roles, she says with a smile.Manjamma is happy with her life. She has adopted three children."

Pachmarhi is one such place. Located in Central India in the state of Madhya Pradesh amidst the Satpura range, this place is everything that a weary traveler seeking for some solace will desire.Geologically speaking, this region is also very important in the context of the history of the earth. One of the biggest tribes here are the Gond people who have given their name to the erstwhile super-continent of Gondwanaland which existed from the Neoproterozoic era until it went through several mutations to give the current form of continents that existed today. True to its scientific spirit, Pachmarhi has numerous cave formations which speak about a time when the earth probably was in a state of transmutation to reach on its long odyssey to its present mould.Pachmarhi is called the Queen of Satpura and not without a reason, as this cantonment town is immersed in the biosphere reserve which engulfs its environment with a richly covered green canopy thereby creating a wide range of biodiversity which seems like a paradise to travelers. Not only geologically or ecologically important, this place also has a rich history to boast which is quite evident from the resilient and brave spirit of the local people here. Once this entire region was ruled by the brave Indian Queen Rani Durgavati.The tribes here are also noted for their bravery against the British under their then ruler Raja Bhabhut Singh. Pachmarhi is also home to the Korku tribe who speaks a certain language belonging to the Austro-Asiatic family. The name Pachmarhi is believed to have been derived from the five caves, which as per the local belief was set up by the Pandavas from The Mahabharata during their long exile. Captain James Forsyth, a British officer turned this place into a sanatorium and a hill station in the 19th century. Madhya Pradesh Tourism department has done an excellent work to preserve its beauty. Let us now explore some of the best places of Pachmarhi.Reechgarh: Imagine yourself slowly hiking up towards a hill through some thick forest and a rocky pathway, where silence reigns in all its glory, suddenly you come up to this giant amphitheatre of rocks forming itself into a cave and looks eerily like a pre-historic site, Reechgarh is one of the most exciting places in Pachmarhi. As per the local belief, this cave was once inhabited by bears which are called Reech in one of the local languages and hence the name. Once you cross it, on the other side is a never ending beautiful valley which can be traversed only with a proper local guide.Dhoopgarh: Dhoopgarh is the highest point in the Satpura range and true to its name, the Sun dances here all the time on a cloudless day with all its rays in the surrounding peaks creating a myriad hue of colors enchanting to human eyes. A weary traveler can spend the entire day here in the viewing enclosure created by the tourism department while the wind blowing through its ravine will calm the spirit.Handi Khoh: One of the must visit places of Pachmarhi is the Handi Khoh gorge, not only because of its excellent foliage and eerily beautiful surrounding, this place also has a very interesting legend. As per mythology, it was a lake before where an evil serpent resided, who was finally destroyed by the fury of Lord Shiva and in the process the water too dried up and now it looks like a Handi (local term for a Pot). Interestingly, the biodiversity found here have remnants of being part of greenery which are generally found near a water body.Bada Mahadev, Gupt Mahadev and Jatashankar Caves: These three cave temples are extremely important for any devotee and visiting them should be a part of any itinerary. Bada Mahadev and Gupt Mahadev are in the same locality while Jatashankar is in a different direction. The Gupt Mahadev cave is extremely narrow and one has to walk sideways for quite some time to reach its centre. Visiting this shrine is quite an adventure. Close to it is the beautiful Bada Mahadev cave where the giant rock formation inspires awe and admiration and the place is the spot where (as per mythology) the evil Bhasmasura was tricked into killing himself by Lord Vishnu. Jatashankar shrine is also very sacred and covered in mythology. Lord Shiva supposedly concealed himself here. The place is beautiful with its amazing rock formations.Other places: Some other places of interest in and around Pachmarhi are Denwa View Point  for its amazing view of the Denwa river flowing through its green valley, Bee Falls  an adventurous waterfall where one has to get down around 400 meters to reach its core, Patalkot Valley  around 2 hrs drive from Pachmarhi, this is a beautiful viewpoint, Rajendragiri  named after our first President, this is another beautiful viewpoint, and of course the Pandava Caves which have given the place its etymology. Pachmarhi indeed is one of the most beautiful hill stations of India.Follow more stories on Facebook and TwitterFirst Published: Oct 25, 2019 13:37 IST"

Read MorePUNE: Its a double jolt for consumers as prices of pulses and foodgrains have shot up too after a steep rise in vegetables prices.The rise in prices of these commodities is also due to the rainfall, expecially the unseasonal showers in October-end and November, which caused heavy damage to kharif crops this year.Prices of kharif harvests reaching the wholesale and retail grain market in the city have gone up by 25-30% in the last 15 days to a month. The price hike is especially visible in case of bajra, soybean , urad dal (black lentil), mung (green lentil) and matki (moth bean).Bajra crop was badly damaged this season, while soyabean was almost completely wiped out. Urad and mung production was affected by around 60%, sources in the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) grain market said.Dhaval Shah, director, Jairaj Group, which deals in foodgrains in Market Yard, told TOI that moth bean, which mainly comes from Rajasthan, has also been affected due to the rainfall in that region. Prices have increased dramatically, with several commodities having gone up by 25-30%. The commodities entering the wholesale market are the harvests of this kharif season. Their production was badly affected due to rainfall in October and even November, Shah said.He said the price of bajra, which was Rs 25-27 per kilogram about two weeks ago, has now increased to Rs 32-35/kg in the wholesale market. In the case of soybean, it has gone up from Rs 40-45 to Rs 60-65, while good quality black urad price has increased from Rs 60 to Rs 90 per kg. Green mung prices have increased from Rs 65-70 to Rs 80-85, while that of moth bean has risen from the Rs 47-50 to Rs 60-65. There has also been an increase in split pigeon peas (toor Dal) wholesale prices by Rs 5 a kg as its harvest has been delayed from mid-December to December-end due to inclement weather. These prices are expected to continue or may increase further in the days to come, Shah said.Bharatlal Unecha, owner of a retail shop in Gokhalenagar said there had been a 20-25% rise in retail prices of dals and grains , which could translate into an overall increase of 30-35% by monthend as prices may rise further due to the adverse effect of unseasonal rainfall on kharif crops. The prices, however, have not affected demand as these are everyday necessities and consumers have not choice but to buy them despite the price spike, Unecha said.He said retail prices of bajra went up by Rs 6-8 per kg, black lentil by Rs 20-25 per kg, green lentil by Rs 10-15 per kg in the lsat few days. Among lentils like split pigeon peas, red lentil (masur), prices have gone up by Rs 2 to Rs 6 per kg, Unecha added.A wholesaler in Market Yard said the biggest impact had been on the prices of black, green and red lentils, besides moth bean. Black lentil has seen a steep rise in the Pune wholesale market by Rs 20-25 per kg recently. There is a shortage of these lentils. The quantitative cap on imports by the government may make the situation worse, he said"

2019-12-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/nutrient-woes-spoiling-the-party-6162522/,Nutrient woes: Spoiling the party,"Santosh Vishwakarma bought urea for Rs 400 per bag, against the government-fixed rate of Rs 266.5. (Express photo: Milind Ghatwai) Santosh Vishwakarma bought urea for Rs 400 per bag, against the government-fixed rate of Rs 266.5. (Express photo: Milind Ghatwai)Sunil Kumar learnt his lesson a few years ago, when he had not stocked up on enough urea. His wheat yield suffered as the crop did not get the desired level of nitrogen for growth at the right time. Since then, the 33-year-old farmer from Amajhir village of Sehore district and tehsil has always taken care to procure sufficient quantity of the fertiliser well in advance of the rabi sowing season. The Class 10 pass, who cultivates 10 acres, purchased 14 bags of urea (each of 45 kg) in late-September, more than a month before he was to commence planting of wheat post Diwali.Kumars decision was vindicated when he happened to go to the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (PACS) in the neighbouring village of Mogra Ram around mid-November. By then, most farmers had completed sowing operations and were desperately queuing up before the PACS store that sold Iffco (Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative) urea. I had never seen this kind of chaos before. Even the farmers who bought after standing in line for hours could manage to get only a few bags, much less than their requirement, he recalls.Farmers generally buy 2.5-3 bags of urea per acre for wheat. Out of that, the first bag is applied within 20 days of sowing, just before the first round of irrigation.Urea bags outside a fertiliser retail outlet. (Express photo: Milind Ghatwai) Urea bags outside a fertiliser retail outlet. (Express photo: Milind Ghatwai)Santosh Vishwakarma, a 12-acre farmer from Jatakheda village of Sehore  a district in Madhya Pradesh famous for production of the premium Sharbati wheat variety  was not as prescient as Kumar. He was late by a few days to turn up at the PACS in Naplakhedi, hardly 5 km from his village. The few days proved too costly. Frustrated by the long wait in the serpentine queue, which also fuelled uncertainty over whether he would get his bags of urea at the end of it, the 59-year-old decided to buy from a private trader.He charged Rs 400 per bag, way higher than the Rs 266.50 government-fixed rate I would have paid at the society. But I had no alternative. Without urea, my germinated seedlings would have wilted for lack of nutrition and there was no point giving water either, says Vishwakarma. Yes, I could have bought the fertiliser in advance, but there is always a chance of it getting spoilt by moisture. In any case, I had never faced this kind of problem, as urea was always available and you didnt have to wait so long in lines. If there is a shortage, why dont they just ration the urea and distribute it equally among farmers? he asks, while accusing the PACS officials of favouring farmers with clout and ignoring aam kisan (ordinary cultivators) like him.Lakhan Lal, a sahayak (assistant) at the Naplakhedi PACS, says the society is rationing the nitrogenous fertiliser. The moment there is news, right or wrong, about a shortage, it creates panic. Farmers then start forming lines to buy even if the fertiliser is not required to be applied immediately. In the process, many dont get even their basic quota of fertilisers. I havent seen such long queues for urea, he adds.Last year too urea shortage had been a huge issue in Madhya Pradesh  especially around the time of the Assembly elections in late-November. The Indian Express had reported about long queues in front of fertiliser outlets in many places. This time also there are similar reports  of tempers getting frayed, police deployment at stores and even the odd instance of urea bags being looted from trucks.Plus, in the current rabi season, there is additional fertiliser demand due to surplus rains. Rainfall during the southwest monsoon season (June-September) was 61% above the normal long-term average for west Madhya Pradesh (which is the main wheat belt) and 25% excess in the eastern part of the state. West Madhya Pradesh also received 37% above-average rains in the ongoing post-monsoon season (starting October 1). With water levels in the states nine major irrigation dams at nearly 95% their full reservoir capacity and groundwater aquifers fully recharged as well, farmers have gone in for large-scale wheat planting.As per data from the Union Agriculture Ministry, the all-India acreage under wheat, at 202.54 lakh hectares (lh) on December 6, was 4.3% higher than the 194.21 lh during this time last year. The figure is even higher, by 16.1 % (from 41.08 lh to 47.70 lh), for Madhya Pradesh.At the same time, the progressive area sown under chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil) in the state has fallen from 30.78 lh and 5.14 lh to 21.98 lh and 4 lh, respectively. The latter two crops hardly require any urea, but the lack of any assured minimum support price-based government procurement means farmers prefer growing wheat  more so when there is plenty of water.Farmers usually stagger sowings and dont cultivate their entire land for lack of water. But this time, with widespread rains, they have used up most of their land and everyone has almost simultaneously planted  and that too, wheat. So, there is naturally more demand for urea, says Ghanshyam Patel, a 30-acre farmer, who has just bought six bags from the Naplakhedi PACS for the third time in the current season. In the previous two visits, he had managed to get 10 bags each.At Pipaliya Mira village of Sehore tehsil, PACS manager Prahlad Singh is trying his best to humour farmers, as they wait for another vehicle with urea to arrive. The entire material from an earlier truck carrying 560 bags just got fully sold in no time. This society, catering to six villages, had sold 198 tonnes of urea during the last rabi season. This season, with three months still to go, the society has already sold 231 tonnes.Jinne jugaad kar li, unko mil gaya (the ones with connection have got their supply), says Ismail from Gudbhela village, as he watches a truck pass by on the highway, not far from his 12-acre plot. According to him, reports about acute shortage arent entirely true because everyone has got something, but they want more. He himself has managed eight bags and is keen to have more. In many fields, the leaves have started drying up and yellowing. If we do not apply immediately, our yields will fall. We cannot afford this, when most of us practically lost our soybean crop because of heavy rains during the kharif season. Farmers are hoping to recover from wheat what they lost in soybean, sums up Ismail.The ruling Congress in Madhya Pradesh is blaming the BJP-led government at the Centre for the crisis. Chief Minister Kamal Nath claims his government sought 18 lakh tonnes (lt) of urea for the state in the current rabi season. As against this, the Centre allocated 15 lt, which is lower than the supply of 15.41 lt during the last rabi season from October 1 to December 31, 2018. Reduced supply, along with higher and simultaneous demand from farmers, has led to some trouble, he admits.Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, however, attributes the shortage to the absence of planning. When our government was in power, we used to do detailed analysis of urea demand, both for kharif and rabi, and stock enough material in advance. Today, even when urea arrives, it is not distributed properly, leading to black marketing, he alleges.The Department of Fertilisers data shows total urea sales this kharif season (April-September) to have dropped to 20.67 lt, from 26.75 lt during the same period of 2018. But sales in October-November 2019 have been higher, at 16.78 lt, compared with 13.73 lt for October-November 2018. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/year-ender-will-2020-be-better-for-agriculture-6185005/,Year-ender: Will 2020 be better for agriculture?,"Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness. Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness.Onion prices, at Rs 100-plus per kg in retail and an average of Rs 6,500/quintal even in Maharashtras Lasalgaon wholesale market, have made headlines in a year that is coming to a close. But its not just onions. There are many other farm commodities whose prices have been looking up, if not soaring, of late.Take pulses: Last year, at this time, arhar (pigeon-pea) was trading at Rs 4,500 per quintal in Latur mandi of Maharashtra. Currently, it is selling at Rs 5,000. Likewise, prices of urad (black gram) in Latur have crossed Rs 7,000 per quintal, compared to Rs 4,500-4,600 a year ago, while that of moong (green gram) in Rajasthans Sumerpur market has gone up from Rs 5,200 to Rs 6,000 levels in the same period. These rates are close to or even higher than the minimum support prices (MSP) of Rs 5,800/quintal for arhar, Rs 5,700 for urad and Rs 7,050 for moong.Read | These farmers who broke the mould point the road ahead for manyThe price increase in pulses would, in fact, have been higher, but for the stocks built from government procurement. During the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 agricultural years (July-June), the Central agencies  National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium  together bought 18.78 lakh tonnes (lt), 44.96 lt and 19.50 lt of pulses, respectively. While stocks in the Central pool with Nafed amounted to nearly 42 lt at its peak in June 2019, the apex agency is still holding 20.90 lt (as on December 21), mainly comprising 16.41 lt of chana, 2.19 lt of moong, 1.99 lt of urad and 0.29 lt of masur (lentil).Those stocks have come useful this year, which saw less area being sown under kharif pulses, courtesy poor monsoon rains till about the last week of July. That, along with excess rains thereafter up to early-November, causing significant damage to the standing crop, has resulted in a decline in kharif pulses production similar to that for onions. The only reason why dal has not gone the pyaaz way is the stocks with Nafed.The absence of such a buffer is now being felt not only in onions, but perhaps also in milk.Last year, around this time, dairies in Maharashtra were paying farmers Rs 19-21 per litre for cow milk containing 3.5% fat and 8.5% solids-not-fat. That same milk is today being procured at Rs 29-31 a litre. In 2018-19 (April-March), India exported 45,082 tonnes of skimmed milk powder (SMP), with the Centre even extending a subsidy of Rs 50/kg to enable dairies to ship out their excess stocks. But with output set to dip in 2019-20, due to the cumulative impact of sustained low producer prices and extended rains, SMP prices have doubled to over Rs 300 per kg in the last one year.Not having created a buffer stock, when dairies were saddled with surplus powder and forced to slash procurement as well as prices paid to farmers, may prove costly soon. The winter and spring months are the flush season for milk. Animals normally produce more during this time because of better fodder and water availability, besides reduced body stress on account of lower temperatures and humidity. This year, though, the onset of flush has been delayed by the late rains, which have not allowed the fodder to grow properly and accumulate sufficient dry matter. Most dairies have recorded negative milk procurement growth so far in 2019-20. It remains to be seen how much of this can be made up for in the next few months before summer, when flush gives way to lean and dairies would need to have sufficient stock of powder for reconstituting into milk.Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness. Soyabean is quoting at Rs 4,000 per quintal in Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh), up from Rs 3,300 a year ago. Prices of maize at Davangere (Karnataka) have similarly risen from Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,900 and that of bajra from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per quintal in Chomu (Rajasthan). The current market prices are higher than the MSPs: Rs 1,760 per quintal for maize, Rs 3,710 for soyabean and Rs 2,000 for bajra.The above price recovery  even sugar seems to be turning around, thanks to a global deficit that has opened up export opportunities for Indian mills  should actually be welcome for an economy desperately looking for good news. The underlying factors here are partly structural (farmers reducing planting or investing less in yield-enhancing inputs in response to low realisations in the past few years) and partly weather-induced (early season drought followed by prolonged unseasonal rains). But to the extent these are helping bring back sentiment in produce markets, badly battered in the post-demonetisation period, there is a strong case for policymakers not to be unduly perturbed.In the days to come, there is bound to be lot of pressure for cutting duties or allowing more import of SMP and pulses. The Narendra Modi government, in its first term, was very hawkish with regard to food inflation. It would be interesting whether it will adopt the same approach in its second term as well  this has already been witnessed vis--vis onions  especially with consumer food inflation in crossing single-digits in October for the first time in almost six years.The one consolation, however, is the prospect of a bumper rabi harvest. The surplus monsoon and post-monsoon rains have recharged groundwater aquifers, apart from filling the countrys major dams close to their full reservoir capacities. That has, in turn, encouraged farmers to aggressively expand the area sown under most rabi crops.If the current price recovery trend holds and rabi production turns out good  there is room for optimism on that count  it would set the stage for a long overdue agricultural turnaround.
