2019-01-03,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/man-with-the-moves/cid/1685999,Man with the moves,"A man from the small African nation of Ivory Coast has made a big impact on his housing complex at Uniworld City in New Town. At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

These griddles are in a heavy demand in the neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as well.IIT Delhi's Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) will join hands with a Bharatpur-based foundation to provide technical assistance to the members of the Kumhar community, comprising traditional potters, for upgrading their kilns to bake more griddles with lesser quantity of mustard stubble used as fuel.About 35 households of Kumhars in Punchari produce 300 to 350 griddles of black clay each everyday in all seasons of the year, except during rains and the intense cold wave creating a frost. The earthy scent of black soil, procured mostly from the villages pond, is maintained in the griddles even after they are baked.Prahlad Prajapat, 30, a leading griddle maker in Punchari, said the demand for clay griddles had soared among the health-conscious people residing in cities, who believed that the chapatis nutrients were protected when cooked on an earthen plate. The clay griddles are supplied as far as Agra and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh and Faridabad and Gurugram in Haryana.Modified designMr. Prajapat said the clay pottery was taken up in the village both as a traditional occupation and the only livelihood option before the community. Over a period of two decades, we have understood the demand in the market. We have modified the design and thickness of griddles to suit the requirement of gas stove and heater in the cities, he said.About 25% of the clay griddles break during baking in furnaces. Bharatpur-based Lupin Foundation is working with RuTAG to find solution to the issue."

Prasad said the FSSAI recognised several oils for cooking purpose and a majority of these oils required refining. Because the oil obtained either from expellers or solvent extraction plant would contain some impurities which adversely affect the safety, flavour, odour and appearance of oil, they are required to be removed for making the oil edible and for ensuring long shelf life. He was speaking at a seminar on Edible Oils  Myths and Facts organised by Indian Consumer Federation attended by scientists, nutritionists and the industry body Solvent Extractors Association and consumers here on Tuesday. Some of the oils like groundnut oil, sesame, coconut oil, mustard oil and safflower oil, which were extracted using expelling technique could be consumed without refining. However in some cases these oils were also affected by aflatoxin during harvesting. Thus it was advisable to refine these oils before consumption.Several oils like sunflower, palm, soyabean, cottonseed and rice bran, among others, were required to be sold only as refined oils as these oils were produced by solvent extraction process and they may contain solvent residues. The refining process was done as per the guidelines issued by FSSAI and most of the nutritional components were retained during refining, he said.Former director of National Institute of Nutrition Kalpagam Polasa said as per ICMR dietary guidelines the total dietary fat intake was 30% of total energy intake per day. This 30% of the total daily energy intake should come from dietary sources of oils and fats. If an individual consumed 2,000 Kcal of energy per day, then 30% or 600 Kcal (equal to 65 grams) should come from total fat (visible plus invisible intake). So 30 g of visible oils was necessary to be consumed per day. On which cooking oil is good, she said each cooking oil had its own merits and demerits. If some oils like coconut oil have saturated fatty acids more, that could be easily metabolised, others have mono unsaturated fatty acids that help lowering LDL cholesterol. Thus a combination of oils could be selected and consumed to get required proportion of all kinds of fatty acids.

2019-01-11,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/i-am-living-my-dream-right-now-masterchef-australia-winner-sashi-cheliah/cid/1681360,I am living my dream right now: Masterchef Australia winner Sashi Cheliah,"Cooking was always a dream for Sashi Cheliah, a dream that saw him give up a job as a cop, pursue his passion and ultimately win the title of MasterChef Australia 2018. Since the win, the Indian-origin chef, born in Singapore, has become a famous face, travelling the world and showcasing his culinary skills at pop-up restaurants.Over the last few weeks, Sashi, 40, has been traversing the length and breadth of India on a private visit. Last weekend, Calcutta was Sashis third stop after Delhi and Mumbai. Over 30 minutes, t2 chatted with Sashi at Souk in Taj Bengal, on his India trip, his MasterChef Australia journey and his food dream.Priyanka Roy: Welcome to India! How has it been so far? Sashi Cheliah: I started with Delhi on December 29. I spent three days there and then four days in Mumbai. It will be two days in Calcutta and then I move on to the other parts of the country.Priyanka Roy: You must be sampling the local cuisine wherever you are travelling? Sashi Cheliah: Oh my God not sampling, I am indulging! (Laughs) Ive been to a couple of restaurants in Delhi and Mumbai and when they know theres a chef in the house, then these guys will go all out to feed you a lot! I tried out the Darbar Special Biryani in Delhi. It was a very different kind of biryani, they used a lot of cloves, and I really liked it. Mumbai is a food paradise. I went to two of the best restaurants there  Bombay Canteen and Bastian  and I really enjoyed the food. These guys are experimenting a lot with Indian cuisine and taking it to the next level. I found the food at Bastian very close to what I grew up eating  very southeast Asian. The food culture in Mumbai has picked up a lot. Delhi is still very traditional, but the variety is huge. I had vada pav in Mumbai and pani puri in Delhi. I think I must have gained three-four kilos in this last week! Food is the main reason I am in India, but I am also doing the touristy things. I am here with my wife and we visited the Taj Mahal. We have gone to a lot of forts and museums. And also done a lot of shopping in Mumbai.Priyanka Roy: What made you pick Calcutta as a pit stop? Sashi Cheliah: I am always interested in exploring different kinds of cuisines, both in terms of eating and also with an eye on how I can use them to enhance my skills as a chef. I had never been to Calcutta before but many people told me that if I was looking at exploring food destinations in India, then Calcutta had to be on my list, primarily because of the fact that the food here is very unique compared to other parts of India. I had a typical Bengali lunch today at Sonargaon (at Taj Bengal) and it blew me away. I dont think there was even one dish I didnt try. I am not very good with Bengali names (smiles), but I can tell you that two dishes particularly appealed to me. One was the mustard fish wrapped in banana leaf (Bhetki Paturi) and the other was a dish of mixed vegetables (Palong Shaaker Chorchori). I think that alone I can have with rice every day for the rest of my life! (Laughs)Priyanka Roy: Though you won the MasterChef Australia title in July last year, India watched you lift the trophy in end-December. Now that you are travelling here, are people recognising you? Sashi Cheliah: Yes, in Australia I am an old story now! (Laughs) But I have a good fan base in Australia and even now when I do pop-ups there, they come and support me. I am still enjoying the euphoria surrounding MasterChef. This India trip was planned way before MasterChef Australia. Its something my wife and I had wanted to do for a very long time and we had no idea the finale would play out in India when we would be here. I was in Mumbai when the finale was aired. I never thought that people would recognise me here, but the day before the finale I was at Oberoi Mall there and as usual I was looking for food at the food court, and I got mobbed! (Laughs) It took one person to recognise me and then it became a crowd. But it wasnt like it is for Bollywood celebrities, it was a small group (smiles), and they were very respectful of the fact that I was on a private visit. I clicked a few pictures, signed some autographs.Priyanka Roy: Before you came here, did you have any idea that MasterChef Australia is so big in India? Sashi Cheliah: Before the competition, I didnt know it was big here. When I was on the show, I started getting an idea of how big it was not only in India and Australia, but worldwide. It shows in many countries and the viewership is huge. India obviously counts as one of the major followers of MasterChef Australia.Priyanka Roy: Do you remember what was going through your mind when your name was called out as the MasterChef Australia 2018 winner? Sashi Cheliah: That moment is like a classic movie for me I can watch it over and over again and still have the emotion (smiles). I get goosebumps every time I watch it. When my name was called out, I just felt numb for a moment and then sheer joy took over. I think what worked for me was that what you saw on TV was me, I am like that every day of my life, there was no pretence. A lot of people ask me that now when I go back and watch episodes of myself, am I critical? I dont think I am; the critical ones are my kids (aged 12 and 10), they really mock me all the time. (Laughs) They are critical of my accent and my English is not that polished; they feel they speak much better English than I do. They now rewatch MasterChef and tell me, Papa, you could have said this better, you should have spoken like this. I am like, What to do? Its totally unscripted. But they are also incredibly proud of me. The boys are very close to me and they kept me motivated throughout MasterChef. On the finale day, my wife, kids and mum were on the show and that was my biggest strength. While I was cooking the final dish, I kept telling myself, My kids are here. I am a role model for them and I shouldnt falter at this stage. That helped me pull through.Sashi with his sons aged 10 and 12 B. HalderPriyanka Roy: Do they have an interest in cooking? Sashi Cheliah: Oh, both of them cook very well. My younger one has a thing for savouries and the elder one makes some really good pastries. When I was in law enforcement, one wanted to be a police officer and the other an engineer. Now my whole career has changed and their interest has also moved towards food. I am supportive of whatever they want to do in life.Sashi with the MasterChef Australia trophyPriyanka Roy: What would you count as your top three moments on MasterChef Australia? Sashi Cheliah: The first would be the one when I got my apron for the first time after I was selected in the auditions. Then I would pick the moment when Gordon (Ramsay) walked into the kitchen; I loved working with him. And then was the history-making moment when I got my second Immunity Pin (a lifeline of sorts that the recipient can use at any time during the competition to save themselves from elimination).Priyanka Roy: Have you made friends for life on MasterChef Australia? Sashi Cheliah: For sure! MasterChef is like a family. On the show, we were constantly helping each other, giving advice. We would constantly sample each others cooking, critique them, and that is how a lot of us would improve. We really worked together as a team. We would shoot Monday to Friday and weekends would generally be off. On weekends, we would practise a lot, do a lot of reading on food. The kitchen wouldnt be available to us throughout the day and so we would cook in slots. We would share recipes and ideas. I am in touch with Ben (Borsht), Jess (Liemantara), Khanh (Ong), Reece (Highnell), Loki (Madireddi). All the three judges (Gary Mehigan, George Calombaris and Matt Preston) were a huge support. I would constantly be tapping on their shoulders and asking for tips and advice. The knowledge they have is huge. All three of them would point out mistakes, give advice, tell us how to improve. I really enjoyed that bit because its free advice from the best in the business! (Laughs)Priyanka Roy: What was it like having Saransh Goila and his famous Butter Chicken on the show this time? Sashi Cheliah: (Smiles) Everyone on MasterChef Australia knew that I wasnt the greatest fan of Butter Chicken. On the day Saransh made his Butter Chicken on the show, I wasnt competing, I was up in the gantry. The following day, I tried cooking his recipe at home and I must tell you its the best Butter Chicken in the world! Its so, so good! He has taken Butter Chicken to the next level. And Ive not seen anyone make Rumaali bread like him with bananas in it and so moist. Its so soft that even if you leave it out for hours, it wont get dry.Priyanka Roy: Whats the status of the restaurant you plan to set up? Sashi Cheliah: I have already started a company called MRS Gaja. Gaja by Sashi is a pop-up restaurant under that company that has successfully been going on for the last four months; weve had pop-ups in two locations. I plan to start my restaurant called Gaja this year. Hopefully, I will find some time after this trip to get the ball rolling. I have the concept ready, but I need to look for a location in Adelaide. I need to do some recipe tasting, some wine pairings. I am not rushing into it, but I will make sure I do it well. In the short-term, I am keeping things fluid. Since winning MasterChef, I have got a lot of offers. I am trying out whatever I like. I am just going with the flow right now and enjoying the little bit of fame Ive got! (Laughs) I am living my dream right now. A few weeks ago, I did a pop-up at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) during the Test match between India and Australia. They had an Indian Summer Festival to coincide with the Test series and mine was one of the four restaurants invited. The theme was to do Indian food with an Aussie touch.Priyanka Roy: Are you a cricket fan? Sashi Cheliah: I grew up in Singapore, so I am not crazy about cricket. I am more of a soccer guy. I regularly watch the Premier League. But when I shifted to Australia six years ago, I started taking interest in cricket. Now I understand it.With Gordon Ramsay on the showPriyanka Roy: As a kid, what was the first thing you cooked? Sashi Cheliah: Barbecue. I started my cooking in school. I did watch my mum and aunts cook at home, but I wasnt allowed to touch anything. In school, it was different. I was allowed to experiment and whenever we had school picnics, you would find me doing the chicken, the lamb. The interesting story is that I met my wife during one such barbecue (smiles).Priyanka Roy: Was it the cooking that impressed her? Sashi Cheliah: Oh yes, my barbecue skills worked for me! (Laughs)Priyanka Roy: Growing up, who were your food idols? Sashi Cheliah: In the 80s, there was a chef called Yan on a TV show called Yan Can Cook. He was my childhood favourite. The way he presented the show, the way he mashed garlic with his chopper was very dramatic and entertaining. He made it look so simple. Then later, it was Jamie Oliver. I enjoy watching him. He puts in a hundred ingredients, but makes very simple dishes, and I liked that. As I got serious about cooking, Gordon Ramsay became my idol. Thats mostly because of his attitude, he doesnt take anything lightly. Hes 100 per cent committed to what he does and I like that attribute in people."
2019-01-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/lovin-it-us-governmrnt-shutdown-white-house-donald-trump-5540223/,Lovin’ it,"The longest government shutdown in the history of the United States has finally come home to the White House, but with his customary ebullience, President Donald Trump has turned a public relations disaster to advantage, making headlines from Ireland to Australia. He had invited the college football national champions Clemson Tigers home for a chow-down, when it was discovered that the worlds most powerful kitchen was closed for lack of funds. No problem. Trump, long-time supporter of McDonalds and Burger King, ordered in hundreds of burgers and a tidal wave of fries.AdvertisingRoughly speaking, it was the equivalent of Ram Nath Kovind inviting a cricket team home and serving chhole bhature, but Trump pulled it off. He said that he was serving the college kids favourite food, and all of it was guaranteed American. No Chinese stir-fry hanky-panky in here, and not a blini in sight either. The meal was served at a candle-lit table littered with mustard servings. Thats another achievement, a sign that NATO should not misunderestimate Trump (pardon the Bushism), even if he made a hash of their dinner meet earlier this year over the trivial issue of Germany buying Russian gas. Trump is clearly the kind of tough guy that global security needs on board, since McDonalds worldwide are notoriously miserly about their mustard and require to be hammer-locked onto the counter before they will surrender a drop.But the bottomline is that the government shutdown has come home to roost, and the time when Trump could pass it off as a result of the intransigence of the Opposition is past. Even if Trump is enjoying serving his favourite food, the end is near. Now, its the kitchen staff who have been sent on leave. How long before the White House plumbers follow them into the sunset?"

Her body was recovered from a secluded area in Chainpura on Tuesday, Amber police said.A villager passing through the area alerted cops after he spotted the childs body near the bushes. A group of cops from Amber police station along with deputy commissioner of police (Jaipur North) reached the area and cordoned it off for investigation DCP Vikas Sharma told TOI that prima facie the investigation indicated that the child was raped before she was murdered.She must have been strangulated, say policeJaipur: Her parents are migrant workers; they said their daughter was missing since Monday afternoon. However, they did not inform the city police about her missing, he said.The police got to know about the incident only after her body was found dumped in a bush. They suspect she died of asphyxiation. She must have been strangulated, but we can only confirm the real cause once post-mortem report (PMR) is submitted by the doctors, Sharma said, adding that prime facie evidence indicates she was raped.Sources in Jaipur police said the particular secluded stretch between Chainpura to Jamwa Ramgarh is crowded by vagrants at night. She was abducted from her makeshift house by the accused and taken somewhere near the crime spot where she was raped. In all likelihood, she was murdered not far from bushes and dumped here in hurry, an official investigating the crime told TOI.Drifters and workers of nearby factories are under the scanner of the police. Cops swarmed the area to collect evidence while an FSL team picked up samples of her shredded clothes for the examination.The latest incident comes close on the heels of a similar heart-wrenching incident in Tonk where a five-year-old girl was raped and strangulated before she was buried in a mustard field on Sunday morning."

The 40-year-old, like some others in the village, is a new-born apiarist  and looking at a better tomorrow, having extracted over 1,000 kg of honey in the past two months.Qutubgarh was only lately adopted by the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and in November 2018, along with BJP Lok Sabha member Meenakshi Lekhi , who too has adopted the village, it organised a programme aimed at making the village the capitals honey pot . With a gift of 100 bee-boxes , KVIC hoped the farmers would have an additional income.No one, however, quite foresaw another huge benefit of the honey chase. As Umed Singh Rana, a 79-year-old farmer on whose land most of the hives are sited, marvels, I have been farming for decades now, but never have I seen mustard of such high quality at this time of the year. By the time it ripens in March, the crop yield should be 30-40% bigger and of very good quality too. We have noticed the flowers are bigger, and this has happened only after the bees were introduced.The old farmers son, Dinesh, is already an expert now having received training in handling bees in November last year. He has quickly learnt that bees fly in a radius of 2-3 km, extracting nectar and come back to their hives, each of which is home to around 10,000 bees. Ive suffered 60 stings since I started, he grins. Initially, we were hesitant and nervous about the bees, but now we can tell exactly what needs to be done in each box and what each colony requires.The initial 100 boxes have increased to 125 because the bees have been reproducing with alacrity in each box. Dinesh explains that when a box is full, hundreds of the buzzing insects are either swarmed to a new box or a shallow super is added to create a new floor in the box. Each hives produces a full yield every 15 days, and apiarists start keeping any eye on the boxes from day 12 of the cycle.When the bees have sealed the honey in the waxy lattice in the box, the bees are gently smoked away. Each frame of honeycomb is put in a centrifuge machine, which produces a grainy, whitish substance not unlike buffalo ghee in appearance. The villages call this cream honey. It tastes wonderful, but has a short shelf life. So we process it to get the more familiar amber liquid, which last longer in the bottles, explains Dinesh.The villagers were initially too sceptical to come on board. But the honey and the crop yield have enthused many. The economic advantages are clear to see, remarks Chand Singh from Mungeshpur village. Youngsters now want to start gathering honey, and the demand for bee-boxes is increasing by the day.Padam Singh Tomar, another Qutubgarh local, is happy that the fresh honey is finding takers, mostly in nearby villages. Since November, the village has produced two yields of over 500 kg each. Vinai Kumar Saxena, chairman, KVIC, points out, Honey derived from different flowers has a distinct and unique quality. This particular honey is produced solely from mustard nectar, but the locals will also try their hand at other varieties. With the mustard season coming to an end, the hives will, therefore, soon shift to another location, where the accent will be eucalyptus.While the local apiarists contemplate marketing their honey in a more professional manner, KVIC actually plans to buy directly from them. Each farmer can earn an additional Rs 50,000 from one box every year from the honey alone, says Saxena. We will pay them Rs 300 per kilo and process it before sending it out into the market.Saxena adds, In the next stage of their training, we will teach the villagers how to extract bee venom. This can sell for over Rs 1 crore per kg and is used abroad to create a medicine for cancer. Another source of money will be the beeswax produced in the hives, for which there is a big demand in the cosmetics industry. Bee pollen is also consumed as a supplement, while items such as honey soaps, shampoos and moisturizers, honey vinegar and apple honey cider can be produced too. Yes, Rana could well sing about not worrying, only bee-ing happy."

He pointed out that the UPA government had failed to implement the Swaminathan committee report on farmers and the NDA government had also ignored it. And farmers are committing suicides due to bad agriculture policies, he added. Besides implementing the recommendation on MSP, the government will also discuss other suggestions in the conference, the minister said.According to an estimate, around 30,000 farmers live in Delhi, mostly in its rural pockets. In December, the government had formed an expert committee to draft an agricultural policy and suggest measures for farmers welfare.An important issue before the committee was to suggest a separate minimum support prices (MSP)  50% more than the weighted cost of production  taking into consideration the Swaminathan report. During recent meetings, it was felt that the cost of production should be calculated keeping in view the scenario in Delhi like increased wages of labour, and cost of inputs and allied components in the local market.A committee of officers was then asked to calculate the costs of cultivation of wheat, paddy and mustard in Delhi. It is in the process of calculating the average cost of production and its report will also be taken up in the conference.The conference has been convened to arrive at a reasonable weighted cost of production and suggest a separate MSP for farmers of Delhi, said an official. Officers of the agricultural department of Odisha and Telengana have been invited."

This year, the challenge was on the theme Into Orbit. LegoGoa team also presented a project on growing food for space titled Andromeadow, growing microgreens in space. The project book was also presented to the director of agriculture.We were thinking in terms of nutrition for astronauts. Tambdi bhaji is abundant in Vitamin K, Vitamin C and calcium and all of these are deficient in modern-day astronauts. We tried various mediums to see which works in zero gravity and learnt that a cocopeat works best. Until now, NASA had grown vegetables that take about 60 days to grow but the microgreens that we have grown take about 10-12 days, Sai Pranav said."

The commercial stretch behind the depot metro station will be developed as an underground parking to facilitate park and ride facility for metro users.However, GNIDA is yet to decide on the total project area and parking capacity.Narendra Bhooshan, CEO, Greater Noida Authority, said at present the depot is the last metro station on this route. There are some residential sectors like Sector 34 and Jaitpur village near the station. We are planning to develop an underground parking facility at the station. We will discuss the issue with NMRC to develop this project soon, he said.GNIDA has acquired the land which is just behind the depot metro station. As of now, local people have grown mustard crops on the land. Local residents said the facility will encourage people to use metro instead of public transport.NMRC has floated tenders to hire contractors to manage surface parking facilities at 17 metro stations on Aqua Line. The surface parking will come up at sectors 101, 144, 137, 148, 81, 76, 142, 146, 143, Alpha 1, 145, 51, NSEZ, 83, 147 and Delta 1. These metro stations have been divided in to four clusters and the bidder can apply for a maximum of two clusters. The NMRC will shortlist the bidders and award contracts for management for two years. All these parking facilities will have separate areas for four-wheelers, two-wheelers and cycle users, though some element of overlap will be allowed subject to availability of space. The contractor shall also demarcate spaces equivalent to 2.5% car space and 2.5% two-wheeler space for NMRC staff free of cost."

But this time when I myself experienced the chill, I understood what she used to experience. In fact, I had come here for just three days but had to extend my trip to more than a week because of the weather. I have not experienced such cold weather in a very long time.

Around eight such mustard seed hubs are being established in different parts of the country. In Rajasthan, it was established in Ganganagar on September, 2018. The monitoring of the seed hub around the country will be done by the National Research Centre on Rapeseed-Mustard (NRCRM), Bharatpur. The director of NRCRM said, The output of mustard is more than that of soyabean and groundnut. We have monitored the seed hub recently and the crops are doing good. We are expecting to get good results, after which more such seed hubs will be established in the state.The cost of per seed hub is Rs 1.5 crore, out of which Rs 50 lakh will be spent on infrastructure like building, godown, processing plant. The seed extracted from the crops will be processed in the plant. The remaining Rs one crore will be spent on farm land necessary for production of mustard and farm labour. Only good quality variety required as per the present condition, will be made in the seed hub.At present, seed varieties RGN 298, RGM-145, NRC HB-101, CS-56, AS-56, PUSA Mustard-26, are grown in the hub.

2019-02-02,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/life-after-citizenship/article26157612.ece,Life after citizenship,"Its a Saturday morning and Jihad Hussain Obama sits quietly in his one-room school, waiting for the flag-hoisting ceremony to begin. He is one of several children, from Masaldanga village in West Bengals Cooch Behar district, whose parents had chosen to stay back in India rather than return to Bangladesh.Ramzan Ali, 40, a local schoolteacher, keeps him company along with other children, who are crammed into a small area next to a Sishu Siksha Kendra that was started in 2011 by the erstwhile enclave dwellers. Most of the children study in bigger primary schools but have assembled at this one-room school to celebrate Republic Day. The tiny space outside the room is decorated with coloured ribbons and a national flag. The school, with tin sheets for walls, is bare except for a couple of plastic chairs.Ali explains the significance of the occasion to the children. He makes them sing the national anthem and chant Vande Mataram. Obama tells everyone that he is nine years old. But many in this erstwhile Bangladeshi enclave, now a part of India, know that he is a few months shy of nine.The residents of Masaldanga, located about 26 km from Dinhata town, have no trouble in recalling the last few days of March 2010, the time when Obamas mother Asama Bibi, nearly lost her baby (Osama). Masaldanga was a Bangladeshi enclave in those days, and Asama Bibi, then in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was not only denied medical attention at the Dinhata Sub-divsional Hospital in Cooch Behar but also threatened with arrest for seeking services at a state-run health facility despite being a Bangladeshi. It was only after vociferous protests by the enclave dwellers that the hospital authorities yielded. Asama Bibi finally got the medical attention she needed and had a safe delivery.The exchangeMuch has changed in Masaldanga since August 2015, when the Land Boundary Agreement was implemented. Before this exchange of enclaves between India and Bangladesh, which came into effect from the midnight of July 31, 2015, there were 111 Indian enclaves in four districts of Bangladesh, and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in West Bengals Cooch Behar district.There was a population of about 34,000 people in the 111 enclaves, and when the option of moving to India was given, 922 people registered their names. These people are now living in three camps in Cooch Behar  at Dinhata, Haldibari and Mekhliganj.The 51 Bangladeshi enclaves, which were also located in Cooch Behar, became a part of India. There were 14,854 people living in these enclaves, including those of Masaldanga and Potarkuthi. But not one citizen from these enclaves has exercised the option of moving to Bangladesh. Most of them are farmers.Not too long ago, the road leading to Masaldanga was a kutcha one. It was also a site of prolonged protests by villagers demanding citizenship rights. Now it is paved, and half-a-dozen solar-powered irrigation pumps are visible in the paddy and mustard fields nearby. There are also new anganwadi centres, primary schools, and power lines that were installed recently, ensuring electric supply to most of the tin houses in the area. Along with the rest of the villages residents, Obama is now an Indian citizen.Soon after the flag-hoisting, candies are distributed to the children. Obama takes the newly paved road to a paddy field nearby where his mother is busy making small bundles of paddy saplings. Asama Bibi has paid Rs. 55,000 for a three-year lease on 1.5 bigha of land. (A bigha is a measure of land area varying locally from 1/3 to 1 acre.) She looks worried. She is concerned not just by the poor yield but also by the fact that her three children, including Obama, are yet to receive proper identity documents.The need for fake parentsBefore the exchange of enclaves, people living in the adjoining areas that were part of the Indian mainland were often presented as the parents of children from the enclaves. This helped them get admission in schools and colleges, and avail treatment in government hospitals. Sadly, even three years after getting citizenship, the people from the erstwhile enclaves are still finding it difficult to get their identity documents corrected. Says Asama Bibi, My son Obama, who is in Class III, wants to become a doctor. But in the school they are asking for his birth certificate. His older sister, Sapla, is in Class VIII. In her case, a couple from the mainland had presented themselves as her parents so that she could continue with her studies.Ali believes that the formal conferment of citizenship is yet to ease the economic and bureaucratic hardships faced by the people. Their lives have essentially remained the same, he says.Chhabir Sekh, 40, a resident of Masaldanga, had been working as a construction worker in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, for almost a decade before the exchange of enclaves took place. He received a new voter identification card after August 2015. But his sense of insecurity is such that he still carries his fake photo identification card, for which he had paid Rs. 4,000. He says, Life remains the same. There are no jobs here, so I still go to work in Noida. All that weve got are a few documents. His 17-year-old son, Ajhar, dropped out of school some years ago and now works with him in Noida.About 80 km from Masaldanga is the Haldibari Enclave Settlement Camp, home to 96 families that moved here in November 2015 from Indian enclaves located in Bangladesh. These are the families that made a conscious choice to shift to India even though they had the option of staying back where they had lived all their lives.Spread over several acres, the camp is a row of tin sheds with alpha-numeric lettering on every house. Sanjay Pandit, the Block Development Officer (BDO) of Haldibari, is the chief guest for the Republic Day ceremony here. Pandit explains the importance of Republic Day to the audience, dwelling in particular on freedom of speech. The children of the settlement, dressed in school uniforms of different colours, some in shoes and others in slippers, do a march-past in front of the BDO.Since November 2015, the only discernible change in the camp are the e-rickshaws parked outside every other house. These e-rickshaws, or totos, as they are locally called, run on chargeable batteries and are a primary source of income for the residents. More than 30 families have bought these e-rickshaws using the money they got by selling their land and property in Bangladesh. Annaprasad Ray, a class XII student, often misses his classes at the nearby Haldibari College as he has to supplement the family income by driving a toto.Ray is not the only youngster who faces such a situation. His friend, Kalyan, is a second year BA student, and neighbours, Gobind, Niranjan, Sadhan Chandra Roy and Phuleshwar, are all graduates. But all of them depend on driving totos and doing odd jobs to provide for their families.Says Sadhan Chandra Roy, who has enrolled for a Masters degree in political science, We had our schooling in Bangladesh, but the certificates are not accepted when we apply for jobs. We came to India with a lot of dreams, but our lives remain in darkness. Occasionally, the youngsters speak to their friends on the other side of the border. The conversations leave them convinced that those in Bangladesh have better opportunities.From camps to flatsThe Cooch Behar district administration has a separate enclave cell (or department) for the erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves that have become Indian territory as well as for the three settlement camps (at Haldibari, Mekhliganj and Dinhata). Every family in the camps gets 30 kg of rice, five kg of pulses, five litres of cooking oil, and one kg of salt a month. The administration is also building three residential complexes where an apartment will be given to each of these families.Rabindranath Ghosh, Minister-in-charge, North Bengal Development Department, and an MLA from Cooch Behar, is convinced that the problems of the erstwhile enclave dwellers have been resolved. He points out that the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal has passed an amendment in the State Assembly to give land rights to the people of the 51 erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves that are now a part of India. He adds that land documents have been provided to 12,560 beneficiaries.Says Ghosh, Only 30 km from Cooch Behar is Assam, where the National Register of Citizens (NRC) has left lakhs of people struggling for nationality. Here in West Bengal we have provided every assistance to the enclaves. According to him, Indias newest citizens have got everything that they were promised, and soon those living in camps will be shifted to the apartments that the government is constructing.It was on January 3, this year that Mansur Ali, 80, of Poatarkuthi, an erstwhile Bangladeshi enclave, got land documents in his name. Mansur says that for him, the day he got his land documents is as important as July 31, 2015, the day the exchange of enclaves made him an Indian citizen. He has carefully preserved a newspaper report in a local Bengali daily which has a photograph of him accepting the land papers from the Minister. Says Mansur, We have received legal ownership of our land after 82 years. My grandfather, Kalu Sheikh, had these land records in his name in 1936, and now, after so many years, we have managed to get them in our name. Mansur has been a witness to several chapters of Indias recent history, from the British Raj to Indian independence, the creation of Bangladesh, and now the exchange of enclaves. Today he is a happy man willing to overlook the mistakes that are still present in his land document.Often referred as Monsur Dhani (Rich Monsur), Mansur has generously donated more than 2 bighas of his land for an anganwadi centre and a community hall. Painted in blue and white, the official colours of the ruling Trinamool Congress government, these buildings are ready but not yet functional, owing to a controversy over staff recruitment.Mansur and other local residents have protested against the formal opening of these facilities, demanding that the jobs in these government institutions be given to their family members and not outsiders. He says, We suffered so much for so many decades while the state turned a blind eye to our plight. Now finally when our struggle has yielded something positive, how can we let outsiders grab all the jobs in the first schools and anganwadi centres to come up in our villages?Joynal Abedin of Masaldanga is a well known activist from the area. He asks: For nearly 70 years, the people of these enclaves were denied the most basic facilities that the state must offer. How can the state now suddenly treat them on a par with other citizens? Dont these 15,000-odd people [14,854 plus the 922 who came from the Indian enclaves in Bangladesh] deserve some preference or reservation for these jobs on account of the historical injustice theyve endured? He adds that the struggle for these erstwhile enclave-dwellers is hardly over, while introducing Rahman Ali, 27, another resident of Poatarkuthi, who recently managed to get the name of his father corrected in school and college certificates.Like thousands of other children in these former enclaves, Rahman had lied about his parents while getting admission in school. Instead of mentioning Naskar Ali of Poatarkuthi as his father, his records stated it to be Sahar Ali of Khatmari village. It took hundreds of letters as official correspondence and several visits to various government offices to get the records corrected. These days Rahman regularly fields desperate queries from people who want to know how he managed to achieve something that remains a Herculean task for most citizens of this erstwhile enclave.No official visits usThe Republic Day celebrations at the Dinhata settlement camp are a low-key affair. Osman Gani, 37, one of the few Muslims who chose to come to India, says that since no politician or official ever visits the camp, they decided to unfurl the national flag by themselves. The camp, located in Dinhata town, is greener than the other camps as residents have planted papaya trees and different kinds of vines and creepers.Gani laughs when asked about moving to the apartment which the State government is constructing for the 58 families in this camp. What will we do with the flats? Most of our lives were spent in Bangladesh. Then we came to the live in the camps, and now we have to leave this also?Mrinal Barman, 39, another resident of the Dinhata camp, is more agitated by the question. He asks, How can the government wash its hands of any responsibility by giving us apartments? Before coming to the camp, Barman was a resident of Dashiachara, a former Indian enclave in Bangladeshs Kurigram district, where he owned about 16 bighas of land. When he crossed over to India after July 2015, Barman, along with his family members, brought with him an irrigation pump and two goats, in the expectation that the Indian government would give him a piece of land. Though one of the goats has died since then, Barman has not lost hope.He says, This goat that is still alive is the responsibility of the Indian government as all the formalities were completed before we crossed the border. Where will this animal go if we are asked to stay in an apartment? I will file a case if the government does not provide a place for the goat.Barmans goat-based argument has many takers in the Dinhata camp. The settlement has nine cows and 20 goats, some distributed by Barman himself. The newest citizens of India will most definitely bring up the issue of shelter for their cattle as and when they are told to leave the camp.At the Mekhliganj settlement camp, about 115 km from Dinhata and the smallest of the three camps, Bipul Chandra Barman has little time to speak. His father, Binay Chandra Barman, had died on January 16, this year and he is busy with religious rituals outside his house. He says that the families in this camp are from the Hathibandha and Patgram areas of Lalmonirhat district in Bangladesh.Ripon, 21, like his brother Bipul, is also wearing a dhoti and has his head tonsured. He says that he could not apply for West Bengals Vivekananda Merit Cum Means scholarship (a scheme for meritorious and economically backward students) as his Class X certificates from Bangladesh are not being accepted in India. Here too, driving e-rickshaws seems to be the primary occupation.Jugal Roy, 47, a toto driver, is also against the idea of moving to one of the apartments being built by the State government, which is about 15 km from the camp. He says that the buildings are coming up in a remote area near a riverbed, an area prone to flooding during the monsoon, and that there is not even a bridge to ensure connectivity when the water rises.Not surprisingly, the very mention of another displacement though only to an apartment  angers the residents of Mekhliganj. Says Swapna Rani Barman, one of the camp residents, We want to stay here at this very camp. But despite several protests, the administration is insisting that we shift to its flats.She also draws attention to something unusual. This January was the first time in the past three years that these 47 families, who had left their homes in the erstwhile Indian enclaves of Bangladesh to come and live here as Indian citizens, did not hoist the national flag and observe Republic Day.Earlier officials and politicians would visit us on Republic Day. This year we heard from no one, Roy says. It appears that they do not care about us any more.For nearly 70 years, the people of these enclaves were denied the most basic facilities that the state must offer. How can the state now suddenly treat them on a par with other citizens?Joynal Abedin,Activist,Masaldanga"
2019-02-02,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/life-after-citizenship/article26157612.ece,Life after citizenship,"Its a Saturday morning and Jihad Hussain Obama sits quietly in his one-room school, waiting for the flag-hoisting ceremony to begin. He is one of several children, from Masaldanga village in West Bengals Cooch Behar district, whose parents had chosen to stay back in India rather than return to Bangladesh.Ramzan Ali, 40, a local schoolteacher, keeps him company along with other children, who are crammed into a small area next to a Sishu Siksha Kendra that was started in 2011 by the erstwhile enclave dwellers. Most of the children study in bigger primary schools but have assembled at this one-room school to celebrate Republic Day. The tiny space outside the room is decorated with coloured ribbons and a national flag. The school, with tin sheets for walls, is bare except for a couple of plastic chairs.Ali explains the significance of the occasion to the children. He makes them sing the national anthem and chant Vande Mataram. Obama tells everyone that he is nine years old. But many in this erstwhile Bangladeshi enclave, now a part of India, know that he is a few months shy of nine.The residents of Masaldanga, located about 26 km from Dinhata town, have no trouble in recalling the last few days of March 2010, the time when Obamas mother Asama Bibi, nearly lost her baby (Osama). Masaldanga was a Bangladeshi enclave in those days, and Asama Bibi, then in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was not only denied medical attention at the Dinhata Sub-divsional Hospital in Cooch Behar but also threatened with arrest for seeking services at a state-run health facility despite being a Bangladeshi. It was only after vociferous protests by the enclave dwellers that the hospital authorities yielded. Asama Bibi finally got the medical attention she needed and had a safe delivery.The exchangeMuch has changed in Masaldanga since August 2015, when the Land Boundary Agreement was implemented.

As party leaders criticized the NDA government at the Jan Aakansha rally, Congress workers danced to the tune of Bollywood song Wada tera wada.jhuta hai tera wada and played another  Kya hua tera wada  on a loop. Chants of Rahul Gandhi Zindabad rang out as the Congress president came up to the dais.Two students, Pratibha Singh and Pooja Gupta, who stay in a hostel, said it was like a dream come true for them to see Rahul in the flesh. I had seen him on television. This is the first time that I am seeing him in real, said Pratibha, a 23-year-old student of mass communication at Patna College.The crowd  which seemed to be extremely responsive to all that went on at the dais  burst into laughter when Bihar Congress in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil imitated Prime Minister Narendra Modis way of speaking and drawled Bhayio behnomitron...jumle baaz jayenge, sachhe din ayenge. He even asked the people to shout slogans loudly to welcome Rahul to the city, saying the people of Bihar used mustard oil in food and had a lot of strength. The opposition leaders also cracked jokes against the NDA, calling its leaders jumlebaaz.Rahul, too, seemed happy to work the crowd. When a plane was crossing over Gandhi Maidan, he pointed towards it and said, Narendra Modi sat on a similar plane and went to France. Anil Ambani also went, on a smaller plane. After landing in France, Modi hugged French president Francois Hollande and lobbied for Ambani.Another attraction for the crowd was Bhagalpur resident Vijay Jha, who dressed up as Mahatma Gandhi, complete with round spectacles and a staff in his hand. I am representing Gandhiji and I have come to this rally with the hope that the Mahatmas dream (for a better country) is fulfilled. I want to spread the message that instead of erecting statues, parties should use the money for the poor, Jha said.When asked about the less-than-impressive turnout on the Gandhi Maidan, and the oppositions allegation that the rally was a flop, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee working president Kaukab Quadri said, This was Congresss solo rally in 29 years. We are satisfied with the turnout. We did not force the people to come; all of them turned up on their own.Quadri further said the administration did not support the party and stopped buses from entering Patna."

Given Indias population, even the lower percentage means the number is huge. Over 11 lakh new patients are diagnosed with cancer every year in India.As lifestyle and environmental factors are believed to be factors, there seems to be a stark urban-rural divide. While the cancer rate in Mumbai is 120 per 1,00,000, it is 50 in Barshi, said Dr Rajesh Dikshit, head of Tata Memorial Hospitals Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE).It is believed that the Indian vegetarian diet along with spices such as turmeric provides better antioxidant support to cells, thereby reducing the risk of cancer.However, this is a loose theory with no scientific backup. We are hence carrying out this long-term ISHA study, he added.Incidentally, a previous study done by the hospitals doctors had shown a link between gall bladder cancer and a diet of fresh water fish and mustard oil in the areas along the Gangetic plain. The other study that CCEs doctors are excited about is the link between lung cancer and air pollution.

In another study, the hospital's doctors will start placing indigenously developed air pollution monitors at the homes of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients to establish a correlation if at all.These studies seem significant in the backdrop that genetic causes can only be attributed to 5% to 10% of all cancers while lifestyle and environment factors such as the food one eats and air one breathes reportedly play a large role in cancer causation.""There has been a change in our country's cancer epidemiology in recent years. While the incidence of breast cancer has increased, the incidence of cervical cancer is decreasing. There also are regional differences to cancer rate. It is to study such epidemiological patterns that Tata Memorial Hospital's Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE) has undertaken various studies,'' said CCE's head Dr Rajesh Dikshit.Apart from exploring the extent of diet's contribution to cancer risk, CCE's dietary study-the Indian Study for Health of Adults (ISHA)-may also provide an answer to whether the India diet that is mainly vegetarian offers better protection than a non-vegetarian against cancer. Cancer rates in the West are double or triple India's rates, said the doctor. For instance, the cancer rate in the US is 300 per 1,00,000 population, while the corresponding figure is 100 per 1,00,000 in India.""Even within India, we see a stark urban-rural divide. While the cancer rate in Mumbai is 120 per 1,00,000, it is 50 in Barshi,'' said Dr Dikshit. It is believed that the Indian vegetarian diet along with spices such as turmeric provides better antioxidant support to cells, thereby reducing the risk of cancer.However, this is a loose theory with no scientific backup. We are hence carrying out this long-term ISHA study,'' he added.Incidentally, a previous study done by the Parel-based Tata Memorial Hospital's doctors had shown a link between gall bladder cancer and a diet of fresh water fish and mustard oil in the areas along the Gangetic plain.The other study that CCE's doctors are excited about is the link between lung cancer and air pollution. CCE, which is located in Tata Hospital's Khargar campus, has teamed up with the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur to develop an air pollution monitor. We will place these monitors in the homes of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients who come to Tata Memorial Hospital for treatment,'' said Dr Dikshit. Similar monitors will be placed in nearby homes of people not affected by cancer.The idea is to look for epigenetic signatures or changes in blood/DNA caused by air pollution. We are working with University of Bristol's specialists who recently published a study on epigenetic markers among smokers,'' he added. Both the studies will take two to three years to reveal some patterns.Research in cancer is important because though India has lower cancer rates than the West, it registers a larger death rate among patients. Moreover, given India's population, even the lower percentage means the number of patients is huge. Over 11 lakh new patients are diagnosed with cancer every year in India."

The tiger was identified as the three-year-old male, son of tigress T-41 aka 'Laila'.A month after an old woman was killed by a tiger in the outskirts of RNP, another woman was mauled to death by a tiger near the park on Saturday. Munni Devi (40) was killed by the tiger at 5.30am, when she had gone to relieve herself. The victim's body was torn into three pieces.Officials had been keeping a watch on the tiger from a control room with a live feed through recently installed high-resolution optical cameras. ""These cameras can track tigers from a distance of 4km. Five trap cameras were also installed last night near the field to trace the movement,"" a forest official said.""In the afternoon, we traced the tiger in a mustard field at Bhadlav ki Jhopdi, about 1.5km from the reserve. The tiger had been hiding here after killing the woman from the neighbouring village of Padali-Kundera,"" the official added. Two darts were shot to tranquilise the tiger. The first was shot around 4.30pm. When it failed to make it unconscious, a second dart was shot at around 5.45pm. The tiger, which weighed 180kg, was then put inside a cage and a revival doze given around 7pm. After putting a radio collar, it was released in Zone 4 of the park. Increased human activity and fast shrinking forest space have led to an increase in man-animal conflict here. However, the relocation programme continues to move at a snail's pace. Man-animal-forest authority conflict continues to plague the tiger reserve as relocation of villages go down the priority ladder of the department.A forest official source said: The department cannot relocate the villagers using force. Successive governments did not take much interest as it requires extensive funds. In the past, Rs 96.5 crore was spent to relocate 966 families.The current tiger population at RNP is the highest in the parks history, and is far more than the park can handle. This results in tigers straying out into neighbouring villages. In both the recent incidents, the attacks were made by young tigers T-98 and son of T-41, who wandered out in search of territory."

Perhaps as gloomy as Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas mood when his favourite nephew died.The Sufi saint who lived between the 13th and 14th centuries helmed the Chishtiyya tariqa (order) after taking over from Fariduddin Ganj-i-Shakar. He never married, but was fond of his siblings children. One of his nephews was Taqiuddin Nuh son of his sister Zainab . He was very attached to him and was crushed when he died young.Woh itne ghamzada thay ki woh bade sanjeeda rehne lage (He was so pained that he became a grim man), said Altamash Nizami, a peerzada at the dargah, and a direct 21st generation descendant of Nizamuddin. The saints disciples were worried about him and looked for ways to cheer him up. One day, poet Amir Khusro saw a group of merry women wearing bright yellow and carrying mustard flowers close to where Humayuns Tomb stands today. They were singing and playing a dholak and going somewhere.Hazrat Amir Khusro asked them the reason for such merry-making. They said that it was Basant and they were going to the temple. Khusro then put on a yellow robe, started playing a dholak, and went to Nizamuddin singing and dancing, Nizami narrated. Accounts say Khusro dressed up like a woman, though Nizami disputes this. But it must still have been quite a spectacle, the oddity of which brought a smile on Nizamuddins lips. When Nizamuddin asked him why he was dressed that way, Khusro replied that it was to bring back the smile on his face.Journalist Meher Murshed writes in his book, Song of the Dervish: Nizamuddin Auliya: The Saint of Hope and Tolerance, that Basant is celebrated at Nizamuddins dargah every year to mark the day Khusro got the masters smile back from the depths of grief and depression.The tradition has continued for over 700 years. On Saturday too, the dargah will don a yellow look for Basant Panchami and devotees will come in their thousands wearing yellow and carrying mustard flowers to greet the patron saint of Delhi, who, in his lifetime, found happiness in a Hindu spring festival. This custom has been followed at other dargahs too, said author Rana Safvi. Dargahs are places where all are welcome and the saint becomes part of the devotees family. So, it makes perfect sense for devotees to celebrate their festivals with the Pir and the dargah to celebrate with them.Nizami shared another tale he heard from his elders: Once Hazrat Nizamuddin went to the dargah of Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki with his disciples, including Amir Khusro. On the way, they saw a farmer draw water from a well in a field and sing in Hindavi, Ram manaiyo, baarhi laiyo (please bless me, Lord Rama, with rain). Nizamuddin was pleased to hear this and told his disciples that every faith had its own way of finding god.That thought later found utterance in Amir Khusros poem: Har qaum raast raahe, din-e-wa qibla gaahe.The importance of Nizamuddins dargah in the Indian conscience can be gauged from the fact that during the turbulence of Partition, when there were fears of an impending communal attack on the dargah, the then home minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, personally visited the dargah after telling his colleagues, Let us go to the saint before we incur his displeasure. No harm came to the dargah and its people.Nizami said the Sufi saints 13th-century message of peace and amity still has meaning today. With so much polarisation happening in society, the dargah provides an alternative. It has always given space to people of all faiths and their different ideas, the peerzada said. Basant Panchami is a Hindu festival celebrated at a Muslims shrine. It is part of our Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. It unites us. There is a need to spread its message. Yeh Hindustan ki barkat bhi hai aur taqat bhi (this is Indias blessing and strength)."

After preliminary investigation, the police registered a case of murder against unidentified persons. We are investigating the case from all angles, but it is not confirmed whether the girl was sexually assaulted or not, said a police officer.According to police, the victim, a B.Com first year student at a local degree college, went missing on Tuesday evening, and the next her body was recovered in the mustard field on Wednesday.The girls brother stated in his complaint that after his fathers death, he along with his four siblings, including her teenage sister and mother, have been living in the village. The victim was their only sister and was the youngest among the siblings.She accompanied us on Tuesday afternoon to our nearby farms. At around 4.30 pm, she went to the house for lunch. But when we reached home, we did not find her there. After inquiring from neighbours about her whereabouts, we launched a massive search operation, but to no avail. On Wednesday, I was informed that a girls body was lying in a field, and when I went to the spot, I identified her as my sister, the girls brother told TOI.Ram Kishan, owner of the field where the girls body was found lying, said that the body might have been dumped in the field in the night. Some locals, who were on their way to attend the natures call near the farm, spotted the body and informed him. He then alerted the girls family members.Police said that are working on every possible angle to crack the case at the earliest. She was strangled to death by using her dupatta. Her slippers, a small steel bucket and her shawl were recovered from near her body.Whether the girl was sexually assaulted or not, will be known only after the postmortem report is received. The girls brother suspect the hand of a villager with whom he had a fight last year. We will question him, said SP (West) Sanjeev Suman."

Homes and workplaces of his associates were also surveyed.The raids started at 8:45 am at 28 different locations including 19 in Agra, three in Rajasthan, two each in Delhi and Mathura and one each in Kolkata and Lucknow.Sleuths of the IT department said that Rathores brother Dinesh Rathore, whose construction company RP Infraventure was under investigation for a Rs 1600 crore alleged road scam by UP government was detained for questioning during one of the raids.The raids were primarily conducted for bogus expenditure, unaccounted receipts, inflation of expenses and unaccounted investments with regards to Saloni Mustard Oil Company owned and run by the Rathore brothers. In Agra, its two manufacturing units based in Shamshabad, three units based in Kota, Alwar and Jodhpur were raided, said a senior officer of the IT departments investigation unit.Raids were also conducted at Rathores associates, including as Phundi Lal Sharma (real estate developer and private security agency owner) Santosh Kumar Sharma (construction company owner) and few others home and offices, as these men have allegedly made heavy unaccounted investments in various businesses owned by the Rathore brothers firm. At the time of raids, Shiv Kumar Rathore was in Lucknow and we have asked him to appear for questioning.Sleuths involved in the raid said, There were nearly 10-14 companies floated by Rathore brothers and the addresses of almost each of them have been registered as Delhis Jangpura area, even though the family resides in Agra. The Rathores also acquired a shell company, identified as Balaji WebTech Private Limited, registered in Kolkata on a ghost address. With its help, they bought land worth Rs 25 crore at only Rs 6 core for a mustard oil manufacturing unit in Rajasthan.A senior IT official of the investigation wing said, Sixteen places were searched and 12 were surveyed in order to recover a heavy amount of unaccounted assets. If the Rathore brothers believe they are clean, this is a good opportunity for them to show the world that all their businesses and money are legal. They should produce all their account books. After all doing legal business and paying taxes is not a crime."

The entire premises of the dargah, popularly known as Urdu Shariff , will turn yellow with the devout wearing yellow clothes in tune with the tradition started at Hazrat Nizamuddin dargah in new Delhi about eight centuries ago. Yellow flowers will be offered to the saint resting at the shrine.Celebrating Basant may have been a norm at various Sufi dargahs in north India, but it is rarely celebrated down in the Vindhyas. Muzaffar Ali Soofi Chisti, the custodian of Hazrat Shaikh Ji Hali dargah , revived the tradition in south India a few years ago. Incidentally, Basant was celebrated as an official festival in Hyderabad of yore  both during the Qutub Shahi and the Asaf Jahi regimes.While mustard flowers are used for decoration and offering at Hazrat Nizamuddin and other Sufi dargahs, in Hyderabad Gul-e-Dawoodi (flowers of David) are extensively used. According to city historian and INTACH Hyderabad convener P Anuradha Reddy, gardens of chrysanthemum (Gul-e-Dawoodi in Urdu and Persian) used to welcome visitors to the Qutub Shahi Hyderabad and Golconda. The tradition of using chrysanthemum for Basant has been in vogue in Hyderabad for four centuries. Though Qutub Shahis were Persian in origin and Basant was a government holiday under their rule. The king personally used to participate in the festival. The flavours of Qutub Shahi Basant can be witnessed in the celebrations at Urdu Shariff, Reddy said.Muzaffar Ali Soofi told STOI that idea behind reviving Basant Sufi festival in Hyderabad is to celebrate oneness of humanity and respect faith and festivals of all. There will be a rendition of exclusive lyrical compositions of saint-poet Hazrat Amir Khusrau. Yellow is not only the colour of Basant, it is also the hue of spirituality and symbol of Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb, which Hyderabad has always stood for, Soofi said, urging devout to bring yellow flowers and gifts wrapped in yellow paper for fellow participants. The cap and the scarf too must be yellow.Ghulam Hasan Khan, a Hindustani classical vocalist of Rampur-Sahaswan Gharana, will sing hymns during the Basant festival. Khans Gharana traces back to Miyan Tansens tradition.In Video: Hindus, Muslims celebrate Basant Panchami together at Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia dargah in Delhi"

In nearly three decades, the seat has been out of the family only once. This includes the time when the political career of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda took off in 1991, when he beat then deputy PM Devi Lal. That win brought the seat to the family after 30 years, as Bhupinders father Ranbir Singh Hooda had also been an MP from here. Bhupinder went on to repeat the performance in 1996 and 1998.However, it was not always a Congress stronghold. From the early-1970s to mid-1980s the seat was won by Jan Sangh and Janta Party. Therefore, it surprised political watchers somewhat when Bhupinders son Deepender Hooda managed to retain the seat despite the Modi wave in the 2014 election.Modi, then PM candidate of BJP, had kicked off the national campaign from Rewari to sway ex-servicemen votes. The party won seven of the 10 seats in Haryana. Om Prakash Dhankhar (now state agriculture minister) contested against Deepender but lost by a margin of 1,70,727 votes. However, within months of this defeat, BJP managed to win four out of nine assembly segments that form Rohtak parliamentary constituency. Losing direct mayoral elections in Rohtak and Jind bypoll, both to BJP, has left Deepender looking vulnerable.Rohtak Lok Sabha seat covers Rohtak, Jhajjar and part of Rewari district with a total electorate count of 12,73,118. Rohtak and Jhajjar are dominated by Jat community with most of them engaged in farming and related activities. Another major chunk of voters is of ex-servicemen and the seat would show whether the OROP brought in by the Modi government at the Centre is acceptable to them.Wheat, mustard and sugarcane are the main crops of this region and unlike neighbouring Punjab, Haryana has not seen as much agitation by farmers. Being the constituency of then CMs son, Rohtak gained a lot in form of infrastructure like roads and institutions like IIM Rohtak.BJP has done its part to get better foothold in the area. Rohtak has got multiple railway overbridge and underbridges and elevated track worth Rs 500 crore. An AIIMS is coming up in the area. Also, OPDs have already been started at the cancer centre in Jhajjars Badhsa village.To ensure enough political weightage to the area, Rohtak MLA Manish Grover and Badli MLA Dhankhar have been made ministers. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and finance minister Capt Abhimanyu also trace their roots to Rohtak district. The party has even set up its state headquarters here. This is one constituency where the Jat community has a complete sway with over 6 lakh voters. Since the formation of Haryana, only members of Jat community have been elected and major political parties have also mostly fielded Jats. The electoral also comprises 1.5-2 lakh SC voters, 1.5-2 lakh backward class voters, 45,000 Baniya voters, and 1 lakh Brahmin voters."
2019-02-10,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/feb/10/yogi-adityanath-government-stares-at-up-farmers-backlash-as-cattle-destroy-crops-1936992.html,Yogi Adityanath government stares at UP farmers' backlash as cattle destroy crops,"By IANSLUCKNOW: What could be more ironic than the fact that while distressed farmers in the state are clamouring for protection from stray cattle, a problem that has assumed menacing proportions with crops worth crores of rupees being lost due to it, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has set aside an unprecedented over Rs 600 crore for the protection and welfare of cows in the State Budget for 2019-20.It's a different matter that top government functionaries mouth sympathies for farmers as Lok Sabha elections are round the corner and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already paid a price in terms of three state governments in the recent polls for ignoring farmers' issues.With the growing trouble among farmers in Uttar Pradesh over stray cattle ruining their harvest, the spectre could result in a possible backlash in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Naturally, there is anxiety in the state's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership.Old and abandoned cattle that are being set free because they are no longer of any use, have become a terror for people as they destroy crops and fields and add to the agony of already distressed farmers.As for the government that had vowed to protect the 'gau mata' and banned slaughter houses, it appears to have given farmers a short shrift. The budget also proposes Rs 247.60 crore for maintenance and construction of gaushalas in the rural areas.Malkhan Chauhan, a small farmer in Darveshpur (Barabanki), some 55 km from here, told IANS how his 3-bigha farm land had been devastated by stray cattle. ""I spent a lot of money for seeds and fertilisers, and now the cattle menace have forced me to shell out another Rs 10,000 to fence the field to protect the crop,"" said an upset Chauhan.A frustrated Ranjeet Maurya (40) in neighbouring Kanhaipur who lost his crop to the menace criticised the Yogi Adityanath government for his troubles. ""Yogi ordered closure of slaughterhouses, now see what's happening,"" he said and added cow vigilantes and Hindu outfits should ""adopt ten cows each"". Crops of potato, wheat and mustard have been destroyed by the stray bulls and cows in his village, he said.Many cattle has also been abandoned due to growing mechanisation of farming. Rizwan Ahmad, a dairy owner in Hariharnagar, said once the cows go dry (stop giving milk) they are thrown out by farmers. ""What else do we do of them?"" he asked.Many Muslim milk sellers like Ahmad Ali, a dairy owner in Chinhat, said his community is scared. ""We hear stories about members of the community being roughed up for transporting cows,"" he said. They can neither keep a large number of animals nor abandon them, he added.That the cattle menace has taken centre-stage for many farmers can be gauged from the fact that in many parts of the state, angry farmers have locked up cattle in schools, hospitals, community health centres. Their demand: fix this menace. Their threat: face music at the hustings.The government has expedited building cattle shelters and 'gau shaalas' but the bureaucratic inertia seems to have retarded the pace. Thus the state missed the January 10 deadline set by the Chief Minister Adityanath for district magistrates to shift stray cattle to these shelters. Penal action has also been sought against cattle owners who abandon or lock them up in public properties.""The chief minister is serious about the issue. Many steps are being taken to tackle the problem"", additional chief secretary (Information) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told IANS.There are 510 registered cow shelters in the state. According to a 2012 government data, there were around two crore cows in the state. Adityanath has also called for a fresh census and allocated funds for that.Animal Husbandry Minister S.P. Singh Baghel agrees that there is a problem, but claimed ""a solution is on the way"". However, he pointed out that the number of stray cattle was also a reflection of the staggering number that was being slaughtered before the ban.""Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesman Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said the BJP government has ""misplaced priorities"" and predicted that farmers' anger ""would cost them dear"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The state government has also levied a 0.5 per cent tax Cow Protection Cess on eight government departments, including the cash-rich excise department."
2019-02-10,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/ber-the-first-taste-of-spring/cid/1684100,Ber: The first taste of spring,"Right next to the heap of bright red apples at the roadside fruit stall in north Calcutta is a green heap  equally shiny if not shinier. Up close you realise what you mistook for green apples are actually bers, kul in Bengali. There is no English equivalent really, though berry comes close.Kul appears around this time of the year and is indelibly linked with Basant Panchami or Saraswati Puja. In fact, there is a ground rule about the kul that almost every earnest student in eastern India follows, or used to. It is this: no youngster should partake of the fruit before Saraswati Puja. Defy and the wrath of the goddess will decimate your grades. Now, that is a superstition even the most radical of the lot will hesitate to break.Durbamanjaree Niyogi, who lives in Copenhagen now but she went to the School of Languages in New Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University in the late 1990s, still calls herself a Left-leaning rationalist. She says, I never could get myself to eat a kul before Saraswati Puja, although the campus had some lovely topa kul trees. In retrospect though, the superstition was possibly created to keep children from eating the unripe variety that could cause sore throat and accompanying ills, all of it impacting the all-important grades, of course.So much for the theology and the myth mills. Back to the biology of it. There are basically three types of kul  the wild, sour, brown-skinned topa makes the tastiest pickles; the sweet-sour, crunchy desi tastes best when it is yellow-skinned; and the insipid narkeli, which is part of the fruit and sweet offering to the goddess of learning. But the neo neon green kul is nothing like anything you would recognise; for one it is humongous. So huge that anyone who has ever regretted a ber being barely a mouthful will not have reason to complain again.Kul is not peculiar to India. It is found across Asia from Palestine to China. The Ziziphus jujube or Chinese jujube  the one we call desi kul  originated in China. The Ziziphus mauritiana or narkeli kul is native to the Indian subcontinent, while the topa originated in West Asia.According to a paper in the Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine, Jesus was crowned with the thorns of the Ziziphus spina-christi or our very own topa kul.While the kul can be eaten as a table fruit, it is tastier as a chaat or kul makha, which is the Bengali version. The turgid topa is burst, seasoned with salt and sugar, and flavoured with mustard oil, cilantro and chopped green chillies. The crunchy desi kul is smashed and mixed with rock salt, chilli powder, cilantro and perhaps a splash of mustard oil. Mouthwateringly delicious. The narkeli, name notwithstanding, tastes nothing like a coconut, ripe or raw. At best you could say its form resembles a diminutive coconut. As for the green-apple-sized ones, they are locally known as bao kul. About three times the size of the common narkeli, they started appearing in the market about five years ago. And now, they have virtually taken over the market.The bao, a variant of the Ziziphus mauritiana, is thought to have originated in Thailand. It, however, entered India via Bangladesh, according to Rishi Krishna De, project director of Maldas Agriculture Technology Management Agency. Says De, Cultivation started from Basirhat [North 24-Parganas]. There was a nursery called Shahnoor Nursery. The owner ran nurseries on both sides of the Indo-Bangladesh border. He was the first to offer bao kul at Rs 250 a plant. When people figured they were very high-yield crops, their cultivation took off, De explains. It seems you can earn a profit of Rs 30,000 per harvest if you grow the bao kul in a bigha [one-third of an acre] of land. To put that in context, growing paddy in a bigha of land would fetch you a profit of Rs 3,000 per harvest.The ever enterprising Indian soon learnt that the bao kul propagated well through cuttings. The other advantage being, in three years a plant starts producing bushels of fruit and does not require too much caretaking either. In fact, the ziziphus or Indian jujube is a tough plant that can survive both waterlogging and drought. It is therefore no wonder that bao kul is now grown all across the state of West Bengal, from Malda in the north to Baruipur in the south.Another factor that added to its lure is that the bush can be pruned severely with no disadvantage to the next harvest, allowing intercropping or growing of seasonal crops between the kul rows. The desi kul does not take kindly to its branches being lopped off. The spreading branches block sunlight, making it impossible to grow anything under them. But the bao can be kept a bush with annual pruning.For the urban Indian, however, the kul point, irrespective of type, is this  it is the first taste of spring. The signal of a largely mouth-puckering change of season."

The budget also proposes Rs 247.60 crore for maintenance and construction of gaushalas in the rural areas.Malkhan Chauhan, a small farmer in Darveshpur (Barabanki), some 55 km from here, told IANS how his 3-bigha farm land had been devastated by stray cattle. ""I spent a lot of money for seeds and fertilisers, and now the cattle menace have forced me to shell out another Rs 10,000 to fence the field to protect the crop,"" said an upset Chauhan.A frustrated Ranjeet Maurya (40) in neighbouring Kanhaipur who lost his crop to the menace criticised the Yogi Adityanath government for his troubles. ""Yogi ordered closure of slaughterhouses, now see what's happening,"" he said and added cow vigilantes and Hindu outfits should ""adopt ten cows each"". Crops of potato, wheat and mustard have been destroyed by the stray bulls and cows in his village, he said.Many cattle has also been abandoned due to growing mechanisation of farming. Rizwan Ahmad, a dairy owner in Hariharnagar, said once the cows go dry (stop giving milk) they are thrown out by farmers. ""What else do we do of them?"" he asked.Many Muslim milk sellers like Ahmad Ali, a dairy owner in Chinhat, said his community is scared. ""We hear stories about members of the community being roughed up for transporting cows,"" he said. They can neither keep a large number of animals nor abandon them, he added.That the cattle menace has taken centre-stage for many farmers can be gauged from the fact that in many parts of the state, angry farmers have locked up cattle in schools, hospitals, community health centres. Their demand: fix this menace. Their threat: face music at the hustings.The government has expedited building cattle shelters and 'gau shaalas' but the bureaucratic inertia seems to have retarded the pace. Thus the state missed the January 10 deadline set by the Chief Minister Adityanath for district magistrates to shift stray cattle to these shelters. Penal action has also been sought against cattle owners who abandon or lock them up in public properties.""The chief minister is serious about the issue. Many steps are being taken to tackle the problem"", additional chief secretary (Information) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told IANS.There are 510 registered cow shelters in the state. According to a 2012 government data, there were around two crore cows in the state. Adityanath has also called for a fresh census and allocated funds for that.Animal Husbandry Minister S.P. Singh Baghel agrees that there is a problem, but claimed ""a solution is on the way"". However, he pointed out that the number of stray cattle was also a reflection of the staggering number that was being slaughtered before the ban.""Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesman Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said the BJP government has ""misplaced priorities"" and predicted that farmers' anger ""would cost them dear"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The state government has also levied a 0.5 per cent tax Cow Protection Cess on eight government departments, including the cash-rich excise department."

It is likely to bring snow to the higher reaches of western Himalayas and rain in the northern plains right up to western Uttar Pradesh ""But the intensity and spread of the spell is expected to be less than the storms seen last week, which were unusually heavy and well distributed. While some areas, including Delhi-NCR, could get hailstorms, most places may just receive light rain,"" said B P Yadav, head of the IMD's regional meteorological centre here.The fresh forecast comes close on the heels of the damage caused by last week's hailstorms. Experts said places such as Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and the adjoining Dabwali area of Haryana suffered heavy damage to standing mustard crops.Elsewhere in Haryana, the damage was restricted to four-five districts in the south. These districts (Bhiwani, Rewari, Mahendragarh, Dadri and parts of Mewat) reported 5% to 10% crop loss. It affected mainly bajra and mustard, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director in the state agriculture department.Yadav said a number of factors made last weeks hailstorm activity unusual  including a confluence of winds coming from opposite directions and jet stream winds in the upper levels, which lead to strong cloud formation.The western disturbance was much stronger last time and we had winds from Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea coming, and meeting on top of the northern plains, leading to such a phenomenon. While there is an active western disturbance this time around as well, the other factors are not present this time around, said Yadav.There were reports of potato and other vegetables taking a hit in Punjab, where CM Amarinder Singh has ordered a special survey to assess crop losses due to the storm. Most of the wheat crop may have escaped damage because the plants have not yet attained much height. The moisture could, in fact, be beneficial, some experts said.Temperatures in the region had plummeted by almost eight degrees in some parts of NCR after the hailstorms, and the chill is likely to continue till Monday.While Delhis minimum temperature was recorded at 6 Celsius on Sunday, officials from the regional met department say it could rise to around 13 Celsius as the rain spell approaches. The western disturbance (WD) scheduled to hit the region this week will be the third this month. In January, seven WDs impacted north India, higher than the normal number of four to six, leading to rain and heavy snowfall across the western Himalayas. The high frequency of WDs hitting the region continues.Meanwhile Delhis air quality deteriorated to the poor category on Sunday with an overall Air Quality Index of 276  an increase from Saturdays reading of 158 (moderate). Agencies say air quality is likely to deteriorate in the next few days before it improves after a spell of rain.Air quality in Delhi is in the poor category now and the clam night situation and strong surface inversion has led to almost doubling of the pollutant concentration. The air quality can further degrade in the next three days, said SAFARs daily forecast on Sunday.In Video: Heavy rain, hailstorm lash Delhi-NCR"

It is also most affected by the recent hailstorms and gusty winds in the region. Mustard growers of the region have claimed 10-15% crop loss because of recent storm. The latest prediction of more hailstorms has set alarm bells ringing among growers.Mahesh Tomar, a Meerut-based farmer. said, I have sown mustard in six bigha land but last weeks hailstorm destroyed at least 15% as it was still in premature state. This much loss we do take into account even while sowing the same but repeated hailstorms are something we cannot afford the luxury of.Amit Balyan from Muzaffarnagar also echoes his sentiments, My crop has reached the flowering stage so the loss would be immense. Another hailstorm will hit mustard hard.According to Ashok Kumar, director, research, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology based in Meerut, The mustard crop is generally planted in October and is now in the crucial stage of pod-filling. Hailstorm at this time, when kernels are still accumulating starch and fat, can adversely impact yield.Mustard is primarily grown in Aligarh and Hathras belt. In the sugarcane belt, it is Bijnor , which has maximum number of farmers who cultivate mustard.Around 7,000 hectares of land is under mustard cultivation in Bijnor. And, these days, the MET department is quite accurate in predictions. We can only hope the loss is minimum, said Manvinder Singh, another mustard farmer."

It is our responsibility to reduce our carbon foot print and for that, handloom is the only way forward. No western nation has as rich a textile heritage as India. Why look elsewhere?Ive been emphasising on handloom clothing since the beginning of my career. Hand-spun textile is not only timeless but also gives life to our weavers. When I started doing fashion shows around the world, my aim was to get international designers to order fabrics from our weavers and it has worked. These days I focus on weaves like Gollabhama, Narayanpet , Mangalgiri and Venkatgiri. But of late, I have realised that I dont want my weaver to weave just one saree or my client to invest in just one saree. So I use 10 sarees to make one lehenga! Its win for the weaver and the outfit is unique.South Indian fashion has developed by leaps and bounds and that makes me elated. I started with Kalamkari and now its everywhere. There was a dearth of Ikat, Pochampalli and Putupaka even eight years ago. But we took double Ikat and triple Ikat and lot of Telia Rumal and presented it at international shows and there was a boom like never before. Now, Pochampalli is all over. Our styles are timeless; We only need to take time out to bring it to limelight.At the Dubai Fashion League, the collection I showcased was lapped up. It was all handloom fabrics, but the riot of colours, from mustard, orange and red to deep blue and pomegranate pink left everyone stunned. Our showstopper Sunny Leone sported a striking white ensemble made of linen-khadi blend textile from Shadnagar, Telangana. The breathability of the fabrics goes so well with the weather of Dubai. They loved it!"

Delicate pink oyster mushrooms for your butter garlic stir fries, piquant, umami capers and crunchy, micro-greens with a bite to add that sass to any dish. South India is teeming with family-run businesses and small, local producers who are growing everything  from seedless Italian lemons to blooming mushrooms in terrace flats and raising rows of baby radish greens via hydroponics. And all these growers are finding a thriving market right here in the city  not just at restaurants, but even at homes.While artisan sourdough bread, sparkling kombuchas, purple corn and gourmet cheeses have already been in circulation for a few years now, food entrepreneurs ofare always looking to make our dinner tables, a little bit more exciting. And they are all consciously staying away from mass produced and processed goods. Most of their produce are an attempt at inching towards a farm to table or farm to fork experience and we are overjoyed. What a time to be alive!Former lawyerwas always passionate about food and wanted to understand how to grow it and where it comes from. Shifting base to Bengaluru from Delhi led to her moving into an apartment with a terrace where she started growing herbs and vegetable patches. After having a son, Goenka was reluctant to go back to her day job and started looking for business options, something she could do from home. She came across a course on mushroom cultivation being taught at ICAR - Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Hesaraghatta, and enrolled herself. During the course she learnt that there were so many varieties of mushrooms beyond the usual button versions. Mushrooms are fuss-free and dont require too much space to grow; and because they grow vertically so there is no pressure on the land. They grow on agricultural waste such as compost, paddy straw and sawdust. For me, this seemed like a sustainable practice, growing something from waste into a healthy produce high in protein, says Goenka.She first started growing mushrooms on her terrace. Depending on Goenkas harvest, you can expect mushrooms such as the elm oyster, pink oyster, king oyster and shiitake. Goenka also offers dried jackfruit, amlas, organically grown Bengal black rice, fragrant Gobindo Bhog rice and nolen gur (smokey palm jaggery).Living Food Company (LFC) co-founder and CEO Akash Sajiths mother and father were both diagnosed with cancer in May 2014 and March 2018. He wondered how his non-smoking, vegetarian parents could get cancer. A deep dive into cancer research revealed that soil in India could be one of the major causes for this fatal disease because of ground water being polluted by carcinogenic substances. In Karnataka, the cropping patterns have altered over the last 30 years to move away from Ragi and other millets that grow exceedingly well in dry, arid areas. Instead, the cultivation of water-intensive crops that deplete water resources as well as nutrients in soil has increased. For example, the area under sugarcane cultivation inhas increased by five times in the last 25 years. Research has shown that sugarcane has adverse effects on the nutrition profile of soil and contributes significantly to soil degradation. This coupled with indiscriminate and unregulated use of pesticides is severely affecting the ground water and soil contamination levels. During 2016-17, Indians consumed close to 57,000 MT of chemical pesticides through food, including those that have been banned in other countries (source: Ministry of Agriculture data), says Akash.Because of soil contamination issues, no local seeds have been used. Instead non-GMO kale seeds from the US, arugula from Europe, mizuna (Japanese mustard greens) from Japan, Chinese kai lan (Chinese broccoli) and 22 kinds of micro-greens comprise their inventory. Restaurants such as the Fatty Bao, Sly Granny, Sanchez and hotels like Shangri-La and Hilton have signed up as part of the B2B format.The micro-greens and herbs are grown in climate-controlled rooms in hydroponic pods; instead of soil the seeds are grown on recycled choir mats on a base of water.Coffee plantation and eco retreat Kerehaklu is here to help with not one but seven kinds of avocado. Pranoy Thipaiahs grandfather first started Kerehaklu, primarily a coffee plantation, in 1953. A 270-acre estate that also offers four eco cabins, the plantation grows alternative crops such as avocados, Italian lemons, litchis and mulberries. According to Thipaiah (who is managing partner along with his father and brother), the avocado season is between June and October and he harvests every two weeks. The idea is to switch to a farm-to-table system as much as possible and to stop relying on imported stuff when we have excellent avocados (locally called butterfruit), oranges, and litchis of superior quality coming from Ooty, Chikmagalur and Kodaikanal, says Thipaiah. To that end, he has been supplying to Bengaluru restaurants and individuals via orders on Whatsapp and Instagram for the last 18 months or so.While an imported avocado at gourmet supermarkets can cost Rs 300 or more, Thipaiah says good local varieties are easily available at Malleswaram and Russell Market for less. Kerehaklu grows seven different kinds with origins in Guatemala and Mexico: Pinkerton, Hall, Reed, Zutano, Fuerte, Choquette and Gwen. The avocado trees were planted as shade trees, 40 years ago, by Thipaiahs grandfather to provide shade to coffee bushes. Thipaiah realised that there was a demand for avocados in Bengaluru and he could supply his farms produce. Apart from avocados, the estate also grows seedless Italian lemons, Devanahalli pomelos (local name chakkota), and limited quantities of shahtoot mulberries. The pomelos come with a thick rind and a sweet and slightly bitter-sweet pink, juicy flesh  perfect for Thai salads than juicing. He is also experimenting with oyster mushrooms, mango ginger and fresh turmeric. To get your stash, look out for the harvest information on Kerehaklus Instagram page and order (on a first come first serve basis). Thipaiah drives down the produce himself to Bengaluru and you can pick it up from him or Dunzo it. Kerehaklu also does regular pop-ups around the city. Though Bengaluru restaurants and individuals are his main clientele, he also has supplied to restaurants in Delhi and Jaipur.Though not Bengaluru-based, Tamil Nadus Ishka Farms delivers capers cured in brine, in sea salt, caperberries in brine, Tuticorin sea salt, caper salt and shade-dried moringa leaves turned into moringa powder to the city regularly. Founded by KN Suryanarayan, whose legacy business is photographic equipment and office products in Cochin, Ishka farms, run by his son Srikant Suryanarayan (managing director) and wife Fiona Arakal (director) was an attempt to branch out into something different. The family invested in buying a tract of barren land in 2012 in Niravi Pudhupatti village in Tuticorin district, Tamil Nadu. The area was drought prone and at that time there had been no monsoon for seven years, says Arakal. So we needed to zero in on a crop that would not be rain-fed and did not need a lot of water.The duo did not want to grow the usual tomatoes or gherkins which everyone else was doing at that time and wanted something that could grow with the Israeli method of drip irrigation (run water through drip lines instead of flooding land in water). In terms of creative marketplace, no one was growing capers, although in parts of India like Gujarat and Rajasthan they do grow wild and are also consumed widely. But those kinds are thorny and hard to grow and cultivate, points out Arakal. Our capers are from the same plant family but are cultivable spineless, easier to harvest, she says. Because the gastronomy choices in our country have begun to change, according to Arakal, there is a possibility for capers to become big because currently there arent even many organic certified caper farms in the world, forget India. Morocco, Yemen and Dubai can collectively account for the current caper supply to the world.Having access to local, chemical free gourmet produce does away with those expensive trips to supermarkets. So ditch those expensive imported Thai pomelos, Peru avocados and Moroccan capers and embrace what is fresh and grown locally."

Accompanied by heavy thunder and rain, the hailstorm hit the district at around 4.30 pm, catching people by surprise, and continued for half an hour.Dirak and Kakopathar areas were hit the worst, as hundreds of acres of cultivated land, including tea and mustard plantations, were extensively damaged by the storm. According to locals, the hailstones were as big as oranges and in some places accumulated up to a height of two feet. Many birds were also killed in the hailstorm.The NH-52 in Tinsukia was turned into a carpet of white, as ice deposited on the busy highway, disrupting traffic. The thick layer of ice on the road slowed movement and most drivers stopped their vehicles to avoid damage to their windscreens from the hail. Several bikers, cyclists and passerbys reportedly suffered injuries.Tinsukia deputy commissioner Oinam Saran Kumar Singh said teams have been sent to the affected areas to ascertain the damage and to provide adequate help to those in distress."

My friend Amita wrote about a harrowing experience shed had with an online order of pickles. She was lured by some mouth-watering pictures of plump veggies glistening with oil, sitting on golden paranthas, but ended up feeling foolish and short-changed. The pickles cost a bomb, but leaked oil when they arrived. The vegetables were still raw, and she was informed that she had to keep the jar out in the sun for several days.

2019-02-24,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/anurag-kashyap-on-his-journey-as-an-actor-director/cid/1685426,Anurag Kashyap on his journey as an actor-director,"Hes made several trips to Calcutta as a director, but when Anurag Kashyap came visiting the city earlier this month, it was in a different capacity  that of an actor. The man behind films like Black Friday, Gangs of Wasseypur and the recent Manmarziyaan has acted in a short called Fool for Love, written by and co-starring Tolly actress Ritabhari Chakraborty and directed by her mother Satarupa Sanyal.The 14-minute short, streaming on YouTube, has Anurag playing Ritabharis estranged husband and is produced under the banner of Royal Stag Barrel Select Large Short Films.Before the short screened to a packed house at The Park, The Telegraph sat down for a chat with Anurag  Ritabhari for company  on being an actor-director, what attracts him to the short film format and why #MeToo has a long way to go in India.Anurag, hows it been in Calcutta this time?Anurag Kashyap: My Calcutta trips are always short and are mostly always about food. This time its workRitabhari Chakraborty: What?! You had Bengali food for lunch! And he wants a Bengali thali for dinner alsoAnurag: I have a lot of school friends in Calcutta who are determined not to let me sleep tonight! For lunch, I ate luchi and kosha mangsho paturi fish and dingriRitabhari: Chingri! Chingri malaikari!Anurag: Haan! (Laughs) Prawn malaikari.Do you eat Bengali food in Mumbai or is that only reserved for Calcutta?Anurag: Ya, ya I do! Ghar pe bhi banta hai mustard fish. Otherwise, I go out. Earlier there was only Oh Calcutta! Now there is Bhojohori Manna, Calcutta Club. I keep eating Bengali food. Theres a new fake Bengali place in Bombay now; they only make good cutlets the rest of the food is terrible.Ritabhari, what made you write Fool for Love?Ritabhari: Sam Shepard (American playwright and author) died in 2017. I have always been a huge fan of his writing and I always loved his play Fool for Love. His writings are surreal but also relatable. What I have written is not inspired by anything that hes written, but is inspired by Sam Shepard the person. I have called it Fool for Love as a tribute to him. It has a lot of my emotions, but its not my story.When I was writing it, it just flowed. I happened to pitch it to a very, very nice actor who I am very fond of. He loved the script, but he fell sick and couldnt do it. The husbands part (Allan, played by Anurag) is not simple and not many actors can fit into that space. We had AKs (Anurag Kashyap) name on the list and by then, Large Short Films was on board (as producer), so his name came from them as well and also from my mother (Satarupa Sanyal) whos directed the shortAnurag: I think my name only came from Satarupa! (Laughs)Ritabhari: Nooooo!Anurag: Satarupa really loves meRitabhari: That she does! But I spoke to AK and told him I had a script and whether he would read it if I sent it across. But before I sent it, I removed my name as the writer!Anurag, did you like the script immediately?Anurag: I did. I liked the director (laughs). I didnt know who had written it, though! If she (points towards Ritabhari) had said she was the writer, I dont know (laughs)Ritabhari: See, I didnt want any judgment from the beginning and thats why I didnt send in my name.Anurag, do you like doing these occasional acting jobs?Anurag: No! I somehow dont enjoy acting; I really love making movies. I can only act if its a short commitment like this one. And Satarupa prioritised me she finished my portions first and they kept shooting afterwards.But I must tell you how tough it was for me. For the first time I was being directed by a mother and doing a making-out scene with the daughter. You have no idea what was going through my head when I was doing that scene. She was so clinical about it; the more clinical she was, the more nervous I became (laughs).But you are a director yourselfAnurag: When I am a director, I can make people do anything! (Laughs)Ritabhari: He actually told me on set that he was awkward. I was like, What?! Anyone but you! He was like, I have a daughter. I told him everyone has a daughter, a son or a mother, but you still have to shoot!Anurag: When I did Chhuri (a 2017 short), there was a scene like this with Surveen (Chawla), whos a very good friend. It took us half-an-hour to shoot it and after I was done, I told her Surveen, I havent done this! When my daughter (Aaliyah, 18) saw it, she told me Papa, I dont want to see you make out! She said that right on my face! (Laughs) She thinks I am a two-year-old.Does she know about the scene in Fool for Love?Anurag: She will know she will see it, of course (laughs sheepishly).Ritabhari: Shes far more mature than he is, by the way.Anurag: In Fool for Love, we were so good at it that we didnt need a second take (laughs). We just did it. I was like, Retake nahin hona chahiye!What was the vibe on set like?Anurag: Very good. I think Satarupa and Ritabhari have very good chemistry. It felt like I was on a professional set. This set was all about one big womens gang, except the cameraman and me.Were you intimidated?Ritabhari: No way! There is something called a ladies man and there is a man who belongs to ladies. AK is in the second category!Would you call yourselves fools for love?Anurag: Everyone is a fool for love. Whoever is not a fool for love makes the world a bad place. I have been foolishly in love all the time from my mom to my daughter to all the other people in between (smiles). I also make movies totally out of love.Ritabhari: I cant do anything that doesnt stem out of love.Anurag, what is it about the short film format thats made you make a couple of them?Anurag: That it gets over soon! (Laughs) Also, its free from the burden of box office and yet is a very expressive medium. It can be non-comprising. I keep making short films all the time. I made Lust Stories last year and I plan to make three shorts this year.When you are an actor on someone elses set, does the director in you strain to come out?Anurag: Then I am just an actor. I leave the director in me at home. I never see the monitor and I only follow directions.Ritabhari: Before this, I had never thought of AK as a co-actor. On set, he was so nice and made me feel very comfortable. There are real emotions in this short and acting is all about reacting and he gave me that comfort. We hadnt done any workshops before shoot, but we came together very well on set. It helped that both of us are completely no-drama people.Anurag: Oh God! Too much praise!Ritabhari, whats your favourite Anurag Kashyap film?Ritabhari: Dev.D! He knows that.Anurag: Dev.D was an adult film. How old were you when it released?! It released 10 years ago.Ritabhari: Okay, I was 15. But I was an adult at 10 so its okay!Anurag: Broad daylight waala crime!Have you watched Ritabharis films?Anurag: Not much. (Pauses) Wait, wait!Ritabhari: Nooooo!Anurag: I was having early dinner once at Bhojohori Manna and the TV there was playing one of her songs and I texted her.Ritabhari: It was from this film called Bawaal that I did with Arjun (Chakrabarty) as commercial as it gets! (Laughs)Anurag: But yes, I actually saw her as an actor in Fool for Love I liked her in it.Dev.D turned 10 earlier this month. What are your abiding memories from the sets of that film?Anurag: I was trying to find myself through that film. The most abiding memory would be my daughter was with me the longest on that set. She was seven at that time.Everybody has a favourite moment from Dev.D. Lekin main jab ek film se nikal jaata hoon toh poora nikal jaata hoon. When Dev.D turned 10, I think I was the last one to tweet about it!Do you get detached from every film so easily?Anurag: I get attached to the next one so fast that I get detached from the previous one automatically (smiles). I am somehow more attached to the films that dont work at all.Youve said you thrive on lows and youve had quite a few in your career. What makes you bounce back stronger every time?Anurag: I learn more from failure. I love life, I want to go out and do things, I want to fight. Something somehow always keeps me going. I am always working I never stop. The biggest strength I have  and also my biggest weakness  is that I move easily from one thing to another. I think Ive seen enough pauses in life I have waited many years initially to see my films hit the screens.Last year was very busy. I had Mukkabaaz, Sacred Games, Lust Stories, Manmarziyaan, Sacred Games Season 2 its been a rollercoaster ride, but I love it.Any recent film made by someone else that you really loved?Anurag: I want to see Gully Boy... I am dying to see Gully Boy! It looks good, feels good, everything about it smells good. I am so jealous of that film! I am so jealous of Zoya Akhtar. I text her every day saying I am jealous of her and she replies with, Ha ha ha ha! Last year, I watched a lot of films. I loved Badhaai Ho, October. I am so happy such great films are being made.How would you define Anurag Kashyap now? Are you still the angry young man whos aged a wee bit?Anurag: (Laughs) I still keep doing the same thing. I think people expect me to keep having the same impact, whereas I am in my own process. And my process varies. I am the most selfish filmmaker, I purge through my movies. I deal with my problems through making movies. I am process-oriented, not result-oriented.Have you mellowed down?Anurag: I have found peace. I can be with myself for longer periods of time now (smiles). Earlier, it was hard. Most people think I am a very dark person. I would just like to tell them that I am not my movies (laughs).But the anger still shows up on social media sometimes, right?Anurag: Thats not anger thats straight talk. I dont bullshit I say things as they are.Anurag Kashyap with Tolly actress Ritabhari Chakraborty Picture: Rashbehari DasBut the industry you work in doesnt welcome straight talkAnurag: I realised that a long time ago. I am aware of the consequences and I am not afraid of them. Honestly, I have nothing to lose. As long as I am on the side of truth, thats all that matters.You recently found yourself in the middle of a Twitter war of words over the title of your new film WomaniyaAnurag: Yes, its now called Saand Ki Aankh! (Laughs) Its about two women sharpshooters (played by Taapsee Pannu and Bhumi Pednekar). Womaniya is a word that I coined in Gangs (of Wasseypur). Somebody (Pritish Nandy Communications) took it and trademarked the title. That clearly shows an agenda, na? I have the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) but someone else is using the title for money. And on top of that, hes pretending he doesnt know whats happening. Hes done that a lot of times to other people as well.Whats it been like making Season 2 of Sacred Games?Anurag: Ive finished shooting, now the post-production is on. I have directed the Gaitonde (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui) portions like I did in the first season and Neeraj Ghaywan has directed the Sartaj (played by Saif Ali Khan) bits. Vikram (Vikramaditya Motwane) is the show-runner. Hes the God of the show. He sits there and sees what Neeraj and I have done and he gets to be the boss!Youve also stepped in to supervise the edit of Super 30, after your Phantom Films partner Vikas Bahl was accused in #MeTooAnurag: Yes I have. I just have to oversee things while the original team works on the edit of the film (starring Hrithik Roshan). Most of the work is already done.Do you think the #MeToo movement fizzled out without much impact?Anurag: It didnt become a movement like a movement should be. In some cases, it became celebrity targeting. It also became very film industry-specific. Such power equations are prevalent throughout the country. This movement became restricted to the rich and famous and those who are perceived as rich and famous. It hasnt gone beyond that. Also, every account needs to be an honest account. Some are, but some arent.There are a lot of years of conditioning that needs to be addressed. A lot of corrections need to be made. One also needs to decide if this movement is about correction or is it about punishment. On the other hand, its great because a lot of people are purging a lot of anger is coming out. People are scared, they will think twice before using the power that they have. They will be responsible. Inclusiveness will increase. But there is so much more that needs to be done.First, we have to un-condition ourselves. I still tell things to people and then I am told I am being patriarchal. And then I have to be made aware of what I said was wrong. We say a lot of things without realising. But women are also conditioned by patriarchy.#MeToo in India is mostly restricted to social media and the elite. It hasnt become a movement. Theres a lot that needs to be done on a basic level. A few years ago, I said something against the term Twitter Feminist and received a lot of backlash for it. But there were so many women who reached out to me and told me to ignore these armchair activists. But they explained to me where I was wrong and I apologised.In #MeToo, if we want to punish those accused, then it has to be done the lawful way. But no cases have been filed. Even in my case (the one involving Vikas Bahl, that led to the eventual closure of Phantom Films), the judge told me I cant be a crusader on someone elses behalf. We also have to learn to distinguish between what constitutes power play and what amounts to harassment. There needs to be discussion and debate. People need to sit across and talk. It cant be on Twitter in just 280 characters. The problem is that its driven so much by anger that everyones only looking at punishment.You just spoke about inclusiveness, but Bollywood still has a long way to go. How do you react to someone like Kangana Ranaut, who you have worked with, claiming that she constantly feels marginalised despite being so successful?Anurag: Im not in her shoes. I dont know what she faces and how she feels and I shouldnt really be commenting on that. There has been marginalisation in this industry for years, but its also changing now. Last year alone, we saw the outsiders making a dent. Kangana, in fact, was one of the first people to make a dent with Queen. It will take time. In the meantime, you have to let out what you feel I let out all the time on Twitter (laughs)."

But that's not the case with the science undergraduate students of Lucknow University as absence of flora and fauna on campus has put their practical examinations in a limbo.The unavailability of earthworms, grasshoppers and specific flowers that are dissected in practicals is making it tough for students to prepare for examination. The zoology and botany departments are finding it hard to help their first-year students as insects and flowers are hardly available soon after winter. Earlier, in the annual examination system, students were taught dissection in July and August-the rainy season- when earthworms and grasshoppers are easily available in abundance. However, in the semester system introduced from current session, the practical examinations have been scheduled in April.The teaching for practicals has now begun but the employee appointed for collecting insects is unable to find any. As a result, around 250 BSc students are finding it difficult to learn and practise dissection. ""The practical examinations which were of 50 marks earlier are now of 100 marks under semester system. Dissection has maximum marks but we don't have earthworms,"" said Preeti Shukla, a BSc student.""We use preserved worms for dissection, but there are certain practicals for which we need live worms. For taking out ovaries of earthworm, a live specimen is needed. Earthworms are not available in winter due to low temperatures,"" said zoology department faculty Prof Amita Kanaujia.""In botany, any plant of same family can be used for dissection. But the problem is that flowers are not available as the flowering season differs,"" said a faculty member. Presently, peas and mustard flowers can be studied but their flower won't be available for dissection after two months, she underlined."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.RANCHI: Hailstorm and rainfall lashed various parts of Jharkhand, including the state capital, in the last 24 hours till Wednesday evening. The Ranchi office of India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) said the outskirts of Ranchi recorded hail of about 0.5cm in diameter while parts of Ramgarh, Bokaro, Hazaribag, Dumka, Godda and Pakur are likely witness hail and thunderstorm in isolated pockets till Thursday evening.R S Sharma, scientist at IMD Ranchi, said the ongoing wet spell is the culmination of an embedded cyclonic circulation prevailing over eastern Uttar Pradesh. There is also an anti-cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, which is feeding moisture into Jharkhands atmosphere, Sharma said.The weather office predicted isolated rain and cloudy condition over north-eastern parts of Jharkhand on Thursday, especially in districts of Santhal Pargana division. The weather will be clear and dry for three or four days after Thursday. However, another system is likely to become active thereafter, Sharma added.Ranchi received around 3mm rain in the evening shower on Wednesday. IMD said at 8.2mm, Jamshedpur received the highest rainfall till 1pm on Wednesday.Meanwhile, experts at the Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke said hail, accompanied by strong winds above the speed of 40km an hour, will be detrimental for standing Rabi crops . Abdul Wadood, agriculture expert and agro-met specialist at BAU, said, It is the time for growing wheat, grams, mustard and vegetables like cauliflowers and spinach. Less intensity rainfall will benefit everything because it will enrich the soil with moisture. In Jharkhand, where the source of irrigation is scarce, such rainfall help the crops. But hail and strong winds are likely to cause mechanical injury to the standing crops.Ramesh Gholap, head of state directorate of agriculture, said they are monitoring the situation on the ground. The district drought monitoring and disaster management units have been asked to verify, calculate and report the extent of damage suffered by farmer to the state disaster management authority through deputy commissioners for compensation, he added."
2019-03-01,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/man-with-the-moves/cid/1685999,Man with the moves,"A man from the small African nation of Ivory Coast has made a big impact on his housing complex at Uniworld City in New Town. At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

In every colony, there is a shop where you get, apart from fresh meat, marinated chicken and fish. If you are lucky, you get ready-to-cook lamb, too. Some of these places are rather good, some eminently forgettable. But they do help when friends suddenly turn up for a meal. You rush to the local shop, get your chicken lollipop or tikkas, fry and grill them at home, and you have something tasty to offer your friends.Conversing with butcherNow, of course, you dont even have to go to the butchers. My local butcher is a great pal of mine, and whenever I drop by there, we talk about haleem and nihari, and where one should go for the right kind of kababs. He has an array of ready-to-cook stuff, too, but I dont usually buy those. For, I must admit, I am not greatly fond of the orangish chicken and meat pieces that you find in glass counters in most of these meat shops.But then, as I discovered recently, you can order some neat ready-to-cook stuff from online stores. For a while now I have been ordering my fish and chicken from an online outlet called Fresh to Home. A few days ago I tried out another popular online delivery outfit called Licious. And then, when two of my friends said they were coming home for dinner last week, I decided to order some ready-to-cook dishes from Licious.I asked for some prawn zafrani, Bengali-style chicken cutlets, fish tikka, and creamy Afghani chicken. The food was excellent, and the rates were really low. There was a scheme on, because of which every dish came at a discount.The prawn zafrani (10-12 pieces), for instance, is for Rs. 297, but I got it for Rs. 262; the eight pieces of chicken cutlets were for Rs. 199 but were being sold that day for Rs. 169, fish tikka for Rs. 239 (actual price Rs. 319) and Afghani chicken for Rs. 224 (otherwise for Rs. 299). I put the cutlets in the air-fryer, and within 10 minutes, we had a plate of crispy chicken chops. I dont know why the cutlets were called Bengali for they didnt much look like Bengali cutlets, which are usually oblong or rectangular. But they were hot, and went really well with kasundi  which is a sharp mustard sauce popular in Bengal. We stir-fried the prawn zafrani, and those came out well, too.The prawns were crunchy and the spicy masala on it was just right. The friends enjoyed the fish, again shallow-fried, but I think we went wrong with the Afghani chicken. We should have grilled or perhaps lightly sauted it. Instead, we put the chicken in a tomato-based sauce, which, I fear, didnt come out very well. But we live and learn.Licious has some other nice stuff, which Id like to try out: The lamb chapli kabab (Rs. 297) and habanero chicken wings (Rs. 149 for ten pieces), for instance. They also deliver quail, rabbit, and duck.As I said, I feel sorry for our local butchers. What will happen to them if we all go online? I think I shall follow the middle path  visit my butcher now and then, and order online when friends suddenly drop by. Let everyone blossom."

In a letter addressed to Mr. Singh, Mr. Anjana said the Centre should allow the purchase of 14.35 lakh metric tonnes of mustard and 8.65 lakh tonnes of gram to give remunerative prices to farmers.Mr. Anjana said the procurement targets of 5.50 lakh metric tonnes for mustard and 4.17 lakh metric tonnes for gram were insufficient and would fail to provide relief to farmers.The difference in MSP and market prices for the two crops ranged between Rs. 700 and Rs. 1,000 per quintal, he said."

Despite various Centre and state government schemes for their well-being, development is still a mirage for them.Some netas have started visiting our village now that the elections are here. They had come exactly five years ago, made promises and disappeared. Lets see what they promise this time, said Sudhira Juanga, a 55-year-old resident of Rimulighati village, 20 kilometres away from Keonjhar.The village has around 70 Juanga households and most of the residents are farmer-turned-daily-wage labourers, who have left farming due to lack of irrigation facilities. Apart from a road that passes through the village, no other facility  including clean drinking water, electricity or healthcare  has touched it. We finish our work by evening and go to sleep as we dont have an electricity connection. These days, kerosene is also not available. Snakes and poisonous insects often enter our houses in the dark, said Phulamani Juanga, a 45-year-old woman.The villagers said Juanga Development Agency (JDA)  formed for the development of the PVTG  has done precious little for them. The officers in JDA have asked me to sign some papers a couple of times in the last few years. They gave us mustard and maize seeds for cultivation but after the farming season was over. When there is no drinking water, how can we farm? wondered Basudev Juanga, a member of Odisha PVTG Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement Programme, which works in the area for the Juanga people.The negligence and apathy of the government towards the Juanga people are evident from their dilapidated houses and unhygienic conditions. Most of our children drop out of school after Class 5 as they dont get admission in the ashram schools (run by the state government for tribal students) due to shortage of seats. They work as labourers. Other Juanga villages have better facilities than us, we dont know why, said Ramesh Juanga. We want our children to study more and work in proper jobs, he added.Though there is an anganwadi centre about three kilometres away, most of the children seemed to play in the village itself. We (parents) go to the forest in the morning and the children stay at home and play. What is the point of their going to school? They will have to work after a few years anyway, said Kuni Juanga, a mother of four. She could not specify the ages of any of her children.Special officer of JDA, Biswadarshi Sahu, however, denied any neglect of the PVTG. He said, The JDA has been working in Banspal block since 1978. It has brought about tremendous change in the lives of the Juanga people. They have schools and anganwadis in all villages and boring water facility has also been made available."

People from different parts of the country are arriving to the fair for trading cattle. Horses and cattle are also being brought in huge numbers for sale in the fair.District collector Gupta offered prayers and inaugurated the fair by hoisting the flag. Balotara SDO Rohit Kumar and others were also present at the occasion. Gupta went around the fair premises and took stock of arrangements. He directed SDO and fair officer, to provide all facilities to cattle owners and shopkeepers. He also directed officials to arrange fodder and water for cattle, so that cattle raisers coming from outside the state should not face any problems. Bheem, a male buffalo that weighs 1,200kg and costs around Rs10 crore, is the centre of attraction in the fair this year. The owners of the buffalo, Jawahar lal and Arvind Jangid, said they have appointed four persons to take care of Bheem. One kg mustard oil is used to offer a massage to the buffalo twice a day. It is taken for a walk for six kms daily and twice a month, his hair is trimmed. Two veterinary doctors check and treat it from time to time and others feed, bathe and do other works for it.A horse performs for amused crowdsJangid said Bheem is five years and 10 months old, and weighs 1200kg and its height is six feet and is 14 feet long. He said that he has got an offer of Rs 10 crore for the buffalo, but his objective is not to sell the animal, but to improve the breed of buffaloes through Bheem. The daily diet of the buffalo includes: One kg ghee, 500gm butter, 200gm honey, one kg cashews and almonds, and 20 litres of milk, along with green and dry fodder, green vegetables and fruits occasionally.At Tilwara cattle fair, people from across the country have come with their cattle. Malawi breed horses have also come to attend the fair. There are 200 shops in the fair. Animal husbandry joint director and mela officer Dr Amilal Saran said, all arrangements have been made for cattle raisers in the fair. People also enjoyed the horse race in the evening.Meanwhile, under SVEEP, the district-level team representative Hitesh Moondra created voter awareness and asked people to vote on April 29."

It was Birlas efforts that led to the reconstruction of the cablestayed bridge, which had collapsed in under-construction stage in 2009. Birla also facilitated the beginning of smaller aircraft flights between Kota and Jaipur, following which the then chief minister Vasundhara Raje flagged off Kota-jaipur flights from Kota Airport in August 2017, but the flights discontinued in April 2018 after operating for a few months.Although he could not fulfil the promise of opening a separate regional passport office in Kota, but he succeeded in starting the passport making process at the chief post office in Kota, which provides respite to the local people from rushing to Jaipur for making their passports.However, the biggest failure of his government in Rajasthan came in the form of farm distress, as more than 50 farmers allegedly committing suicides in the Hadoti region during five-year tenure, which was unheard of in the past.While the BJP-led state government stopped the bonus on government purchase of wheat, the state and union governments did not buy mustard on the MSP for three years during the fiveyear tenure. Garlic farmers complained that they were paid meagre prices for their yields. Farmers growing pulses had to sell their produce on losses due to lapses in the government purchase of the crop on MSP. However, farmers were compensated for hailstorm crop damage in Kota in the year 2015.A farmer leader Dulichand Borda and secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) alleged that after the Modi governments order, Rajasthan government revoked bonus on the government purchase of wheat, while it also did not implement the Swaminathan Commissions report and waived off farm loans of farmers. Just around 8% of the garlic, which is around 7 lakh quintals out of total production of 90 quintals in Kota division, was bought under MIS scheme by government which is nothing but peanuts which did not increase market price of garlic and forced garlic farmers for suicides, he alleged.A Kota city resident Ajay Sharma said, Birlas performance as an MP is average, as he had ensured construction of cable-stayed bridge that reduced road mishaps in Kota city, but could not do enough to bring industrial investment to Kota and even a public sector unit named Instrumentation Limited closed down in current BJP regime.Another resident, Farhan Ahmad said, Promise of extension of Dakniya railway station has not been fulfilled, which lies close to the coaching zone in Kota and can prove to be useful for the large population of city inhabitants and coaching students living in new Kota.FACTIONS WITHIN PARTY A CHALLENGEThere are several BJP factions in Kota, which have augmented with the arrival of former Congress MP Ijyaraj Singh. Former BJP MLA from Kota North, Prahlad Gunjal is believed to be a staunch rival of Birla, while ex-BJP MLA from Ladpura, Bhawani Singh Rajawat had also staked his claim for the BJP ticket from Kota-Baran parliamentary constituency before the declaration of Birlas name.Birla is banking on the wave of nationalism and Modi hysteria post incidents like terror attack in Pulwama and airstrikes in Balakot in Pakistan.Lok Sabha elections 2019: Here is all you need to know about RajasthanFirst Published: Apr 03, 2019 12:24 IST"

In Delhi, its celebrated in a way that takes people back home, and a reminder that our city is a mish-mash of cultures. Since it signifies the beginning of the Telugu year, it is considered auspicious and people start new ventures on this day, says Santhi Kodeboyina, a Delhi-based IT professional and entrepreneur, who began her systems-integration company on the day in 2004.People wake up at dawn, bathe, make a rangoli at the entrance of their homes and decorate with flowers. Then theres the food. Its an important part of the festival, with Ugadi pachadi being a must in every household, says Kodeboyina.The pachadi is made of raw mango pieces, tender neem leaves/flowers, tamarind, jaggery, coconut, green chillies, and salt. It has basic flavours: sweet, sour, bitter, spice, pungent, and salt, the dish represents the diverse emotions we go through in life: joy, sorrow, fear, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear, she says.Pachadi, lemon rice and sakkarai pongal are the key offerings to the Gods, with pachadi given as prasad after the pooja. There may be non-vegetarian fare for lunch.Kodeboyina recollects how Ugadi was celebrated in her village Ramayapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Homes are thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed, we buy new clothes for, and new films released on Ugadi. She misses the sense of gaiety that was all-pervasive there, but says, We still try to recreate the magic. Heres what you can do on the day, whether you celebrate the festival or want a taste of it.Karnataka Food Centre in R.K. Puram will serve a special Ugadi thali. The food will be served on a banana leaf in a thali, says Usman Abdul Sharief, the manager. Starting with butter milk, it will include lemon rice, white rice, puri, a dry vegetable (beans), avial, rasam, sambar, kosambari, papad, pickle, curd chilly, dal vada, sweet pan, payasam (made of seviyan and sabu dana). The star of the thali is holige (puran poli), which is eaten with ghee and coconut milk. It is a sweet made of chana dal, coconut and jaggery, he says. Holige represents the local produce of this season: the end of winter and beginning of summer, adding that the coconut is for taste.(Rs. 300 lunch, 11 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.; dinner, 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.)Dakshin at Sheraton New Delhi is offering a variety of dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, in its lunch thali. Besides special starters, there are three preparations with raw mango as the main ingredient: mamadikai mudda pappu (includes lentil tempered with mustard and cumin), mamidikai annam (raw-mango-flavoured rice) and Ugadi pachadi. Raw mango is part of the seasons harvest and hence it finds a prime place in the preparations, explains Velu Murugan, the chef leading the preparations. Other items include vankai alasandala karam (brinjal and butter-eyed beans in onion tomato gravy), pala koora masala (seasonal greens), chikkudukai tomato korma (flat beans) and, aloo gadda (double beans korma) among others, all made from seasonal agricultural produce. Theres also chinta chiguru mamsam (mutton curry flavoured with tamarind leaf), natu kodi pulusu (Andhra-style country chicken), and royyala vepudu (prawns). For dessert, choose from korra biyyam paramannam (jaggery-foxtail millet pudding) and bobbattlu (steamed rice pancake with jaggery filling).(Rs. 1,650+ taxes for a vegetarian thali, Rs. 1,950+ taxes for a non-vegetarian one, lunch, 12.30 p.m. to 2.45 p.m.)Andhra Pradesh Bhavan Canteen , thronged by foodies and just those grabbling a meal, will also be celebrating. The regular thali will be given an Ugadi touch and we will include mango puliyodharai, Ugadi pachadi, poornam boore and gari (vada), says Satyanarayan Reddy, the manager. These, he said, will allow the guests to taste and enjoy special regional cuisine.(Rs. 140, lunch from 12 noon )Bagundi , the newly opened restaurant in Connaught Place will be decorated with mango and banana leaves and jasmine flowers. Besides regular Andhra cuisine, every guest will be offered Ugadi pachadi and sakkarai pongal complimentary, says Naveen Rawat, the executive chef.Tejeesh Behl, who runs an art start-up says, These celebrations are a treat for people like me, who are not from that region and dont celebrate Ugadi.

His home is two tin rooms and his family is among the 58  around 250 men, women and children  who live in a temporary camp in Dinhata, 28 km from Cooch Behar town, that was set up for people from Indian enclaves in Bangladesh when they decided to return in November 2015.AdvertisingIts been three years now, and they are yet to get the promised land.About 60 km from Dinhata, Poaturkuthi, a former Bangladeshi enclave in India, has got new roads, solar-powered tubewells and an under-construction primary school. The process of handing over Indian deeds for land has started. But jobs are still elusive, forcing the youth to fan out across India.Voting on April 11 for the first time to choose a government at the Centre, their expectations are high from both the state and central governments. This is not their first elections though  they had voted for the Assembly poll in 2016 and the Lok Sabha bypolls the same year.In Cooch Behar, TMCs Paresh Adhikari is engaged in a tough fight with the BJPs Nisith Pramanik, who joined the party after being sacked by Trinamool from the post of general secretary of its youth wing in the district. In his affidavit, he has declared 11 pending criminal cases. The Congress has pitted Pia Roy Choudhury and Left Front Gobindo Roy.The Cooch Behar seat has been with Forward Bloc since 1977. In 2014, TMCs Renuka Sinha won with 5,26,499 votes defeating Forward Blocks Dipak Kumar Roy by 87,106 votes. After Sinhas death, TMCs Partha Pratim Roy retained the seat with a huge margin of 4,13,241 against BJPs Hem Chandra Burman. Both TMC (59.03 per cent) and BJP (28.32 per cent) increased their vote share by 19.52 per cent and 11.98 per cent, respectively.Click here for more election newsIt was at midnight on July 31, 2015, that 14,856 people in 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in Indian soil were absorbed in the country following a historic land agreement. Added to this were 921 people who left their homes in Indian enclaves located in Bangladesh  they came in phases that November to three makeshift camps in Dinhata, Mekhligunj and Haldibari in Cooch Behar.During their campaign rallies in the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee claimed credit for the enclave exchange. The land deal with Bangladesh was stuck for decades. We did it, said Modi at a public rally in Cooch Behar town Sunday.I had 9.5 bigha of land in Bangladesh. We were given one month to sell. I could not sell it and therefore left my two sons Gopal and Mithun there. Here my wife and I stay with my third son and his family. Polls come and go, but there is no change in our condition. First, we were promised land, then apartments. Nothing happened so far. However, I will vote. I am waiting for the candidates to come here. Whoever helps us will get our votes, says Burman whose son works as a daily-wage labourer.Burman, like all others in the camp, hailed from the Dasiar Chora enclave in Bangladeshs Kutigram district. No one would buy our land there as they all knew we will be leaving for India. We left everything there, our home and three bigha agricultural land. We have written so many letters to everyone  from the District Magistrate to ministers. Nothing happened, says Osman Gani, who stays in the camp with his wife and two children who have been enrolled in the local government school.Residents claim that apart from their monthly ration, they get 50-55 days of work under the rural employment guarantee scheme. They say they have not been able to access other state or central schemes, such as old-age pension and a youth initiative of the state government.Each family gets free ration, including 30 kg rice, 5 kg masur dal, 5 litres of mustard oil, 5 litres of kerosene, 1 kg packet of salt and 1 kg packet of milk powder per month from the government. There are families which have eight to ten members, some are more. The ration gets over in two weeks, says Mohammed Saheb Ali, 54, who lives with his wife and three sons in the camp.Residents say they had completed the process for Voter ID and Aadhaar cards by 2016, but that discrepancies in details in the documents remain a problem.At Poaturkuthi, 60 km away, the government has provided 20 solar-powered tube wells for irrigation, some of which have gone defunct. The enclave, which has got electricity and a community centre, is one among the 51 Bangladeshi areas that were absorbed in India in August 2015.Just 5 km from the Bangladesh border, Poaturkuthi is spread across 1,200 acres, and is home to 3,037 men women and children from 479 families.There has been some development. But the handing over of our Indian land deeds are yet to be done. We are farmers and the papers are important to us to get loans or avail schemes. The process has started and we have got draft papers. Secondly, most of the youths are forced to work in Delhi, Mumbai and other places as masons and labourers. There is no opportunity here. We will vote for the party who will assure us jobs, says Sajid Khan, 50, whose three sons work as labourers in Delhi.In Puaturkuthi, residents say, there are around 40 youths who have completed secondary school and around two dozen graduates. Most of them venture out of Bengal for jobs as labourers in construction and agricultural fields.I have returned home to vote. Others are on their way. We will vote and leave after April 11. I will not say nothing happened. But those were basic amenities. What about jobs? says Ainul Ali, 27, who works as an electrician in Mumbai.For now though, the residents of these enclaves are at the centre of a tug-of-war for votes.Nearly 1,000 people came from Bangladesh. We are giving them free ration in temporary shelters. We are constructing 1,000 sq-ft apartments for each family. We are also trying to bring them under government schemes. There is ample opportunity of work here as labourers, says Rabindranath Ghosh, North Bengal Development Minister and TMC leader from Cooch Behar.The government not only seems to have forgotten these people, but did not care to make a practical plan for their rehabilitation. Apartments are not a solution for rehabilitation of farmers. Over three years have passed and yet these people stay in camps. The Centre has allotted money for their development, which is being misused, claims Diptiman Sengupta, convenor of the former Bharat-Bangladesh enclave exchange co-ordination committee, who has since joined the BJP."

2019-04-10,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/qutubgarh-where-bees-help-farmers-grow/story-NKLwI5yXvAgRF0zdFZR8uI.html,Qutubgarh: Where bees help farmers grow,"At 82, Umed Singh Rana has aced the art of giving interviews to news channels and researchers who have been visiting his farm in north-west Delhis Qutubgarh village since November 2018. Ranas was among 10 families who were given 100 bee rearing boxes by Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi.One of biggest village in a cluster of 49 and right at the edge of northwest Delhi bordering Haryana, Qutubgarh, according to its residents, has changed for the better since it has witnessed the honey revolution.It was in November last year when we were given these boxes. Initially, all of us thought it was a waste of time. But in the first five months itself, the village has produced 1,100 kg of honey, Rana said. Buoyed by the success of their honey production, residents have written to Lekhi  who has adopted the village under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana  urging her to change the name of Qutubgarh to Madhugarh.Besides honey, the bees also helped the village produce a bumper mustard crop due to cross pollination.Mustard production has gone up by 20%. We asked for more bee boxes and now the count has increased to 130. Also, more trees are now being planted in the village because bees need a variety of flora and fauna. These include eucalyptus, neem, shisham and jamun, said Dinesh Rana, 40, who after two cycles of honey extraction is now imparting apiculture to other farmers in the village.The success stories have encouraged more Qutubgarh farmers to look for avenues to increase their income. Rajpal Rana, 47, is the first in the village to start organic farming. The first batch of my wheat produce is now being harvested. Villagers who have tried the flour made out of my organic wheat, say it is tastier. For decades, we have degraded the soil by using fertilizers and pesticides. Now, we plan to change this, he said.Ravinder Rana, who owns a 2.5-acre farm, has bigger plans. I have already applied for licenses to set up a packaging unit. The farmers have also written to the National Centre for Organic Farming to include Qutubgarh in a pilot project under the Central governments National Project on Organic Farming, he said.Lekhi said the main demand of the villagers was streetlights. Unfortunately, MPLAD cannot be used for works in areas other than the MPs own parliamentary constituency. I really had to struggle as Rs 25 lakh is the only amount I could use. So, I gave streetlights which may sound like a small thing but was significant as the area had absolutely no lighting which was a big safety hazard, she said.The MP said apart from giving bee-boxes, she is also sending trainers on a regular basis to impart skill training to women and the farmers. The honey turned out to be of the highest quality and it sold for Rs 300 per kg. Now they have learnt to even harness beeswax which is being sold for Rs 600 a kilo, Lekhi said.Satveer Singh, 57, was among the 35 potters in the village who received an electric pottery wheel from Lekhi about three months back. Apart from farmers, this village also has a community of potters. The best thing about the electric wheel is that it has a speed regulator. I can make 50 earthen lamps in 10 minutes. On a manual wheel, it used to take double the time, he said.Villagers, however, said the pock-marked roads in the area have not been improved. Lekhi said the work needs to be done by the area MLA through the Delhi government.They also complained of lack of any hospital or college in the vicinity.The area MLA, Ram Chander of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said all major works in Qutubgarh are being done by him. The village has four colonies. I am getting roads and drains built in each of these colonies through Delhi governments flood and irrigation department. Some pockets also have got new water pipelines, he said.Qutubgarh, however, was not the first village adopted by Lekhi. The MP had first adopted Pilanji village in her New Delhi parliamentary constituency. A year after I had announced adoption of Pilanji, I got a notice from the rural development department that urbanised villages cannot be adopted under the PMs scheme. My constituency has no rural village. So, later I adopted Qutubgarh, she said.Surrounded by planned government colonies and clean markets, Pilanji village in the upmarket New Delhi area sticks out for its never ending haphazard high-rises and fly breeding garbage strewn across its narrow lanes. But the 11,000-odd residents of this urban village say all is well and that theres little to complain about.When asked about the works done by the area MP, locals said development has taken place, although some of their demands remain unfulfilled. Roads have been made and new water and sewer lines have been laid. More importantly, all electricity lines have been shifted underground. Short circuits and load shedding were so frequent. This has reduced now, said Akash Baisoya, a third generation resident of Pilanji.While Qutubgarh is a Jat dominated village, Pilanji, the only urbanised village in the New Delhi assembly constituency, is dominated by the Gujjars.Residents also complained that they were unable to use the community centre in Pilanji. The building was supposed to be a baraat ghar-cum-recreation centre for the village. It was supposed to have a library too. But, it is currently being rented out to some NGO. Also, there is no public toilet facility in our area. One is there within the community centre premises, but it has been locked down, said Dheer Singh, who is known as the pradhan of Pilanji village.First Published: Apr 10, 2019 07:14 IST"

The pure yellow mango has often been ripened unnaturally.* Aroma: The sweet natural aroma of a genuine Alphonso mango will fill a room.

Often people mistake a wrinkled fruit for a naturally ripe Hapus. That is far from the truth.* Shape: The Alphonso, also called Hafoos, Hapuz or Aapoos, is oval and all mature Alphonso mangoes develop a slight dimple just below the stem, small enough to hold a drop of water or stop it from sliding down.Now that you have identified and purchased your Hapus, what are you going to do with it?While I am a fan of the Paayari, and nothing gives me more pleasure than massaging a small green Paayari mango that has been chilling in the fridge, till the fibres give way to produce a sluice that can be sucked straight from the fruit, the Alphonso is indeed the king.

Perfect with steamed rice and a small piece of fried mackerel on the side.Like all things Kerala, the Mambazha Pulissery  a traditional sweet-and-sour ripe-mango-and-prawn curry  is divine. Made especially during Lent, when devout Christians abstain from meat, the curry is made with yoghurt, coconut, small onions, chillies, ginger, mustard seeds, fenugreek, turmeric and coconut oil, with a handful of de-veined and shelled small-sized prawns, and eaten with steamed rice.In Tamil Nadu, a Raw Mango Pachadi is de rigueur for Tamilian New Year. But the same pachadi can be made with sweet, ripe mango. Grind up a paste of rice flour and coconut, tempered with mustard seeds and just a few green chillies. Cook the pulp till it turns smooth and soft; to this add jaggery and stir till jaggery and mango have blended. Cook together, then add coconut and chilli paste. Once the pachadi has thickened, add turmeric and temper with hing and red dry chillies.In Karnataka, mango rasam is made with jaggery, spices, and a taut green mango on the verge of ripening. In Maharashtras Konkan region, Ansa-Fansachi Bhaji is a sweet, sour and spicy dish made with jackfruit, mango and pineapple. I could go on and on.

2019-04-13,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/beyond-insects-ferments-and-bhoot-jholokia/article26826864.ece,Beyond insects  ferments and bhoot jholokia,"Insects, fermented flavours, visions of TV show hosts scarfing down bhoot jolokia like marathoners. Just mention Assamese cuisine and some might even shudder a little or shy away because it has been made to sound so exotic or even intimidating. But it isnt. These are all myths that have been propagated to create TRPs for TV shows and social media. Some of these myths were busted for me by Kashmiri Barkakati Nath, exactly a year ago when she hosted her first Assamese pop-up in the city. Mumbaikars now have a chance to bust some myths about the States food too, with the self-taught proponent of Assamese cuisine, Nath coming from Guwahati with a host of traditional ingredients, her passion and a deep desire to showcase these gastronomical delights.The first thing Nath said to me when we met then was, I do not do tribal cuisine. She was visibly pained when talking about incorrect perceptions of Assamese cuisine. Momos, crickets worms. these are not representative of our food. I want to showcase regular Oxomiya (Assamese) food to the world. I remember identifying with her at the time. I was similarly upset when a popular TV show showcased kandalee or bichughaas (stinging nettle) as a sensational food in its episode on Garhwali cuisine. Yes, it is eaten and is quite tasty (it was a traditional foraged food used to supplement the diet), but only if found it by the wayside on the way home, is one inclined to risk being stung to harvest and cook it. Is it representative of vegetable preparations on the Gahrwali thali? Not by a long shot.While elements like insects, ferments, bhoot jholokia exist in Assamese food, they arent representative of the cuisine on the whole. These elements exist as part of tribal diets in Assam, but 80% of Assamese society is non-tribal. And just like every cuisine in the world, Assams food culture is a confluence of many factors and has many local regional variations.Assam is rich in local flora and fauna and has evolved its own signature flavour profile based on the climate and topography. Our diet is local and seasonal and has evolved to make the most of what we have available. We eat many traditional varieties of rice, as it is, or made into a variety of pithas accompanied but many subtly spiced curries, gravies and condiments, elaborates Nath. Predominantly rice based, Assamese cuisine is full of subtle flavours and delicate accents. Although perceived as meat centric, and associated strongly with pork, Assamese food is more nuanced. With rivers such as the Brahmaputra and its tributaries flowing through and almost every home boasting a pond, fish is much loved and eaten with relish. Being rich in local produce all year round, owing to abundant rain  vegetable dishes are cooked in a variety of ways to supplement meals. Pork has only became popular over the last 20 years or so. Meat is reserved for special occasions and festivals. Even though it is in India and the bhoot jholokia grows in Assam, our food is not spicy at all. We do not use many spices. Our dals and curries are mildly and delicately seasoned. We also use a lot of souring agents. Our hot and humid climate, has resulted in consumption of souring agents that have a cooling effect on the body. We also eat a lot of fermented foods, shares Nath.Local food, global twistNath has hosted Assamese food festivals and cooked for visiting dignitaries and celebrities. Shes also a permanent jury member for the Guwahati Food Awards while doubling up as a menu consultant for the Taj Group in Guwahati. Having been mentored by legendary cooks from tea estates, Nath has gained a deep understanding of the varied nuances of Assamese cuisine including the Ahom, South East Asian, and Colonial influences that blended with local techniques and ingredients to create Assamese cuisine.The Unsavoured Assam pop-up that Nath is hosting in the city currently showcases this. In honour of Rongali Bihu, a festival that marks the advent of the spring and is celebrated to welcome the Hindu New Year, Nath has included Bihu festive dishes as well as classic Assamese cuisine. Traditional ingredients and dishes are treated with delicacy and beautifully presented in more modern formats. Take the appetisers for example, Starters are Western concepts, Nath says, But I believe that a food must evolve and stay rooted in traditions at the same time. Its a process that has resulted in a thoughtful menu that caters to the vegetarian and non-vegetarian palate.Eat AssameseWhats on the menu, then? Theres Luchi, Guti Aloo and the flavourful Bilahi Ambol, ( an appetiser of s mall puffed puris topped with Assamese baby potatoes and sweet tomato chutney). Then theres the soul satisfying anguli pitha. Inspired by the traditional one-bowl dish of hand rolled rice flour dumplings, Naths version is rich in taste and texture, tossed in a piquant tomato sauce. Other unforgettable dishes included Maas Khorika Aru Kharoli (chunks of fish smoked and served with fermented mustard chutney), and the Haanh Kumura which is duck slow-simmered with ash gourd until its falling off the bone.Also included Bihu specials like Til Diya Chicken ( chicken in black sesame seed), the Pani Pitha Aru Bengena Pura , Jolphai Meetha Chutney (bite-sized rice flour pancakes with smoked eggplant and a sweet olive chutney), the Bhaat Kerala Bor Aamor Chutney (stuffed teasel gourd fritters with spicy sweet mango chutney). Desserts include Kola Bora Sawalor paiyox (black rice kheer) and Kumal Sawal, Doi and Gur (rice with yogurt and jaggery).An Assamese cooking class featuring dishes from the pop-up will take place at APB Cook Studio on April 17; call 42152799. The pop-up is ongoing at Mustard, Atria Mall; 67363338"
2019-04-15,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-cruel-joke-in-the-name-of-insurance-claim/article26839743.ece,A ‘cruel joke’ in the name of insurance claim,"Prahlad Singh Bharukhera was in for a rude shock when he got his passbook updated at his banks branch in Sirsa on March 31. The latest entry showed a credit of Rs. 10.21 as insurance claim for crop loss.It was a cruel joke, said Prahlad, a matriculate, who along with his two brothers owns six hectares of land.Since Prahlad holds a Kisan Credit Card, the premium amount of Rs. 367 per hectare under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was automatically deducted from his account in 2017. His wheat crop was destroyed in April that year due to a hailstorm. Having paid the insurance premium, I hoped to get an adequate claim from the firm for my loss worth thousands of rupees. But I was shocked to see Rs. 10.21 as the insurance claim. And it is not just me. Several farmers in neighbouring villages have received similar amounts. We met the Deputy Commissioner, but he too expressed his inability to help, said Prahlad.No benefitsThough the current government has announced several welfare schemes for the benefit of farmers, Prahlad argued that they are yet to reach the targeted beneficiaries. The crop insurance is a good idea. But the farmers are not getting the benefits. Its the insurance companies which have made money running into several thousand of crores from the scheme. The government must ensure that the farmers are the actual beneficiaries of its schemes, said Prahlad.He said his father had taken Rs. 7 lakh loan, but they are yet to repay it. The family made a profit of Rs. 30,000 by selling mustard this season, but incurred Rs. 50,000 as medical expenses on childbirth and some other treatment.When the expenses are far more than the income, how can a farmer survive? The government claims to have increased the Minimum Support Price, but the increase in prices is many times higher. This gap between income and expenditure is increasing every year due to inflation, said Prahlad.He argued that mere implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report is not the solution to all the ills in the farming community. The government must strike a balance between income and inflation, he added.He also questioned the claims of the current government to double the income of the farmers in the next three years. The most important question is how they are going to do it. They have not come out with any formula or road map yet, said Prahlad.Other optionsHe said he and his brothers would prefer to join some other work where they can earn Rs. 10,000-15,000 per month.Farming is not profitable. It is getting more and more difficult to survive as a farmer. The agrarian crisis, lack of job opportunities, unaffordable education and health facilities are the most important election issues for me this year, he said.Farming is not profitable.

Supposedly set in pre-Independent India, Kalank appears instead to have been filmed inside a Good Earth catalogue curated by Baz Luhrmann. In a disreputable neighbourhood, a courtesan stands in her doorway while gondoliers paddle about in what looks to be a moat behind her, and later, when she feels the need to cry, she walks first to the centre of the elaborate golden motifs painted on her floor before dropping to her knees and wailing cinematically. This is as baroque as it gets.We see revolutionaries wearing different shades of mustard, with a scene set around the kite festival of Basant Panchami, but, as Kalank goes on, we are conditioned to exorbitant colours frequently matching  from scarlet umbrellas to marsala walls and columns. Rioters holding swords march in fiery streets, dressed as if theyd first bickered about a suitably Prussian shade of blue.Watch -Raja Sens movie review of KalankDirected by Abhishek Varman and shot by the masterful Binod Pradhan, the makers of Kalank not only want every frame to be a painting, but every dialogue a proverb, every scene a portent. The result is beautiful but tedious, an opera that needed a stout songstress to warble through it midway.You sing well, says the courtesan to a young ingenue, but there isnt enough salt. This indefinable namak goes a long way in Indian art, and the older woman blames the blandness on a potential lack of spice in the girls life. The girl  Roop (Alia Bhatt)  may agree, caught in a passionless marriage via Victorian circumstances: a wealthy woman with a few years to live has brought Roop to be her husbands bride after she passes away.The names are literal. The pretty girl is Roop, the outsider is Baahar Begum, the upright lady is Satya, her husband is Dev (like in pati-dev), and the boy who wins women over is named Zafar, meaning victor. Played by Varun Dhawan, eyes tinged with kohl and misery, Zafar brings Kalank alive, a blacksmith forging swords with serrated edges, speaking in lines as lethal. He doesnt lay a hand on a woman without permission or payment, and an awestruck Roop wonders aloud: even he must have a limit. He does not. Inhi tez jumlon se Heera Mandi ke auraton ke dil kaat rakhe hain, admires his friend, emphasising how in a film with exclusively poetic lines, Zafar gets the last word because of his sharpness of his phrases.Dhawan revels in the melodramatic syntax, committing to the films pitch and making the audience root for him. Bhatt is fine in their scenes together, but otherwise appears reluctant to embrace this gaudy a cinematic style, while Sonakshi Sinha, as Satya, is rather effective as a woman perpetually biting her tongue  and biding her time. Aditya Roy Kapoor is suitably detached as Dev, a man wondering where to start rebuilding his life, while Sanjay Dutt does little but glower in silence. Above them all reigns Madhuri Dixit, playing Baahar Begum with stately grace, her tear-filled eyes flashing with defiance. Despite an odd, Kathak-caricaturing dance, Dixit outdoes the films extraordinary backdrops. The lady is an enchantment.The films politics are naive and laughable. From verbose lines to extreme opulence, Kalank is too theatrical and stage-y to appear current, which is why the old-world setup works until it doesnt. More attention is paid to the chikan embroidery on Roops husbands kurtas than to the films climactic revolution, and the third act exposes the storys hollowness, even as the film flits irritatingly and inconsequentially between timelines. The end asks the audience a question, but it means little.The visuals linger. A necklace fastened around Roops neck with velvet drawstrings; a fake bird in a theatre performance spectacularly getting its wing sliced off; a harp the size of a house; and the first time Zafar meets Roop. During a Ram-Leela performance at Dussehra, he shows up with wet, blue-skinned Rams rising from the water behind, and when the lovers touch, burning Ravana heads cast a glow on their encounter. Kalank often feels too much, and I only wish it made me do the same. It is a stunningly plated meal, but needed salt.Follow @htshowbiz for moreFirst Published: Apr 17, 2019 15:26 IST"

After a mom e n t a r y pause, she says, One who can prepare a feast out of the leftovers in the kitchen. Ushas response is evident from the way she swiftly dishes out a handful of items with the minimal vegetables and spices available in her kitchen. Give her ripened green chili, she will crush them and make pickle, or remains of previous days rice, she will grind and dry them in the sun and make vadams.In her KK Nagar colony neighbourhood, Usha is everyones go-to for questions about cooking. Her preparation of masala vada, sundal and kesari were hotcakes at the Womens Day celebration last month. Usha was 17 when she got married. Her working knowledge in the kitchen was limited to her mothers instructions. Those days we had a pumping stove.What else would a class 8 girl know? Sometimes my mother used to ask me to grind spices on ammi. It was a timeconsuming process. Id simply throw away the unground spices into the drain. Of course, my mother used to find out later. Wed have mixed rice for lunch.Simple, soulful, and healthy recipes  whatever was served used to be consumed without questioning or complaining. We had no choice and everything was treated like a luxury, says Usha, who has two d a u g h t e r s a n d f ive grandchildren. Usha continues to live in the same 44-year-old building in which she grew up as a child. Little did Usha know that shed get married into a huge family within a short span of her engagement. My husband belonged to a village called Thottiyam near Tiruchy.His side of the family had excellent cooks. I had a lot to learn from my mother-in-law and six sistersin- law. The first meal I had to prepare after marriage, as per instructions from my husband, was rasam rice and ladys finger fry. While I was wondering, my mother-in-law sarcastically asked me to wash it and fry it in a vessel with mustard seeds. I followed it blindly and messed it up. I will never forget my first kitchen mishap, reminisces Usha, who doesnt need a measuring cup or cookbook to prepare delicacies. She remembers them from memory.Summer is the best season for Usha to experiment with all kinds of savouries. She prepares one variety of sundal every day. Based on orders from neighbours, she also grinds powder varieties like idli, ellu, sambar, paruppu podis. Her other specialties include maavadu pickle, vathal, vadam, and thogayal. I like preparing things the traditional way. Its the smallest of methods that you adapt which bring out a big difference in the tastes, across households.I use two separate kadais for sweet items and spicy ones. My adai is popular for its softness. Even the hours of soaking and method of grinding matters. Ive surrendered myself to cooking. The tricks are simple. Once we master them, there will be no need to go to restaurants. Its been a dream to open a fastfood chain in the US. Hopefully, it will be true someday. Cooking is a therapy, pass-time, passion, and everything to help me get rid of sitting idle, says Usha."

The Anna Nagar store has a counter-top display which is a traditional shopping experience and hangers covering 50 per cent of the showroom for those who prefer self-service.The new store on Oliver Road is an out-and-out walk-in wardrobe inspired unit. The designs were curated by Sunita Yogesh, daughter of Jeyasree Ravi who is the senior designer of Palam Silks.We have demolished the gap between customers and our creations, explained Sunita. All the saris are easily accessible as they are set up on hangers. A customer can enjoy viewing each and every sari on the hangers instead of a countertop display unit where the viewing is limited to the sales executives selection of saris. Customer can leisurely walk around the store and take the liberty to get up-close and personal with every sari in the showroom.The store houses four unique sections. One part is inspired by online browsing experience where the customer can swipe through every sari that has been designed.

2019-04-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/states-order-surveys-after-rain-ruins-crops/story-fngWkU2IGpA9qzDVaSEuzL.html,Unseasonal rain brings destruction to crops in north,"Rain and hailstorms have flattened ready-to-harvest fields of wheat, among other crops, in key states, prompting the Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan governments to order surveys to assess the extent of damage, but officials are sanguine that output of the main winter staple will still be robust.It could take up to a week to determine the extent of crop damage, but according to information received by HT from state-level agriculture department officers, Rajasthan seems to have borne the brunt.Millions of farmers grow wheat during winter, which fetches them high prices because it is a key commodity procured by the government at federally fixed support prices.Although the surveys are still on, eye estimates suggest extensive damage to wheat in areas like Ganganagar and Kota division. Hailstorm and rains have damaged various crops in about 26 districts, said BS Rathore, the chief statistical officer of Rajasthans agriculture department.Rain, thunderstorms and lightning struck parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana between Monday and Wednesday, killing at least 60 people, at the start of a summer in which, experts said, such weather events could be fairly common.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday ordered a statewide girdawari, or a revenue department assessment, to determine crop damage.In most of these states, winter grown wheat is ready for harvest. We had expected 18 million tonnes of wheat output. There have been reports of damage to wheat in many places, said Balwinder Singh Sandhu, the agriculture commissioner of Punjab.According to a preliminary report prepared by the agriculture department, crops have been hit in scattered areas of Amritsar, Barnala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ferozpur, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Mansa, Muktsar, Mohali, Patiala, Pathankot, Sangrur, Ropar and Tarn Taran.In Rajasthan, apart from wheat, late-sown varieties of mustard, isabgol and gram have also been damaged, Rathore said.The agriculture ministry had been expecting wheat production to cross a record 100 million tonne in 2018-19, aided by good weather conditions. Wheat output stood at a record 99.70 million tonne in 2017-18.On average, Punjab experienced 15 mm of rainfall in two days. We are keeping our fingers crossed. We hope rainfall has not caused much damage. We are waiting for the crop to get proper sunshine for a few days, said Punjab agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi.Despite the rough weather, Gyanendra Pratap Singh, director of the Karnal-based Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, said he was expecting wheat production to be over 105 million tonne as weather conditions throughout the winter had been favourable.There are no reports of any damage to wheat in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which is a very large grower too. So I expect overall output to be good, Singh said.First Published: Apr 19, 2019 08:08 IST"
2019-04-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/such-a-simple-recipe-such-a-magical-result-kunal-vijayakar-on-mayonnaise/story-H99cePZ1DQ63s1kEaQudTN.html,Such a simple recipe; such a magical result: Kunal Vijayakar on mayonnaise,"Ive often extolled the virtues of eggs and the many-sidedness of this smooth and oval object. Talked about how the modest white and yolk, when artistically negotiated, can burgeon into a variety of dramatic forms, textures and tastes. One such gastronomic opera is performed when two seemingly straightforward and unassuming ingredients  vegetable oil and vinegar  have a bit of a skirmish with eggs in a bowl, to result in the most wondrous consequence: a luscious, bright, tangy and sweet emulsion called mayonnaise.Mayonnaise in a jar, off a shelf, was difficult to procure in the 70s, unless you had an uncle smuggling in foodstuff from abroad. So it was no big deal that my grandmother made mayo at home. It was just done. She would separate the yolks from the whites and drop them into a large Tupperware bowl. To that shed add a bit of vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard. Even mustard, in those days, was sold in powder form. The most popular being Colmans Dry Mustard Powder, and a local variant being Atlas Brand. Mustard powder is usually made of finely ground yellow, brown and black mustard seeds and needs to be mixed with cold water and set aside for the mustard to catalyse and erupt with that unmistakable kick. Of course that was then; today you can just inflict a few helpings of mustard straight out of a tube or a bottle.So with three or four egg yolks, vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard in a bowl, my grandmother would instruct me to hold the basin at an angle while she simultaneously did two things. With a hand mixer in her right hand, shed start blending the yolks and condiments, while with her left hand shed start dripping measured vegetable oil from a large cup slowly into the swirling recipe. Lo and behold, as she got to the end of the oil, the vigorous liquid ingredients would start getting stable as if by magic and turn into a calm creamy emulsion of golden yellow.The mayonnaise my grandmum made, and my mum after her, was unlike the white mildly sour mayo that you can buy ready-made in a jar or a bottle. This mayonnaise was bright yellow, translucent, sticky, gooey, and sweet, with a sharp slam of mustard. And with this sauce we made the most memorable chicken mayo sandwiches and rolls. A simple soft bread roll stuffed with boiled or roasted chicken, a crisp cold frond of lettuce tucked in sideways and dressed with this homemade mayonnaise that oozed out from the side of the bread and your mouth when you took a bite.Paradise Restaurant in Colaba used to make these chicken rolls best, but now that Paradise is lamentably lost, the iconic J Hearsch and Co at Hill Road, Bandra, makes unarguably the finest chicken rolls on both sides of the sea link. Theres no lettuce in their chicken rolls, but they are stunning. Soft bread generously filled with both chicken and mayo, moist and fresh. Fresh is important, because unlike the mayo you buy in a bottle, this mayo needs to be made fresh and consumed fresh. If you ask Melvin DSa, who runs the bakery, anything about his mayonnaise, he suddenly goes coy and silent. Then, with a sly smile, he admits that the recipe is a huge secret and their mayo is clandestinely prepared in his kitchen at home and then brought to the bakery, so that not even the staff know how it is made.Well, I dont really want to know how he makes the mayo, as long as he keeps making it the way they do. Just across from Hearsch is a 60-year-old hole in the wall. Its called A-1 Bakery. They too make chicken rolls and their mayo too is from a similar recipe. After youve stood in a sweaty queue, the man behind the counter freshly fills warm bread with chicken and mayo and serves it wrapped in butter paper, on order. A-1 Bakerys mayo packs a substantial punch. It has a sharp mustard taste that cuts the sweetness of the sauce and is a joy to bite into.But if you cant be bothered to make the mayo yourself, and getting Hearsch to divulge the recipe proves hopeless, Ratan Tata Institute (RTI, as it is popularly known) often sell a tub-full. You can make your own sandwiches or dress old-fashioned salads, like a Summer Salad (lettuce, cress, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, radishes, cucumber and mayo) or an old club-style Potato Salad (boiled potato, dill, celery, onion, mustard, pepper and mayonnaise) or a Russian Salad, also known as an Oliver Salad, originally invented by Lucien Olivier in Moscow in the 1860s (potato, carrot, boiled egg, French beans and peas in a mayonnaise dressing). Or just simply boil some eggs and smear them with mayonnaise! By the way, do you know what my favourite law is? Its Cole Slaw!First Published: Apr 19, 2019 16:22 IST"

This is the parliament election. We will not allow Didir police at booths. Dadar police will come from Delhi to guard the booths and conduct the polls. Tell the villagers that there will be policemen from Delhi at the booths and BJP workers as well.A Trinamul leader said Ghoshs remarks showed that the central forces and the BJP would work together to trigger violence.Dilip Ghosh today made it clear that central forces would work as per the direction of the BJP. He also said BJP workers would be with the central forces, which means paramilitary personnel will be hand in glove with the BJP members to trigger violence, the Trinamul leader said.The BJP leader also issued a threat for those who wanted to rig the polls.Tell those who will come to loot votes this time to apply mustard oil on their back. We are ready with bamboo sticks and if those sticks fall on their back, they will have to be hospitalised. Ask them to book beds in hospitals as they would stay there for six months, said Ghosh.He went on: You watched the first day of the polls in Cooch Behar where our party workers chased the goons. Those goons were found running with their sandals in hand. We assure you that we will not let anyone loot votes in this election. Our workers will resist.Anubrata Mondal, the Birbhum district Trinamul president, said: What he (Ghosh) said at Dubrajpur today was derogatory and his intention is to perpetrate violence in the area. I have asked local Trinamul leaders to lodge a complaint against him with the Election Commission.ClashesAt least five persons have suffered injuries in clashes between suspected Trinamul and BJP supporters in Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts since Saturday.The violence has also prompted a group of BJP supporters to stay away from their homes, who fear attacks by Trinamul.The clashes broke out after the voting in the Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar seats on April 18."
2019-04-25,https://www.telegraphindia.com/sport/simon-katich-on-his-gig-as-kkr-assistant-coach/cid/1689393,Simon Katich on his gig as KKR assistant coach,"KKR assistant coach Simon Katich believes in easing pressure off the lads and getting them to relax. The Telegraphcaught up with him to know how he keeps our favourite players focused on the game.So, whats your earliest cricketing memory?Ummm... probably playing on the front lawn at home when I was about four years old.Do you have any favourite World Cup memories?Oh! I think my favourite one initially was the 1992 World Cup in Australia. I went to see the final at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) and it was incredible to watch Wasim Akram in action!Who was your cricketing hero growing up?Definitely Sir Viv Richards. I grew up during an era when West Indies was dominant and I loved watching them play. He was my idol. Ive been extremely fortunate to meet him and have some great conversations with him throughout my career. I think I met him for the first time in England in 2003, and I remember I was a bit shy to go up to him and chat, but my teammate said: Come up, dont be shy, well chat with him, and 40 minutes later, we were still chatting and he didnt let me down. Hes a champion.Youve been with the Knights for quite some time now. How was your first experience stepping into Eden Gardens?One of the great regrets I have of my career was that I never got to play a Test match at the Eden Gardens. Now that its my home ground for KKR makes it really special. The atmosphere is amazing and its incredible to get to come here.So, since youre a mentor and an assistant coach, how do you get the boys to loosen up after practice? Is it tough to juggle the caps of a strict disciplinarian on pitch and a chilled-out friend off it?Yeah, I think away from cricket Im pretty relaxed. There are times when we do get frustrated with little mistakes that happen, and that is human nature. But more often than not, we try to be as positive as possible because ultimately the boys are going through a lot of pressure and cricket is an intense game and you have to be as relaxed as possible and trust yourself and the boys.You and Jacques (Kallis) were on opposite sides of the pitch during your playing days and now, both of you are working together to help the Knights win the trophy! What is your equation like?I obviously had a huge amount of respect for Jacques as a player. We had some great battles on the field and I do joke with him that while he did knock me over a few times, I did get some runs against him as well (laughs)! But, weve worked well together.Do you still get excited when you see a textbook cricketing shot?Yes, absolutely! Especially in the shorter format of the game, where you see more unconventional shots, its always nice to see the classics make a comeback. (Smiles)Talking about the boys, which Knight would you pay to watch play?(Smiles) That is a tough question because you dont want to be biased as a coach. Last year we got an opportunity to work with Shubman Gill. He was 18 and it was his first IPL and to see the amount of ability he had at that age was fantastic! Its been great to see Nitish Ranas progress and I think Rinku Singh will also get more opportunities in time.This is the tough part. Whos the prankster in the team?(Chuckles) Umm... earlier it was Brad Hogg! Now Rinku Singh is up there and hes always making the boys laugh with his characters and hairstyles. Harry Gurneys got a good sense of humour.What about the party animal?Oh! (laughs) Without doubt thats Chris Lynn!And is there anyone who forgets stuff?Ummm... theres no doubt there is, Im just trying to remember who it is. Its probably me, given that I cant remember! (Laughs)As a coach, whats the weirdest excuse youve heard of someone not being able to come to practice?I think the best one was at an optional session we had a few years ago and one of our coaches, Wasim Akram exercised the option and didnt come to training.And what excuse did you give to skip practice?I never skipped practice. I loved it!Can you share the weirdest fan encounter youve had?Probably in Zimbabwe, when a lady on the boundary line asked me to sign her bra. Yeah, that was the first time Ive had to do that! (Laughs) I went a bit red actually, I was quite embarrassed!Since travelling is an integral part of the life of every player and coach, what are your travel essentials?I would say my KKR neck pillow for flights. My backpack is a must. I always carry water and snacks, because I get hungry on planes.What is your favourite travel destination?Oh, thats a tough one... I do like going to the US.Whats your favourite thing about Calcutta?Ummm... whats the mustard fish dish? (We prompted him that it was shorshe ilish) I love that!Have you picked up any Bangla in your time here?Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo! (smiles)Have you seen any Shah Rukh Khan films?We did, about two years ago. We went for the premiere of Fan.Any other Indian films on your bucket list?Well, Im still yet to see a couple of Indian films that Ive been a part of! (Chuckles) I think it was Victory, and there was another one we shot with Brett Lee where I was an extra, Andrew Symonds was in it (t2 prompted him that it was Patiala House) Correct! Yes! So I should go and watch those.Youre not on social mediaOh no, Im old school. Id still have pigeons deliver letters if I could! (Laughs)In that case, which is your favourite app?Probably WhatsApp.Whats the best thing about being a father?Seeing your kids progress and learn different things and develop relationships with yourself and your family is amazing.Do they come to practice with you?This is their first trip, so not yet. I definitely like bringing them to the afternoon games, but the evening games end a bit too late for them. Id love to bring my eldest one to training, hes eight, but Im worried with all the balls flying around, since he might get hurt.So are you like a strict father who says, Youre grounded! very often?Oh no hell prefer being grounded than watching. (Smiles)What are you listening to?Ive got a playlist on Spotify and there is a variety of music that I like. One of the young guys in the team, Yarra Prithviraj and I have a similar taste in music. I like Guns N Roses and Metallica.And what are you reading?Not reading anything apart from my sons books at bedtime, which is Diary of a Wimpy Kid!What are you currently watching?I have been watching a lot of IPL to prepare for the team meetings, but when Im at home, I watch a lot of the boys shows. I think my elder son likes this show called Deadly 60, which is all about deadly animals, while the younger one likes Crash Investigation Unit, a show about car crashes!What do you do when youre not playing?Generally when Im at home, Im doing a lot of activities with my boys. I either help them with their schoolwork, or coach them in cricket, soccer or IFL football.You also managed a football team. Which is the team you support?My team is Richmond (Football Club) in the Australian Football League, but Ive also been working at the GWS Giants (Greater Western Sydney Giants).If you were not a cricketer, you would be...I wouldve probably liked to play AFL football. Growing up, I either had a cricket bat in my hand or an AFL football. I did a commerce degree, so I mightve been stuck in an office somewhere."
2019-04-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/running-out-of-children-a-south-korea-school-enrolls-illiterate-grandmothers-5698748/,"Running out of children, a South Korea school enrolls illiterate grandmothers","Written by Choe Sang-HunAdvertisingEvery morning on her way to school, Hwang Wol-geum, a first grader, rides the same yellow bus as three of her family members: One is a kindergartner, another a third grader, and the other a fifth grader.Hwang is 70  and her schoolmates are her grandchildren.Illiterate all her life, she remembers hiding behind a tree and weeping as she saw her friends trot off to school six decades ago. While other village children learned to read and write, she stayed home, tending pigs, collecting firewood and looking after younger siblings. She later raised six children of her own, sending all of them to high school or college.Yet it always pained her that she couldnt do what other mothers did.AdvertisingWriting letters to my children, thats what I dreamed of the most, Hwang said.Help came unexpectedly this year from the local school that was running out of school-age children and was desperate to fill its classrooms with students.South Koreas birthrate has been plummeting in recent decades, falling to less than one child per woman last year, one of the lowest in the world.The hardest hit areas are rural counties, where babies have become an increasingly rare sight as young couples migrated en masse to big cities for better paying jobs.Like other rural schools, Daegu Elementary in Hwangs district has seen its students dwindle. When Hwangs youngest son, Chae Kyong-deok, 42, attended it in the 1980s, it had 90 students in each grade. Now, the school has only 22 students in total, including one student each in its fourth and fifth grade classes.This year, the worst calamity of all struck the district.We went around villages looking for just one precious kid to enroll as a first grader, said the principal Lee Ju-young. There was none.So Lee and local residents, desperate to save the 96-year-old school, came up with an idea: How about enrolling older villagers who wanted to learn to read and write?Hwang and seven other women, aged 56 to 80, stepped forward, with at least four others asking to be enrolled next year.For younger people who want to stay in the area, the future of their town depended on keeping the school alive.Who would start a family here if there were no school? asked Noh Soon-ah, 40, whose husband  one of Hwangs sons  quit his job in an auto parts factory in a big city and resettled his family here five years ago to succeed his parents farming business. Children are what brings laughter and vitality to a town.The local education office warmed to the idea, and Hwang started attending classes last month.Like many first graders on their first day, Hwang cried. But these were tears of joy.I couldnt believe this was actually happening to me, she said. Carrying a school bag has always been my dream.Once overcrowded with students, the seaside campus of Daegu Elementary looked almost empty on a recent visit. Camellia, sweet brier and pine trees surrounded its deserted sandy playground. After a rain, cherry trees were shedding their blossoms.Inside the two-story school building, children and grandmothers changed into slippers and walked hallways decorated with locally produced jade-green celadon vases.In the first grade classroom, Hwang and two other grandmothers toiled laboriously, determined to learn to read and write.Pencil in hand, they chanted the 14 consonants and 10 vowels of the Korean alphabet as their teacher, Jo Yoon-jeong, 24, wrote them one by one on the white board. They took dictation on words like aunt, fisherman and raccoon with their slow and crooked penmanship.Between writing exercises, Jo turned on an upbeat song, There Is Nothing Wrong With My Age! and led a dance routine for the giggling grandmothers to follow.School is so much fun, Hwang said.Her son, Kyong-deok, agreed: My mother has become a much happier person since she began going to school. Smiles hardly seem to leave her face.Hwangs county, Gangjin, here on the southwestern tip of South Koreas coast, is typical of the rural areas left behind in South Koreas rapid industrialization.Gangjins last major industry, pottery making, died when plastics began replacing crockery in Korean kitchens in the 1970s. Its rapidly aging population now makes a living growing strawberries and mulberries or picking oysters, cockles and octopuses from tidal flats.Park Jong-sim, 75, is a champion octopus catcher in her village. But on a recent day, she was more worried about falling behind in her elementary-school class.She blinked her eyes as she tried to keep them focused on the notebook, and occasionally took her reading glasses off to wipe tears caused by eye fatigue. Enunciating words was also difficult. To practice her penmanship, she woke up before dawn.My memory, hand and tongue dont work like I wish, Park said. But I am going to learn to write before I die. You dont know how I feel when I go to a government office, they ask me to fill out a form and the only thing I know how to write is my name.Going to school became a distant dream for Park after her father died when she was 8. She spent her childhood collecting sea mustard, raising silkworms and harvesting ramie plants.Decades ago, Korean families often focused what little resources they had on educating their sons. Many girls were expected to stay home and look after younger siblings while their parents worked outside.Hwang said her father found a new wife after her mother gave birth to five daughters but no son. Her stepmother refused to send Hwang to school and scoffed at the idea of teaching a daughter letters when her father tried to show her how to read at home.Being illiterate brought many humiliations later in life. Posting packages was always a problem because she could not write addresses.Years ago, she and her husband, Chae Jan-ho, 72, were visiting their son in Seoul when they got separated in the bustling subway. Hwang could not read any of the signs and was hopelessly lost until a stranger helped her find her way.Now she and her fellow students are determined to make up for lost time. One of the women who returned to elementary school this year had dropped out of school as a fifth grader in the 1970s, when she was sent away to become a live-in housemaid for a rich family in order to support her own.They are eager to learn, said Jo, the teacher, about her first grade students. They are probably the only students here asking for more homework.Unlike other classrooms, the first graders classroom has a sofa and a heated mattress. During breaks, the older women sat on the warm mattress and buried their feet under blankets. They also kept a basket of candies for the second graders next door who occasionally came to visit.But Hwang felt bad that she was in school during a busy strawberry harvesting season. To make up for it, she rose at 4 a.m. and helped her husband, son and daughter-in-law pick strawberries before going to school.Hwang has already hatched an ambitious plan.AdvertisingI am going to run for president of the village womens society, she said. People used to ask me to run, but I always declined. Its a job for someone who can read and write."

We need equal opportunities in education and employment and equal treatment in society, she said.Having left her home in Uttar Pradeshs Meerut city in 2012, she lives with a toli (a group from the hijra community who perform at ceremonies) in Mangolpuri since .Just like any other young good looking woman I too can dream of walking the ramps and hit the silver screen. But, being a transgender its very difficult to even dream. Will any politician promise us equal opportunity? Can we dream at least? said the modelling aspirant.This is the first general election wherein transgender persons are casting their votes under their chosen gender identity after the Supreme Court had declared them as the third gender in 2014. Around 669 transgenders will exercise their franchise in Delhi, compared to 78,49,947 male and 64,21,283 female voters.However, many transgenders are still forced to cast their votes under the male or female category after failing to rectify their gender in the documents.For instance, 18-year-old Dummy will cast her vote as male as she could not change her gender in the documents . Its so disappointing that I cannot vote with the transgender identity. I still have my previous name in all my documents, said Dummy. When asked what will she expect from the new government she said, Recognition.Narrating the story behind her name, she said, Dummy jaise koi murti (like a mannequin). When I had joined an NGO for transgender  SPACE at Kashmere Gate, I was very shy. I was scared and quiet most of the time because I had to leave my home at the age of 15. People started to call me dummy.Anjan Joshi, of NGO SPACE, said that most of the transgender voters are still male or female in their documents. There is no proper data available on transgender voters. Most of them are still male or female on paper. The change of gender and name in documents is a very lengthy task that is depriving majority of transgenders from mainstream education as well. The strength of these voters looks still very less and that is why the politicians neglect them in their manifesto and pre-poll promises, said Joshi.Special chief electoral officer Satnam Singh said that the transgender do not require any different documents to register as voters. Anyone who fills the form-6 can register as a voter. One needs to submit a date of birth certificate and residence proof to fill that. There is no requirement of gender proof for registering as voter. A transgender can easily change her/his gender in form 8-A of election commission online, he said. However, they cannot get their name changed on the form.The Delhi election office has also organised a special drive to encourage transgenders to enrol as voters and exercise their franchise.Joshi, however, said that the process is not as easy.Most of transgenders who go to help centres to register as voters are being asked to present documents such as address proof, and sex certification by a government hospital that takes two to three years, she said.Singh, however, said the election commissions help centres also accepts letters from the recognised NGOs and the heads of transgender tolis to change the gender in voter list.A 56-year-old transgender guru, who heads a toli of around 24 other community members in northeast Delhis Kabir Nagar said, I have been voting as a man since forever. Do I even look like a man? Its just I do not have my gender changed in my documents. I do not know about the online option.Madhu and Janasheen, who earn their livelihood by dancing in ceremonies, have managed to get their gender changed on adhaar cards. They will be voting as third gender on May 12. How does it matter even if we vote as transgender? Politicians promise us separate public toilets, free passes in public transports, shelter homes and employment before every elections. But everybody forgets after winning the elections. Though these cards give us confidence, they are not helping us earn, said Janasheen, 30.Nodding her head in affirmation, Madhu, 31, said Forget about everything at least the politicians can ensure us equal treatment in hospitals. Doctors look at us like some aliens whenever we go for treatment.Aliya, another transgender who begs at a streetlight in Dharampuri, said, There are shelter homes for animals but not for us. It clearly shows our importance in the eyes of those running the government.First Published: Apr 29, 2019 07:40 IST"

And what better place than the Burma Burma chain of restaurants and their ongoing Thingyan Festival to relish this concept?I cant get over the Village Set they first place in before me. Its an assortment of traditional Burmese dishes arranged beautifully on a cane flat basket. The colours, the aroma, the delicacies and ornamentation of the whole platter...so much like the Indian thali.Start by peeling and munching the sunflower seeds, says Ankit Gupta, Founder of the vegetarian Burmese cuisine chain. He explains how guests in Burma are first served sunflower seeds till the main course arrives. Gupta, as a host, is gentle and warm, makes sure I savour my food like the Burmese do. As the cuisine is based on a specific country, it is impertinent on our part to celebrate its customs, traditions and the grand festival of Burma. The Thingyan Festival is a big festival in Burma as it welcomes the New Year. We travelled back to our roots, to explore and bring back new, authentic dishes and flavours to India.By now, Im tasting the Yangon tea shop favourite Quack Quack Palata  square pockets filled with a special mix of tangy and sour spices. Next, I dig into the traditional 999 noodles, flavourful, without any sauces. My companion choose the black sticky rice with eyed pea and pickled vegetables, its robust nutty flavour was a welcome change. It went well the sweet, tangy and thick eggplant-long bean-and-potato curry. Shan Khow Suey is my favourite  rice noodles in tomato relish, garnished with tofu, pickled mustard leaves, carrot and radish. Another favourite was the Tofu Steamed Buns with fried tofu, a soft-and-crispy combo with lettuce, onion, tomato and mayonnaise stuffing. But the star of my meal was the Lotus Stem Fritters  lotus stems sliced, fried and dusted with roasted paprika, rightly flavoured with curry leaves.Our village sets will serve two and four (people), and for the first time Burma Burma will also serve a small plate menu inspired by West Burma, informs Gupta. This includes an authentic Burmese dishes with names Kyan Tribe Rainbow Soup; Spicy Sour Tea Leaf and Avocado Salad, and Rangoon Ruby.Burma BurmaTill: May 5Timings: Lunch (12-4pm) and Dinner (6.30pm-11.30pm)Outlets at Select City Walk, Cyber Hub & DLF Mall of India, Noida"

After poor prices roiled agricultural incomes in 2016-17 and 2017-18 amid bumper harvests, farmers staged protests in several states. This prompted the government to set MSPs, an assured price, at 1.5 times the input costs  or expenses incurred by farmers towards cultivation  so that cultivators get at least 50% returns.Winter harvests began arriving in wholesale markets on April 1, which marks the beginning of the peak rabi or winter-sown marketing season. So far, prices of major crops have barely touched MSP levels, except for wheat. Wheat usually gives higher returns to farmers because it is bought by the government in large quantities at declared MSPs.In October 2018, the Centre raised the MSP of winter lentils (masur) by 5.3% to Rs. 4,475 a quintal (100 kg), while the support price for mustard, the winter oilseed, was raised by 5% to Rs. 4,200 per quintal. Wheat MSP was raised to Rs.1,840 a quintal, a 6% hike over the previous year. The support price for gram or chickpeas was raised by 5% to Rs. 4,620 per quintal.MSP is a floor price set by the Centre to help avoid distress sale and also serve as a benchmark rate, but price trends show farmers will find it tough to sell winter crops at such prices. Experts say the government isnt buying sufficient quantities at these rates (known as procurement) to mop up surpluses and pull up overall rates. This is a key reason stoking the countrys continuing agrarian distress.Mustard has so far on average sold 17% below MSP (between April 1 and 15). In most markets in Rajasthan, the largest grower of winter mustard, the commodity has failed to reach MSP levels.For instance, between April 1-15 in Rajasthans Alwar, which is categorised as a principal market for that commodity, mustard prices ranged between a low of Rs. 3,425 a quintal (on April 1) and a high of Rs. 3,650 a quintal (on April 10), against an MSP of Rs. 4,200, the data showed.Thats 16% below MSP. During this period, about 8,971 quintals were traded in Alwar, with daily arrivals of nearly 1000 quintals, which indicates Alwar is a major mustard trading hub.In Uttar Pradesh, the fourth largest producer of mustard, the commodity sold 15% below MSP between April 1 and 15. In the states Hapur agricultural market, mustard prices last week trended 13% below MSP, ranging between a high of Rs. 3,660 (April 25) and a low of Rs. 3,600 (April 29) against an MSP of Rs. 4,200.This year will end up like last year because most items are selling below MSP. I dont think wheat is doing any better in states where the governments procurement system is weak. That is why we have been demanding a law prohibiting buying of crops below MSP, said Rakesh Tikait, the national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.Farmers arent getting MSP rates for gram, another major winter crop, which on average sold 12% below the MSP rate of Rs. 4,620 between April 1 and 15. In Gujarats Dahod agricultural market, gram sold on average for Rs. 4,250 a quintal (8% below an MSP of Rs. 4,260) in this period.Gram prices continue to be depressed elsewhere. Between April 23 and April 29 in Madhya Pradeshs Dewas and Vidisha market, gram fetched on average Rs. 3,900. In Vidisha, the commodity touched MSP levels on April 27 before dipping again. Lentil prices too were lower than MSP by 9% in the last fortnight. In Madhya Pradeshs Ujjain, for instance, the average price was Rs. 3,400 against an MSP of Rs. 4,475.An official overseeing procurement of oilseeds and pulses said on condition of anonymity that since this is the beginning of the procurement season and prices would improve in the next two months. In states such as Rajasthan, which has a less robust procurement machinery compared to states such as Punjab, even wheat was trending below MSP in some markets. For instance, in Alwar, wheat sold for Rs, 1,725 between April 23 and April 27, about 6% below the MSP of Rs. 1,840. The government procured only about half of maximum allowable limit of 25% oilseeds and pulses in 2018. It must at least procure 25% to effect a change in market rates, said Abhishek Agarwal, Comtrade Ltd.First Published: Apr 30, 2019 07:45 IST"
2019-05-05,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bharatpur-voters-rue-closure-of-industries/article27037094.ece,Bharatpur voters rue closure of industries,"Voters in eastern Rajasthans Bharatpur Lok Sabha constituency, an erstwhile Jat kingdom, rue its inclusion in the National Capital Region and Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) which has put the brakes on the regions industrial growth. As the successive governments failed to promote non-polluting industries, the youths here are mostly without work.Once represented by veteran leaders such as Natwar Singh, Rajesh Pilot, Ram Kishan and Vishvendra Singh, Bharatpur was declared a reserved constituency for the Scheduled Castes in the 2008 delimitation. Since then, the electoral battle has shifted from the erstwhile royals to Dalit communities, including Jatavs and Kolis, as the political parties seek to exploit their fault lines.Congress candidate Abhijeet Kumar Jatav has joined politics after taking voluntary retirement from Indian Revenue Service. The BJP denied ticket to its sitting MP Bahadur Singh Koli and fielded Ranjeeta Koli, daughter-in-law of three-time parliamentarian Ganga Ram Koli. Bahujan Samaj Partys Suraj Pradhan Jatav poses a challenge to both, while expecting to polarise Jatav voters.If the 2018 State Assembly election results are any indication, Congress should have an upper hand here, as it had won six out of the eight Assembly segments, along with its ally the Rashtriya Lok Dal, in this constituency. The BJP drew a blank and the BSP won two seats  Nagar and Nadbai. RLD winner Subhash Garg has been appointed a Minister of State in the Congress government.Though Deeg-Kumher MLA and Minister Vishvendra Singh, a scion of the royal family, is trying hard to get the support of Jats for the Congress, the party is finding it difficult to bridge the chasm created between Jats and Jatavs since the Kumher massacre of 1992, when 15 persons were killed and 300 houses of Dalit Jatavs were set ablaze.SEZ optionDr. Garg told The Hindu that since the establishment of coal-based industries was not possible in Bharatpur because of the NCR and TTZ status, the governments emphasis should be on the creation of jobs in IT sectors. The BJP MP did not take any initiative in this regard. No action has been taken to establish a special economic zone here, he said.Shortage of water for irrigation because of low supply in the Gurgaon Canal and lack of extension of the Chambal project to more tehsils of the district is a major issue affecting the villagers.The brick kilns, which dotted Bharatpurs skyline in the past, have shut down without creation of alternative sources of livelihood for jobless labourers. Similarly, the ghee and oil units dependent on mustard production are slowly closing down because of high taxes. Bharatpur is the largest mustard growing division in the State."
2019-05-05,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/summer-love-it-was-a-different-kind-of-feeling/story-f2eirgGsnwpkYF0YdO85KN.html,"Summer love, it was a different kind of feeling","Sometime in the first week of our class 9 summer vacation, my friend Karan made an important discovery. If we go to Siri Fort after ten, its only five bucks. But we have to get out of there by evening. If they catch us after four-thirty theyll charge twenty five rupees. This struck us as a pretty fair deal.Thus began, for our little band, a summer love that lasted even when we could afford the full fee, until marriage and middle age approached, until finally it left us, the spirit to run around without complication or narcissistic purpose. Whats the most reliable signal of adulthood? Grey hair? Bad back? When play turns into exercise  racquets and bats replaced by routines and Fitbits  you are no longer young. If I am idling through Instagram now my eye stops not at pictures of friends in faraway places but at the ads for yoga gear. They make it in California and sell it at ten thousand rupees and inspire unrequited lust. On a bus to Mysore many years ago, I watched, on a tiny TV screen suspended to the ceiling, a ten-year-old boy wearing only a saffron langot assume a series of scarcely credible contortions and positions. How he would laugh at our export-import yoga.But I digress. Back at Siri Fort, what explained this neat reduction in price, this lowering of the drawbridge? Try playing a three-setter directly under a forty six centigrade Delhi sun. You have to be mad or thirteen to attempt it. It certainly didnt bother us. Every day of the frying pan summer we would gather at our temple, this sprawling sports complex built by Rajiv Gandhi for the Asian Games and almost immediately colonised by Delhis bureaucrats and politicians, who would arrive for their evening walks and golf swings on the floodlit driving range just as we temporary members were chased out. We scorned these schmucks, with unstinted access to the best sporting facilities in the city, who chose instead to while away their day in air conditioned offices in South and North Block.The basketball court was the first port of call, built, conveniently, just beside the sweeping main entrance. By the time wed played a half-court game or two a worker would notice us and wander out with a pink receipt pad, prompting at least one of our groupwhoever was most broke that dayto sprint off in another direction. The man would give half-hearted chase, but no forty year old propelled only by a DDA wage was catching us. We had fear on our side. The fear of a clip on the side of the head. The fear of parting with the ten bucks wed need in the canteen for the essential afternoon Pepsi.xxxNext to the basketball court was a shooting range. None of us had anything beyond a passing interest in shooting, but we went here to get out of the sun, to claim respite on the row of red plastic bucket seats. We would dry ourselves under the fans (on days of power cuts, wide indignation) and literally cool our heels, watching the Serious Shooters with pirate-like guards for one eye and braces on their wrists fire tiny metal pellets from rifles and handguns that seemed like theyd stop a bull. Shooting was far too serene to hold us more than a few minutes. But on occasion it made us move very fast. Karan, aforementioned, once mistakenly triggered a pellet into my cousin Nishants thumb, setting him dancing across the concrete. My cousin still shows me the scar sometimes. He claims the wedge of tin remains lodged inside him.That heat. That heat. The memory of which I could summon years later, on another continent, walking to class between giant snowdrifts. It made the top of your head and the soles of your feet feel precisely the same, no longer serving individual purpose, simply appendages in desperate need of dousing. If you were in the middle of a noon game of tennis and suddenly it felt as if your shoes were on fire, theres a good chance they were. Sometimes you could smell the rubber of your soles smoulder.xxxOften forgotten by the residents of the great and cruel city I grew up in is that Siri Fort is not only an arterial road winding along Gulmohar and Uday Parks and leading to Colonel Kebabz, Def-Col market, that the fort was an important feature of the second of the medieval Delhis, built in 1303 by Alaudin Khilji  he of Ranveer Singh fame  to defend the city folk against the Mongol horde. It is said to have this name, in fact, because Khilji built the forts foundations on the severed heads -- sir -- of Mongol soldiers. A gloriously macabre history underneath a stretched, soothing arbour of neem and pipal, chitvan and amaltas. How perfect for Delhi.But we knew none of this. In fact we did not see the fort at all. We came to play, bearing racquets for tennis and squash and table tennis, because to play was to burn away the blood pumping madness of being a boy of fourteen. There were incredible glass-backed squash courts, better than youd find in private clubs. Off to one side, next to a tiny roller rink, was an open hall with a mysterious dark pool that we werent allowed in  only full members, mind  where they conducted swimming classes for children. Day after roasting day as heat rolled around our brains and rose up our veins we plotted ways to jump in. But we never had the courage. At a journalists barsaati party years later, summer night, no electricity, sweating, buzzed, I was waxing eloquent about Siri Fort when I was informed that this pool was a notorious canyon of little kid pee.Now some of this same gang from school have children who are five and six. Our cities have changed so much. Late in the nineties Delhi felt still safe enough that we could hack around on our own all day, a playground that stretched wide in every direction. We could cycle where we wanted, main roads or colonies. I spent many of my formative years living in Palam Vihar, in Gurgaon, so getting to Siri Fort was more than a challenge. Sometimes my mother would drop me on her way to work, but often I would sling my racquets either shoulder and begin a somewhat epic journey, pitstopping like Odysseus: walk to the end of my road; hitchhike on a passing uncles Bajaj Chetak down the straight shot that led into Bijwasan; Blueline that took me onto the four-lane National Highway, past the bronze Shiva statue that looked then so enormous set against flat fields of mustard, now neatly dwarfed by outlet showrooms for Puma and Diesel; another thumbed hike from Vasant Kunj (which would look and feel abandoned, apocalyptic, on a really hot day), hopefully with a Gurgaon-living officegoer, which meant air conditioning at least until Hauz Khas. Sometimes the last stretch in an auto, depending on the wallet situation, depending when the first game was tipping off.I realise, after putting it down, that this is simply my equivalent of an ancient trope, the privileged-nineties version of I cycled twenty kilometers to school through pouring rain and mud. But it does feel like our cities have changed irrevocably. Now my friends children dont go out to play, they make playdates with each other, at which their parents hover in the background like anxious ants, waiting to plunge in, protect. When my son is old enough no doubt I will behave exactly in this manner. You cant do nothing about the march of time, someone wise once said. You can only fill your life with things you will remember, like baking summer days with your oldest friends, racing about a fort of severed heads.Prayaag Akbar is the author of the award-winning novel Leila.

2019-05-08,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/guess-who-came-to-dinner-with-lalu-prasad/cid/1690130,Guess who came to dinner with Lalu Prasad,"It was the day of Bakrid. I landed at Mumbai airport on August 21, 2018, to meet Lalu Prasad, who was then hospitalised at the Asian Heart Institute located in the suburban Bandra Kurla Complex. Though by then I had submitted the manuscript of what eventually was published as Gopalganj to Raisina  My Political Journey on April 6, 2019, I wished to discuss with the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief some of its contents to be sure about accuracy.I took an autorickshaw from the airport, asking the driver to take me to Asian Heart Institute. Do you know Lalu Prasadji? He lives at that hospital, the auto driver said.Pleasantly surprised, I said: Yes! I am going to meet him.The autorickshaw driver, a Muslim from somewhere in eastern Uttar Pradesh, immediately steered his vehicle to one side of the road and stopped.Can you help me meet Laluji? If you help me meet him I will pray to the Almighty for you, he said in Hindi.I was a bit perplexed. I didnt know if I would be able to get the driver to meet Lalu. And to be honest, getting the driver to meet Lalu was not my priority. But to get out of the situation I suggested that the driver give me his cell phone number and name, and promised him that I would try.The driver pressed on, trying to convince me about his desire: If I get the chance to meet Amitabh Bachchan and Laluji at the same time, I will meet Laluji.He also wrote his name  Ansari  and phone number on a piece of paper and gave it to me, which I pocketed casually. He dropped me off at the hospitals gate, requesting: Laluji se mujhe milwa dena babu. Allah meherban hoga (Please help me meet Lalu, God will bless you).I forgot about his request the moment I entered the hospital premises. A Lalu aide who was waiting for me at the lobby took me to his room on the fourth floor. My commissioning editor from Rupa, Rudra Sharma, too joined me a little later.Lalu was not in the best of health. He had had heart surgery, and his blood pressure and sugar levels were fluctuating. Doctors and nurses were attending to him, guiding him about what to eat and what to avoid. Lalu was supine on his bed but was talking to us very warmly. Rudra and I stayed in his room for over two hours and discussed with him about the manuscript at length.In between, the doctors and nurses kept on checking his blood pressure, sugar, etc. Some of them were clicking selfies with the ailing leader. Lalu also got a call from one of his grandkids in Haryana and spoke for two to three minutes, talking as one would do with a child.The nurses and doctors treated Lalu as a lovable elder and he too spoke to them as if they were his family members. He was in pain but everyone around him was laughing and smiling at his words and disposition.You should get married, Lalu told one of the nurses. Dont delay your marriage. You should take care of your ageing parents and other elders in the family.The nurse smiled.Around 6pm, when I was preparing to leave, I remembered the auto drivers request and casually told Lalu.Some senior leaders from Bihar and Maharashtra were waiting outside for us to leave so that they could meet Lalu. But as soon as he heard about the drivers wish, Lalu became restless. Have you kept his phone number? Please give it to me, he commanded.I fished out the paper from my pocket and gave it to Lalu.He instantly ordered Bhola Yadav, his party MLA who was accompanying him, to call up the driver.Bhola connected the phone and handed it over to Lalu.Aap ka naam kya hai? Aap jaldi hum se milne aa jao. Dhai sau gramme kachcha kaleji bhi lete aana. Aaj Bakrid ka din hai. Kurbani wala kaleji lana (What is your name? Come fast to meet me. Today is Bakrid. Bring 250g of raw liver of a sacrificed goat, Lalu told Ansari.After disconnecting the phone, Lalu asked Bhola to ask the leaders outside to call on him some days later. He told Bhola to go downstairs and bring the driver in. After half an hour, the driver came in, the meat wrapped in a white handkerchief. He was weeping uncontrollably.Dont cry. Just go with Laxman (another aide of Lalu) and cook the liver with mustard oil, garlic, green chilli, pepper and salt. We will eat the meat together from the same plate, Lalu told Ansari.Laxman escorted Ansari to a special kitchen next to the room, which the hospital administration might have arranged for Lalu. Laxman and Ansari brought the cooked liver on a plate. Lalu sat up on his bed and asked Ansari to share the meat.Hoojur! Aap ke plate mein kaise khaoon! Main garib aadmi hoon, autorickshaw chalata hoon. Aap se mil liya, mujhe sab kuchh mil gaya (My lord, how can I share food from your plate! I am a poor man; I drive an autorickshaw. I have got everything just by meeting you), Ansari said, hands folded.Lalu admonished him lovingly: Chupchap aakar saath mein khao nahin toh do thappad maroonga (Just eat, else I will slap you twice).Ansari joined in meekly, eating with Lalu from the same plate as we watched.A nurse came in yelling: Why are you eating meat? The doctor has strictly asked you not to eat red meat!Lalu smiled: Doctor sahib bhole hain. Unko pata nahin hai ke Ansari ke meat mein jitna phaida hai utna phaida poore aspatal ke dawai mein nahin. Yeh kurbani ka meat hai (The doctor is naive. He doesnt know that Ansaris meat has more benefits than all the medicines in his hospital. It is sacrificial meat).He turned to us, and said: I have got immense love from the poor people. What more do I need? I dont think of death and ailment. Life is in the hands of God.Then he told the auto driver: Ansari ab jaao. Koi taqlif hoga toh batana, phir milna (Ansari, go now. If you run into any trouble, come to me again).Overwhelmed, Ansari left weeping. Yah Allah! Laluji ko aabad rakh (O God! Keep Laluji healthy), he said as he left.After the auto driver left, Lalu told us: It is 8pm. I could not have shared the meat with you as there was not enough for four/five people. Now you should go to your hotel and have good drinks and good food. Bihar mein toh sharab bandi hai (There is prohibition in Bihar).The writer is co-author of Gopalganj to Raisina  My Political Journey, Lalu Prasads autobiography"

Wise old trees, croaking frogs, chirping crickets, yowling wild cats, hooting owls, rustling leaves, the buzzing of bees. it was everything Venkat Raman Singh Shyam could ask for as companions while growing up. This splendour was the best part of Sijhora village in Madhya Pradesh, where he spent many years of his life. Today, its all lost to urbanisation. Disturbed by this, he had been feeling on the edge lately, until the moment when he started pouring his thoughts on to the canvas. The result is now for everybody to see through a body of work, titled Clouds of Wings.The richly adorned forests have now given way to extreme aridity with patches of shrubs and grass living their last. Global warming has shown its ugly face and we have failed to recognise it. This inner conflict reflects in my paintings, says Shyam, adding, I understand the need for development. I also understand the imperativeness of advancement, but I cannot rationalise all of this achieved at the cost of the climatic crisis.On a brightly painted red paper background, red, black, mustard and white acrylic colours give birth to The Knowledge Tree. This work shows the tree as the most important element in the aspiration of learning and acquirement of enlightment like was the case with Gautam Buddha who meditated under the Bodhi tree. I take the focus off from the individual seeking knowledge, and place it into the source, the tree in this case, that is responsible for attaining that knowledge, says the artist.Another artwork titled Bamboo Tree (acrylic on paper), depicts the ornamental value attached to plants, in this case, the bamboo. While we all like to adorn our spaces with attractive greens, we dont think about planting them for the larger good of the world. The representation of the two cows within the vase depicts a similar sentiment. In theory, we talk about cow worship and hang beautiful paintings of the animal, but we dont do much to protect the ones dying on the street. Its all about projection, whether in the case of the bamboo vase or the cows, he shares.In Urban Tree, he shows the polluted nature of our earth by symbolically representing the roots of the tree as black.

The GEAC was apprised of this but no action had been forthcoming so far, the letter claimsThe lab report was also sent to the Haryana government, which picked up samples of the suspected Bt Brinjal crop and sent it to the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) in New Delhi for testing. The complete report and decision hasnt been made public so far.Following brinjal, a genetically modified strain of mustard too is in the regulatory pipeline. While this was cleared in May 2017, a GEAC panel changed tack and ruled that more tests were required before the mustard could be made available in farmer fields."

2019-05-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/russia-challenges-chemical-watchdog-on-naming-perpetrators-5732437/,Russia challenges chemical watchdog on naming perpetrators,"Russia is seeking Security Council approval for a resolution that challenges the global chemical weapons watchdog for setting up an investigative team with the power to name perpetrators of chemical attacks.AdvertisingThe draft resolution circulated to council members Thursday and obtained by The Associated Press notes with concern the continuing politicization of the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW.It says the Security Council is the only international body authorized to impose legitimate compulsory measures on countries that violate the chemical weapons convention.The OPCW took the initiative to apportion blame for poison gas and nerve agent attacks last year after Russia used its veto in the Security Council to terminate a joint U.N.-OPCW investigative body set up in 2015 to determine responsibility for chemical attacks.AdvertisingThe UN-OPCW team accused Syria of using chlorine gas in at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 and the nerve agent sarin in an aerial attack on Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that killed about 100 people and affected about 200 others. The latter attack led to a US airstrike on a Syrian airfield.The team also accused the Islamic State extremist group of using mustard gas twice in 2015 and 2016.Russia, a close ally of Syria, claimed the UN-OPCW team was not professional or objective in its investigations and vetoed a resolution to extend its mandate.The OPCW was created to implement a 1997 treaty that banned chemical weapons, but lacked a mandate to name the parties it found responsible for using them.Many OPCW member nations saw the inability to assign responsibility as a senseless hamstring, especially after fatal chemical attacks during the war in Syria and Russias veto. Russia opposed adding a new power to the chemical watchdogs portfolio, saying that was a decision that belonged to the United Nations.Britain led the campaign to give the OPCW new teeth, and last June members voted 82-24 _ more than the two-thirds majority needed _ to expand the organizations powers to apportion blame for illegal attacks.The Russian draft resolution calls on the parties to the chemical weapons convention to cooperate with each other and seek to restore the spirit of consensus in the OPCW.Security Council experts are expected to discuss the Russian draft resolution next week."
2019-05-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/may/18/a-delectable-mix-1978289.html,A delectable mix,"Swetha Kadiyala ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: The Konkan belt boasts of a coastline that stretches for 720 kms. Hence, the culture is unique, as it traverses the four coastal states but perhaps what is even more significant is the cuisine of the Konkanis. The Konkan food festival currently underway in the All Spice restaurant at Four Points by Sheraton, promises to render an ample introduction to the food of the region.It is curated by Chef Deepu Mohan whose expertise in Konkan cuisine comes from working for over five years at The Taj in Mumbai. Chef Mohan is a reticent person but his demeanour changes immediately when asked about his favourite dish in the spread. He talks animatedly about a non-vegetarian starter he modified to work beautifully with a locally-found pink perch fish. The fresh fish is dressed heavily in Mangalorean and North Kerala spices and then fried. The result is a surprisingly mild-flavoured starter which is both crispy and soft at the same time.The lunch menu, which has been specifically introduced for the ongoing festival, comes with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thali options. ""We have taken into account five major regional influences along the Konkan railway track including Maharashtrian, Malvani, Goan, Mangalorean and Malabari to design the dishes and every day we change the menu entirely to add new dishes. Apart from the accompaniments, there are about 18 items in each thali,"" Chef Mohan says.The thalis come with a sweeping array of curries, of which the taut gassi is particularly impressive. Made with Madras curry cucumber, it is equally tangy and spicy, and a generous tomato puree adds to the zest. Its non-vegetarian counterpart called kori gassi is made with chicken and is stronger in flavour.Escorting the kori gassi in the non-vegetarian thali is the familiar Malabar meen curry with its rich coconut milk infusion and mustard tempering. The truly Konkani verieli vengi (stuffed brinjal in tomato and spice gravy) hits your palette with incredible relish, it looks just like the taut gassi but is tender and sweet. The only lentil dish is mixed ussal which is a twist on the traditional dal and made with six different pulses. It glides pleasantly down the throat and leaves you wanting for more.The exhaustive range of accompaniments has been curated with equal care. The sanna (Goan steamed rice and urad dal cake) goes well with either taut gassi or kori gassi while puli inji (sweet and sour ginger curry) adds a spectacular pungency. The feast ends with a delectable ada pradhaman and neatly brings the entire meal together."
2019-05-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/odisha-cyclone-fani-storm-aftermath-5735431/,Finding Fani,"The trees seem frozen in time. Shorn of leaves, their bare trunks hold up the sky, still stunned by the wind that blew on the morning of May 3. Around them, other trees lie motionless, uprooted, their branches intertwined with high-tension wires, mangled utility poles and heaps of rubble.AdvertisingTwo weeks after the onslaught of Fani, classified by meteorologists as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, the landscape of Central Odisha, pummelled by gusts of wind reaching up to 205 km per hour, stands ravaged beyond recognition.Puri district, along with its temple town, took the worst hit, recording 39 of the total 64 deaths. The state government has declared Puri, along with Khordha, which saw nine deaths, among the extremely severely affected districts. Kendrapara and Jajpur districts recorded three deaths each while Mayurbhanj and Cuttack four and six deaths respectively.Puri District Magistrate Balwant Singh, who took charge on May 6, says that in the days after the cyclone, the immediate priority of the administration was to restore road connectivity. With the telecommunication network completely snapped, officials used VHF (Very High Frequency) sets to maintain contact.AdvertisingSingh says 200 tankers have been pressed into service across the district to supply water while an exercise to assess the damage to housing will be completed in 10 days. Restoring electricity, however, he says, is emerging as the biggest challenge. We have to go in for complete re-electrification of the district. All this electrification work that took years to be done will now have to be wrapped up in a few days, Singh says. The administration has, as a temporary measure, provided over 200 diesel generator sets and put up 400 light towers.The police are also running Karuna Camps to assist people in need. The damage is far higher than what we had anticipated, says IG (Central) S K Priyadarshi. But the fact that there are so few casualties reflects a very successful evacuation exercise. Even the deaths that have taken place are freak ones.While the administration is being lauded for its swift evacuation that helped minimise the death toll, despair and hunger stalk the region. The Odisha government has pegged the total losses in the state at over Rs 11,900 crore, with the storm having flattened homes and wrecked lives.That day, on the morning of May 3, a little before 8 am, the angry swirl of wind had hurtled in from the Bay of Bengal towards the Odisha coast, making landfall at Satapada, a cluster of seven villages in Krushna Prasad block on the banks of Chilika lake, before moving on to Brahmagiri, Puri, Pipili and Bhubaneswar.Krushna Prasad block, PuriHomes razed, social fissures emergeOn May 15, two relief trucks carrying 18 quintals rice, dal and bottles of drinking water  enough to feed the entire village for at least a week  reached Alupatna, a fishing village with around 450 families near Satapada town, where the cyclone had made landfall. The trucks had been sent by Birla Tyres through a tie-up with the local administration.The women of the village talk of how, a day earlier, with the men caught up with tracing their missing dongas (fishing boats), repairing motors and fishing nets, they had taken the lead in getting the relief trucks.We left home at 6 am on May 14 and returned only after midnight. For how long could we have survived on rice, chura and gur? So we rented autos and went from one office to another, says Payal Dalai, a mother of two, talking of how they went knocking on the doors of the District Magistrate, the Additional District Magistrate, the Block Development Officer and the local MLA.For the last two weeks, Payal, along with the others in the village, have been forced to take shelter in the Alupatna secondary school, where a community kitchen has come up.At the school, the men, when not setting out into the sea and the Chilika lake to look for their boats, kill time playing cards, women help out in the community kitchen and children play cricket. While the schools are now shut for the summer break, officials say there could be challenges this academic session since several school buildings  2,134 in Puri and around 6,500 schools across Odisha  have suffered damage in the cyclone.As people sit around talking of the storm that swept their lives aside, fisherman Bhimsen Behera, 40, says he lost his boat, the only source of income for his family of four. One boat comes for around Rs 3 lakh. I also lost most of my fishing net. On an average, each marginal fisherman owns around 50 kg net and 1 kg of net costsRs 750. Then you add labour cost. I dont know if I will be able to revive my business, says Behera, adding that even the fishermen who hadnt lost their boats will now have to spend a lot on repair.Behera wishes he had left before the storm struck. We stayed back despite announcements by the administration to evacuate. Frankly, we didnt realise the damage would be so much. We thought since nothing happened during Phailin (October 2013), this will also blow over, he says.Even senior officials of the state administration  which undertook a massive evacuation exercise involving around 12 lakh people by official estimates  admitted that the damage caused by Fani, the first tropical cyclonic storm to hit India in April since 1956, was much more than what was anticipated.Shuffling a deck of cards at Alupatna, Chandrakant Jali says Fani set Odisha back by at least 10 years. Just as the state was making some progress, comes this. Cyclones have been Odishas bane, says the 22-year-old fisherman.Jishnu Prasad Behra, 22, doing his post-graduation in history from Cuttacks Ravenshaw University, says that as soon as the roads cleared, he came home to Alupatna to help his parents at the relief camp.He says he dreads the damage that a post-monsoon cyclone like Phailin or Hudhud could cause to the already reeling district. After so much destruction, what if there is a cyclone after the rains? Its scary. Already, our fields are useless with all the saline water that came in from the sea.He then walks around to a portion of the school that lies damaged. You see that building? Those were the primary sections. Even I studied there. Its terrible to find it in this state, says Behera, pointing at the structure that may have to be razed to make way for a new building.Down the road from Alupatna is Gorapur Sanabalabhadrapur, another fishing village where nearly every hut has collapsed and close to 80 boats have been washed away.The winds started howling at 6 am. I took shelter in a concrete room at one end of the village and put my children on the ceiling as water from the Chilika was gushing in. Mun bhabuthili mun banchi na thaanti (I thought I will not survive), says Minati Behra, 26, a mother of two.By 8.30 am, she says, the storm had blown away most of the thatched and asbestos roofs in the village and ransacked homes and belongings.Like in Alupatna, most people are sheltered in the village school building, where NGOs run community kitchens, but there is still no steady supply of cooked food.According to official records, the Puri administration has roped in 64 NGOs for running free kitchens, providing dry ration, polythene, solar lights and water bottles. As of now, NGOs are running 37,850 free kitchens in the district.A control centre has been set up at the Collectorate for real-time monitoring of the situation while a separate cell has been established to coordinate with NGOs engaged in relief and rehabilitation.Around 4 km from Alupatna is Baghamunda, a village dominated by Scheduled Castes. Here, under a shed along NH-316 sit a group of women  the village has almost run out of rations and they hope to flag down relief trucks that come that way.They mistake this newspapers team for government representatives and come rushing, pleading for assistance and food.As part of an emergency relief measure after the cyclone, the Odisha government had announced 50 kg rice to every PDS card holder family, apart from Rs 2,000 in cash. Puri district officials claim that by May 16, 93 per cent eligible beneficiaries were given Rs 2,000 cash while 96 per cent got their quota of rice.Later, the state government decided to cover all families, irrespective of whether they are covered under the Food Security Act or not, under the rice and cash scheme.Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also announced that sanitary napkins would be distributed free of cost across cyclone-hit areas over the next two months, apart from 2.5 litres kerosene per family every 10 days.Yet, challenges remain. With most people having run out of cash, several villages in the region have been struggling to survive on just rice, chura and gur. Cooked food isnt available at many places as NGOs have not been able to cover all the villages.Look at us. We have been reduced to beggars. We do not even have spare clothes, says Mina Das, who is among the women from Baghamunda sitting on the highway.The calamity has also laid bare social fissures in the region. At Gopinathpur village, a group of Dalit men blocked the highway leading to Puri, claiming that upper-caste communities had looted relief sent by SC communities in Berhampur, situated along the eastern coastline of the state.Our community members had sent relief meant for us and two other SC villages in the region. After we unloaded our share, the vehicles were on their way to Mirzapur and Golla villages when upper-caste people looted the trucks and took everything away, says Sushant Das, 25.In most of these villages, Dalit families were the worst hit mostly because their kuchha homes could not withstand the ferocity of the storm.Administration officials, however, insisted that while caste-based discrimination has been reported from a few areas, it was not large scale. This particular area is known for such issues. But a disaster is always secular, says Priyadarshi, the Central Odisha division IG.Brahmagiri block, PuriThe long wait for reliefPayal Nayak, 9, was among those who lost their lives in Brahmagiri. A resident of Dharanikudi Kuapada village, Payal, who had a speech impairment since birth, was eating with her father when a brick wall of their house collapsed, fatally injuring her.Payals house took the direct hit of the storm, primarily because it is the last structure in the village, beyond which is the vast expanse of the Chilika.Days after her daughters death, Mamata is alone at home. Her husband is undergoing treatment at the district hospital for the injuries he suffered. We didnt know the storm would come so early. We were told it would come at 5 in the evening, Payal was eating the wall just fell on her, says Mamata, grief stricken and bewildered at how swiftly her daughter had been snatched away. There is a gaping hole where the wall once stood.Mamata rummages through a wooden cupboard for a photograph of Payal, taken a few years ago at a local studio. Her clothes and other belongings have been pulled out from the rubble, packed, and kept in a corner. The cyclone spared Payals Chhota Bheem school bag, which still hangs from one of the doors.According to a report prepared by the Brahmagiri Block Development Office, around 156 villages in the block, with 1.46 lakh people, were affected by Fani. There were eight casualties here, while 11,056 cattle perished.On May 14, around 8 pm, the residents of Bododandi, a village of around 220 families in Brahmagiri, eat their first proper meal of rice and dalma after around a week, courtesy former Dhenkanal MLA Sudhir Shyamal.As the region remains plunged in darkness, the headlights of auto-rickshaws are turned on as men and children sit down to eat in two rows on a lane cutting through the village. Its my first big meal in four days, smiles Anshuman, a six-year-old. The turn of the women comes at the end, after batches of men have had their share.On May 16, a team of the NGO Plan International reaches Jagannathpatna village, nearly 10 km off the Satapada-Brahmagiri highway, close to the Bay of Bengal, with food and other essentials, hours after the villagers wrote a letter to the Brahmagiri BDO seeking urgent assistance.Tushar Kanti Das, a senior executive with the NGO, says each family in the village will be given 10 kg polished rice, 5 kg wheat flour, 2 kg sugar, daal and chura, 1 litre mustard oil and 100 gm turmeric.All this while, they were forced to eat rice with locally available greens. We have told the villagers that they will have to reciprocate by assisting us in cleaning up the village. Otherwise, with the onset of monsoon, things may spiral out of control and children may be severely hit, he says.Puri Sadar block, PuriGetting back on trackAt Puri, Odishas temple town which usually attracts hordes of tourists during this time of the year, hotel owners and tour operators rue a lost season. Yet, the pace of recovery has been the swiftest here.On May 16, 35 of the 150 rooms at Puri Hotel in the heart of the town were occupied, mostly by tourists from neighbouring West Bengal. Some had their tickets booked and didnt cancel. Some are coming just to see what the cyclone has done. While power has not been restored, we are running generator sets. Yesterday, power was restored at Jagannath temple and the Grand Road. We will have to follow the Kerala model and send out a message that Puri is safe, says Yugabrata, a tour operator.The road along the coast, which had disappeared under mounds of sand washed ashore during the storm, has been cleared. Among the severely damaged structures are the District Magistrate residence, the roof of which was blown away. DM Balwant Singh now occupies a room on the ground floor of the building.The Balukhand-Konark wildlife sanctuary, located a few km away from the main Puri town, has almost turned barren, with officials at a loss on how to revive the forest. Harshvardhan Udgata, the Divisional Forest Officer of the area, says the district has lost not less than 50 lakh trees to the storm.Pipli Block, PuriCoordinating reliefOn May 16, Nivedita Sharaf, food procurement officer at the godown of the Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation in Pipili, has a problem on her hands. A convoy of around 50 relief trucks  each carrying around 650 sacks of rice  has stayed queued up outside the godown for the last four days.The trucks were to offload the supplies at a godown at Sakhigopal along the Bhubaneswar-Puri highway, but the authorities of the OSCSC had to turn them away as the godown, with a capacity of 25,000 quintals, had suffered extensive damage in the cyclone. Subsequently, the trucks were diverted to the 500 MT capacity godown at Pipili. But Sharaf says the godown is already stocked to the brim.For the last four days, the officers at our head office have been telling me that the trucks will be diverted. But as long as I dont get official instructions, I cannot do much. The trucks have come here by mistake. I can at best accommodate the stock of five trucks. What will I do with the others? says an exasperated Sharaf.Outside the gates of the godown, patience runs thin among the truckers who are now threatening to block the highway.After hectic negotiations, the trucks are directed to the Brahmagiri godown. But as they reach the godown around 1 pm, officials tell them that it will be another four more days before the trucks are unloaded.There are 49 trucks on the waiting list. And not more than 17-18 trucks can be unloaded in a day. We have already unloaded 15 today. How much more can we do? says Saras Kumar Swain, procurement officer at Brahmagiri.While Odisha counts its losses, the scale of the havoc has made many wonder if things will ever be the same again.Back at the Balukhand forest range office in Puri, Nirmal Patra, 22, one of the seven forest guards of the range, is despondent. Its almost as if a monster has ravaged my beautiful garden in a fit of rage, he says.AdvertisingAround him are tell-tale signs of the destruction  a collapsed BSNL tower, a roof that caved in and a flattened patch of forest."
2019-05-20,https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/over-20-000-mt-wheat-faces-rot/story-rCmyfhfTOdTyQYYE3rlGGJ.html,"Over 20,000 MT wheat faces rot","More than 20,000 metric tonnes of wheat is lying unpacked at the three mandis of the district since the government godowns have been filled with mustard, officials familiar with the matter said.An unusually high procurement of mustard this year by Food and Supplies Department, Haryana State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited (HAFED) and Haryana Warehouse Corporation (HWC) has taken up almost entire storage of 28,000 metric tonnes available in the three mandis of the Gurugram district, officials said. This has triggered fears that nearly 20,000 metric tonnes of unpacked wheat left in the open may rot.A storage nightmareIn Haily Mandi, Pataudi, HAFEDs 14,000-metric-tonne and HWCs 8000-metric-tonne godowns are filled with mustard. The HWCs 6000-metric-tonne storage unit in Farrukhnagar is also packed with mustard. The officials are now finding it difficult to save the huge amount of wheat that is lying at the mercy of elements. As per official estimates, the Haryana government had procured 80,260 metric tonnes of wheat.In the absence of enough storage facility, we have transferred some wheat stock to Tauru godown in Mewat. Some stock has been sent to the Siwari warehouse, said DK Pandey, district manager, HWC.All the government godowns, be it HAFED or HWC, are packed to their capacity with mustard. There is hardly any space to stock wheat. We are trying to create space in the mandi itself to at least lift the remaining stock kept in the open, he said. The HWC is yet to lift over 25% of its wheat procurement. Likewise, HAFED has to lift at least 58% of its 31,733 metric tonnes procured wheat in Haily mandi.Explaining the mustard glutEarlier, the mustard procurement was not done through the commission agents in the state. Local cooperative societies under HAFED used to procure mustard, only if required.Since the minimum support price (MSP) for mustard used to be low and the government did not focus on its procurement, farmers used to sell their produce in the open market at a price less than or equal to the MSP.Also, late purchasing by HAFED last year, forcing the farmers to sell their produce in the local grain market at a price lower than MSP.However, this year mustard farmers were offered an MSP of 4,200 by the central government compared to last years 4,000. Also, this year only those farmers who were registered online under the Meri Fasal, Mera Byora scheme were entitled to sell their crop to the government agencies. More than 6,000 farmers are enrolled with HAFED and HWC.Earlier, the procurement of mustard was never done in such huge quantities. It is for the first time that we were ordered by the state government to procure mustard, says Monika Malik, district food and supplies officer, Gurugram. According to her, compared to last year there has been a 130% increase in the procurement of mustard.To ensure no beneficiary is left behind, the government had put a cap of purchasing 25 quintals per farmer per day. But due to a bumper crop, almost every farmer from the nearby villages sold his produce twice in the mandi.As per Nafed, production of mustard crop, the main oilseed of rabi season, is estimated at 8.4 million tonne in 2018-19, up from 7.5 million tonne a year ago.Bishan Singh, a farmer in Mubarakpur had sold his entire 38 quintals of the mustard, grown on six acres of land. I sold the yield in two instalments and have received the payment.However, Mohan Lal had to sell his excess mustard produced on his 30 acres of land in the open market. After selling the mustard twice in Mandi, I couldnt sell the remaining stock. Therefore, I had to sell it in the open market at a price lower than the MSP, he said.The average prices of mustard were 8-20% lower than its MSP of 4,200 per quintal in major mandis of Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat during April 1-May 7, according to official data.Packaging woes for wheatTalking to HT, Mangeram Beniwal, district manager, HAFED, who operates from Faridabad said, We have a total storage capacity of 14,000 metric tonnes, of which 10,000 metric tonnes has been given to mustard. We have stored only 4,000 metric tonnes wheat.Therefore, we are keeping the stock of packed wheat in the open.The real problem, however, for Beniwal is to get the remaining stock packed by the licensed commission agents, who are demanding complete payment.Commission agents or aarhtis are licensed under the market committees. They assign labourers to weigh and fill the stock in gunny bags of 50 kilogrammes each.It also includes stitching of each bag and loading into the trucks. They get a commission of 2.5% per quintal, based on the minimum support price of each crop.The department has already cleared 80% payment for agents who are licensed to lift the procured stock. As per the order, we cannot pay until the entire lifting is done. Complete payment does not guarantee that they would finish packing and arranging the stock, said Beniwal.But agents are adamant. They have refused to lift the stock kept in open until their dues are cleared.Hence, the wheat is likely to rot if unseasonal rains, like the ones witnessed a couple of days ago, hit the district again.HAFED officials are adamant they wont pay us until we lift the entire stock. We are asking them to clear our payment, said Anand Goyal, who works as a commission agent in Haily Mandi.It can be expected, in the ongoing tussle for payment and lack of space, the wheat stock might be left to rot.First Published: May 20, 2019 06:44 IST"

Let there be a floor test. We are not bothered because we enjoy majority and have proved it before, he told reporters at the PCC office.Nath said the legislators were offered an amount ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 25 crore each by the Opposition party. The Congress leader also dismissed the exit polls as entertainment polls.AdvertisingLeader of Opposition Gopal Bhargav had on Monday written a letter to the Governor requesting her to direct the Chief Minister to call a special session to discuss important issues like water shortage and deteriorating law and order situation. He also said the party could demand a floor test once the discussion was over.Nath wrote to Bhargav on Tuesday giving details of the steps taken by his government to address problems faced by the people. He said the Congress government was sworn in on December 17 and fulfilled 85 promises made in the partys manifesto within 73 days before the model code of conduct kicked in.Though you left empty coffers, we waived loans of 21 lakh farmers, the letter said, adding the government has continued schemes launched under the previous government. Accusing the BJP of misleading farmers on procurement and payment, Nath said that more than 68 lakh tonnes of wheat, chana, lentil and mustard have been procured so far and farmers paid within seven days.Pointing to deficient rains for drinking water shortage, the Chief Minister said more money has been allocated for providing drinking water in rural and urban areas. Denying the charge that the law and order situation had deteriorated in the state, Nath said the general election was conducted peacefully and the administration acted quickly in cases of crime.Its clear that your letter was not based on facts but conjectures and imagination, the Chief Minister said, adding that his government was ready to discuss issues related to welfare of people.Meanwhile, the BJP slammed the Congress government for arresting Bunti Sahu, who contested against Kamal Nath in the Assembly by-election from Chhindwara, and 21 poll agents in an old case. The BJP alleged that false cases were lodged against BJP workers and they were arrested two days before the day of counting so that the Congress could have its way.Calling it an attack on democracy, the BJP approached the Election Commission and sought its intervention. Alleging that the Congress wants to keep BJP poll agents away from the counting centre, the BJP has demanded immediate release of Sahu and others, warning the government of consequences.The CMs media coordinator Narender Saluja claimed Sahu and others had surrendered before the police on Tuesday. He said BJP workers were booked for violation of code of conduct after they gheraoed the Kotwali police station. They were booked under Section 188 and were granted bail immediately after arrest. He said the allegation that they were arrested to stop them from participating as poll agents was baseless."
2019-06-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/the-coolest-job-in-churu-mahavir-ice-cream-rajasthan-heatwave-5771426/,The coolest job in Churu,"At noon, Naya Bass, one of the busiest localities in Rajasthans Churu district, is deserted. Amidst the hot loo that blows in carrying grains of sand are occasional silhouettes of men and women, mostly daily-wage labourers. Bent, they walk slowly, wet towels wrapped around their heads as the sun breathes fire on Churu. A day earlier, on June 3, this was the hottest place in the world  according to at least one weather mapping website, the mercury had risen up to 50.3 degrees Celsius. In one corner of Naya Bass, under a neem tree, stands an ice-cream cart with Mahaveer Ice-Cream Centre written in white paint.AdvertisingSitting on a plastic chair behind the ice-cream cart, a white cloth partially covering his head and face, Shankarlal Choudhary, 30, looks upwards at the sky wryly and says, I thought this spot under the tree would be slightly cooler, but at this time in Churu, no matter where you go, you just cant avoid the sun.Choudhary says he has been here since 9.30 am and has had only six customers so far. Majboori hai, rozi roti ke liye karna padta hai. Warna is garmi mein koi bahar nikalta hai kya (Its a compulsion I have to do it to earn my living. Otherwise, why would someone venture out in this heat), says Choudhary, meticulously removing wood sticking out of ice-cream sticks while keeping a lookout for the rare pedestrian.Badaam shake, strawberry ice-cream, faluda, Choudhary calls out every time he sees a potential customer approaching the stall, mostly daily-wage labourers or students. The latter, he says, especially like to buy the ice-cream cones, priced at Rs 10 each. Its the strawberry-flavoured ice-cream and badaam shake that are the most popular among customers.AdvertisingChoudharys cart is owned by Rameshwar Choudhary, a resident of Churu, who has three other such outlets in the town. Rameshwar prepares the ice-cream at his house and sends it to the carts. The ingredients for the faluda and shakes are also made by the owner, and Choudhary gives them the finishing touches when a customer places an order.Rameshwar gets to keep all the money from the sales and Choudhary is given a monthly salary of Rs 9,000.I have been doing this job for nearly seven years. Every year, between March and September, I sell ice-cream from this cart, says Choudhary.Situated in the heart of Rajasthans Shekhawati region, with a mixed population of Rajputs, Jats and Muslims, Churu makes headlines not just in the summer months but also winter, for registering the coldest temperatures in the state. Unlike other parts of Rajasthan, Churu does not get many tourists, and the arid climate and large stretches of desert land that border the district offer little scope for agriculture.Choudhary says maximum ice-cream sales happen in the months of June, July and August, when at times his earnings go up to Rs 1,800 in a day. Most of my customers are locals who are forced to step out in the heat to run daily errands, says Choudhary, adding he cant really complain about the weather  after all, its the heat that brings more customers to his cart.But on hot days like these when the hours stretch endlessly, he misses his family  his wife and two sons  in Sharda village in Bhilwara district. The younger one is just five years old. But I am glad that he isnt here in this heat. It would have been unbearable, says Choudhary.Just then, he stands up, pushing back his plastic chair, spotting a customer walking up to his cart. Nadeem Khan, 24, orders a glass of badaam shake and moves to the farthest corner under the tree to avoid the heat. An Armyman posted in Pune, Khan is a resident of Churu and is home on leave.My friends in Pune often complain that the heat is unbearable there during summer. It makes me laugh. I tell them they should come to Churu if they want to see what real summers are like, says Khan, taking a sip of his drink.By 2.30 pm, the road looks even more deserted. A lone horse cart ferrying watermelons drives by, the animal panting every few steps.Choudhary counts the days earnings so far  a little over Rs 400. The owner of the cart will be happy, he says, if he makes around Rs 1,500 by 9 pm.A little after 3.30 pm, mini tankers from the local civic body splash water, but the road hisses and the water evaporates in a few minutes. Choudhary puts his head down on the edge of the cart and dozes off.The only sounds are of the trucks rumbling down the Churu-Jaipur road and the whirr of the sugarcane juice machine on the opposite footpath.Choudhary is woken up by Bhagoti Devi, who has taken a break from work for a kulfi  she is a labourer and is paid Rs 300 for a days work.I dont really understand whats the big deal about the heat. Do we have the choice of sitting and not working when its too hot? Who will feed us then? she says, paying Choudhary and wrapping her sari even more tightly around her face before walking away.Suddenly, Choudhary notices a problem  the ice inside his cart has started melting. I had filled the cart with ice at 9.30 am and half of it has already melted. I have to pay Rs 160 every day for the ice. There will be customers in the evening. I hope the ice lasts the day, says Choudhary, sprinkling some salt over the ice to keep it from melting. But this doesnt seem to be working and there are big droplets of water on the box.Shortly after his damage control measure, Choudhary faces another problem. A man has occupied the spare chair beside him meant for customers, clutching an open can of beer.Choudhary asks the man to leave, worrying his presence will keep away customers. The middle-aged man slurs and stutters, before finally standing up. But his effort doesnt last long and he goes down once again, this time spreadeagled under the neem tree, the empty beer can lying beside him.Everybody wants to be here, under the tree shade, says Choudhary before slumping back on his chair. At times, the heat becomes so unbearable I try one of my own ice-creams to keep cool, says Choudhary. Like his customers, his favourite too is the strawberry-flavoured ice-cream.In the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan that has the districts of Sikar, Churu and Jhunjhunu, the sunlight lingers well beyond 7.30 pm. Thats when Choudhary and fellow vendors do the most business, catering to people who have finally come out of their homes, some still with their faces covered against the hot wind that continues to blow.Almost everyone who turns up at the stall discusses the weather. During winter, its the opposite in Churu. Temperatures often go below zero degree Celsius and the nights are freezing, says Krishna Kumar, one of Choudharys customers.The talk of winter months stirs memories of home for Choudhary. I will be home by then, with my family, and busy sowing mustard in our field, he says. Until he heads to Churu next summer.AdvertisingAround 9 pm, Choudhary gets ready to call it a day. As he pushes his cart to his one-room accommodation near a local temple in the town, another sweltering day in Churu awaits him."

This is a significant festival for the Tiwas, one of the major ethnic groups of Assam.The two-day Wanchuwa festival is usually marked by the sacrifice of a pig and prayers being offered for a bountiful harvest.As spring comes to an end with a flourish and makes way for the rains, Tiwa communities in Karbi Anglong district perform the ritual sacrifice, which is accompanied by dances performed by young men of the community wearing brilliant tangerine head scarves. Following traditional custom, women winnow rice grains by hand and the men then ceremonially pound the rice into powder in large wooden mortars. Brewing fresh rice beer is also a major part of the festival.Agriculture is the mainstay of the 3.16 lakh-strong Tiwa community, who practise shifting cultivation and grow paddy, sesame, ginger, mustard and chilli.The Tiwas believe strongly that the Wanchuwa festival with its sacrifices, dances and rituals blesses seedlings and wards off natural calamities that damage the harvest.(Images and Text by Ritu Raj Konwar)"

The monthly entitlement of five kilogrammes of foodgrains per person of eligible households under the priority category, as well as 35kg per family under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) is ensured under the NFSA.The beneficiaries have to pay Rs 2 per kg for wheat, Rs 13.50 for sugar and Rs 20 for mustard oil.First Published: Jun 12, 2019 04:04 IST"

He then dug a tube well, which gave water for 3-4 years before it went dry.He said, When there was no water, I got another tube well dug at a depth of 100-feet, which was giving little water. I came to know about recharging of dry wells through rainwater harvesting done at Bawanpura village, so I decided to get the structure build in my fields too.Bairwa in 2018 got the structure made and his well got water and as the result there was enough water in the second tube well due to which he had sown wheat in 2018-19 Rabi season along with mustard.He said, Due to availability of water, the yields were 10%-15% more and income too increased by around 20%. Prior to 2018, in kharif nothing is sown as there was no water and in rabi season, only mustard was sown as it requires less water compared to wheat, he informed.The soil in villages in Chaksu panchayat samiti is clayey as a result water does not percolate into the ground hence it gets accumulated in the fields or flow into nearby rivulet or river or other land during rains.Kumarappa Institute of Gram Swaraj (KIGS), a Jaipur based NGO took the initiative of recharging dry wells through rainwater harvesting and chose Chaksu panchayat samiti. KIGS project director Amit Kumar said in 2016, a model of this system was made at Bawanpur village to showcase to villagers of nearby villages. Villagers saw the model and recharge structures were made in 15 wells in2017-18. Kumar said, out of 15 wells water table increased from2 to 17 feet in eight wells. Similarly, Rajendra Gurjar (25) of Thuni Madanmohanpura village said he has 4.5 hectares of land and his well dried in 2012. He said during rainy season bajra crop is sown and in winters mustard was sown. Now he got the structure made and depending on the rains will sow wheat this rabi season. Earlier in kharif he used to get ~30,000-~40,000 by selling bajra, but this year, he expects that by sowing wheat, he will earn ~1.20 lakh. Mishri Lal (62) of Garhi Lashkari village too has built the structure and his income has gone up.Shankar Lal (40) of Garudwasi village is getting the structure constructed and hopes that with good rains this year, he will get the dried well recharged and will get good yields in Rabi season. I have recently come to know about this structure and is getting it constructed before monsoon, Lal said.Kumar said each structure costs approximately ~40,000 and he is collecting money from philanthropists. This year, 25 dry wells will be recharged, he added. .KIGS project director said preference is given to deep dried wells. Recharge water pans (pits) of size 6x7x4 feet are constructed in farmers fields to collect surface water run off during rainy season.During rains, the rainwater from the field is directed to these collection pits. The water then enters the collection pits via a series of trenches or pipes thus replenishing the water tables and aquifers.First Published: Jun 12, 2019 13:48 IST"

2019-06-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/maharashtra-moef-seeks-report-on-gm-crop-sowing-in-state-5779706/,Maharashtra: MoEF seeks report on GM crop sowing in state,"The Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) has sought a detailed report on the sowing of unapproved genetically modified (GM) cotton and brinjal in Maharashtra.AdvertisingJoint Secretary Richa Sharma has written to Ajoy Kumar Mehta, Chief Secretary of Maharashtra, to investigate the matter and take appropriate action. On Monday, more than 1,000 farmers had publicly sown unapproved transgenic cotton and brinjal in Akoli Jahangir village of Akot taluka in Akola district. Organised by the farmers union Shetkari Sanghtana, the gathering was aimed at demanding introduction of Herbicide Tolerant (Ht) Bt cotton and Bt brinjal, which farmers said reduces the cost of production.In India, introduction of GM seeds requires approval of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), a body under the MoEF. To date, commercial release is granted for Bt cotton, but similar approvals for Bt mustard and Bt brinjal are awaited.In case of cotton, the first two generations of Bt have seen introduction of Cry1Ab and Cry2Bc genes from the soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), into the cotton seed, which make the crop resistant to the attack of pink bollworm. The third generation variety saw the addition of Cp4-Epsps gene from another soil bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which produces a modified protein that allows the plant to withstand herbicide glyphosate. Farmers are not able to spray glyphosate on normal cotton because the chemical does not distinguish between the crop and weed, but the herbicide tolerant Bt (HtBt) cotton remains unaffected by glyphosate.AdvertisingLike the first two hybrids, Ht Bt has also been developed by the US giant Bayer Monsanto. Usage of such hybrids can attract jail term of five years as well as fine of Rs 1 lakh under the Environmental Protection Act of 1989. Action can be initiated under the Seed Act, 1966 and the Cotton Act of 1957.In her letter, the joint secretary referred to complaints received from Coalition for GM Free India regarding suspected open cultivation of Ht Bt cotton and Bt brinjal in Maharashtra, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. I request you to immediately order an investigation and verify the facts on grounds and conduct gene/event specific testing for suspected illegal cultivation of GM crops. Appropriate action may be taken to stop any illegal GM cultivation in accordance with the Rules for the Manufacture Use/Import/Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro Organisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells (1989), the letter read. Akola Collector Jitendra Papalkar said they had sent samples to Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CIRC). Once the results come, appropriate action will be initiated, he said."

2019-06-14,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cashews-chilli-coconut-kunal-vijayakar-on-the-holy-trinity-of-karwari-cuisine/story-QJap7AjpLYBjBEwbpZ4y0L.html,"Cashews, chilli, coconut: Kunal Vijayakar on the holy trinity of Karwari cuisine","This is a battle that is worth the fight. Oh no, the battle is not between countries, clans or communities; its a war between coconut, chilli and cashews. Let me put forth the question at the outset. Is the food that comes from Karwar (a tiny village in Karnataka, just across the border from Goa) closer to Malwani, Goan or Mangalorean food? The simple answer is that it is all three.Like all three, the Karwari cuisine revels in the abundance of fish, the lusciousness of coconut and an anthology of spices. I have had the privilege of eating in several Karwari homes, and have devoured classics like Gavathi Kombdi (desi chicken curry) with Vade, Kurlya Suke (crab masala) with the classic Karwari Kaala Vatana (or black pea) Usal and the daily Upkari (dry vegetable with coconut) with a spicy Muga Ambat (sprouted moong in coconut and spices).Everything, vegetarian and non-vegetarian, fish and poultry, root and vegetable, is considered incomplete without coconut. I have devoured this food with great rapture and gluttony, and on deliberation I have to confess that Karwari cuisine is profoundly kindred to Mangalorean food, and is less like the individualistic, fearless and diverse cooking styles of Maharashtra and Goa.Like all intimately regional cuisines, the Karwari too has thrived only because of the recipes, methods, formulas and rubrics handed down by generations of grandmothers, mothers and cooks. Till I bumped into Sudha Kamat and her beautifully photographed and detailed cookbook, The Karwar Palate. Each page systematically and comprehensively illustrates the variety, nuances and amplitude of Karwari food.Karwar is on the coast of Northern Karnataka, and unlike Goan cuisine, Karwari cooking did not succumb to the influence of the Portuguese. Karwari food has one hero and one heroine without whom there would be no drama. The hero is coconut and the heroine is the Byadagi chilli.Coconut is paramount and is used in all its forms. It is sometimes ground with spices, often just grated and added to vegetables; usually the milk is extracted and used in curries.The Byadagi chilli is a sweet, not-so-spicy thing grown in the Bellary, Haveri, Shimoga and Chitradurga regions of Karnataka. It is long and crumpled and imparts such a bright red colour that the oil of the chilli is also used to tint confectionary, beverages, nail polish and lipstick.No Karwari dish is complete without the flaming colour of the Byadagi chilli, and in her book Kamat lists recipes from her mother that pair it with native ingredients like jackfruit, raw mango, cucumber, drumsticks, cashews, and of course meat and fish.The book starts with concoctions for the variety of masalas that form the base of most of the dishes  like the localised garam masala, aamti masala, Malwani masala and kholombo masala. Kholombo is actually a vegetable and lentil preparation and the masala (a mixture of spices used commonly in Karnataka and Goa) is a bit like the south Indian sambhar powder.Next, in the book, come the chutneys, or as they are called in Konkani, Tond Lanvache. One such chutney is the Saasam, starring fried mustard seeds; it goes very well with neer dosa.The chutneys are followed by Fodis or fritters and it seems like the Karwaris make fritters out of everything, including brinjal, doodhi, raw bananas and jackfruit.The Pachadi is next. This is a mildly spiced coconut and yogurt-based raita made with vegetables and tempered with curry leaves and dried chillies. Much like the Pachadis cooked in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.Sudhas book then goes on to unravel the treasure trove of Karwari accompaniments, starting with the spicy Sungta Lonche or prawn pickle, and a unique recipe for red Karwari papads. There are also recipes for snacks like Biskut Ambada (a Karwari version of the Medu Wada made from urad daal); sweet rice pancakes called Dashmis; and Kalingad Dosa, made with freshly grated watermelon.Fish frying is an art in this coastal cuisine. The fish is usually shallow fried after being marinated in the right amount of spice, sourness and salt. Lightly coated with coarse flour, it emerges soft on the inside and crisp and fluffy on the outside.The most popular Karwari fish curry is the Ambat. Whether it is made with mackerel or pomfret, prawn or crab, the recipe for an Ambat is the same  spices, Byadagi chillies, coconut, kokum and triphal. Its a fiery red, but not-so-spicy coconut curry that must be eaten with rice and a slice of fried fish and washed down with a glassful of Sol Kadhi.Sudha Kamats book on the Karwar palate is quite encyclopaedic, and I have to confess that the cuisine is elaborate but at the same time simple to make. All you need is a recipe, the right spices, some coconut and the craving for something new.First Published: Jun 14, 2019 21:29 IST"

Any guesses? Ask a Bengali and he/she will promptly tell you, Of course! Its the gondhoraj lebu (lime) thats missing!Over centuries, gondhoraj lebu has been a welcome guest in Bengali households and even today, it is considered as a dear relative of all types of dal and in some cases, fish and chicken curries cooked in the kitchen.Known to be a cousin of kaffir lime and having no such English word in the dictionary, gondhoraj keeps its head held high as the ultimate king of aromas, the essence of which can be felt even from a few metres away. Oh! Calcutta in Church Street is hosting the Gondhoraj Cocktail and Mocktail fest, and true to its spirit, we went Oh! Gondhoraj after the meal.To beat the heat, we were offered Gondhoraj Lychee Cooler, which was simply aromatic, fruity and soothing. The lime and its leaves did the magic of accentuating the magical aroma and lychees in the drink put in more flavour, turning the mocktail into an absolute delight. My dining companion had the Gondhoraj Lychee Caipiroshka, a vodka-based cocktail infused with flavours of the East. The vodka-mixed lychees gathered at the bottom of the glass gave a nice kick to the start of a sumptuous Bengali dinner ahead.Oh! Calcuttas fortnight-long summer food festival, Grishher Khabar, includes innovative yet traditional recipes, keeping in mind the ingredients that are essential to the summer cuisine. For starters, we had Sosha Diye Bhapa Maach, which is steamed boneless fish with cucumber and mustard. Soft bhetki fish topped with slices of cucumber melted in our mouth, with the right amount of spices and mustard that left our Bengali taste buds wanting some more.Coming to the course that is fit for a king, we were served rice along with Jhinge Pabda Aam Jhol, Lau Chingri, Doi Moricher Mangsho, Kancha Aam Diye Maacher Paturi and Enchorer Dalna. Only a Bong will understand the feeling of maa er haater ranna, (moms cooking), especially when he/she is living outside Bengal, and the main course reminded us of just that.The Jhinge Pabda dish, which is butterfish cooked with green mango and ridge gourd, is known for its amazing health benefits. Although the fish was not too fresh, the flavour came out really well, as anything that has hints of raw mango gives a tantalising taste to it.Lau Chingri, or bottle gourd cooked with prawns, is again a common dish prepared back home. With the right amount of ginger, tempered with dry red chillies and cumin, we loved this dish with rice.Chicken or mutton, when cooked with yoghurt, gives a creamy scrumptious flavour to the meat, and Doi Moricher Mangsho was no exception. The mutton, stewed in a clay pot, was cooked with yoghurt and black pepper and its richness got to us quite well.The Maacher Paturi, which is steamed fish marinated with mustard paste and wrapped in banana leaf, was marinated with green mango and stood out as our favourite. It was as soft as it could get, and the spices helped amp up the flavour. The jackfruit cooked in onion and tomato gravy (Enchorer Dalna) was wholesome, which we relished till the end of the course.Lastly, we ordered Nolen Gurer ice-cream, which is date palm jaggery added to the dessert, and ended our dinner on a sweet note. The summer food festival is on till June 25 and cost for two is Rs 1,700 (approx)."

But after noticing the scheme received a lukewarm response up to June 15, from the particularly selected areas, the agriculture department extended the scheme for entire areas in the above-mentioned seven districts along with extending the date up to June 24.Now, since the area has been extended, the agriculture officials claim that their registration targets of covering 50,000 hectares under maize will be completed within the allotted period of time.The farmers who are registering under this scheme want the government to fulfill its promise and procure the production of maize, soybean and arhar on the minimum support price (MSP).Pardeep Meel, Kurukshetra deputy director agriculture (DDA) said, we were given a target of registering 7,000 hectares of land under crop diversification scheme, and till June 18, we have registered around 7,200 hectares of land and the figure will jump up till the last date.Dr Girish Nagpal, Ambala DDA said, we have a target of covering 8,000 hectares and till date 4,556 hectares have been registered under crop diversification.Surender Singh Yadav, Yamunanagar DDA said, Our target is covering 3,000 hectares as the rainfall graph of the district is higher as compared to other areas and we have a large flood-prone agricultural area along the banks of Yamuna river. Till date, 950 hectares of area under diversification is registered.Farmers leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said, transparency of any scheme is a must, every scheme is adopted first by the farmers, but its success rate depends if the government fulfills the promises made under it. There are many crops in Rabi and Kharif seasons that require less water like masur dal, mustard, chickpeas, soybean, bajra and other cereals but the difficulty is that the farmers do not get MSP on these crops and there is no guarantee of procurement by government agencies. The government must give a guarantee of the procurement and increase the MSP if they want to promote crop diversification and also invest budget in rainwater harvesting and strengthen the infrastructure to store water getting wasted in seasonal rivers."

Why not? Such a wedding is happening for the first time in Auli, said Rekha.AdvertisingThe two friends are not on the exclusive guest list for the Rs 200-crore wedding extravaganza of the two sons of controversial business brothers Atul and Ajay Gupta in Auli, 16 km from Joshimath, but have showed up like hundreds others to simply watch.At 3,000m above sea level, Auli, an alpine meadow, has never been the centre of attention. From December-March, adventure junkies drive up for skiing  otherwise, the tiny hill station is a pit-stop for devotees on their way to Badrinath.Last week, however, Auli entered the news cycle when the Uttarakhand High Court slammed the state governments decision to allow the extravagant wedding at the pristine site, after a resident filed a petition against the event.AdvertisingOn June 18, the High Court ordered the Gupta brothers to deposit Rs 3 crore to the District Magistrate of Chamoli for restoration after the event, and directed that two monitoring assistants be deputed at the site to ensure measures suggested by the Court and the state pollution control board are adhered to.But then, the Gupta brothers are not new to controversy  from becoming one of the most influential families in South Africa, with a business empire spanning computers, mining and media, after they moved from UPs Saharanpur to their dubious links to former president Jacob Zuma; from moving to Dubai following corruption charges in 2018 to this big, fat wedding in Uttarakhand.In Auli, people spend Rs 2-3 lakh on a wedding, we want to see what a Rs 200-crore wedding is like and we cant show up in everyday clothes for that, so we bought new saris, said Rekha, 41, who is the local Congress mahila committee president, while Lalita, 44, is a BJP member.We had never heard of Guptaji before this he has made Auli and Joshimath world famous. But there are no arrangements for locals. We have come from our villages to see it but theres no food for us, not even a free chairlift ride. We had to pay Rs 500 each. We are giving you Auli, what are you giving us? asked 85-year-old Navmi Devi. She had travelled from a village two hours away after a local resident told her that Guptaji has asked everyone to come and attend the wedding, have all meals here.All the staff has come from Delhi but theyve hired some men from Auli to help with decorations and arrangement we are being paid Rs 1,000 a day. Its good money but such few people have been employed. How is this tourism for us? asked a 50-year-old labourer in his fifth day on the job here.The Guptas, meanwhile, are going all out for the wedding of Ajays son Suryakant with Kritika Singhal, daughter of Suresh Singhal, a Delhi-based diamond merchant, on June 20; and Atuls son Shashanks wedding with Shivangi Jalan, daughter of Dubai-based businessman Vishal Jalan. Rajesh Gupta is the third brother in the family.In Auli, barring one homestay, all hotels have been booked for the weddings, which started on June 17 and will go on till June 22. The main venue is Cliff Top hotel, decorated like the valley of flowers, and teeming with Bollywood and TV celebrities and musicians  from Katrina Kaif and Badshah to Kailash Kher and Shruti Pathak. Baba Ramdevs close aide Balkrishna was present at Suraykants wedding Thursday and the Uttarakhand Chief Minister is expected to attend Shashanks Saturday."
2019-06-23,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/desperate-farmers-switching-to-illegal-gm-crops/story-q0MfEVQHeeHtqsWFMhuJ2H.html,Desperate farmers switching to illegal GM crops,"Desperate for breakthrough technologies as they struggle with a rough patch in traditional agriculture, thousands of farmers across states, some of them in open defiance of the law, are embracing illegal genetically modified (GM) crops  from Bt brinjal to herbicide tolerant (HT) cotton.Despite the risk of prosecution, farmers in Maharashtra are growing illegal HT cotton, which has not been cleared for commercial cultivation, responding to a call by Shetkari Sangathana, an influential farmers organization in the western state.Shetkari Sangathana, founded by the late Sharad Anantrao Joshi, a former MP, has traditionally advocated free markets and ready access to global technologies for farmers, is protesting the governments freeze on new GM technologies. One cultivator was arrested on June 17 in the states Buldhana district.Under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, planting unapproved GM seed varieties can attract a five-year jail term and a fine of up to 1 lakh.The open defiance by farmers comes amid a downturn in agriculture blamed on the double whammy of bumper crops and unremunerative prices, and frequent droughts in parts of the country where the June-to-September south-west monsoon is the lifeline of farming. At least 700 million people in India depend, directly or indirectly, on agriculture for a livelihood. And the health of the agricultural economy shapes the health of the rural economy.On June 10, Shetkari Sangathana organised an event in the states Akola district where farmers pledged to sow illegal HT cotton. Responding to the call, farmers are growing this illegal variety openly in the states Yavatmal, Jalna, Aurangabad and Amravati regions.In April, authorities forced Jeevan Saini, a farmer from Haryanas Fatehabad district, to destroy his brinjal crop after it was found to be a banned GM variety. I was told that this is a better variety. I dont know that I was growing something illegal, he said over the phone.In February 2010, after nationwide consultations with scientists, farmers and other stakeholders, then-environment minister Jairam Ramesh announced an indefinite moratorium on commercialisation of Bt Brinjal. He said at the time that the moratorium will last till independent scientific studies establish Bt Brinjals long-term impact on human health, biodiversity and environment.Saini may or may not have known that he was growing a GM brinjal variety not officially approved for cultivation, but Indian farmers have always craved new technology that promises to improve yields, cut costs and fetch higher returns.India has been the biggest exporter of cotton but now farmers are losing out to competition. Labour costs are rising. The government is holding back new technologies, hurting the interests of farmers, said Ajit Narde, a leader of the Shetkari Sangathana.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), Indias biotech regulator, wrote to the chief secretary of Maharashtra on June 12 to initiate action to stop cultivation of illegal HT cotton, an official said, requesting anonymity.GM crops are those whose genes have been altered for a certain benefit, such as higher yields or pest resistance. But they are also controversial. Those opposed to it cite risks associated with the environment or health.HT cotton, grown globally since 1995, is designed to withstand herbicides, which kills weeds but leaves the plant unaffected. This results in significant savings on labour costs.These are latest incidents in a country where the regulatory framework has failed to curb illegal varieties since India in 2002 approved BT cotton, the only GM crop to be allowed so far.The circumstances back then were similar to what they are now. Authorities approved BT cotton after it was found that the crop was already being grown illegally on a very large scale so not approving it was futile.In fact, unapproved HT cotton has been grown for the past two years across states such as Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, according to a government report.In 2018, the government set up a Field Inspection and Scientific Evaluation Committee (FISEC) based on instructions of the Prime Ministers Office to assess the illegal HT cotton seed market. The FISEC report recommended destruction of all HT cotton seeds seized by authorities.Those opposed to GM crops say that it is not difficult to crack down on the illegal GM seed market. Authorities need to look at the whole supply chain. The government also needs to amend the law to make GM developers solely responsible for any leakage of unapproved seeds, said Kavitha Kuruganthi of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture.The FISEC report, however, noted that consultation with farmers showed that they were very satisfied with the technology which is less labour-intensive and hence is cost-beneficial.Scientists say this regulatory ambiguity over GM technologies is baffling. We are in a silly situation, says Deepak Pental, a biotechnologist and former Delhi University vice-chancellor whose state-funded GM mustard did not receive a final clearance despite being approved initially.Either you clearly say you are against GM...Farmers need technology. You should have technologies that are safe and sound. This ambiguity has done great harm, Pental said, adding Once you fall back on science, it will be very difficult to catch up.Kuruganthi said farmers taking to illegal GM crops were a sign of the governments failure in providing acceptable agricultural solutions. They have no choices.First Published: Jun 23, 2019 07:13 IST"

2019-06-26,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/crop-insurance-scheme-time-to-reboot-pms-flagship-scheme-let-it-be-weather-based-farmers-5801623/,Crop Insurance: Time to reboot PM’s flagship scheme; let it be weather-based,"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has threatened to shut the shops of insurance companies for not paying farmers crop loss claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).AdvertisingThe Union Agriculture Ministrys own data, based on a Parliament question reply on June 21, shows that insurance firms have approved only Rs 9,473 crore out of the Rs 13,471.44 crore estimated claims made for the 2018 kharif season. Further, actual claims paid so far are just Rs 8,540.11 crore. This, despite more than 7-8 months after the bulk of last years kharif crop being harvested. As for the 2018-19 rabi crop, whose harvesting was completed by May, the admissible claims have not yet been worked out in most of the states.A major cause of delayed claims settlement is crop cutting experiments (CCE) that now form the basis for assessing yield losses.The PMFBYs operational guidelines require state governments to carry out at least four CCEs in every village panchayat for every notified crop and submit the yield data to insurance companies within a month from the date of harvest. Given the roughly 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in India, it means undertaking 10 lakh CCEs in a single season. The numbers will be higher if more than one crop is grown in the same village or even by the same farmer.AdvertisingGetting states to do so many CCEs in a short time span has, not surprisingly, proved to be the biggest impediment to proper implementation of the Narendra Modi governments flagship crop insurance scheme. Insurance firms are supposed to pay claims within two months of completion of CCEs that generate actual yield data to estimate losses vis--vis seven-year average thresholds. Since that doesnt come on time, it leads to delays in farmers getting their claims as well.There is a way out of this mess, though. That solution could come from automatic weather stations (AWS). These machines  basically automated versions of traditional weather stations costing Rs 50,000-100,000 each, which includes installation expenses that may vary according to location  measure simple parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and rainfall. They can capture this data every 10 minutes or so and transmit it on an hourly basis through mobile communication to a remote computer/cloud server.The weather data recorded by the AWS sensors are a good proxy for yields. A spike in March temperatures, for instance, translates into poor grain-filling in wheat  just as below-normal rains during July-August are bad for most kharif crops, high relative humidity at this time is conducive for pest infestation in cotton, and heavy winds in February-March may cause damage to the standing mustard or chana. 80-90 per cent of crop yield losses are clearly attributable to the said weather parameters, which can be measured, recorded and archived in data loggers using AWS.The Uttar Pradesh government is in the process of floating tenders for installation, operation and maintenance of 2,750 AWS. Each of them, to be installed at specific locations based on geospatial mapping, would cover an area of 10 square km. Simply put, we will now have accurate weather data for almost the states entire crop land. This will be available for not just every district having, say, a 100-sq km area, but even a cluster of villages within a tehsil or block. The data, in turn, can be used to implement a weather index-based crop insurance programme, said a top UP government official.According to Jatin Singh, managing director of Skymet Weather Services Pvt. Ltd, insurance companies would be willing to accept products based on data from AWSs. They need some basis for paying out claims. CCEs, conducted by state revenue or agriculture department official, take time. Insurers cant be blamed for not paying until they get reliable yield data. But with AWS data, there is more transparency, less moral hazard and claims settlement can be quick, which is what farmers would also want. You could even implement this scheme using blockchain technology, to enable automated verification of claims and payments, he pointed out.There are an estimated 15,000 AWSs currently in India. Of these, 10,000-odd are operated by private companies such as Skymet, National Collateral Management Services and Weather Risk Management Services Pvt. Ltd, and the rest by various Central/state government departments and universities. Skymet  which claims to have 6,500-plus weather sensors  has already installed over 2,000 AWSs across Maharashtra under Mahavedh, a public-private partnership project. It envisages establishing an AWS network at the rate of one machine for every revenue circle, covering 12-sq km area in lowlands and 5 sq km for highlands.Then question to ask is: Can these state government-promoted initiatives make crop insurance a viable proposition for farmers (insurance firms are certainly making a killing at present, with their gross premium collections far exceeding payouts). And can they help salvage PMFBY?"
2019-06-27,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-based-keeraikadaicom-plans-to-take-its-greens-to-chennai-and-bengaluru-too/article28181592.ece,Where keerai is king,"Green dosa is a conversation starter. G. Sriram Prasad, the founder and CEO of keeraikadai.com is talking about vallarai or brahmi leaves. Have you seen the country vallarai leaves? It is much bigger in size and resemble lotus leaves, unlike the hybrid varieties you get in the market. To make the green dosa, make a fine paste of the leaves and mix it with dosa batter and you have a dosa that is packed with nutrients and will improve your memory. It is not just tasty, it is especially good for the kids,he recommends. The Coimbatore-based e-commere company now sells 110 native varieties of keerai in Tamil Nadu, procured directly from farmers across Coimbatore, Pollachi, Madurai, Bengaluru and Chennai.He says keeraikadai.com was started to empower farmers to market their produce better and bridge the gap between farming and technology. This also meant spreading awareness of food as medicine.The keeraikadai.com team ( from left) Sriram Prasad. G, N.G. Mani Raj and G. Sriram Subramanian | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementSriram cant stop talking about the greens he deals with every day. Naatu malli is aromatic and has small leaves. In ponnanganni keerai, there are four varieties that come in red and green colours. There is Mudakkathaan that gives relief from joint pains, and there are also medicinal greens like Thoothuvalai. We also have exotic varieties of lettuce like the ice berg.After nearly two years in Coimbatore there is excitement as Sriram talks about branching out to Chennai and Bengaluru in July. We have started growing micro greens in hydroponic farms. These are very useful, especially in the big metros, where there is water scarcity. Explaining this further, Sriram says how hydroponic farming saves water by 80 per cent. For example, to grow 500 bunches of greens using soil, you require a minimum of 100 litres of water. But in hydroponics, it can be achieved with 20 litres. And, that water is recycled too.Micro greens | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThis plan will also unfold with the local farmers in those cities. Sriram insists that any development at keeraikadai.com is incomplete without farmers. We want to encourage them to try this farming technique too. We want to grow with the farmers. Recently, I posted an advertisement on the social media saying Wanted Farmers and it went viral. Even now I get phone calls from farmers across India wanting to know more. We invite them, provide accommodation, food and train them in hydroponics. Later, we rope them in as a part of the team.Why hydroponics? The greens are grown from original extracts of seeds in a controlled environment like a greenhouseThere is no soil. The plants are nourished instead with mineral nutrient solutions.They are grown at a controlled temperature which lends itself to uniform growthThe nutritional value of leaves is almost 100 per cent. In the traditional method, the ph and nutrient values of the soil determines the quality of greens and one has to worry about insect menace and weeds.The keeraikadai team has cultivated mustard leaves, methi, palak, and vallarai using hydroponics. They also tried mayil keerai or chakravarthi keerai that comes in a mix of purple and green. The harvest was ready in a week and the quality they found was very good.The team now includes N.G. Mani Raj who is the chief statistical officer and Srirams brother, G. Sriram Subramaniam, who heads the operations. The brothers, who come from a farming background in Madurai, are trained as organic agriculturists at TNAU. They are also inspired by Nammalvars natural farming methods.The keeraikadai app is available on Android and iphone, to order the greens. This will soon be extended to the metros. Their website www.keeraikadai.com, provides information on the nutritional and health benefits of the greens and gives easy-to-make recipes. Sriram is happy to share a green smoothie recipe that is cooling, nutritious and a perfect mid-morning snack. Blend baby palak leaves with a fruit of your choice (papaya, orange, banana or apple), throw in some dry fruits and your health drink is ready."

Think of Kerala food and sadhya is all that comes to mind. The richness of coconut milk, the fragrance and sweetness of cardamom and the mild proportions of spices lend a native touch to the recipes. At a food festival organised by Hotel Regenta Central Deccan, home chef Saraswathi N prepared an extensive menu with delicacies from the state. She was invited as a guest to the hotel following a feature coverage in The New Indian Express on her recordbreaking feat of attempting 108 dishes in an hour a month back.Saraswathi N recently set arecord of cooking 108 dishesin one hour  DebadattaMallickThe interiors of Olives restaurant at the hotel was decked up with photos portraying festivities of the state. Kathakali and Theyyam masks were displayed on the wall. Single strands of garland were suspended from the ceiling. Food was prepared and kept in earthen pots. Saraswathi was busy interacting and explaining the traditional cuisine to the guests. We began our meal with drumstick soup made from the inner pulp and seasoned with mustard seeds. The base gives it a creamy texture. Crispy mango and onion pakodas were served as accompaniments. The idea is to serve authentic items with a touch of fusion.Most of the ingredients are sourced locally except for a few that are brought from Kerala. Im trying to make aviyal out of red spinach but its hard to get it here. Even the raw mango here is less tangy compared to said Saraswathi who runs a restaurant in Thrissur with her younger son. Back in her hometown, Saraswathi is popular for her eggless and multigrain cakes. From vada moru kootan to puliserry there are around 15 dishes in the spread.All these can be eaten as accompaniments with Kerala red rice. To break the monotony, the chef instance, erissery pachadis made parottas with mildly-spiced moilee were served. Sweet unniappam has been a hot-seller among the crowd. I love cooking for gatherings as it runs in my genes. Ive imbibed traditional Saraswathi. Among the other highlights in the menu were idichakka thoran, jackfruit ring biryani, and kaya tholi thoran. Snacks like banana chips, chakka varatti, jackfruit chips and sweet banana chips were also available for quick bites.The desserts for the day were pazhamuruku, elaneer payasam and idichu pizhiya payasam. Jaggery, coconut milk and rice are the three our desser t s. Pazhamuruku is p r e p a red by steam cooking banana in jaggery syrup. Ive also made a fusion of pal ada, elaneer special one is idichu pizhiya payasam made of rice, coconut milk and jaggery. This sweet is lord Ayyappas favourite and usually given to devotees as prasadam at temples, she said. The sweets were satisfying and easily the best part of the meal.

We will give one-third seats to women and one-third to the youth, Yadav, who was accompanied by the partys state unit president Rajeev Godara, told a news conference here.We are going to focus on five issues  agrarian distress, remunerative prices to the farmers, unemployment relief for educated unemployed youth and we want a law which would ensure no liquor vend can be opened unless women of that gram sabha approve of it, the psephologist-turned-political leader added.

But we think this is the best time because this is when people are looking for an alternative, a viable alternative which we will provide. There is a complete vacuum in Haryana, every day you hear of MLAs running away to BJP, every other day parties are disintegrating, Congress is fighting more against each other.If you look at parole plea filed by jailed Dera Sacha Sauda chief and reactions from political leaders of the ruling and most opposition parties on this, it shows the bankruptcy of Haryana politics, not a single opposition party has the guts to oppose Babas parole. This shows the bankruptcy. And this is where we will provide a viable alternative, he said. Yadav said his party will issue an Imanpatra with concrete policy proposals instead of the election manifesto. The party has been allotted whistle as a poll symbol by the Election Commission, Godara informed."

Join Kunal Vijayakar on a spicy trail,"Very often in life, the effects of small things prove to be inversely proportional to their size. I dont mean to get mysterious or philosophical. But take for example the chilli. I often gawk in awe at this tender, slender little fruit, and marvel at its huge gustatory impact on food.When it comes to Indian food, there is hardly any cuisine that doesnt use chilli or at least chilli powder. Could you imagine cooking without fresh green chillies? I dont think so. We have so embraced their flavour and piquancy, that weve quite forgotten that they are not native to India. Until 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed here, India used no chilli in its food. I cannot imagine what pizza without capsicum tasted like in the Vedic period oops, just kidding.There are now many different varieties grown in India. All chillies contain a biologically active ingredient called capsaicin, which is the cause of their heat and which stimulates the palate and increases our blood circulation. Thats why some believe that chillies are good for low blood pressure, the heart and our respiratory system.Chillies also make you sweat, which in turn has a cooling effect, which is why they are so popular in tropical regions like ours. That seems a bit warped to me; I hate to sweat. But Im guessing its true. Each type of chilli has its own profile and heat level, and while some are used for heat, others are used for their complexity of flavour.Green chillies are unripe or fresh, hot if eaten with the seeds, and are used for their acidity and raw grassy flavour. I love slitting a long green chilli and adding it to scrambled eggs. It adds dimension and elevates the flavour of the creamy eggs. Chopped green chillies ground to a paste with coriander and mint is a chutney that can be used as a marinade, a base or just by itself.When tempered with ginger, garlic, onion, tomato and masalas, the same chutney makes a great green chicken or mutton curry. A simple green chilli paste is a key ingredient in most Mughlai cooking. It makes the flavours more complex. I cannot imagine a Qorma or Biryani without green chilli paste. When you add salt and lemon to green chilli paste, it can be stored and used in many vegetarian dishes, like Vatana na Ghughra, Khatta Dhokla and Doodhi Muthia.We Indians also use a large variety of dried red chillies. In fact, there are different ones, used differently, in different parts of the country.The Reshampatti from Gujarat are short, broad and dark red. They are medium in pungency and used in powdered form or stuffed as pickles. They add a vibrant red colour to food.The Kashmiri Chilli is known to everyone for its flaming colour and for being non-spicy. Its what makes a Rogan Josh that bright, brilliant red without heat.The Mundu chilli is round and button-like and native to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Its only slightly spicy but has a unique flavour that makes it indispensable to the cuisine, when tempered with curry leaves, mustard and methi seeds and added, for instance, to curd rice.The Byadagi chilli is grown in Karnataka and no Karwari Fish Curry is complete without this dry, long, crinkly fellow. The chilli is pungent and imparts a bright red colour to curries and gravies. The Byadagi chilli really comes into its own when combined with coconut.The reason Andhra food roars with spice is because of the Guntur Sannam chilli. This one can in fact be deadly and that is why, though India grows a lot of it, very little is exported to the West. Demand for the Guntur chilli comes mainly from other Asian countries. Andhra uses the Guntur with passion and fervour. No Natu Kodi Kura (spicy Andhra chicken curry with coconut) or Guntur Kodi Vepudu (spicy chicken fry) or the Mamsam Pulusu (spicy mutton) would taste the same without Guntur chilli.Mathania chillies, named after a town in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, have a powerful aroma and flavour but are not that spicy. This is the chilli that brings the laal to Laal Maas.The Sankeshwari mirchi from Kolhapur is used in combination with other chillies to make chilli powder. Its a bright orange and is also used in a lot of central Maharashtrian cuisine.Little known outside Goa, the Titimiti is a bright orange, inch-long thing that is the reason a true Goan Prawn Curry looks and tastes the way it does.And then finally there is the Naga Bhut Jolokia, or Ghost Chilli. It is one of the worlds hottest, is used both fresh and dried, and is the key spice in a Naga Smoked Pork.These are just a few of the chillies we use in India. Overall this fruit is so adored that the Lavangi Mirchi is not only a bright red, spicy, detonative chilli from Kolhapur, but also a term used to describe a sensual, smouldering woman. Hows that for spice?First Published: Jun 28, 2019 20:10 IST"

When asked why just pizzas, Watsons corporate executive chef Ashley DSouza says there is no comfort food over this, when you want to lean on a couch and have your eyes hooked on the game.Chef Ashley has curated unique flavours of pizzas, names of which people may never have come across. He combined different flavours of each participating country in the World Cup special pizza.Our personal favourite is The Bangla, a pizza where signature flavours of Bangladesh, including posto (poppy seeds) and kashundi (mustard paste), have been mixed to create a finger-licking dish. Another dish which caught our eye was The Batter from India  a pizza that provides us flavours of our nation with an Italian treatment; the range also includes The Black Caps from New Zealand, The Pacer from Pakistan, Coastal Lanka from Sri Lanka, English Summer from England, The Afghan from Afghanistan, The Baggy Green from Australia, The Paprika Proteas from South Africa and The Windies from West Indies.Commenting on the unique names and the regional flavours used in the pizzas, the chef said not only did a lot of thought go into the selection of ingredients, but also the names, just to have some funny connotation to the teams that are taking part in the series.We got local spices to replicate the traditional ones used in the international food range, Ashley commented. We did not look for exotic spices to take the pizza range to a different level, as Watsons is more about providing a comfort factor, rather than making it over-the-top.While one grabs the unique range of pizza slices, Watsons also has introduced a World Cup-exclusive range of three shooters, which can enjoyed slowly while you cheer for your favourite players. Vodka is used as the beverage base, while Watsons has brought in colours to represent the countrys flag, using natural products like saffron for the orange element, a clear shooter, representing the white part, and kiwi has been used to give the third shooter its green colour. World Cup is an international event, and everyone is hooked to it on a global scale, which is why we went all out with the theme, said Ashley.Cost for two: `1,000 (approx)"

Not too far from work, my colleague and I reach there at 2.30 pm (feverishly thinking about alternatives if the place is shut). But no! The doors are wide open and a beaming Lakshmi T Priya welcomes us in and seats us at a table (I sit on a stone bench that runs along the wall).The meals room is a no-nonsense affair and brightly lit and focussed only on the business of serving food to its customers. Just outside is the menu of the day written in chalk. We must have looked starved; before the banana leaf is placed in front of us, two cups of steaming hot wheat and coconut milk paaysam is served to us.Lakshmi started the all-vegetarian Kongunad style restaurant only recently. It is possible to get a lot of our non vegetarian dishes perhaps, but the equally impressive list of vegetarian cuisine is hardly out there, she says. As a vegetarian I am delighted and the happiness only grows as wholesome, vegetable-filled, non-paneer dishes are served one by one.

Alamelu Ammayi was a queen of thokkus, pickles and non-vegetarian fare and while Rajalakshmi Ammal cooked vegetarian delicacies like none other. I grew up watching both of them cook. They were affectionate, says Lakshmi, but strict, and tolerated no short cuts or laziness in the kitchen. Nothing made them happier than cooking for near and dear ones. It is that generosity of spirit and giving that inspired Lakshmi to open this Meals Room.I want to revive country recipes and produce and bring alive my grandmothers recipes. They only used local and seasonal fare and I am doing just the same. She is a farmer first, says Lakshmi, and nothing pleases her more than cooking from what grows on her farm including the native oils that are milled there. Farm to table is a philosophy that I subscribe to completely.Lakshmi and Mani are the only cooks. I have watched him cook for 45 years! We both cook from our heart and soul. She brushes aside our awe that just the two of them handle the cooking and says, it takes no more than what it takes to turn out a meal at home. Just requires a bit of planning, that is all.The Meals Room serves a different menu each day of the week. So be prepared to be pleasantly surprised when vegetables like pirandai, thoodhuvalai, ponnangani keerai and thandu kovakkai appear on your plate. We enjoy an exemplary pachadi that we try hard to decode. Lakshmi takes pity on us and reveals that it is a kovakkai pachchadi! We are not inventing anything; just reviving old recipes and I follow my grandmothers recipe to the last word, she says, plonking down two beautiful, glistening urundais onto our elai. The kadalai podi urundai is a peanut and red chilly powder fashioned into balls that Lakshmi encourages us to eat with hot rice and gingelly oil. Someone had a brilliant idea when they told her to patent it!Lakshmi wears her love for her grandmothers on her sleeve. I am dedicating this restaurant to them. I learnt about integrity, passion and the importance of keeping my kitchen and surroundings scrupulously clean. They taught me that food tastes good only when one cooks from the heart and, even today if I am upset about something, I wait till I have resolved the matter before I enter the kitchen1The sambar follows. You must come again and taste Alamelu Ammayis vengaya thokku. And the arisi paruppu sadham, kollu rasam, pirandai chutney, surakkai thattai payiru kulambu and pachai payiru kadaisal, Lakshmi tells us.

The move was inspired by a similar action by farmers in Maharashtra last month.AdvertisingIn Haryana, the protesting farmers gathered at at the agriculture farm of one Cheeranji Lal Bishnoi, in Hisars Sarangpur village. I am under a debt of Rs 14 lakh and I want to overcome the financial crisis by opting for better seeds, Bishnoi said.As its nomenclature signifies, HT Bt seeds are resistant to herbicides that farmers use to clear weeds without harming the crop.After sowing the seeds, the protesters also distributed it among nearly 200 farmers gathered there. The state unit head of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Guni Prakash who was present at the spot, said they will now move to other areas in Haryana and to Mansa district in Punjab where we will not only call the farmers to sow HT Bt cotton but will also prepare BT brinjal plants for distribution.The Union government in 2010 had imposed a moratorium on BT brinjal.Apart from BKU, activists from Maharashtras Shetkari Sanghatana also took part in the satyagraha  (civil resistance) demanding that they be allowed to use the latest technologies in the agriculture including GM crops.AdvertisingCritics of GM crops say they have adverse impact on health and environment. Why dont they make such government reports public, Prakash asked.The protesters, however, are not sure whether the seeds that they sowed in Bishonis farm were HT Bt.Because of the ban, government laboratories dont conduct any test on HT Bt cotton seed. So, it cant be said with authority that the seeds used belong to the banned variety, said Lalit Patil Bahale, a farm leader from Akola in Maharashtra.Bahale had also sown HT Bt cotton on his two-acre field. Two weeks later, police lodged an FIR against me under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, he added. Rajender Zoting, another farm activist from Maharashtras Yavatmal district, said, The authorities have collected samples from my fields. I am ready to go to jail for my right to sow the seeds of my choice.The protesters also handed over a cheque of Rs 50,000 to Jeevan Saini, a farmer from Fatehabad district in Haryana who had sown the banned BT brinjal on his farm that was later uprooted by the local administration.A farmer leader from Sirsa, Vikram Pachal said that availability of good seeds was the right of the farmers. With limited production of mustard, the country is dependent on import of mustard oil, which mostly comes from the Bt crop. No ill effects in the imported have been reported yet, said Pachal.According to a statement issued by the activists, nearly 60 per cent of the total area under cotton across world had HT Bt variety. In 2017, a field survey conducted by the central government had found that in major cotton growing states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, 15 per cent of the total crop sown was HT Bt and in Punjab and Haryana, it was 9 per cent."

It doesnt cost more than 500 to 600. I wear it like a dhoti, says Shravan Kumar Ramaswamy. The designer is in town with a collection of weaves he has revived, not just from the treasure trove of textile heritage of Andhra and Telangana but also from across the country.Can you tell me about your special saris, I ask. He jumps up and pulls one out of the neatly displayed ones. He unfolds it, deftly fashions pleats and wraps the pallu around me all in a few seconds. I look at the mirror and instantly feel like Maharani Gayatri Devi. Because it is one of her saris that he has revived. Shravan says that he has permission to copy some of the royal saris, not just Gayatri Devis but from several other royal houses too.Saris are not from our country; they are our country and heritage. A conversation with Shravan is interspersed with flourishes and drama. That is because he feels keenly for the weavers and the many weaving techniques are going extinct, as no young person is interested in taking it forward. He talks of the rich textile heritage of Telengana with emotion. Gadwal, Venkatagiri, Mangalgiri, Gollabomma, Narayanpet... If I am asked what is my favourite kind of sari, I would say Narayanpet. Do you want to know why? Because they are woven by some of the poorest weavers, he sighs. Otherwise, he says, a favourite would be the Benares weave, which royal women wore no matter which part of the country they came from.Love them! The beauty of a sari has nothing to do with its price. A sari that is 2,000 can be as striking as one that costs 200,000.When you pick a sari, make sure it is a handloom. Patronise your local weavers.Check its colour, weave, how comfortable it feels to you and how often you will wear it. It is smart to figure out how many looks you can get out of it. A sari can look very very different with a mere style of wearing or with a change of blouse or accessoriesThe sari is one of the most forgiving and flattering of garments. Wear it at least twice a week. No matter your shape, size, age or profession, it is a winner right throughDo not discard old saris. They are heirlooms. You may not find weavers who can make you another sari like that any moreIf you are lucky enough to know weavers, ask them to reinforce the places that have frayed or weakened in the fabric. If nothing works, convert that precious sari into a wall hanging or use it as a canopy in your puja roomI have worked with over 5,000 weaving clusters across the country, says Shravan adding how he and his team have been instrumental in training nearly 10,000 women through the Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) scheme. In 10 batches of 1,000 each over 100 days. We trained them in cutting, stitching, sketching and made mini designers of them. Many now have a respectable income, he says.He did the same with Pochampally. I had to persuade the weavers to go back to traditional, uncomplicated single Ikat. They were insistent about complex weaves and were barely getting the money for the effort they put into it. Pointing to the kurta he is wearing he exclaims, See how nice it looks. People love it and it sells fast.Treat them WELL Air your saris frequently. They need to breathe fresh airIf you want to wrap them up, make sure you do so in a normal cotton textileMake little bundles of black pepper or mustard with cloves and put them in your cupboard to keep the musty smell and insects away. Camphor works tooIs that Kalamkari, I ask of another sari. It is the grandmother of Kalamkari. It is Mata Ni Pachedi, he corrects me. A folk art from Gujarat, it also uses flora and fauna and the figure of a goddess all hand-painted in natural dyes so one is forgiven for thinking it is Kalamkari. It is a backdrop and is said to be something the Vaghari community painted for themselves as they were barred from entering temples, he explains. It was also used as a backdrop (Pachedi) or a canopy to the mother goddess (Mata).Shravans eyes keep straying to where his saris are. I am sorry. I worry when people pull the saris out, drop them on the floor or handle them roughly. They are not saris to me; they are my daughters. He pulls out a beautiful pink-and-gold coloured Benaras  his grandmothers sari  and declares, This daughter is not going anywhere. She will stay with me."

Stating that capital cities were force multipliers, Badal said the amount of revenue a state capital could generate was phenomenal.""The Centre's promise of making Chandigarh the capital of Punjab remains unfulfilled till now. It should be made the capital and the revenue and resources generated by Chandigarh should be collected by the state,"" he said in a statement issued by SAD. He made a slew of demands for Punjab, including a tax holiday for the state and royalty from Rajasthan for availing its water resources.About the depleting groundwater in the state, Sukhbir said that in the last 10 years, despite six deficient monsoons, Punjab farmers had increased the productivity of paddy and wheat.""This, however, came at a great cost, with the state's only resource 'water' depleting. Water should be given the same importance as coal, iron ore and gas. It is time for the country to help Punjab and grant special funds for upgrading its canal system, rejuvenating groundwater, diversifying from wheat and paddy,"" he said, adding there should be an assured support price for alternate crops.Raising the problems being faced by farmers whose lands are situated along the Pakistan border in the no man's land, Badal said farmers tilling 17,000 acres did not have freedom to tend to their crops or irrigate wheat, mustard, chana and vegetables.He suggested that either this land should be acquired by the central government or it should pay a yearly compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre to farmers. Describing the Union budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as a bold, revolutionary and futuristic document, he said it addresses concerns of all sectors."

2019-07-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/self-sufficiency-in-edible-oils-a-tall-order-5824531/,Self-sufficiency in Edible oils: A Tall Order,"In her Union Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has lauded farmers for making India self-sufficient in pulses, while being sure they will repeat such a success even in the production of oilseeds.On the first achievement, there are few doubts.AdvertisingDuring 2016-17 to 2018-19, Indias pulses output has averaged 23.92 million tonnes (mt), as against 17.58 mt for the preceding three-year period. As a result, imports, after more than doubling from 3.18 mt to 6.61 mt between 2013-14 and 2016-17, fell to 2.53 mt in the last fiscal. In value terms, pulses imports were only $ 1.14 billion (Rs 8,035.30 crore) in 2018-19, having peaked at $ 4.24 billion (Rs 28,523.18 crore) two years before.The Washington-headquartered International Food Policy Research Institute has projected the countrys pulses demand under different GDP growth scenarios at 21.40-22.36 mt in 2020 and 25.22-28.07 mt by 2030. Given that current production is already at 23-25 mt, the self-sufficiency claims arent entirely without basis. And the Narendra Modi government can probably take some credit for it.But can the pulses (vegetable protein) success be replicated in oilseeds (vegetable fat)? The simple answer: It is a tall order.AdvertisingTable 1 shows the quantum and value of Indias vegetable oil imports  how these are much bigger relative to pulses. Between 2009-10 and 2017-18, imports surged from 6.73 mt to 15.36 mt, with the corresponding foreign exchange outgo, too, rising from $ 4.72 billion (Rs 22,316.68 crore) to $ 11.64 billion (Rs 74,995.91 crore). They dipped somewhat to 15.03 mt ($ 9.89 billion or Rs 69,023.80 crore) in 2018-19, but nowhere near the scale seen in pulses.The accompanying chart gives a better idea of the extent of import dependence. In 2001-02, the countrys vegetable oil production, at 6.72 mt, exceeded imports of 4.76 mt. In 2011-12, imports crossed 10 mt for the first time, while also surpassing the domestic output of 8.15 mt. In the last oil year, imports, at 15.12 mt, were almost twice the production of 7.92 mt, translating into a self-sufficiency ratio of just over 34%.The wholesale shift to imports has completely transformed the profile of edible oil consumption.According to GGN Research, an Indore-based agri-commodity analytics firm, 58% of Indias estimated edible oil consumption of 2.29 mt in 1973-74 was accounted for by groundnut. This was followed by mustard (28%), cottonseed (10%) and other indigenous oils such as coconut and sesame. But in 2001-02, 29.1% of the total consumption of 10.13 mt was constituted by palm oil, which, along with soyabean (22.3%), had relegated mustard and groundnut to third and fourth places. By 2017-18, the combined share of palm and soyabean oil had increased to more than 60%. Adding sunflower oil took it further up to nearly 72%.About 96-98% of palm and sunflower oil consumed by India is imported  the former from Indonesia and Malaysia, the latter mostly from Ukraine. The ratio would be lower, at 70-72%, for soyabean that is imported primarily from Argentina and Brazil. It is these three, predominantly imported, oils that are being largely used today for deep-frying pooris and pakodas, making the tadka/chounk tempering to add flavour and aroma to dals, and imparting necessary texture, mouth-feel and bite to biscuits and cookies. While soyabean and sunflower are consumer-facing oils, not even a third of palm oil gets directly used in home kitchens. The bulk of it is consumed by the food industry  for everything from mithais, namkeens, bread and biscuits to noodles  and quick-service restaurants. It is the cheapest oil and amenable to deep as well as multiple frying. Hydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati), too, is entirely based on palm oil.Against this background, how feasible is the goal of self-sufficiency?B.V. Mehta, executive director, Solvent Extractors Association of India, believes it is possible to push up production, particularly of mustard oil, which is currently around 2.2 mt. Mustard-seed has roughly 40% oil content. Our average seed yield is hardly 1.2 tonnes per hectare. Punjab and Haryana together have six million hectares under wheat that the government is struggling to procure, amid overflowing godowns. If half that area is diverted to irrigated mustard with 2 tonnes/hectare yields, we can get an additional crop of 6 mt or 2.3-2.4 mt of oil, he notes.The second biggest contributor to Indias annual vegetable oil production of 8-8.1 mt is soyabean, at 1.3-1.4 mt. But since its oil content is only 17-18%, increasing production beyond even 2 mt is difficult. At No. 3 and No. 4 spots are cottonseed (1.2-1.3 mt) and rice bran oil (1 mt). Cottonseed has, in fact, now become Gujarats dominant indigenous oil, ahead of groundnut. The boost here has come essentially from the Bt (genetically-modified cotton) revolution, just as increased paddy production has led to higher rice bran availability. A targeted approach can raise the output of these two oils by another 1.5-1.6 mt.The real impetus to self-sufficiency, however, can come from oil palm  the only crop capable of yielding 4 tonnes of oil per hectare. At present, local palm oil production is just 0.25 mt. India can potentially cultivate oil palm in 1.9-2 million hectares, giving 7.5-8 mt oil. But since the trees take four years to grow and yield fresh fruit bunches, you need to plan now. Oil palm should be declared as a plantation crop and exempted from land ceiling laws to attract investments from corporates. Simultaneously, we must restrict imports, especially of refined palm oil, adds Mehta.On the other hand, industry expert and former Cargill India chairman, Siraj A. Chaudhry, is skeptical about aiming for self-sufficiency.AdvertisingEdible oil cannot be equated with pulses, where theres very little global trade and the consumption requirement of our significantly vegetarian population has to be met through domestic production. In edible oils, wheat or corn, there is no dearth of global suppliers producing at much lower costs. If China can import 100 mt of oilseeds annually (compared to its production of 58-59 mt), why should we worry about importing 15-16 mt of oil? Also, assuming our oilseed production rises substantially, where will you sell the resultant de-oiled cake or meal? Unlike China, our meat consumption isnt going to grow enough to absorb all this byproduct, he points out."
2019-07-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/this-chennai-restaurant-is-merging-cuisines/article28354106.ece,This Chennai restaurant is merging cuisines,"Its like stepping back into 2017. Everything looks the same: from the quirky portraits of historical figures (look for the one of Emperor Shah Jahan playing golf) to the painted and upholstered furniture, and indoor cabannas with silken drapes. Walking into the soon-to-be-launched Desi Di in Poes Garden feels exactly like walking into the Desi Di premises of Perambur just a few years ago.We kept all the [decor] pieces and furniture from that restaurant to use in this one, grins Chef Aaron Coutinho, back in Chennai after a recent stint in Hyderabad. The chef, who also has some experience under Mumbai-based The Bombay Canteen under his belt, is proud of how much of Desi Di he has managed to keep consistent despite the long pause, and also of the things he has changed.I want this to be a space where people have conversations about food, he says over plates of banana leaf wrapped tawa fish fry and and bhutta (corn) kebab made two ways. To demonstrate his point, he gestures to the fish  soft, pungent with a hint of mustard, but otherwise very familiarly Chennai. This week, we are using an Indian version of puffer fish for this dish. I chanced upon it at the market this afternoon, in a batch of small fishing boats that had just come in. The catch contained many local varieties that arent well-known, and dont sell much. But that is the kind of fish I want to serve my guests, and explain where it comes from, why they should try it.Inspired by IndiaThe mustard in this marination is an idea Aaron borrowed from Bengal. Other dishes are nods to other parts of the country, like the chicken tikka khakhra, which comprises meaty little chunks sprinkled like pizza toppings on a sturdy khakhra. And then there are the two-way corn kebabs: an oh-so-soft potato chikki; and sliced cobs marinated in spicy tandoori masala and, well, tandoored. It is corn this week; well change it to some other seasonal vegetable next week. Brinjal has a lot of scope, says Aaron.He calls it adaptive Indian cuisine  taking flavours from around India and adapting them to the local region. I either give familiar dishes and ingredients a different recipe, or take something hyperlocal yet lesser known and give it a typical Chennai preparation.Its clear that the chef had his fun when coming up with creations. Take, for example, his Naga chicken curry that is served with dosa. Not the dosa you get when you pour batter on a pan, but what you get when you pour the same batter into a waffle maker. This thick, soft dosa waffles are surprisingly just right for dipping into the thick, rich onion-laced gravy and munching along with soft chunks of boneless meat. But the sugarcane chicken kebabs, on the other hand, are just a game of mix and match. The tikkas themselves are just regular seekhs, if a tad too garlic-heavy, but each is skewered on a sugarcane stick instead of a regular one. So you finish your meat and then chew on the skewer too.But Aaron isnt just creative with the big stuff: a large part of his seasonal and local plan is focused on the chutneys, dips and sides. I wanted diners to see that the vegetables we used to hate as children, actually can be a lot of fun, he says. So the sugarcane chicken kebab is served on a bed of shredded gongurra salad, sweetened with oodles of honey and made crunchy with crushed peanuts. The mutton boti kebab comes with a smooth turnip relish fit to replace all mayonnaise dips from dining tables. And at the centre of the chicken khakhra sits a dollop of ridge gourd chutney, which looks exactly like its mint version, but tastes greener. As if plucked fresh from a garden and crushed then and there.Desi Di  Indian Restaurant on Kasturi Rangan Avenue, Poes Garden will be open to the public from July 13 onwards.

2019-07-13,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/13/from-less-cash-villages-to-cashless-ones-2003329.html,From less-cash villages to cashless ones,"By IANSJAIPUR: Thirty-five-year-old Neetu Devi carries wheat in her sarees pallu and places it on the counter of Ramswaroop Sharmas shop. He weighs the wheat - it measures slightly less than 250 grams - prices it at Rs 4 and in exchange hands over two matchboxes and a candle to her. The transaction is now complete.In an India where terms like Paytm, Google Pay and internet banking are increasingly becoming commonplace, residents of villages like Ladore Khurd, Ledor Kalan, Bahrai, Mengra and Hakimpura in Rajasthan's Karauli district are still engaging in the century-old barter or commodity exchange system.Picture this scenario: Customer A has 1 kg wheat and seeks to buy sugar. A goes to shopkeeper B and requests to exchange their wheat for sugar. Under this commodity exchange system, B buys the wheat - for a price lower than the market rate - and hands over 1 kg of sugar. In the market, the price of wheat is currently lower than that of sugar. B later sells this wheat at a profit.This system works well since agriculture is the primary occupation across these villages. The lack of cash within their economic circles has led residents to exchange home-grown grain for ration.Dynamics of make-do 'cash'Neetu from Ladore Kalan village comes from a small family of labourers. As a substitute for cash, her family grows grains on its farmland and exchanges it for ration in the market. She explains that because of poverty and unstable employment, household goods like sugar, oil and kerosene are procured by exchanging wheat, millet, mustard and sesame. When asked about 'digital economy', Neetu says she has heard of the term but isn't aware what it means.Sharma, from whom she bought candles and match box, runs a small shop, selling vegetables, mustard oil, kerosene and other items in exchange for food grains. On the same lines, Mukesh Jadoun of Ledor Khurd village has been running a small grocery shop for 10 years. He says it is common for residents to engage in barter system.'Small shopkeepers like us get a little more profit in this. We buy grains at less than market price from villagers, sell it in the market at a higher prices and earn profit,' he explains, adding that he gets more than 100 kg grain every month through this arrangement.Shankar Singh, a social worker from Rajsamand district, says apart from Karauli, this system is practised in tribal areas of Udaipur as well. He adds that the barter system isn't phased out completely even though its prevalence has reduced over the last decade.While most of the country's 1.3 billion people were left hanging after the Modi government banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on October 8, 2016, life across these villages continued seemingly unaffected. Demonetisation only accelerated the commodity exchange system residents engage in.Moreover, there are no banks or ATMs in any of the villages in Karauli district. A single bank resides in the main district area. This makes it difficult for bank account holders to regularly travel back and forth to withdraw cash.Jaipur-based chartered accountant Raghuveer Singh Punia says rural areas were worst-hit by demonetisation. 'Due to decreasing cash, people started meeting their daily needs through barter. Second, there are few banks in rural areas. People from villages come to the city once or twice a month for bank work,' he explains.Jadoun claims the barter system increased swiftly post-demonetisation and now has reduced only slightly. He says, 'At the time of note ban, almost everyone from the village bought goods by exchanging grain. During those few months, I earned around seven to eight sacks of cereal. Today as well, I get one-two sacks of grain every month.'Deena Sharma from Bahrai village says exchange of goods took place for purchase of vegetables and other daily-use products even until 10 years ago. She adds that note ban in 2016 only increased this activity. Sarpanch of Khedia village, Bhawna Devi, concurs and says it is a common, traditional system, which accelerated after demonetisation.Nesar Ahmed, senior analyst at the Rajasthan Centre for Budget Analysis, too is of the view that demonetisation accelerated barter trade. 'Before currency, barter was a way of trading. Now, when people did not have enough cash after demonetisation, they looked at other options and barter was the easiest. That is why it has been seen that the tradition of commodity exchange has come alive after demonetisation. While most villagers did not have cash, the ones who did found no use for it, and the best resort was barter system.'Pinty Sharma, a shopkeeper in Hakimpura, explains that this economic system is not just business but a 'symbol of faith' as well, as it creates a level of trust between the customer and shopkeeper. 'After the ban on notes, this belief has increased,' he says."
2019-07-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/mustard-seeds-capable-of-lighting-leds-iiser-5827702/,Mustard seeds capable of lighting LEDs: IISER Pune,"Spluttering of mustard seeds and the popping sound, when tempered with hot oil, is a common sight in Indian kitchens. But, what if the same dancing seeds were able to generate electricity, enough electricity to glow small LED bulbs?AdvertisingA team of scientists at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune, has demonstrated the same. They carried out an experiment using mustard seeds, sandwiched between a layer of plastic and a polymeric nano fibre pad, subjected them to mild force and found that electric power was generated.Led by senior physicist Satish Ogale, the researchers also carried out similar tests using flax and basil seeds, in an effort to harvest power by a Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) device.Due to the ease of transferring electrical charges afforded by the natural seed surface to a mildly impacting soft material, we could generate usable electricity, Ogale told The Indian Express.AdvertisingWhile the scientists have been working on identifying potential materials that will allow easy separation of charges, the idea of using mustard was purely an accidental one, the team lead claimed.It was just another day at home when I was playing in my kitchen with a plastic bottle that stored mustard seeds. As I shook the bottle, the seeds kept popping up, dancing and hitting the walls of the bottle. That is when I decided to experiment with them, he said.A series of tests using the three seeds revealed that mustard seeds produced maximum 334 MW/square metre electric power, followed by flax (324 MW/square metre) and basil (72mW/square metre).Our tests demonstrated that the electricity (after being converted from Alternate Current to Direct Current) generated from about two grams of mustard seeds could momentarily flash/light nearly 120 LED bulbs. Such power is enough to operate several low power devices used in wearable electronics, said Sachin Kumar Singh, lead author of the study titled Seed power: Natural seed and PVDF nano fibre based triboelectric nanogenerator with high output density.Among other applications, the power generated in this manner can also suit in lighting up smart gadgets, wearable devices and security check posts requiring low power for operations.The biggest advantage of using such techniques, more commonly known as green chemistry, is that they are highly cost-effective in nature.This factor attracts industries the most as there is reasonably good power output received at much lower costs, said Ogale, who explained that the chemical composition, structure, shape and morphology of the seeds play a vital role in the power generation.The crust or the surface layer of mustard offer better response to friction and it was found to be electrostatically more active than the other seeds used in the experiment, said Ogale.With India being one of the major producers of mustard and its significant use of mustard oil for cooking purposes, the work of the IISER team suggests that mild power generation is also possible from the residual waste after oil extraction process was complete.We achieved similar results from the residual waste collected after mustard oil was extracted, said Singh."

Read MoreFarmers see red, but cant help itDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityNEW DELHI: Mungeshpur drain, one of the longest in north-west Delhi and part of the Najafgarh basin, paints a jarring picture amid the greenery dotted with farms growing vegetables and mustard. The colour of the drain that passes through Mungeshpur and Qutubgarh villages is almost blood-red, with parts of it full of foam due to effluents emptied into it by nearby industries In a hazardous practice, local farmers use water from the drain to water their farms. They say the deadly mixture of toxic chemicals act as rasainik khaad (fertiliser), helping them save money on fertiliser and urea . Moreover, the groundwater table in the area, they claim, has rapidly deteriorated over the years. But this comes at great cost. Dinesh Rana from Qutubgarh says that cases of cancer in the village have gone up at least seven times in the past 10 years.Rajpal Rana, another Qutubgarh local who has been farming in the village since 2003, said, We know the vegetables we grow are injurious to health. But we dont have an option.Rana started using water from the drain sporadically in 2008, but now solely relies on this water. Rana, who took over the reins from his father in 2003, said the increasing cost of fertilizers and pesticides pushed him further towards using drain water .There is a shortage of water in this area and it takes time through tubewells. The cost of installing a tubewell is around Rs 70,000 to 80,000. The cost of fertilizers and manure is additional and that makes it extremely difficult for us farmers to grow a good crop each year. The water acts as a fertilizer and fulfils the water demand. We know it is harmful, but we cannot help it, said Rana.Dinesh Rana, another Qutubgarh local says some farmers are starting to realise the problems arising out of the polluted drain, but most are helpless.Rana holds up a 2015 NGT order which was issued against 21highly polluting industries in Sonipat, primarily dealing in things like pyrolysis oil, tyre ingredients, katha dye and other hazardous chemicals. With the village located right next to the Haryana border, Dinesh says they receive a major brunt of the pollution through these industrial units which empty their dyes and effluents in the drain.Some were sealed. A number of industries like these have resumed operations. The water and the foam make it evident that this is not normal water. We have seen industries even dump effluents by the truckload at night, said Dinesh Rana, covering his face with a handkerchief.Cancer cases are also increasing in our village. If there was one cancer case a decade ago, now there are 7 or 8, he added.The drain eventually joins Najafgarh drain before emptying into the Yamuna. Manoj Mishra, convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan says until such industries are stopped from causing pollution, Yamuna is not likely to see any improvement soon.Industrial pollution from Najagarh drain is largely from the Haryana side. Mungeshpur drain is a bigculprit. If you notice the water quality of the Najafgarh drain before Gurgaon and after it, you will see a considerable difference. It is evident the effluent is finding its way into the Yamuna and affecting all locals that come in its way, said Mishra."

State health officials helped a woman deliver a baby on a country boat at Bokakhat in Golaghat district. An accredited social health activist (ASHA), Manju Chetry, helped the woman deliver a baby boy weighing 3.4kg.They were on their way from the village to the wellness centre here, but realised that it would be late till they reach. So, with the help of a community health officer under Bokakhat BPHC and an ASHA worker, a successful delivery was conducted on the boat itself. Later, the mother and child were referred to the Bokakhat Sub-Divisional Civil Hospital. They are doing well, said Golaghat Deputy Commissioner Dhiren Hazarika.Heavy rains led to washed out roads in several places. In Dhubri, people who have settled near the railway lines were seen carrying tin sheets and plastics to build temporary shelters on the railway tracks. Several of them made an abandoned truck their temporary base to escape floods.Things are in a bad shape, we are taking shelter in the railway tracks. We saw a train approaching in the morning, said one of the flood victims.Along the India-Bangladesh border in Dhubri and Karimganj, some of the Border Security Force (BSF) outposts and a Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) camp have been inundated by rising water levels of rivers, making it difficult for the personnel on duty.

Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo (RJD) Lalu Prasad, who was the chief minister of undivided Bihar till 1997, is serving prison sentences in a number of cases related to the scam, while his predecessor Jagannath Mishra is out on bail and undergoing treatment for cancer.Citing examples of the massive financial irregularities during the 80s and the 90s, Modi told the House, ""Fodder worth Rs 10.5 crore was required for cattle and poultry in Chaibasa , Gumla, Dumka , Jamshedpur and Ranchi (now in Jharkhand) besides Patna. But an expenditure of Rs 253.33 crore was shown by the animal husbandry department.""For these six districts, purchase of yellow corn and almond straw - used in very small proportions for fodder - had been shown multiple times the actual requirement, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said on Wednesday.""The extent of the financial indiscipline can be gauged from a single example - the then general manager of a dairy farm at Hotwar - near Ranchi - showed an expenditure of Rs 15.50 lakh towards purchase of mustard oil for applying on the horns of buffaloes,"" Modi said evoking peals of laughter.The RJD supremo's son, Tejashwi Yadav, also drew sharp criticism from the deputy CM over his failure to attend the House during the ongoing session which began a month ago.Notably, RJD MLAs had staged a walkout when Modi was making his submission. The government's appropriation bill was also passed by a voice vote at that time.The Lalu Prasad-led party later reacted indignantly, with its MLA and spokesman Shakti Singh Yadav issuing a statement accusing the deputy CM of ""trying to hide his own failures and diverting public attention through false and out-of-context criticisms of Lalu Prasad and his family members""."

The then manager of the Hotwar milk supply-cum-dairy farm, Dr Januel Bhengraj, produced fake bills to gobble up the money in league with senior officers and top politicians.Fodder worth Rs 253.33 crore was purchased for the consumption of 959 sheep, 5664 pigs, 40,504 hens and 1,577 goats for Ranchi, Chaibasa, Dumka, Jamshedpur, Gumla and Patna districts against the precise requirement of fodder worth Rs 10.53 crore.As per the standard procedure, 10 per cent yellow maize is mixed with other ingredients as complete fodder for lactating and meat-producing animals. But yellow maize weighing 115 times more than the required quantity for six districts was shown to have been procured at the cost of Rs 154.72 crore.Similarly, 15 per cent almond oil cakes are mixed in complete food supplement for animals. However, oil cakes weighing 33 times more than the requirement were shown to have been purchased at the cost of Rs 7.69 crore.These are fresh revelations related to the fodder scam, made by Bihar deputy chief minister and finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi during the discussion on the Excess Expenditure Appropriation Bill, 2019 in the state legislature.He said excessive expenditures perceived or necessitated by the government are taken either as advance from the state contingency fund or through supplementary budgets approved by the state legislature.But this practice was not followed by the then government led by Lalu Prasad Yadav and excessive withdrawals were made more than the budgetary allocations in a bid to loot the public fund through fake bills, Sushil Modi said.A total excess expense of more than Rs 142.47 crore, incurred by different departments during different periods between the financial year 1977-78 and 2015-16, were ratified by the state assembly.However, a sum of Rs 658 crore spent by the animal husbandry department could not be considered because the fodder scam cases are pending with the CBI courts in Ranchi and Patna.A close scrutiny of annual outlays of the animal husbandry department reveals a shoddy tale of organised loot through gradual increase of budgetary allocations after 1990 and reckless excessive withdrawals were made through forged bills.A sum of Rs 54.92 crore was earmarked for animal husbandry department for 1990-91 state budget, but Rs 22.29 crore was spent in excess of budget outlay for the department spending total Rs 84.21 crore during the period.Similarly, a sum of Rs 59.10 crore was allocated for the department during 1991-92, but instead a sum of Rs 129.82 crore was spent, thus exceeding the budget outlay by Rs 70.72 crore. In 1992-93, the budgetary allocation was Rs 66.93 crore but a sum of Rs 154.70 crore was spent in excess of Rs 87.77 crore.The budget outlay of the AHD in 1993-94 was Rs 74.40 crore but an astounding Rs 245.01 crore was spent registering excessive withdrawal of Rs 170.61 crore. In 1995-96, the department made an expenditure of Rs 205.06 crore against the budgetary allocation of Rs 82.12 crore showing excessive withdrawal of Rs 122.94 crore.For over 14 years, the politicians and bureaucrats in Bihar joined hands to craft a spectacular scam. It is well-known that receipts for fodder were conjured out of thin air to the extent that bulls were shown to have been ferried from Ranchi to Ghagra on a scooter. In another instance, a car bearing registration number BHV-5777 was used to carry four bulls from Ranchi to Jhinkapani, according to CAG records.The government money was systematically looted and imaginary cows and bulls were transported to imaginary farmers who existed only on paper. The rush to withdraw money from the government treasury was so great that the political masters presided over the loot through a nexus of gung-ho bureaucrats and suppliers willing to manufacture bills out of thin air.The ever-willing treasury officers did not object to excess withdrawals since they also connived with the fodder mafia for pecuniary gains. By January 1995-96, Rs 116 crore were disbursed by various treasuries against the budgetary allocation of Rs 71 crore but the finance department had no clue as to how much money had been overdrawn from treasuries of Bihar.The money withdrawn on fake bills was stashed away in different banks in benami accounts in connivance with bank officials. In January 1996, the Ranchi administration seized seven bank accounts in different branches of Union Bank of India and State Bank of India. Five out of seven were benami accounts.Most members of the mafia owned palatial buildings in Ranchi, Patna, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata, and it is said that a majority of buildings in Ashok Nagar in Ranchi are owned by fodder mafia and suppliers. All the buildings had black polished marbles fittings and the washrooms had huge lotus-shaped bath tubs which Bollywood stars and starlets used at times as guests.(The author is a senior journalist.)"

And Dipen Patel, a civil engineer, thought of doing his bit to save the planets food cycle and how! Patel started harvesting honeybees. Theres more.Through hands-on research for over three years, Patel today has successfully collected honey in 15 different flavours and realized, bees not only give sweet returns, but also helps in better crop yield.The engineer-turned-farmer, who hails from Dolatpura village of Desar taluka, initially placed honeybee boxes in his sandalwood farm as a security measure. During the initial stages when I had placed the boxes, honeybees in several of them had died. This led me to research on the lives of honeybees. I met beekeepers, read research papers and articles on them extensively. I then learnt that the boxes have to be migrated regularly, said Patel.He further said that the honey that we buy from the market is merely sugar. Nectar is collected by bees from all kinds of flowers and many of these products are pasteurized due to which honey loses its all properties and what remains is sugar, Patel added.Realizing that honeybee travels within a diameter of two to three kilometres to collect nectar, Patel started experimenting by placing the boxes in farms having single crop. Most of the trees and crops have nectar in them. So when a honeybee gets nectar from a plant which is close to its comb, it will not travel further, he said.Patel then placed 150 boxes in jamun and drumstick farms. During the first experiment, honeybees in 50 to 60 boxes died as they may have tried to take nectar from fields sprayed with pesticides. However, the honey extracted from the remaining boxes had different characteristics, he said, adding that the colour and taste of honeys from the two farms were completely different.Patel sent samples of the two honeys to Vadodara Municipal Corporations laboratory for testing. Here, lab officials refused to accept that the honey was pure without additional colour. After the test results arrived, they were amazed as they had never come across honey that had different characteristics, Patel gushed, adding that this led him to look for more varieties of plants and crops with nectars and also those with medicinal properties. Patel zeroed down on 15 crops  sheesham, eucalyptus, fennel, basil, ajwain, acacia, banana and mustard among many others.Patel then tied up with Jayant Kumar Bhan, who retired from the oil and gas industry after more than 35 years of service. I loved the bees for their group behaviour and also wanted to provide pure honey to society. Since Patel was already into it, I joined him in his experiments, Bhan said."

(iStock)Sir  It has become commonplace for the Bengali bhadralok to express a virulent distaste for anything vegetarian. Yet Bengal has a rich tradition of serving a variety of such dishes; items like fish and mutton are just a part of a diverse meal. The Bengali kitchen churned out dishes ranging from the simplest mashed potato enlivened with mustard oil, green chillies and onion to a miscellany of vegetables that are fried, boiled, roasted or combined with other veggies and seasoned with spices. But the anxiety of meat and fish disappearing from plates across the country is causing the Bengali to rebel against vegetables in general.Kalyan Banerjee,CalcuttaNo one is surprised at the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy in Karnataka PTIPower gamesSir  No one is surprised at the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy in Karnataka. The Aya Ram, Gaya Ram culture in Indian politics that began in the 1970s is now a flourishing business of sorts. One could hope that the Narendra Modi government, which has a huge majority, will bring a more stringent anti-defection law to put an end to this unethical practice. But alas, toppling state governments headed by parties other than the BJP seems to be a priority for the saffron outfit.One only needs to look at the Madhya Pradesh leader of the Opposition, Gopal Bhargava, for proof. Bharghava shamefully claimed that the Congress government in the state would collapse in 24 hours if the Number 1 or Number 2 in the Bharatiya Janata Party issue an order to that effect. The way the BJP is proceeding by grabbing power in one state after another, it seems that its dream of one nation, one election will soon be fructified. India is undoubtedly headed towards becoming a totalitarian state.Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,FaridabadSir  The editorial, Steep fall (July 25), raises a pertinent question regarding the ease with which legislators defect en masse to change the fortunes of political parties without caring for the peoples mandate. This is a breach of fundamental democratic principles. The anti-defection law is not strong enough, making life easier for turncoats. When an elected representative changes his political affiliation, he must be made to seek re-election. This is the only way to ensure that democratic principles are not trifled with.Birkha Khadka Duvarseli,SiliguriSir  The collapse of the coalition government in Karnataka was expected. Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) are traditional rivals who came together not for the betterment of the electorate but to keep the BJP from coming to power. The relationship between the coalition partners was uneasy from day one. As is the case with most political alliances based on compromises, the denial of ministerial berths proved to be the undoing of the Congress-JD(S) combine. It is encouraging that the party in power at the Centre will also be ruling Karnataka. People in the state can now hope to be treated on a par with the citizens of other states.K.V. Seetharamaiah,Hassan, KarnatakaSir  The Congress-JD(S) alliance are as much to be blamed for the state of affairs in Karnataka as the BJP. Each political party is only concerned about holding on to power. When does the government have time to focus on welfare measures if it is busy ensuring that its members do not defect? The BJP is not different. In state after state, members conveniently defect to its benefit. In Bengal, the prime minister openly claimed that he was in touch with elected representatives from the Trinamul Congress. Democracy has gone for a toss in the country.Sanjukta Das,CalcuttaModernity callsSir  The Rajasthan High Court has taken a long overdue step by directing lawyers to dispense with the colonial practice of addressing judges as My Lord or Your Lordship and asked that they simply be called Sir (Dear Sir, July 25). Similarly, the British left the country over seven decades ago, but lawyers in India still have to wear the long black robes that were customary back in colonial times. It is time such superfluous rituals are done away with. Further, it is expected that the directive of the Rajasthan High Court will be applicable all across the country. There is also ample scope of simplifying the language of the legal documents, which are drafted using unnecessary jargons, complicating matters for lay citizens not trained in law.Asit Kumar Mitra,CalcuttaSir  It is heartening to note that the suggestion to address judges as Sir instead of My Lord or Your lordship has come from the judiciary itself. The change in salutation will be a step towards bringing equality between the dispensers of justice and lawyers. One only hopes that this initiative will be the forerunner of other, much-needed judicial reforms .Tarsem Singh,Hoshiarpur, PunjabSir  Cumbersome robes and needless courtesies only come in the way of dispensing swift justice. The directive of the Rajasthan High Court is, thus, heartening. The apex court should now officially ensure that such gratuitous practices are done away with.Rima Roy,Calcutta"
2019-07-29,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-engineer-who-quit-job-for-farming-lands-in-textbooks/articleshow/70426525.cms,Engr who quit job for farming lands in textbooks,"Venkat Iyer with his farm produceDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityMUMBAI: An engineer who quit his well-paying job in 2004 to take up full-time farming in a small village in Dahanu , his struggles and his difficulties have been made part of Class XI English textbooks by the Maharashtra State Board.Venkat Iyer, who practices organic farming on his 4.5 acres in Peth, says he is happy that through the revised textbook youth will learn about agriculture and the importance of indigenous varieties of produce. This year, the education department revamped the Class XI syllabus and changed textbooks.After 17 years of corporate job when he shifted to farming, he was met with failure and loss of crops, but did not lose his resolve. The textbook has a brief introduction of the author and a chapter from Iyer's book, Moong Over Microchips, which he published in 2018, has been made part of it. The chapter, The call of the soil-A scent of rice, talks about his experience initially as a farmer, the pride in owning his land, the first produce and his tryst with nature. ""I could not believe that I was the owner of the land and that I was looking at my first crop as a farmer,"" the chapter read.""Earlier, it was assumed that people who have no option turn to agriculture, but that is not the case any more. The chapter will also educate youth about organic farming and introduce them to traditional varieties of produce, which have been displaced by hybrid varieties,"" Iyer told TOI. Iyer grows seasonal vegetables, two indigenous varieties of rice (red and brown), sesame seeds, groundnut, mustard and basil leaves.When asked why he switched over to the green side, he said he was not sure what he wanted to do and was looking out for a while. At the same time, his wife was writing a book on organic cotton and was spending a lot of time in villages for her research. ""She would come back and tell me stories about the village life and I was fascinated. I asked her one day if I could become a farmer and she said if 65% people of the country are farmers, even I could. And that's where the seed was sown,"" said Iyer.He also trains local farmers in organic farming and has devised new marketing platforms to help farmers get new markets and better prices. Local farmers, along with Iyer, set up stalls in Mumbai housing societies and schools to sell their harvest.The committee working on textbooks said they wanted to introduce students to real-life role models. ""When we were working on textbooks, we noticed that until now textbooks included examples of historic role models or those no longer alive. Hence, we wanted to include examples which students can relate to, and stand a chance to meet,"" said textbooks committee chief coordinator Prachi Sathe."

The police had registered a case under sections 302 and 201 of Indian Penal Code against unknown persons at Pataudi police station.The court of additional district and sessions judge pronounced the sentence on Monday.The police said that it was a blind case and their only clue was a train ticket recovered from the victims pocket. The ticket led the police to Jodhpur, Rajasthan, where the victim, a native of Bhojpur in Bihar, used to stay while working there.The convict, Sanjay Dutt, was a neighbour of the deceased. He had hatched a conspiracy to kidnap the victim and demand Rs. 50,000 as ransom to pay a debt. The victim had confided in Dutt about his familys financial status, police spokesperson Subhash Boken said.He took the victim from Jodhpur to Pataudi, taking a brief detour to Singhana. In Pataudi, Dutt was joined by a friend, Sanjeev. They offered the victim a spiked alcoholic drink and then strangled him with a cable and slit his throat with a blade. They escaped after dumping the body in the field. After killing him, the accused had called the victims family demanding the ransom money, Boken said, adding that since the police had informed the family about the murder, no ransom was paid.The police said when they had gone to Jodhpur, a relative had informed them of the ransom call.The convicts were held guilty under IPC sections 302 (murder), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (disappearance of evidence of offence) and 404 (misappropriation of property). All the sentences shall run concurrently.First Published: Aug 01, 2019 07:36 IST"

The route to Pryda village, set deep within the West Khasi hills of Meghalaya, involves a gruelling one hour trek. Fortunately Spermon Kharnaior has volunteered to guide me. The sprightly village matriarch, probably in her late 70s, skips from rock to shaky rock as we climb uphill, with an impressively firm grip on my wrist to haul me past the more challenging portions.A few hours ago we were at a dramatic meeting of the tribes in Shillong helmed by the International eco-gastronomic movement Slow Food. The meeting brought together about 600 delegates representing 140 tribes from over 58 countries. Spending three days among pastoralists, honey gatherers, yak herders, reindeer breeders, fishermen and farmers made me develop a new respect for ingredients and the people who bring them to our dining tables.As a food writer, I spend time learning from chefs and mixologists, who use complicated, impressive techniques to tease and primp ingredients into flamboyant menus and sophisticated cocktails. It is humbling to be reminded that ultimately everything depends on ingredients. And the only way to get quality ingredients is by respecting water, soil and forests, just like the indigenous people do.Admittedly, it is easier said than done in a world that bristles with processed food, and in which taste buds have been trained to crave the addictive alchemy of fat, salt and sugar that comes in every bagged snack. I try. I gingerly sample crunchy Eri silk worms, reputed to taste like crisps. (They dont!) Eat lunch with a surprisingly tasty and tangy ant chutney. And snack on salted deep-fried grasshoppers.Then, I head to Pryda for lunch. A pig has been killed, and every part of it has been sensibly used, so nothing goes to waste. A sturdy table in the village schoolhouse is laden with food, much of it unfamiliar. There are bowls filled with fresh green herbs and a hefty pot fragrant with sauted mustard leaves. At the centre of the banquet is the pork curry  rich, spicy and delicious.There isnt a sauce bottle or plastic packet in sight: none of these flavours have come out of a factory. There are no chefs in the kitchen; the community has cooked together, between cups of tea and gossip. The vegetables were harvested in the morning from a garden behind the school. The flavours are uncomplicated and alluring in a way no Michelin starred restaurant can compete with.As the sun dims, I jump up realising I must leave immediately if I am to reach the main road before the path is plunged into darkness. Spermon presses a cool package into my hands as she hugs me goodbye. Its sohplang, a local tuber, deftly wrapped in banana leaves. I snack on it thoughtfully as I walk back: it is crisp, juicy and refreshing.Environmentalists warn us incessantly that we are marching towards a precipice, propelled by competitive consumerism. Can looking towards the villages save us? It may sound nave but it is a seductive idea. And I would rather learn lessons from Spermon and her ilk than be disappointed, again, by yet another Facebook warrior."
2019-08-03,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/elon-musk-seems-intent-on-erasing-the-line-between-philanthropy-and-fantasy/cid/1695712,Elon Musk seems intent on erasing the line between philanthropy and fantasy,"The old-school philanthropist favoured benefaction. The legacies of Alfred Nobel, Henry Ford or even Alexander Graham Bell continue to be burnished by their singular charitable contributions. But the modern patron is, arguably, far more ambitious. It is, evidently, no longer enough to have a charitable heart. The stakes must be raised higher; at times, even as high as blurring the line between philanthropy and fantasy.Elon R. Musk, the much-feted technology entrepreneur, seems to be an enthusiastic endorser of this new age  aggressive  culture of endowment. Tesla, of which Mr Musk is a co-founder, pioneered the self-driving car, booting the human driver out of contention. Among his other concerns  passion would be the appropriate expression  is SpaceX, which, in true philanthropic fashion, seeks to make space travel an affordable, public enterprise. Egged on by his altruistic spirit, Mr Musk has now declared that he is ready to go where, as that iconic slogan says, no man has gone before. He has come up with the idea of linking the human brain to the computer so as to enable consumers struggling with debilitating conditions  those struck by paralysis, for example  to interact seamlessly with electronic devices. Neuralink, Mr Musks dream, proposes to insert an implant in the brain, a proposal that involves a rather invasive medical procedure. But then that would be a small price to pay for those who agree that Neuralink is an irresistible idea. The thrill of controlling machines without having to move a finger  thoughts, Mr Musk has assured the world, would be enough to get the machines to do chores  must be truly overwhelming.But there is a danger in this kind of seduction. It can, fact and fiction have shown repeatedly, lead to the surrendering of the faculty of reason. Having been overwhelmed by the power of charisma, democracies around the world are beginning to rest their faith in allegedly despotic leaderships. Victor Frankenstein, scarred by the death of his mother, had attempted to end the suffering caused by mortality. But he had been ultimately consumed by his monstrous creation. There is a line of thought that argues that Mr Musks creation could prove to be monstrous. Modern machines are notoriously vulnerable to hacking. Would a link between man and machine impair human health by making it susceptible to such intrusions? A chip in the brain, segments in the medical fraternity believe, could have unknown physiological repercussions as well.Human inventors, down the ages, share a common dilemma  the unpredictable nature of their inventions. While it is true that the genesis of chemotherapy lies in mustard gas, a deadly war weapon, it must also be acknowledged that Bayonne, a town renowned for its cutlery, played a role in the creation of the bayonet. The assessment of Mr Musks legacy hangs in a similar, delicate balance."

Pradeep is smoking a beedi, so is Sonu, who has an eagle tattoo on his biceps. Naveen is concernedly examining his blistered hand. Its because of cement... tonight Ill rub mustard oil, he said.All five men, in their 20s, are palledars, or labourers, who unload cement sacks from goods trains, the only tool at their disposal is a hooked metal tool called kundi.The poker-faced Parveen suddenly utters a line in a singsong tune: Socha tha banege kalakar, ban gaye palledar.Everyone laughs, except for Parveen whose face remains expressionless.This is an old joke among these men and was first uttered by a common friend who went to Kolkata hoping to become a movie actor but ended up as a palledar.All five are from Meerut and frequently come to Gurgaon railway station on the summons of a contractor.Same mazdoori (labour) in Meerut station but less money, says one. The rate for unloading a single sack is Rs 2.30 in Gurugram compared to Rs 1.5 in Meerut.Each labourer handles 3,000 sacks daily.By the end of the day we are as dead as a cement sack, half-jokes the man with the eagle tattoo.The labourers, however, have learned to make the best out of the situation. We always dine early at night, says Naveen, after which each of us gulps down a quarter of desi daru, just Rs 50, and that guarantees a quick long sleep.

2019-08-05,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/growing-crops-without-soil-heres-how-hydroponics-works/article28822221.ece,Growing crops without soil: Here’s how hydroponics works,"The air in the polyhouse is thick with the fragrance of basil.A variety of lettuce, baby spinach, arugula, mustard greens, kale, mint and the aforementioned basil thrive in little net pots, nestled in troughs with varying levels of water.Workers are busy checking the roots and shoots of the plants before deciding whether to move them to the next stage. All one can hear is the gentle whirring of fans, constantly running to maintain a conducive temperature inside the polyhouse. It is hard to believe that bustling OMR is just 500 metres away from these lush surroundings.Meeting market demandAt HMA Greens Hydro Farm there are over 14 varieties of greens being grown at any given point using hydroponics. Launched in early 2018 by 30-year-old Akil Murthi, the farm started with three varieties of lettuce before scaling up to its present stage.I first came across hydroponics when I was doing my MBA in Singapore. I wanted to replicate it since we didnt have anything of the sort here then. Land is becoming premium and you can do so much more with hydroponics: better quality control, more yield in a smaller patch of land and lower water usage as well, he says, adding, It took about eight months to get the project moving.Akil explains how hydroponics allows one to tailor crops as per market demand. There was a report by the World Economic Forum that stated that a lot of Southeast Asian countries grow crops that are not really required in the market at that point of time. This leads to wasted produce, he says. He adds, With hydroponics we can change that, since harvesting times are a lot shorter than in traditional farming.In hydroponics it takes an average of 45 days to harvest crops like lettuce, basil and baby spinach. The same would take around 90 days when grown the traditional way. Water consumed to grow these crops is 90% less. A nutrient solution is mixed into the water in the control room. From here it is pumped into troughs which house the net pots with the crops. Since the water directly reaches the roots, it is absorbed much better and you need much less water as well since nothing is lost in soil absorption, says Akil.Less water, good yieldTypically, HMA Greens farm uses around 700-800 litres of water a day. In winter that consumption goes down to 500 litres. This is why his farm has managed to consistently produce good yield despite the water scarcity in the city this year.No chemicals are used in the farm and only natural ingredients such as neem oil are used to keep away pests. We also use sticky pads and a solar powered insect trap, says Akil.They also use the Nutrient Filled Technique (NFT) system, which Akil says is ideal to grow crops like salad greens. The polyhouse also uses the pad and fan technology  cooling pads line the wall on one side, while on the opposite wall are fans  to maintain temperature and humidity levels inside. Since this was a pilot project we did not get into vertical farming. If we decide to, itd mean changing our entire system and bringing in LED lights for the plants.On an average the HMA farm produces a total yield of 2,500 kilograms during summer and in the cooler months manages to churn out as much as 4,000 kilograms. Excess produce is turned into compost. HMA farm delivers to customers doorsteps for a fixed charge. Alternatively, customers can pick up their orders from the office at HMA Land, Thapar house, 37, Montieth Road, Egmore. 28553550."

I am aboard The Black Pearl, a pirate-themed buffet restaurant at Sholinganallur junction on Old Mahabalipuram Road. With pirate caps on sale and an ongoing selfie contest, the restaurant intends to get its guests to participate in the theme.So, blimey! Why am I still talkin like a landlubber, and not like the true-blue sea dog that I am?I am just settlin in and the mobile beeps. Shiver me timbers, its a WhatsApp video call from my brood. I ignore it, thanks to the wisdom of the seas. As my two kids love role-playing games, I am not showing them where I am, and risking a cold reception later at home.With what looks like a labouriously-crafted decor offering vignettes of life aboard a pirate ship and statues and busts of characters from Pirates of the Caribbean, The Black Pearl creates a world of make-believe and role-playing that should naturally appeal to children. The evidence is not far to be seen: At the next table, the excitement on a childs face proves it.As I travel on The Black Pearl on a Monday, there is piped music, with the selection expectedly restricted to English songs (a live band plays on other days). The sounds are a tad too loud for my comfort. It can be an irritant while I am trying to catch up on scuttlebutt (gossip in my seafarers parlance) with my fellow liquor-guzzling buccaneers.Aaarrrggghhh! Now, the Pirate Tavern is a let-down. It presents a sight that a sailor of my stripes can never appreciate. Mocktails flow freely where liquor should. Joel Rajadurai, manager of the restaurant, explains, The liquor licence is expected to come, tentatively, before the end of August. Until then, it will be only mocktails.Now, the food is marked by variety, but sticks to the tried and tested, largely staying in Indian waters. In the main vegetarian section, the paneer Kolhapuri and pineapple sadam have been interestingly made and the results match the efforts. Paneer Kolhapuri is spicy without being hard on the oesophagus and stomach  and that comes from someone who battles GERD (a gastroesophageal issue). I learn that freshly-ground cashewnut paste takes the edge off the spices, which include Kashmiri chilli powder.Pineapple sadam, said to be a new addition to the menu, seems set to run for many weeks. Besides pineapple slices, peanuts and roasted channa dal are significant flavours apparent in the dish that is garnished with curry leaves.In the non-vegetarian main course, kozhi varutha curry packs a punch. Marinated chicken is sauted with onion and tomato sauce along with Indian spices. Mustard fish curry is bland in a nice way: catla fish is fried in mustard oil, and the gravy prepared with mustard sauce. The egg masala, though, can be improved upon: it comes with a gravy that is right for rice, but too thick for rotis.One gets a sense of a large spread, at the very beginning with the starters, which alone are served.For those choosing non-vegetarian fare, there is an on-table barbecue grill, with its offerings to choose from. The appetizers, small-eats and desserts section seems to beat the rest, in terms of items. There are dedicated counters for chaats and pizzas.The desserts section, with its sugar-overloaded shakarpara, jalebi with rabri and paan ice cream, closes the dining experience with a taste that is likely to linger on."

A cloud of vacillation takes over and there is nothing really to hold on to as a crutch. Love seems to be the most natural thing to reach out to. Finding that person, place or thing that stimulates closeness during sombre times, is what Delhi-based fashion designer Abhinav Mishra scouts for in moments of crisis.As an ode to this unconditional reinforcement, he dedicates a collection to love, calling it Love Stories.Delhi-based fashion designerAbhinav MishraThis bridal couture collection encompasses this emotion in the way it transcends the narrow visions of communal, racial or societal love. Its about one love one religion or in other words, the religion of love. Its a place where there is acceptance, where Hindu, Muslim and Punjabi weddings arent governed by individual rituals but by the law of eternal, all-encompassing, never-ending love, says the 30 year-old-designer, who gets his creative forbearance from the karigars of Delhi.He would visit them at their kharkhanas, often located in the citys nooks and crannies to see how they executed complex stitch work gracefully. Old Delhi too has fuelled his creativity. Its history urges him to incorporate the citys cultural excellence into modern clothing. Delhi runs in my blood. Its here that I began dreaming and its here that Ive realised them too, he says.A little dream has been achieved through Love Stories as well. Divided into Seerat, Roshanara and Banarasiya collections, these propagate the diversity and dynamicity within each.Through his label, he has dressed women from different cultures and seen how they approach their outfits. They are all operating from that one strong central desire for attachment and need for tender attention.The lehengas, anarkalis and shararas come with dextrous mirror work, symbolising the way love reflects more love. Some of the garments have been treated with gota patti and marori work.The choice of colours too paints a cheery attitude with mustard yellow, rani pink, powder blue, ivory, maroon, red, emerald green, and sapphire blue to symbolise the many shades of love. It took me four months to create this. Since love is the essence of weddings, I visualised a utopian world where love unites and is treated with equality. Inherently, I would like to see his translate into reality, hopefully, while I am still around to see it.Store address: Leela, 116-A, Ground Floor, Shahpur Jat, Siri Fort"

But we found that people who dont see the labels eat this butter after it is offered to the god at various temples, said Chennai food safety officer A Ramakrishnan.Most manufacturers also make edible ghee and butter on the same assembly line. This is a complete violation of food safety as there is risk of edible food getting mixed with these chemicals, another official said. Samples of ghee and butter products were seized from these units and sent for analysis.We will be able to find adulterants they use. We can frame charges against the manufacturers if edible ghee is contaminated and if there are labelling issues, he said. If the charges are proved, it can lead to cancellation of manufacturing licence besides criminal action.None of the manufacturers reared cows or had dairy farms and bought raw material  white and yellow butter and ghee  from a distributor (name withheld for investigation) in tins. The distributor also gives them 5 litres of a red dye mixed with mustard oil. This goes into white butter to give it the colour and texture of cows ghee.The chemicals have also been sent for analysis. Last year, food safety officials in Visakhapatnam found manufacturers mixing synthetic resin adhesive such as Fevicol with ghee.Consuming ghee or butter mixed with colouring chemicals and vanaspathi is dangerous. While the chemicals can cause digestive disorders and cancer, the effect of vanaspathi is equally devastating.It is vegetable ghee that has been hydrogenated and hardened with palmolein. It is high on trans fats, a risk factor for high cholesterol, heart attacks and strokes, said nutritionist S Bhama.In 2018, the government said 47 major temples in Tamil Nadu run by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department will get Food Safety and Standards Authority of India certification for prasad. Food safety officials say they check all temples. We told temple officials and priests not to use inedible substance as offering, he said."

And soon, weather officials sent out a warning saying the deluge is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. While this would substantially reduce the citys current monsoon deficit of 44%, it has also brought cheer to hilsa lovers who have not been able to indulge in their favourite fish as much this season. Thanks to a dismal spell of rain, the supply of hilsa has remained largely affected this season. But with the current weather, theres no stopping Bengali foodies, who are all geared up for khichuri and ilish maachh bhaja for their Sunday lunch.I just bought a stock of 1,000 kg of ilish. Finally, I have some good stuff here, said Ratikanta Bar, a wholesale fish seller in Howrahs Kalibabur Bajar, on Saturday morning. So, after months of small, inferior catches, at last good-quality ilish has just started to come in. However, with the depression that set in on Bengal in the last two days, the fishermen boats are stationed in the harbours. There is a weather alert and no boat can go fishing now. It is a government instruction. If anyone disobeys, he has to pay a fine. But this is temporary. Since good fish has started coming in, I presume all the markets in Bengal will be stocked up with quality ilish in a weeks time, he added.Talking about the price of ilish here, he added, Any catch between 700-800 gm is available at around `800 per kg. We are selling one-kilo ilish at `1,200 per kg. Fish weighing 1.2 kilo to 1.5 kilo is available for about `1,500 per kg. There is absolutely no fish coming from Bangladesh. However, given the trend, now we are getting pretty big-size catches too.According to an official from the state fisheries department, until Friday, the amount of rainfall received here was rather low. So, the fishermen havent been able to get a good catch this season. But they expect the situation to improve by month-end. The current downpour that Kolkata is experiencing is a result of a cyclonic circulation over south Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh. We are hoping that the situation will improve by the end of August. With more rain, the supply of hilsa is expected to normalise. However, in between, small amounts of hilsa have been caught from the coasts of Digha and Diamond Harbour , said Chandra Nath Sinha, the West Bengal minister for fisheries. Actor Ritwick Chakraborty, who loves to gorge on ilish, said, ""While my father is from Dhaka, my mom is epar Banglar. So, ilish dishes at home have always been influenced by both the sides. I love the patla jhol of ilish or even bhapa. Even fried ilish along with steamed rice, mixed with the bhaja tel, is so appetising!""When do you say your ilish has gone bad? It is never when the curry is too jhaal or nunpora. Ask Bengalis and they will tell you that ilish goes bad only when it is not served in plenty.Way before the silver harvest started pinching a deeper hole in our pockets, a middle-class Bengali familys monsoon feast would include three to four varieties of the fish  ilish maach bhaja with ilish bhaja tel, begun diye kalo jeere-knachalonkar jhol and ilish maach bhaapa or shorshe ilish. Be it jora ilish on Saraswati Puja and special items on Jamai Sashthi, what the queen of fishes enjoys in Bengali households is pure love.While certain dishes of ilish, including shorshe bata, paturi, bhaja and bhape, are Bengalis staples, there are several other items that are as delish but do not enjoy the same popularity for their region of origin.In the eternal cultural fistfight between Ghoti and Bangal, ilish is one of the biggest stakeholders. While Bangals claim they can cook more than 400 different items, some unique dishes, including ilish maacher tok and posto ilish, were introduced by Ghotis. Santanu Bhattacharya  a Kolkata-based HR professional, who hails from East Midnapore  said ilish maacher tok is cooked regularly in his household. Besides shorshe bata ilish, my father prepares this chutney with tamarind pulp and ilish maacher matha. We have it with rice or on its own, he told us.Not just in Midnapore, in 24 Parganas too, the chutney is popular. Kakoli Bhattacharya, who hails from Bakhrahat, South 24 Parganas, said, I remember my mother making this chutney in our childhood. But none of our siblings were fond of it and, hence, she stopped making it. Instead, they lapped up a curry that had panch phoron (a mix of fenugreek seed, nigella seed, cumin seed, black mustard seed and fennel seed in equal parts). My mother used to make ilisher jhol with alu-begun and dhonebata (potato, aubergine and coriander seed paste). She would add a dash of mustard paste and after the jhol was done, she would temper it with paanch phoron. She would also make pui shak (Malabar spinach) with ilisher matha, Kakoli told us. The fishermen community of South 24 Parganas has a unique recipe for their time of sailing. Bimal Bera, owner of a couple of ilish-catching mechanised boats near Sagar, said, Our trawlers travel for over 18 hours at the average speed of 15 kmph. We travel almost 300 km from the harbour. There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Meanwhile, several households in other parts of Bengal use locally available ingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacing mustard with posto (poppy seed). We prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is common in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Ilish became hilsa in the kitchens of our colonial past. Not all British households in India could debone ilish with fork and knife and, hence, the khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire. British rulers are gone more than seven decades ago. However, smoked hilsa remains popular. Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later. It is seasonally available at some traditional restaurants in the Park Street area.While a lot of areas in Bengal have their own version of ilish preparations, many items have a strong Bangal influence too. Sandhya Roy , whose family hails from Barisal and is settled in the colony area of Garia, said their cooking involves garlic. We take a heavy-bottom pan with a lid. We lay about two banana leaves. On the top of the leaves we arrange the fish with garlic and kochu shak with mustard oil. We close the lid and put it on low flame. We often replace kochu shaak with mustard paste, Sandhya told us. The influence of Bangal recipes is visible in North Bengal, where nona ilish is common. Sayantan Sarkar, a businessman from Cooch Behar , claimed that his early memory of ilish mach is all about nona ilish  ilish dried with salt. We are from Mathabhanga and fresh ilish was not widely available in my childhood due to lack of proper roads and transportation. I remember my mother and grandmother preparing nona ilish with onion and garlic. I think the dried fish used to come from Assam. Now, we get a lot of fresh fish and, hence, the supply of nona ilish has gone down. Our staple fresh ilish preparation is with potol, jhinge and danta (pointed gourd, ridge gourd and drumstick)  an obvious influence of Purbo Bongo, he said. The post-Partition settlement in North Bengal has influenced the local peoples diet a lot. Mandabi Bhattacharyya, a city-based NGO worker, who hails from Jalpaiguri, said, Earlier, there used to be days in the festival season when people used to buy fish from the other side of the border at a cheap price. My father and uncles used to go there. Ilish maach is usually prepared with kalo-jeere (black cumin seeds) and aubergine. We temper it with fenugreek seeds and add diced pumpkin.The way she movesAccording to food writer Amitabha Malakar, every province has its own story of ilish. Take Sylhet and Noakhali for example. Ilisher shnutki is popular in both these places. In Sylhet, people make shnutki because of lack of availability of ilish. In Noakhali, people dry ilish for its abundance. The same happens with ilisher tok in this part of Bengal. In Midnapore and 24 Parganas, tok is made of tamarind pulp. As you move west, the same tok is made of chalta (elephant apple) and kamranga (star fruit). Some Bengali diaspora grill ilish like they grill salmon, he said.Several households are other parts of Bengal have made use of locally availableingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacingmustard with posto (poppy seed). We usually prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is prettycommon in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Not all British households in India could debone ilish with elan with fork and knife and, hence, their khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire... Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later. It is seasonally available at some traditional restaurants in the Park Street areaThe fishermen community of South 24 Parganas has a unique recipe for their time of sailing. Bimal Bera, owner of a couple of ilish-catching mechanised boats near Sagar, said, Our trawlers travel for over 18 hours at the average speed of 15 kmph. We travel almost 300 km from the harbour. There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Both my parents are Ghotis. At my house in Santiniketan, my mother makes two types of ilish. One is the bhapa preparation. For the other one, ilish is first fried and then put into a curry, which is made of tomato, ginger paste, coriander powder and kalo jeere. Salt and sugar are added as per taste. It is a light curry but tastes heavenly. For me, having ilish is a task, what with all the bones. I need someone to help me remove the bones from the fish. Ma amake kaanta bechhe daye. So, outside home, I prefer having boneless ilish only. Aparajita Ghosh, actressI am a die-hard ilish fan. Though I am a Ghoti, my wife is a Bangal. So, every ilish recipe cooked at our place will always have the Bangal essence. I am fond of all their hilsa dishes, but my most favourite is the one made with doi, kalo jeere and begun. This season, I have already had hilsa thrice. But since monsoon has just begun properly here, I look forward to gorging on a lot more hilsa in the coming days. During the rainy season, we make hilsa at home at least twice a week, if not more. I not only love eating this fish, but I have also learnt a lot of Bangal hilsa dishes from my wife and at times I like to prepare them myself too. Kharaj Mukherjee, actor"

Young couples in NCR are increasingly looking to get such pre-wedding shoots done and are heading to the fields outlining the small villages of Greater Noida . They are closer home and picturesque, which means that couples can get beautiful shoots done, with minimum hassles.Photographers say the demand for having a desi shoot has increased in the last two years. Earlier, I used to suggest locations in Delhi for couples looking to do outdoor pre-wedding photo shoots. However, for the last two years, many couples have expressed their desire to shoot at farms in Greater Noida with a desi set-up. The natural and bright settings bring out some of the best pre-wedding pictures and now I have started suggesting it to all couples and many of them opt for it, says Deepak Trehan, who has a photo studio in Greater Noida.According to couples, shooting in the lush green farms provides them with a refreshing break from life among the towering high rises in the city.We are living in a concrete jungle and I wanted my pre-wedding shoot to be straight out of a book  with nature and beauty all around. Greater Noida has a beautiful landscape, so we jumped at the idea of shooting at the farms, says Ankita Khandelwal, a resident of Sector 71.For others, it is a time to live their 'moment. I am a big SRK fan and since childhood, I had the dream of reliving that scene from 'in which Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan are romancing in a mustard field. I was able to make that real here in Greater Noida. I had no idea earlier that the city has such beautiful locales, says Rakhi Bedi, a resident of Sector 93, Noida.With most of them located in isolated places around the city, the farms in Greater Noida are also chosen for pre-wedding shoots because there is no fee involved. Shooting at monuments or even in studios for that matter is more expensive than shooting at a farm since there is zero cost involved, in terms of location. So obviously shoot costs are considerably lower and are preferred by couples who dont really want to splurge on pre-wedding shoots, says Ajay Sapra, who has a photo studio in Sector 25, Noida.Though the farms belong to local villagers, photographers say there is no problem in getting permissions. As long as we are not damaging crops, locals dont mind us shooting in the farms. In fact, I have now developed friendship with the caretaker of a farm in Greater Noida and he always allows us to shoot, says Vicky Mehta, who has a photo studio in Sector 51. Photographers add that they always shoot during early morning as that ensures better lighting and there is less trespassing.Farms spell home advantage for Noida, Greater noida residentsSome people consciously decide to shoot in their own city. My fianc and I live in this city, work here, met each other here and we are getting married here itself. So it only seems logical to have our pre-wedding shoot right here. When we told this to our photographer and he immediately suggested us to do the shoot at the farms in Greater Noida and we really liked the location, says Manjari Bhatia, a resident of Sector 37.With the locations just a few kilometers from Noida city, the farms in Greater Noida also come to the rescue of couples who are short of time and cant go for elaborate shoots in other cities. It takes barely 30 minutes to reach the farms from Noida and for couples who want to get done with the shoot during the first half of the day, the Greater Noida farms become the best option, adds Trehan.In Video: Pre-wedding shoots come to Greater Noida farms"

I dont like overloading a dish with too many ingredients, said Nair, while mentioning that his menu has a separate section focusing on Lucknows cuisine. He further says that he cooks with mustard oil and ghee in old-school copper utensils to give a nawabi touch to the dishes.For the main course, two dishes stood out among the delicious array of dishes  Shahi Nalli Nihari and Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani. Light-yellow fragrant biryani rice with soft and juicy mutton pieces is too good to be true. The meaty nalli in a light gravy is to die for. Cooked for over 24 hours, you will not regret gorging on the beautiful mutton raan.To finish off the evening, the chef suggested his special dessert, Makhan Phirni. Loaded with butter and topped with a sweet sticky caramel, the dense creamy dish will take you back to your childhood. Nair said, Most people who had the dish wanted some more.

Come September and India explodes with colour, light, fireworks, and food. The two big festivals just round the corner are Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam, to be followed by the gaiety of Dussehra and the explosion of Diwali.Both Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam are festivals that tug at the emotional bonds of people, Maharashtrian and Malayalam people in this case. Weary form a years work, Malayalis from all over the world rush back to their native towns and villages for the festival of Onam. Maharashtrians do the same, going from cities like Mumbai and Pune back to their villages and hometowns. This is a time to bond with family and friends and celebrate culture and heritage as our people have, for centuries.Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival close to my heart, and Ive often written about how it was celebrated in our homes, and the special foods that were so typical of the festival. But I havent delved much into a classic Onam celebration. Onam is primarily a harvest festival, celebrated all over Kerala to commemorate the golden rule of king Mahabali, a fabled asura ruler. Jealous of his acclaim, the legend goes, the Gods conspired to end his reign. They sent Lord Vishnu to earth in his Vaman (dwarf Brahmin) avatar, and he trampled Mahabali into the netherworld, but granted his last wish  to visit his land and people once a year.That day is celebrated as Onam. With Onam come banana leaves, colourful Kathakali masks, the aroma of incense and the beats of the Panchavadyam and Chenda drums. Onam is the emotional string that binds all Malayalis together.And nothing brings together all Malayalis like the Sadya does. Sadya is the Malayalam word for feast and it is Keralas most popular and revered Vegetarian Thali. Sadya is not only served during Onam, a Sadya can also be the traditional meal served during a wedding or on Vishu (another festival celebrated in Kerala and in parts of coastal Tamil Nadu).I am an ardent worshipper of food from Kerala, especially of Mapla and Syrian Christian delicacies, but the Sadya has a special place in my heart. Its the one vegetarian meal that I adore. Maybe its the coconut that features in the Avial and Payasam or the crisp south Indian papadams or all the lovey fritters that go with a traditional Sadya.Normally the Sadya served on Onam is cooked without onions or garlic. A full-fledged Sadya should have at least 23 items. The meal is usually had sitting on the floor; cutlery is definitely avoided. A Sadya must comprise of Avial (curd curry), Thoran (dry vegetables), pickles, lemon, salt, boiled rice and Payasam (a sweet dish).It starts with Kaya Varuthathu (crisp banana chips fried in coconut oil), Sarkara Varatti (jaggery-coated banana chips), at least two kinds of pickle, raw mango or lime. Along with that is served a Pachadi (a sour curd curry made with cucumber and ash gourd cooked in coconut, mustard seeds and curry leaves). Then comes the classic Avial, the nectar of Kerala  soft and creamy vegetables cooked with coconut, curd, coconut oil and curry leaves. The omnipresent Sambar and a pepper-spiked Rasam. Then there is Parippu (a thick moong dal curry cooked with grated coconut and seasoned with spices and drizzled with ghee).Thoran can be made from any vegetables that are fresh and available  carrots, cabbage, beans, tomatoes or leafy veggies. The curry is flavoured with coconut and green chillies.You can take the Sadya to whatever level of fanciness you wish. You can add dishes like Erissery (a coconut curry of pumpkin and black-eyed peas), Kaalan (a sour dish made with bananas or yam cooked in yogurt, and coconut) and Olan (spiced black peas in coconut milk).As with most meals, you end with a sweet dish. Here, Palada Pradhaman (a sweet dish made with rice, milk and dry fruit) or Pazham Pradhaman (rice with coconut pieces and jaggery) is typically the last dish served.If you truly want to understand what an Onam Sadya means to a Malayali, there is a saying that describes it best. They say in Malayalam: Kanam vittum Onam unnanam, which means We should have the Onam Sadya even if we have to sell all our land.First Published: Aug 30, 2019 19:23 IST"

2019-08-31,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/magnet-fishing-the-hobby-that-is-cleaning-up-french-rivers/article29310653.ece,Magnet fishing: the hobby that is cleaning up French rivers,"Equipped with powerful magnets, history enthusiasts and environmentalists scour Frances rivers, pulling out bits of scrap metal, bikes, scooters and the odd kitchen appliance.Sometimes, they fish other more unexpected objects out of the water, such as unexploded munitions.Magnet fishing has fast become a popular pastime, according to public safety officials, but French authorities have clamped down over fears that historical battle sites could still harbour active weapons.As in other countries, participants in France tie a super magnet to a rope and drop it into waterways, partly for treasure hunting, partly for environmental reasons.On the banks of the Oise river, in a town about 75 km north of Paris, Owen Gressier, 20, and his three fellow magnet fishermen cast their neodymium magnets.After several attempts at their spot near a bridge in La Croix-Saint-Ouen, they latch onto something It takes a few minutes to haul out the item with the help of a grappling hook. A rusty, cast-iron pipe emerges: Nice catch, they say. Its the best find that afternoon.Weve been fishing here for a number of years, the bottom (of the river) is pretty clean, Gressier, a forklift truck operator, says.Driven by what he calls his passion for memorabilia related to the Second World War and a quest to find medals, military gear and other historical objects, Mr. Gressier says that he also quickly realised that it was possible to clean up the waterways.In 2017, he set up a Facebook page, which now has more than 500 subscribers, where members share photos, advice and organise outings. Its crazy everything you can find in the water, Mr. Gressier says, listing anything from electric scooters to traffic signs and microwave ovens.With a dozen people, you can sometimes pull out 50 kilos of scrap metal in a few hours, he adds.In the neighbouring Somme department, site of one of the largest battles of the First World War, Christophe Devarenne started magnet fishing three months ago.He says the thrill comes from not knowing what will be at the end of the magnet.But the 52-year-old driver warns that if you expect to find treasures, there are not many.Although he did pull out a rifle dating from 1914 to 1918, he says that it was downright rusty after 100 years in the water.Even the Museum of the Great War did not want it, he jokes, adding that nothing goes to waste as it is resold or given to scrap merchants.In other French regions too, where bloody battles were fought during both world wars, magnet fishing enthusiasts have discovered shells, ammunition and grenades.And they can still be active, warns the national public safety authority.Faced with the hobbys rising popularity in the last nearly two years, including under the Pont des Arts pedestrian bridge in central Paris, the authority has recently made police across France aware of the dangers. In May, a man was seriously injured after pulling out a shell that emitted mustard gas, in the Nord region, home to the town of Dunkirk.Two young magnet fishers in the Somme at the end of July also hauled out a phosphorus grenade, which irritated their eyes, police said.The pastime is now illegal in France without a permit issued by the state or landowners.We were not aware of the risks... until my son found a grenade, says Helene Ledien, who lives in the Somme.She said that her 14-year-old son Arthur bought a magnet for about 30 euros ($33) on Amazon and regularly fishes with his friend for environmental reasons.Gressier said that his group had hauled out one active shell and hundreds of rusty weapons but knows what to do in that case.We establish a security perimeter and we warn the disposal experts, he adds.Despite the warnings, his group says it wont stop the activity that has got them hooked.Its a passion, good for the planet, we will not stop overnight, says his 26-year-old friend Nicolas, who declined to give his full name.People will play cat and mouse, Devarenne chimes in.Nobody is really afraid, because the police have better things to do than chase after magnets, he adds.

The typical way someone wanting to improve their health would be using microgreens in smoothies, simply tossing them over salads and main courses. For instance, the brassica family of microgreens contain the biochemical glucosinolate, a powerful cancer fighter.Microgreens are tiny plants that have only their first pair of leaves soon after the germination stage. They are a stage ahead of sprouts and are grown in soil or sometimes a soiless substrate such as cocopeat. Most popular vegetable varieties are grown as microgreens. The choice of microgreens grown by an individual depends on their preferences. They are delicious and can range from mild to tangy, spicy, or peppery.Some of the most popular in India are red amaranth, rocket, radish, Italian basil, beets, broccoli, kale, mustard and sunflower.Nutritional Powerhouses: When researchers at the University of Maryland in college park first discovered the nutrition contained in microgreens, they were so astonished by the findings that they went back to the drawing board and to their surprise, found out that it was indeed true. This study was also simultaneously carried out at the USDA and they too found the same results. Even for arguments sake, if we look at it, microgreens are just the next level up from sprouts and so it is just common sense to assume that they are just as packed with nutrition as sprouts are but they take it to a whole new level by also adding chlorophyll to the equation. Something that sprouts lack. But what commonly powers them is phytochemicals that are available in high concentrations at the early stage of a plants life. They are also responsible for the beautiful colours that these greens exhibit. Studies suggest that microgreens may contain high concentrations of nutrients compared with mature vegetables and herbs.Due to their high antioxidant content, microgreens are considered as functional food, a food that promotes health by boosting immunity.A diet rich in plant-based foods of all kinds has been linked to a reduced risk of many health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Many people are not getting the recommended amount of vegetables and fruits per day for many reasons including access, cost, convenience, and taste preference.

It is expected to touch full capacity soon, as the heavy inflow continues, following fresh rains in upper catchment areas in Madhya Pradesh.The authorities have released more than a million cusec water from the reservoir. As a result, more than 200 villages in Narmada, Bharuch and Vadodara districts have been put on alert.Gujarat has so far received total rainfall of 926.59 mm, which is 13.5% more than its Long-Period Average (LPA) of 816 mm.This year, rainfall picked up in August, when it received 446 mm rainfall.

2019-09-12,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-art-of-managing-ltte/article29401895.ece,The art of managing ‘LTTE’,"A few years ago, while at one of the smaller airports in south India, I was in conversation with a colleague in the office on some of the musts that had to appear that day in the LTTE. There was a tap on the shoulder and a sharp question: What LTTE? It took the security personnel a while to be convinced that the abbreviation was not for the proscribed organisation and that we were chatting about the forum for patra  the Letters to the Editor column. The musts were an envoys letter and a rejoinder to an Editorial page article.Every day, the editorial and opinion pages desk faces not simple questions about letters, but a barrage of queries and comments about how we manage this space. The tough ones that we handle, over phone and by e-mail, are from those letter-writers who are determined in their quest to be featured first and foremost in print. Even the assurance that their full-length letter will appear in the online edition is spurned instantly. The common questions they ask are: Why havent you published my letter? I have written so many letters but you ignore them! I came in the hot sun to the office and addressed it to you, but you ignored it; what happiness do you derive out of this? I sent an email, a postcard and a letter by speed post, so please publish the letter. Why are all the letter-writers only from Kerala? Why are you now focusing only on writers from north India? I know it; the moment you hear my voice you decide not to print my letter.And there are also those that are unprintable and unreasonably question the editorial line, with threats to play it out on social media. One writer decided to share with us his intellectual property. He claimed that a German institution had evinced interest in his paper. When it didnt quite cut the mustard, he demanded that we return the letter to him at once along with a signed declaration that we had rescinded our rights over the IP, or else face legal action. There was also a writer from Pakistan who hoped that by publishing in India a letter about festering civic issues in Lahore, there would be results.Over the years we have fine-tuned our responses to be professional and polite. But despite our keen efforts to be just a voice on the phone, some readers have managed to breach this line and find out more about us. One frequent caller even figured out our weekly off days and demanded to know why two of us had exchanged our day off one week!The letters section covers an area of anything between 600 and 1,200 words. Hawk-eyed readers audit this too. But much more is invested in this space; the LTTE helps deepen the newspapers bond with its valued readers. Among them is a 90-year-old gentleman who telephones us from every destination he travels to. His narration of the days events ends with a simple request: Please publish my letter.Another anecdote: Once, a first-generation reader from a village in north India wanted his letter published in print. We could only tell him to take a chance and look out for it the next morning. The grateful young man called the next evening: his stock had gone up in his place. And the paper, he said, had got a few more subscribers."

Like him, thousands of other farmers too are busy preparing the ground for their next crop, mostly unaware that the National Green Tribunals slew of directions on Wednesday for curbing pollution of the Yamuna included stopping cultivation on the riverbanks.Most farmers TOI spoke to did not know that NGT had instructed Delhi Development Authority to ensure compliance with its order on stopping vegetable farming on the Yamuna floodplain. The farmers were quick to point out that they did not use polluted water from the river, and instead had hand pumps and borewells to draw out groundwater.Many admitted a willingness to give up farming if provided other means to earn a living. Farming is all I know, and all that I have been table to teach my children. This is my only source of income, said Premraj, who has spent half of his 40 years growing vegetables. He pays the land owner Rs 18,000 as annual rent, but says he makes adequate profits through the year. Besides the cauliflower crop he has just planted, this spinach and mustard greens are ready for selling.Most farmers said they had been consuming their produce for years without suffering ill health. Usha, 30, claimed her family was fine despite having eaten the vegetables they grew all their lives. We have never used water from the river and we use manure and fertilisers for our crops, Usha claimed. She watched her husband plough the field for spinach and okra, and almost absentmindedly remarked that only a few farmers drew water from the polluted Yamuna for their fields.NGTs directions came after two separate studies showed vegetables grown on the Yamuna floodplain were contaminated by toxic metals. NEERI analysed seven vegetables  cabbage, cauliflower, radish, brinjal, coriander, fenugreek and spinach  and established the presence of lead, nickel, cadmium and mercury. Lead was found to be above the safe limit of 2.5 mg/kg in all the samples and ranged from 2.8 mg to 13.8 mg/kg. The study by the Central Pollution Control Board too determined metal contamination, highlighting the presence of copper, lead and manganese in the Yamuna water and high levels of iron and manganese in the groundwater.A few hundred metres from Premrajs plot, teenager Mamta Kumari busily prepared her familys small farm for cauliflowers. Just before the flooding, they had been able to harvest their okra crop. If we lose our farm, how will we live? asked Kumari wide-eyed. We were born here. I quit school in Class VIII to help the family. The teens father sells their produce at the nearby Shakurpur mandi. Zyaada nahi milta, par kaafi hai (We dont earn much, but its enough for us), reasoned Kumari.When told of the ban, the family said it would require help for an alternative livelihood. We would like assistance from the government in the form of a new plot of land or employment, said Savitri, Kumaris mother.Manoj Mishra, convener of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, pointed out that NGT was only against the growing of crops for human consumption. Horticulture and cultivation of non-edible crops can still be carried out, he noted. Though this is also only for those who have not encroached on the floodplain. Mishra added that in 2017, the Supreme Court had given the Yamuna farmers two years to switch to non-food farming.DDA vice-chairman Tarun Kapoor claimed to have an action plan ready to remove any encroacher from the riverbank. We will comply with all NGT directives and take action as required, Kapoor said."

For North Indians living in the South, finding a place that serves authentic Naan, Stuffed Paneer, Malai Kababs, etc. can get difficult. But the newly-launched Copper Chimney in the busy neighbourhood of Koramangala sets the expectations just about right.Copper Chimney, which began its journey in Bombay in 1972, now has 15 outlets in Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, besides three in Kuwait and one in Dubai. The restaurant claims to have retained some of their oldest recipes in the menu, which gave us ample reasons to check it out.It was a quiet evening, and the view from the outdoor seating area, with an open kitchen inside, made us comfortable. A cafe latte seemed like a fine drink to soak in the rainy weather of September. We ordered Achari Mushroom, Smoked White Pepper Chicken Chop, and Bhatti Murg Tikka as starters. Interesting fact: The menu also mentions the place of influence for the dishes that are labelled as originals. For example, mushroom is an influence from Haryana, while Chicken Chop represents flavours of Balochistan, and the Murg Tikka is from Punjab.A few minutes later, we were served Kadak Roomali, an interesting variant of the famous soft, pliable and translucent roti. It was a crisp, handkerchief-thin roti, with a bowl-like depression formed by the inverted tawa on which it was cooked, topped with masala-infused chopped tomatoes and onions  a refreshing beginning to the meal indeed.As for our appetisers, the mushroom came barbecued, flavoured with mustard and pickling spices, and tantalised our taste buds immediately. The chicken chops are smoky, tossed in nutmeg, white pepper, and chillies, making it succulent. The murg tikka is grilled and flavoured with Bhatti masala.For the main course, we ordered Butter Roomali Roti along with Benaras Malai Kofta, which is a little on the sweeter side. Out of the several curries featured on the menu, the two went really well together.You can also try out the Specials here, like the Slow-cooked Frontier Raan, Chelo Kebab, and biryanis, which are flavourful and reflect the rich cooking techniques of the north.To end the day on a sweet note, we relished the piping hot small Gulab Jamuns served on a pretty platter.Cost for two: `1,500 (approx)"

With quite a large Bengali population in the city, its not unusual to come across restaurants/hotels offering the sumptuous delights from the place. Mercure Hyderabad has on its buffet menu food from Bengal prepared by Chef Dipak Adhikary.The starters containing Machher Chop, New Market Mangsho Chop and Vegetable Chop released a perfect taste with the crispiness and the right balance of spices that didnt overpower the fillings. It came with an array of chutneys. It was surprising not to see kasundi, the sharper Bengali variety of mustard sauce, on the table. When asked chef Dipak Adhikary smiles and says, Because of its strong pungent taste it requires acquisition to the flavour and guests ask for something their tastebuds are more familiar with. We tried the main course comprising a vast spread. I picked Murgi Biryani, Shyam Bazaar Kosha Murgi, Lamb Stew, and Papda Fish. Despite that the biryani was a bit dry, the flavours unfurled as I took a spoonful of the rice cooked with the meat.Trying it with spicy chicken curry was a bit of an experiment, but I relished the mix. From the veg section, I liked Potol Dolma, peeled wax gourds cooked in a mildly-spiced gravy of yogurt with a dash of sugar. It tasted home-made with a morsel of plain steamed rice. And quite surprisingly the chef has also included red spinach or laal saag, a popular vegetable in Bengali households. Hes sourcing it directly from Calcutta.I decided to cap the dinner with the dessert platter and was happy to find, raj bhog, langcha, kalakand and mishti doi. The yellow roshogulla wasnt as spongy as it usually is. The reason was that the hotel allows only standardised milk packets for the sweets to be prepared. That explains the texture of the delight. I dug into other sweets to shift the attention from the less sponginess and washed it all down with a glass of watermelon juice.The food festival is on till September 22 for dinnerCharges: `1,250++ Saima Afreensaima@newindianexpress@Sfreen"

The actor who has the vigour and a youthful vibe, recently credited the humble idli sambar as one of the secrets behind his fitness. While talking to The Times of India, the Race actor revealed that his love for south Indian cuisine has played a vital role in making him what he is.AdvertisingIt probably has to do with my love for South Indian food and the amount of such food that I have consumed over the decades. I am very fond of the cuisine. Idli, sambar, chutney, dosa and all the pickles I have had with rice, rasam and curd must be the reason. South Indian cuisine like idli and dosa are healthy food options. When a person is unwell, their diet usually includes idlis  as it is the safest food option, Anil Kapoor told the media group.In 2013, India Breakfast Habits Study, a survey conducted in four metros, found that Chennai has the best breakfast nutrient profile in the country. The study covered other metros like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata on a sample size of 3,600 subjects, split across 8 to 40 years age group, and described alarming figures of nutritional inadequacy in our country.Heres why we agree with Bollywood actor:* The rice and urad dal in idlis complement each other making it a complete protein.Advertising* Traditional sambar preparations have veggies like drumsticks, pumpkin, brinjal, okra, tomatoes and various other fibre-rich seasonal vegetables that are rich in fibre and anti-oxidant. The goodness of vegetables in sambar makes it a good supplement and helps in digestion of the lentils.* Curry leaves, tamarind extract, turmeric powder, red pepper and mustard seeds have a number of health benefits, ranging from good digestion, weight loss and high immunity, hair growth among others.* A pre-clinical study published in Pharmacognosy Magazine, Sambar, an Indian Dish Prevents the Development of Dimethyl HydrazineInduced Colon Cancer said that consumption of sambar significantly reduced aberrant crypt foci in DMH-induced colon cancer model. Sambar may prevent the risk of CC when consumed in dietary proportions. It comprises a variety of spices that exhibited both pro- and antioxidant properties in different tissues, leading to its overall beneficial effect in this model.Heres how you can make an authentic sambar.Ingredients3-4  Bite-sized pieces of cut drumstick, yellow pumpkin and brinjal2 cups  Tamarind juice, extracted from a small lemon-sized ball of tamarind100g  Toor dal, pressure cooked until the dal is soft1 tsp  Sesame oil1/4 tsp  Turmeric powderSalt  To tasteFor seasoning1/2 tsp  Mustard seeds1/2 tsp  Fenugreek seeds2  Red chillies1  Green chilliTo garnish5 sprigs  Curry leaves and coriander leavesFor the sambar masala2 tsp  Sesame oil2 tbsp  Coriander seeds1 tbsp  Bengal gram1 tsp  Black gram6  Dried red chillies1/4 tsp  Fenugreek seeds1 tbsp  grated coconutMethod* To make the sambar masala, heat a pan with 2 tsp of oil.* Fry the coriander seeds, Bengal gram, black gram, red chillies and fengugreek seeds until golden brown.* Finally, add the grated coconut and fry for a while.* Cool the mixture and grind to a powder.* Boil the vegetables in tamarind juice with turmeric powder and salt.* Add some water if necessary.

FabAlley aims to compete with these global brands by offering trend centric fashion in an affordable price range. However, Indya was initially set up in 2015 as a subset until the founders recognised the huge market for fusion Indian clothing in the country. Three years later and there are over 22 exclusive stores across Kolkata, Chandigarh and Chennai apart from 200 large format stores.Boasting minimalistic and uncluttered interiors, the store at Express Avenue features gold and copper accents that spell a sense of luxury.

And while Kaash flowers grow abundantly near lakes, they also signify the arrival of Goddess Durga with the ten-day celebrations across the city, which will soon see a huge footfall in the pandals. There are nearly four lakh Bengalis in the city who are employed in different sectors ranging from IT, hospitality, banking, finance, education and more. Like other communities, Bengalis are quite active in arts and cultural activities. The Bengali platter has a variety of delights like Rohu fish fillet cooked in mustard paste, minced meat cutlets or the spongy white roshogullas. But theres more to the community than just a penchant for art and grub. We take a closer look:Durga PujaKeyes High School, Secunderabad and Bengalee Samity Domalguda are renowned for showcasing splendid idols of Goddess Durga. The pandals are elaborate, the deities sparkling with the craftsmanship of artistes based in Kumartuli, Kolkata. The idols are given final touches after they are brought to Hyderabad.

No disappointment here. There are several eateries in the city.

Then theres Roll Call at Punjagutta for typical Kolkata Kathi Kebab Roll.

While tuxedo and kurta pyjama have their own charm and when it comes to wedding, nothing can beat the magic of sherwani.This wedding season, experts feel that it is more about lighter fabrics and lesser embroideries that make sherwanis look very subtle yet classic in looks. To make a statement, also invest in accessories like turban, juttis and neckpieces, which can help to enhance the look of sherwani. Here's a look at six colours that will rule the wedding season this year.This one is a classic shade that goes well with Kashmiri red dupatta. To break the monotony and add a fusion factor, complete the look with a blue pocket square. For an eye-catching look, pair it with maroon embroidered slip-on footwear to add contrast!What started with shirts, has now entered into the traditional wear market too and men have all the reason to celebrate it. If you are planning to invest in a floral sherwani, always make sure to balance the look with light shade turban and plain juttis.Pattern to print, there are a lot of options to explore the multi-coloured sherwani trend. All you need to do is, balance the look with the stole and safa/turban. You can also pick the same fabric and create a style statement.Pastel colours are in and blue makes a stunning colour for photographs! Look for thread-embroidered sherwani, which you can pair with straight pants or churidaar in white colour.For mustard coloured sherwani, you can enhance the look with a floral turban and safa. For accessories, you can pick white and red pearls necklace.Another colour that looks good in photos is green. Pick a regal-coloured sherwani with minimal detail and pair it with slip-on shoes.Inputs by Meenu Jain and Rachna Aggarwal from Label Manmeera."
2019-09-26,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/break-bread-at-this-chennai-eatery/article29518635.ece,A slice of everything,"As I run my eyes down the menu, I subconsciously make a list in my head that goes Italian, Indian, Chinese, Lebanese, Mexican The menu at The Bread Bar is short, but packs a diversity that can make you ponder a few extra minutes as you choose what to dig into.Tucked away along the quiet Barnaby Road at Kilpauk, in the midst of a row of restaurants and arching branches, The Bread Bar is nestled inside the Swaad Nation Food Court. Wooden board panelling and warm fairy lights combined with the toasty scent of freshly baked bread check off all the right boxes in the first impressions department. A basket on the counter displays a variety of breads  garlic, basil, oats and flax seed loaves sit in between orange and chocolate-swirl buns, and I learn that they are batches made to order. After I sufficiently graze the plump loaves in the basket and the menu with my eyes, I zero in on the focaccia and the bao.The focaccia arrives as a six-inch sandwich, with a filling of sliced cucumber and cherry tomatoes in a generous drizzle of pesto sauce and cheese. The first bite into it is a gentle rush of flavours, and the sumptuously hydrated bread has me going in for the next bite within seconds. At odds with its hard appearance, the texture of the focaccia is so easy that I make record time devouring a sandwich. The bread clearly plays lead singer while the pesto quietly takes on the role of supporting chorus, striking the right balance.Two compact baos on a plate come out next. Off-white and mustard coloured pockets, with a smattering of green, they present a pretty sight. The bread is supple, but the Sichuan sauce in the filling blatantly overpowers the cabbage, spring onion and Sichuan mayonnaise. Where the focaccia stands out in its fresh and authentic flavour, the bao fails to hold ground.Determined to mask the lingering Sichuan flavour from the bao experiment, I opt for the vada pav and the pita. A palm-sized pocket, the falafel in the pita is a tad dry and could definitely do better with a bigger dollop of hummus. It leaves me wanting more, after just a cursory encounter with my taste buds.The Bread Bar Swaad Nation, 13, Barnaby Road, KilpaukHits: Focaccia and bread boxFocaccia and bread box Misses: Bao and pitaBao and pita meal for two: 240240 9884692997I am glad I saved the vada pav for the end. The garlic chutney with the slightly crunchy vada creates a burst of flavours that few vada pavs on the East coast manage to do. With three pieces to a plate, this vada pav is best relished with company, unless you plan to make a meal of it. And if you are part of a group that cannot agree, the chefs platter (an array of all their breads) on the weekend menu is the ideal pick.Manisha Khumbat, one of the proprietors and the chef here, recommends the bread box before I leave. Though I am stuffed, the sight of warm gooey cheese coaxes me into one final indulgence. The bread box is a cheese fondue with croutons in a carved-out loaf of wheat bread. As I slowly polish off the cheese, the bread crumbles into it, making the dish a fulfilling experience in itself. Before I roll out of the doors, I make a mental note to nip in again for the cheese fondue."

2019-09-28,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/stars-without-a-fault-the-benefits-of-star-fruit/article29528617.ece,Stars without a fault: The benefits of star fruit,"Our President may not know about this, but the sprawling estate where the head of the state resides in central Delhi was a favourite haunt of mine, and of my equally scruffy companions, when we were kids. We werent so much interested in the splendid architecture of the complex than in the fruit trees that lined one part of it just outside the estate.That was where we would pluck a fruit we could never have enough of. It was the kamrakh, and it was so sour that the very thought of it makes my lips pucker up even after all these years.Packed with Vit CJust the other day, I saw an elderly man selling kamrakhin another part of Delhi and remembered the pleasure the fruit gave us way back in the 60s. The curiously shaped fruit has ridged vertical lines. The vendor cuts the fruit down the lines, and then seasons the pieces with salt and masala. And there it is  a delectation, just for a few rupees, for those who love their food sour. If cut horizontally, the pieces come out shaped like stars. Hence its name: star fruit.The image was still in my mind when I reached home that day, and found a book waiting for me. I had been eager to get my hands on it ever since I heard that a new edition of First Food: Business of Taste published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), was out.And, as it often happens when something is echoing in your mind, the first page I opened was about kamrakh also called amrakh. The fruit, in fact, figures in two chapters in this informative book about little-known, or dying, food and ingredients.Star fruit is considered a superfood now, and is a part of many a health conscious salad-eaters diet. It is full of vitamin C and is believed to help control blood sugar. But those with a kidney problem should steer clear of it, the book tells us.In one chapter, CSEs Vibha Varshney recalls how vendors would sell the fruit with tamarind, guava and ber, and how it was used to garnish sweet potato chaats. The fruit, she adds, grows in abundance in Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh, about 200 km from Delhi. Star fruit is apparently used in Surinam for preparing wine and as a preserve in southern China.Cure for hangoverStar fruit is a one-stop medicine shop as well. According to traditional Indian medicinal systems, its consumption can treat haemorrhage. The dried fruit or the juice extracted from ripe fruit can cure fever. In Brazil, the fruit is recommended for eczema. According to the Chinese, consumption of star fruit can quench thirst and increase salivary secretion, the author writes.Star fruit is believed to have originated in Sri Lanka and the Moluccas and then spread to different parts of the world. Averrhoa carambola, its scientific name, the book informs us, is derived from Averroes, the Andalusian astronomer, philosopher and physician of the 12th century. What he had to do with the fruit, however, is not clear.This edition of First Food  glossier than its earlier avatars  also comes with recipes, some of them from top chefs. In the star fruit section, there are recipes for chutneys and pickles.For a portion of suitably sour chutney, take star fruit (one piece), coriander leaves (50g), mint leaves (50g), green chillies (3-4), coriander powder (1tbsp) and salt to taste. Grind them all together and your chutney is ready.For pickled star fruit, take kamrakh (500g), nigella seeds (20g), chilli powder (20g), fennel seed powder (20g), mustard seed powder (20g), salt (50g) and mustard oil. Cut the fruit into thick slices. Add salt and wait till the fruit releases water. Remove the slices. Keep the saltwater aside.In a bowl mix the star fruit slices with the seeds and powders. Transfer all this to a glass bottle and pour the saltwater over it. Add mustard oil till it covers all the slices of the fruit. Leave the bottle in the sun for 2-3 days. The pickle is ready to eat, First Food tells us.Such a small fruit but so useful. And theres more. Kamrakh, the writer tells us, also treats hangovers. You live and learn.The writer likes reading and writing about food as much as he does cooking and eating it. Well, almost."

Rest the dough for 20 minutes. Make small lime-sized dough balls from the prepared dough. Roll the dough into 8 cm circles. Apply ghee on the surface and sprinkle with rice flower. (This process will enable the layers to be visible once the porota is fried later). Make an incision from the centre of the circle till the edge. Start rolling from one cut edge till the end. This will help to form a cone. Now flatten the cone from both ends and roll it out again till 6 cm in diameter. Deep fry in hot oil until golden and crispy.

(Photo: Twitter/jawaharyadavbjp)GURUGRAM: The state governments spokesperson, Jawahar Yadav, on Sunday threatened to lodge a police complaint against workers of Swaraj India who met him at his residence in Palam Vihar to hand over documentary evidence stating only one-third of bajra and mustard crops in the state have been bought by the government at minimum support price ( MSP ).Jawahar Yadav claimed the workers, along with journalists, barged into his home.During an on-air debate with Yogender Yadav  the partys national chief  on September 24, Jawahar Yadav had said he would resign and leave politics if bajra and mustard crops had not been procured at MSP by the state government. Also, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during a news conference said that each grain of bajra had been procured by the state agencies.According to Swaraj India, only 26.7% bajra and 19.32% mustard were purchased by the government in 2018-19, while only 4.34% bajra and 4.21% mustard were purchased in 2017-18 by it. We only wanted to meet him and hand over the documentary evidence and correct figures of crops procurement by the state government. We kept waiting outside his house. He first called us and journalists inside the house, but after he got to know we are from the opposition, he made us leave his house immediately. We only wanted to hand over the document to tell him that his claim of bajra and mustard procurement at MSP by the state government was incorrect, said JC Yadav, coordinator of Swaraj India, Gurgaon. He also said the data given by Swaraj India had been taken from the documents provided by the Department of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare.I am quite furious as workers ofSwaraj India and journalists barged into my house without permission. However, the claims made by Swaraj India are absolutely incorrect. As per a reply submitted by states agriculture minister OP Dhankar in Vidhan Sabha, the state government procured 6,13,339 metric tonnes of mustard seeds in 2019 and 1,00,894 metric tonnes of bajra in 2018, Jawahar told TOI."

TS Kannan, a veteran with over five decades of racing and riding behind him, held fort. There were nankhatais, coffee and some lassi on offer for the motley crew of bike enthusiasts who talked shop and swapped stories on a balmy Sunday morning in Semmencheri.I have a 1968 model. I used to take my son for rides on my Jawa when he was an infant, and he loved to rest on the engine, on the way to his aunts house. He is in his 40s now, and every time he visits, he has to take the same bike for a spin. Kannan, easily, the main attraction at the event, smiled gently as young riders reminisced seeing the septuagenarian race past them on the track. Riding keeps me young, you know. I have raced at Sholavaram, participated at drag events, done over 200 Bengaluru-Chennai trips, and covered over 2,50,000 kms on my bike. I still do breakfast rides every now and then with the younger riders, he added.Many bikes, many memoriesRoshan Kamath, who has amassed 18 imported bikes over a span of 15 years said that his Jawas, to him, have meant freedom to explore. I bought this one beauty from my milk vendor. He used to deliver to our house on this Jawa, and I was so taken with the bike, that many cajoling conversations later, he sold it to me, explained Kamath. The deep maroon model with mustard accessories and Mysuru plates (more on that later), has kept Kamath company on many an adventure.These bikes are so easy to tinker with, I have been able to personalise them for offroading experiences. If you know your way around an engine, a Jawa is a dream to work with, stated Kamath, who has taken his souped up ride to Ladakh, and done some trips around the Indian peninsula.Prashanth Kumar, aka PK aka The Nomad, explained his love affair with the Jawa through a session on restoration. When you are younger, it is what you can afford, really. These are simple and sturdy bikes, easy to figure out, said PK, showing off unique pieces he snagged when the Jawa factory was shuttered in Mysuru, in 1996. One is a maroon, 1961 Jawa model 353 with a Pav-40 trailer and a snowguard. Another, silver, is a 1976 Jawa model 634 with a velorex sidecar.Jawa has a rich history in India, and when they were closing shop, I had to preserve these pieces. Jawas have multi-generational racers, who have used the same bikes with a few tweaks over a span of decades, and theyre still going, said Arul Futnani, who went down to Bengaluru to bring his bikes. I actually house all the bikes at my residence, and work on them once in a while. So when Arul said he wants to showcase them, he meant business. He showed up at my place, and a day later, were all here, talking about the good old days, exclaimed PK while posing next to his sidecar model.The myriad shades of green at the farm framed the chrome cruisers beautifully. We grew up with these Jawas, and now the next generation is taking it forward. There are a lot of serious motorheads in India, and every year on the second Sunday of July, you will see over 500 Jawas descend at a single venue, for International Jawa Day. You realise that the bikes live on, as long as you preserve them materially and in your memories, says Prashanth Kumar, as he explained some of the features of his Jawas to eager 20-something-year-olds, resplendent in his Jawa tee."

However, instead of blindly following fad diets, she decided to go back to her roots. Read on to know her motivating weight loss journey to lose weight Shikha A SharmaEntrepreneur30 years5 feet 5 inches86 kgs30 kg9 monthsI have been overweight for as long as I can remember and it wreaked havoc on my self-confidence levels. Body shaming incidents made it extremely difficult for me to go out and socialise. In fact, I was embarrassed to even go out of the house as I was really conscious of the way I looked.I did not want to wear western clothes as I felt that I looked bad in it and hated getting my photo clicked. I was tired of living my life in hiding and decided to do something to lose weight and get back in shape.1/ 2 teaspoon coriander powder with normal water1/2 teaspoon ashwagandha with normal water1/2 teaspoon of the black mustard seed with normal waterFor breakfast, I usually have one stuffed chapati with either tea or coffee without sugar or stevia in it. I ensure that I do not miss my daily dose of nutrition in the form of kitchen spices which is the secret behind my weight loss.In the afternoon, I have two wheat chapatis with any vegetable of my choice. We need to understand that vegetables do not make us fat. Having green chilli with your daily meal is a must as it works as a natural fat burner.2 small cardamoms and 1/2 teaspoon of coriander powder with water1 cup of tea or coffee made of milk with 5 biscuitsFor dinner, I have two wheat chapatis with any vegetable curry of my choice. I occasionally switch my dinner and have two idlis, a bowl of sambar and a big bowl of vegetable curry.Once in 15 days, I take a cheat day where I eat whatever I feel like without any guilt or regrets.Being a mother and a working woman, I did not have any time to hit the gym or exercise. I have broken the myth that you cannot lose without exercising. I focussed on eating right and used mustard oil or ghee for cooking.I have realised that going back to your roots i.e. what our dadis and nanis used to eat is the simplest way to lose weight.We need to understand that all these international food items which are called the holy grail of weight loss may not work as efficiently for us.We are Indians and we need to follow a local, Indian diet to get back in shape. We have also made chapatis our enemies, completely forgetting that we used to have it since childhood.There was a lot that pulled me down when I was unhealthy. All the unsolicited comments, the trolling and negativity were my main motivation to lose weight and get back in shape. I still remember those incidents very clearly and do not wish to go back there, ever again.I won't lie, there are days when all I want to do is eat junk food. However, I have realized that junk food satisfies the mind and not the body. Now that I have lost a lot of weight and get my life back on track, I dont want to go back to where I had begun. I feel extremely proud of myself every time I look into the mirror and I dont want to lose that feeling.When you are overweight, people judge you solely on the basis of your looks and do not bother to know you. It is really heartbreaking. Sadly, you also become underconfident and are on the risk of developing unhealthy eating habits.I want to remain as fit as possible, live a life sans any medications and enjoy the freedom of eating whatever I want.I made it a point to be consistent with my diet and stick to Indian food. I did not follow any International fad diets to lose weight. I just followed my own diet which was completely based on the spices available in my kitchen.Being overweight really impacted my self-confidence and there is this once incident which still hurts me. There was a time when one of my friends refused to meet me only because of the way I looked.I have realised that going on a diet is nothing more than eating healthy food and making healthy choices. At the end of the day, going old school is the best way of losing weight as Dadi ma ke nukhse can never go wrong!"

You can add your choice of seasonings from lemon, black pepper or chilli flavours and barbecue the kebabs before savouring them, piping hot, says M Chinna, chef and city head.At this 134th outlet, the ambitious menu attempts to offer something for everyone, so there are rotis, gravies and biriyani sharing space with pizzas, pastas and south Indian fare. They also offer panipuri, shawarma and dosas, as well as a range of relatively exotic meats such as duck, quail, turkey, and rabbit. As we settle down, Cajun-spiced baby potatoes make an appearance.

Also the crisp okra, dusted with ground spices. I follow it up with bell peppers, broccoli and corn-on-the-cob. An interesting sweet and tangy grilled pineapple continues the line up.

With the air turning cool and the nights turning cooler the pandals in the city are glittering with decorations, food stalls, and more. Thousands come for goddess Durga standing majestically in her beautiful avatar.With the population of four lakh Bengalis in the city, different communities and groups come forward to put in their efforts to bring the best idols created at Kumartuli, West Bengal which are then given final touch by the local artisans after they are brought in to Hyderabad. Thats how Hyderabad Bengalee Samity (HBS) in its 78th year of Durga Puja is continuing its legacy of being the oldest puja in the city bringing magnificent deities to the pandal erected at Domalguda in the premises of Ramakrishna Math. Says the general secretary Sumit Sen, We have been getting the best artisans to get the idol done. This year we havent kept any special theme for the decor. But theres an array of interesting cultural programmes in the evening by women and children.Bangiya Sanskritik Sangha (BSS) which hosts the grand Durga Puja at Keyes High School, Secunderabad is in its 54th year. The decor of the goddess is created from shola, a milk-white cork spongy wood, which grows in the marshy areas of west Bengal, informs Atin Chaudhuri of BSS. The spacious grounds of the school has food stalls selling delights not just from Bengal from kulfi from Ajmer as well which goes really well after a plate of fish cutlets with mustard sauce or the famous Calcutta Kathi Kebab rolls with crunchy rings of onion, green chillies, grilled chicken chunks with a dash of lime and pepper wrapped in paratha which opens layer by layer. At Attapur Bengali Association (ABA) the devi wears a large shola crown with intricate paisley work and around her the trimmings of the alcove is almost lace-like in the same white shola.At the same time Bengalis In Hyderabad (BIH) are all set today for Pujo Parikrama in the city ready with three buses.

2019-10-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/pathrade-the-dish-that-stalked-me/article29596170.ece,Pathrade: The dish that stalked me,"I was stalked by a dish! Let me tell you the story. I was the quintessential Gulfie kid, born and brought up in Kuwait, till the age of 11. Coming to my hometown of Mangaluru every year on vacation was, for me, like coming to a veritable Disneyland of rustic adventure. Cows roamed freely on the streets, auto drivers channelled their inner Schumacher, it rained copious amounts, and I was allowed to play in the rain! My grandmothers home was my version of Mowglis jungle, filled with mango, tamarind, coconut and chikoo trees and so many beautiful flowers. The well beside the washing stone was my place to perch, listening to the sounds of nature.Of course, through all this, eating was the main agenda of each day. Pathrade, a Mangalurean dish, popular during the monsoons was always on the cards. This is a laborious dish made with shredded colocasia leaves (called alwache kolay in Konkani, arbi in Hindi, alu in Marathi, and sempu in Tamil) and a rice and black gram paste that is mixed together, patted on to teak tree leaves in a thick one-inch layer, packed and tied tightly, and then steamed. The resultant rice cakes are then sliced, coated with a chilli-salt-vinegar paste called meet-mirsang that you will find in every Mangalurean kitchen, and fried. Alternatively, you can add it to meat gravies making it a one-pot meal.Leafy treatThe first time I heard of pathrade, I did what every tween would likely do  screwed up my nose and went yuck. Till my mother coaxed me to put one of the fried slices in my mouth. It was as if a window to a new flavour flew open in my head. I loved it and devoured it by the plateful. It took me a while to develop a taste for the curried version, but I did so soon.What I loved about pathrade was being a part of the entire half-day process. My favourite task was to pick the leaves that grew randomly in the large compound during the rains. The instructions were clear  pick the medium-sized leaves (the larger ones result in an itchy throat) and pick ones without any tears. The task meant stepping into puddles of rainwater. I would stomp through them much to the chagrin of our help, who had been put in charge of little missy. Armed with the leaves, we would march back, and I would watch my mother and the other women of the family divide the work among themselves, under the watchful eyes of my grandmother.This was an annual ritual, which continued even after we moved to India for good, with my mother now sending me out to pick the leaves in our own garden. The sights and sounds of moms kitchen at pathrade time always made me smile  the swish of the knife as it peeled the thick stalks of the colocasia leaves, the rat-a-tat sounds while shredding them on a wooden board, the rhythmic notes of stone against stone while grinding the soaked rice and gram, and the joy of opening the steaming packets, in anticipation of good things to come.And now to the part of the dish stalking me. Growing up, with a Parsi best friend, I soon discovered that her family made a version of pathrade too. This one did not use rice; instead spiced chickpea flour paste was applied generously to the colocasia leaves. These were then layered (our job if we were caught loafing around) and rolled into tight bundles. Into the steamer, these jam-roll like bundles went, then they were sliced, pan-fried and served with chai.Many, many versionsSchool and college went by and I moved to a hostel in Manipal for my postgraduate studies. It was a time of newfound freedom. But there were times, especially rainy days, when homesickness would wrap around me like a cold, wet blanket. One such evening, a Gujarati classmate who had just come back from home, came to my room with a box of homemade goodies. In the box was patra, the Gujarati version of pathrade. This one was made with a paste of chickpea flour, asafoetida, chilli powder, pounded jaggery, and some tamarind. It followed the same principles of preparation of layering, rolling and steaming, but was such a different melange of flavours. The world was now a better place.In Mumbai, at a classmates home, en route to Delhi for my internship, her mother treated us to the family special  alu vadi aka pathrade  and as I would soon learn, rikwach (in U.P.), and patode (in some parts of North India). While the Marathi version is quite like the Gujarati one, it has the additional nuance of a mustard-sesame seed tempering and a handful of freshly grated coconut to finish it off. Seeing my enthusiasm, aunty was kind enough to pack a dabba for us to take on the train to Delhi.Years after graduation, work often took me around the country. I found myself back in Delhi and at a Bihari friends home. She told me that the special for the evening was patode. The interesting thing about her version was that the chickpea flour paste was made with curd as the base, along with carom seeds, bringing in a completely different flavour profile. I was now convinced that the dish was stalking me.And just as life has a way of coming full circle, so did pathrade. I met my husband, who is from Kochi, and of course, pathrade was an integral part of their cuisine. In his home too, it was a dish made community style (remember what I said about the women of the house dividing the work under the searing gaze of my grandmother?). It took a while for the women in my in-laws home to open up their circle and welcome me in. But in the swish of the knife on the stalks, the rhythmic grinding of paste on stone, and the aromatic smells from the steamer, I was finally brought into the family 15 years ago.SUNDAY RECIPEPathrade (Mangalurean style)Pathrade, Mangalurean style. | Photo Credit: Ruth Dsouza PrabhuIngredients12 medium sized colocasia leaves5-6 teak tree leaves to steam pathrade (banana leaves may be substituted)2 cups raw rice cup stripped black gram2 tbsp coriander seeds1 heaped tsp cumin seeds6 dried red chillies1 tbsp tamarind pulp tsp turmeric powderSalt to tasteMethod1.

With grand decorations, sumptuous food, magnificent idols of Goddess Durga and devotees dancing to the dhol, the city is rife with celebration. KV Navya and Roshne Balasubramanian tell you where to go pandal-hopping to experience the spirit and grandeur of pujoDakshini Society, ThirumangalamAs soon as we enter School Road in Anna Nagar, the high-octane sound of drumbeats lead us into Thanthai Periyar Hall. Decorative cloth streamers in powder pink and gold deck the auditorium. Senior citizens, men and children clad in traditional attire, and women draped in the famous lal paar sari sway their body to the beats as the dhakis (drummers) perform.While soaking in the music, the crowd gathers in front of the ornate Durga idol and starts giving their offerings to ring in ashtami. This is the scene at the Dakshini Societys Durga Puja-cum-25th anniversary celebrations. When the association was initiated in 1995, there were only seven members.Now, we have grown to 115 members, says Mukul Dasgupta, secretary. The Durgotsava celebrations at Dakshini Societys pandal not only features religious rituals, morning puja and aarti, but is also dotted with cultural programmes by members of the association to keep the visitors entertained.The vibrant pandal is famous for its stalls that serve hot jalebis, Bengali snacks, luchi with cholar dal, pulao, hara dal, rasgulla and fish-based dishes. The chefs are from Kolkata and authentically prepare the food. The priests who perform the pujas are also from Kolkata. So, everything is done the traditional way, he shares.SMCA Durga Puja, Besant NagarLocated right next to the Besant Nagar bus terminus, this pandal organised by the South Madras Cultural Association boasts 21 stalls, mostly serving authentic Bengali food including Kolkata biryani, ilish paturi (hilsa fish cooked in banana plant and mustard), fish chops and kosha mangsho (Bengali mutton curry). While the puja celebrations go on the whole day, the cultural performances start after 7 pm and end at 12.30 am.This is our 41st year here and we are one of the largest pandal organisers in the city. When we established SMCA, only one major Durga Puja was being organised at T Nagar, so we started organising this pandal. Daily, there is a footfall of at least 1,500 people, said Pradeep Benerjee, committee member. There is no particular theme that they follow every year, but the pandal is popular among Chennaiites for lip-smacking food. If you are going pandal-hopping, you cannot give this place a pass.Bengal Association Durga Puja, T NagarOne of the first Durga Puja pandals in Chennai, the Bengal Association is celebrating its 86th puja this year. Apart from the usual festivities, this place is famous for its music, dances and even theatre performances of some of the oldest folklores associated with the festival.One of the highlights is that the artisans of the Durga idol and all the performers come down to Chennai from Kolkata every year. ""It takes a month to make the idol and they do it with much precision. Even the priests are from Kolkata. Also, we have recently adopted green initiatives. We stopped using water bottles. Most of the items used to distribute food are eco-friendly, said Soumya Guha Thakurtam secretary of the association.They also provide vegetarian food free of cost during lunch in the dining hall. If youd like to parcel the meal, you need to pay Rs 20 for the container. After 7 pm, you can indulge in some delicious Bengali delicacies, especially sweets made by home chefs. The pandal witnesses an average footfall of 5,000 daily.Dakshin Chennai Prabasi Cultural Association, SholinganallurThis pandal brings with it colour, life and celebration. It is a crowd-puller that showcases the idol of Goddess Durga in the traditional ekchala style. People flock in large numbers in the evenings, to get a glimpse of the devi in sparkling lights. We have been setting up a pandal since 2014. The highlight of this year is the Kumari Puja, which is usually not done anywhere in Chennai, will be held on Monday between 10 and 11 am. Celebrating the sanctity of the girl child, young girls are worshipped as a part of the puja, said Ardhendu Chakraborti, president of the association.Apart from people belonging to the Bengali and Odia community, many Chennaiities visit this venue to try out the Bengali delicacies at the stalls set up inside the pandal. By Sunday afternoon, as many as 3,000 people visited the pandal. In the afternoon, bhog is provided at `200 per plate.

Celebrations are on till past midnight, and above all, it is an air-conditioned pandal!Madras Kali Bari, West MambalamLocated inside the Kolkata Kali temple in West Mambalam, the Madras Kali Bari Pandal celebrates both Tamil and Bengali traditions of Dussehra, and makes for a deeply spiritual celebration. At the entrance, you will find an elegantly decorated Durga idol. The hall further leads to a narrow path that ends in a beautiful golu. ""Each year we follow different themes for golu. This year, it is Pandaripuram. The evenings get interesting here as the Tamil crowd and the Bengali crowd interact with each other and get to know the traditions, said one of the members at the venue.

2019-10-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/with-a-colonial-hangover/article29654639.ece,Tracing Europe's influence on India's culinary heritage,"A story goes: When English memsahibs sent their empire-building husbands off to work, what went with them in their lunch-boxes were slices of roast from Sundays lunch, wedges of cold pork pies, leftover stew with a few boiled eggs thrown in. The ambitious brown sahibs who shared offices with these Englishmen were impressed with these packed lunches and began to believe that these bland and often insipid offerings were the secret to the power of their masters. And so, somewhere in Bombay, an exasperated homemaker, egged on by her upwardly-aspirational husband, fashioned a dish that was a cross between a shepherds pie and a pasta casserole, using leftover curry. Thus was born the dabba gosht.Krishna Shantakumar, general manager, Ebony in Whitefield, Bengaluru, admits that one cannot attest to the veracity of this story he shares, but the fact is, that colonial influences on Indian cuisine and even vice-versa were natural. A blending of cuisines occurred when the British trained Indians to recreate their stodgy offerings in a bid to counter the spice levels of Indian cooking. Simultaneously, Indians aspired to be more like their British superiors and often asked their wives to recreate English cooking, says Shantakumar.The menu at Ebony has the Bohri dabba gosht of course, along with a few Anglo-Indian classics such as the mulligatawny soup, chicken jalfrezi and brown sahib scotch eggs. To show that the experimenting never ceases, Shantakumar speaks of dishes on the menu with a colonial twist a la Ebony. Take the salonee broccoli. Broccoli being a traditional English vegetable, is cooked in the tandoor with a mustard marinade, and topped with a crispy coating.In search of adventureMany people from Britain, Scotland and Ireland were adventure-seekers and came in search of new experiences. When the ships landed, many of them made India their home and took on Indian spouses as well. They craved home food and had to make do with what was available in India. The Scottish egg, similar to the Nargisi kofta, became a speciality. The humble meat cutlet with added spices became the shami kebab. These dishes became standards in most of the clubs and barracks, explains chef consultant Michael Swamy.At Anglow, Khan Market, New Delhi, Chef Swamy showcases dishes from select regions across the country. Many of the dishes come from various experiences, like the influence and creation of the Railway mutton curry, a dish that was created for long train journeys from Calcutta. The dak bungalow chicken curry evolved when the khansamas cooked in far-off outposts using the simplest of ingredients to create a flavourful dish, Swamy says.Such cross-cultural experiments were seen across the country. Bengal was once the home of French and British colonisers, and also hosted populations of the Portuguese and Dutch. Collective influences of these communities were seen in the food created for them, explains Subrata Debnath, business head and general manager, East India Room, Kolkata. The result was a unique blend of cuisines, where local ingredients were adapted to French, and western cooking techniques  characterised by creamy sauces, the restrained use of spices, and new techniques such as baking, grilling, frying, poaching, steaming and roasting, he adds.On the menu at East India Room is the Sovabazar Rajbarir winning pantheras  a British colonisation high tea recipe with mutton. This was first made and served at Sovabazar Rajbari to British Governors and is a testimony to these cross-cultural influences and techniques. As also the beckty meuniere, grilled Calcutta bhetki with parsley brown butter and the Dacress Lane stew, a classic chicken stew served with toasted pound bread.Breaking breadSpeaking of bread, it is common knowledge that we have the Portuguese coming to Goa to thank for that. Pav is the only form of leavened bread that is made in the country today. It was the Portuguese who taught us to culture yeast and make our breads; today it is an integral part of Mumbai and Goas culinary landscape. Portuguese is the only cuisine that introduced wine in cooking in India and is also the only one that uses so many types of vinegars. A lot of ingredients were brought in too  tomatoes, green chillies, corn and cashews. Colonisers came in for trade and brought their techniques of cooking with them. Take the smoking and curing of meats with the chorizo sausage. The idea was for it to last long voyages! explains Hussain Shahzad, executive chef, O Pedro, Mumbai.Going beyond the popular vindaloo (which features on the menu) at O Pedro, Shahzad pays tribute to the Portuguese concept of petiscos or small plates that often make up dinner in Portugal, while showcasing Goan cuisine.While this is a doff of the hat to the classics in a way, the food at Punkah House in Bengaluru is a modern interpretation of many dishes influenced by our colonial history  Portuguese, French, British, Dutch and colonies in Burma and Ceylon. At Punkah, the flavours of harissa spiced chicken pate are very Indian, but the technique of making pate is French-inspired. Similarly, the galouti mousse in our lamb sticky rice dish, uses a classic European method. The same goes for our jamun ceviche and even the rasam ramen, explains Shikha Nath, brand director, Punkah House. We have tried to incorporate the colonial influence very subtly into mainstream Indian cookery; without losing the essence of any of the individual cuisines, she adds.Tradition retoldPunam Singh, co-founder, Mustard, Mumbai too has a similar approach where she is committed to telling traditional stories from the rich cuisines of Bengal and France. The two meet, not in fusion, but in flavours that one savours. Paupiettes are a favourite in Normandy, the part of France that our Chef Gregory hails from. Usually made with meat, hes chosen to make these traditional parcels with rice, serving them with a red wine sauce thats been thickened with a carrot pure. We also have the bandhakopir dolma, stuffed leaves and vegetables that are a legacy of the Armenians in Bengal. Here we stuff fresh cabbage leaves with rice and minced meat, and for vegetarians with mushroom. There is the chingri machher chiney kebab, a stuffed lobster served on a bed of salad, elaborates Singh.Over the centuries, cuisines in India have assimilated a lot of colonial influences. These have gone both ways. From the chamosa of Portugal that is inspired by the Indian samosa, to the kedgeree that pays tribute to our khichdi. While tracing the lineages of these dishes may prove difficult, the fact remains that a delicious legacy continues to prevail."

But how often do you see someone carrying it off the way Kareena Kapoor just did? The fashion diva looked absolutely stylish in the black dress as she stepped out for a dinner party with her girls to celebrate celebrity stylist Tanya Ghavris birthday.AdvertisingSpotted with sister Karisma, the 39-year-old actor was seen wearing the sleeveless, zip-up black dress that was cinched at the waist with a matching belt. Keeping with the laidback vibe of her outing, the actor skipped on heels and paired her black and gold dress with pointy-toed tan coloured flats.While Kareena added a shot of colour to her all-black look with mustard flats, Karisma styled her outfit for the night with maroon flats in the exact same design. To round off her evening look, Khan went with a classic watch and one of her favourite handbags, an ebony Birkin. Leaving her shoulder-length hair open in tousled waves, the star highlighted her eyes with a generous dose of kohl and completed her beauty look with a nude lip colour.Check the entire look here.The well-turned out actor is often snapped up at media events, be it judging a reality show or her radio shows.

In both looks, she wore sneakers for comfort, even if it didnt exactly go with the outfit.While its expected for celebs to be dressed on point at every outing, Khan is someone who likes to take it easy on an off-day."

These days, hypertension has become quite common, and it must be noted that this disease often shows no distinctive symptoms. Hypertension, if left untreated or unmanaged, can increase the risk of heart diseases and stroke, says dietician Nmami Agarwal, founder & CEO, Nmami Life.AdvertisingShe adds that an appropriate dietary approach can be significant in managing high blood pressure with or without medications. The key foods that help in lowering blood pressure, as suggested by her, include:ALSO READ: World Hypertension Day 2019: Ayurvedic tips to manage hypertension1. Banana: Bananas are an excellent source of dietary potassium, a mineral that helps in regulating blood pressure levels. As per a scientific study, eating two bananas a day can help reduce blood pressure by 10 per cent.Advertising2. Green Leafy Vegetables: Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, lettuce, or mustard greens are a rich source of nitrates. Just one to two servings of nitrate-rich vegetables can reduce hypertension for up to 24 hours.3. Beetroot: Beetroot contains certain antioxidants that help in managing high blood pressure levels. The vegetable gets its red hue from anthocyanin, that emits blood pressure regulating action. Drinking one glass of beetroot juice is an effective remedy to combat high blood pressure levels. Beets contain another compound called nitric oxide which is also really effective to manage blood pressure.4. Oat Bran: Oat bran makes a very healthy choice for breakfast. It is loaded with the goodness of soluble fibre known as beta-glucan that can help in lowering blood pressure levels and also improving digestive health. Oats are also rich in potassium which is a significant mineral for blood pressure control.5. Sweet Potato: Sweet potatoes are definitely one of the best super foods to control high blood pressure. It is naturally rich in blood-pressure friendly fibre and is an excellent source of two essential minerals  magnesium and potassium. These minerals help to regulate blood pressure levels to a great extent.6. Flaxseeds: A lot of scientific studies have supported the fact that consumption of flaxseeds regularly can bring a significant improvement in high blood pressure levels. Eating flaxseeds regularly for six months can lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg and 7 mmHg, respectively.7. Walnuts: Walnuts are the only tree nut which are significantly higher in plant-based ALA (Alpha Linoleic Acid), which is the plant-based form of Omega-3 Fatty Acid. Regular consumption of walnuts has shown to improve blood flow. These are also loaded with healthy fats, magnesium, and fibre.8. Garlic: Garlic is rich in an essential sulphur compound known as allicin that has significant blood pressure-lowering benefits. About 600-900 mg of garlic powder can lead to about 9-12 per cent reduction in blood pressure levels.Another key point to remember is to cut back on salt consumption to the least, says Agarwal."

2019-10-14,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2019/oct/12/the-regal-taste-2046246.html,The regal taste,"Saima Afreen ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: S Abaji Rajah Bhonsle brings with him heirloom recipes from the Palace of Thanjavur. Praveen Anand, executive chef  Southern Cuisine, ITC Hotels, says with a smile, It took 17 years for us to convince him to bring the royal cuisine to ITC Kakatiya Hyderabad. Abaji Rajah smiles back adding, I had to be sure for the showcasing. And the recipes that hes brought along are documented in the book Sarabendra Pakashastra safely kept at Saraswati Mahal Library, Thanjavur. The palace is built in an area of 45 acres and has seven museums housing several collections of art. It was Rajah Serfoji II who began documenting the recipes in 1812. These were written for the first time on palm leaves inscribed in a code language called Modi, now translated into English, Tamil and Marathi. But there are several documentations which remain uncoded and hence, untranslated, informs Abaji whos the brother of the Rajah Bhonsle, the current king. His better half, Lady Dhanashree Raje is from Kolhapur and certain methods of cooking are passed only to the ladies of the family.The book classifies five kitchens in the kingdom: Maratha (non-vegetarian), Brahminical (vegetarian), Angrezi (European), Obdhar Khana (water) and Thatti Mahal Khana (milk). They even had a sharbatkhana to prepare just the sherbets and seasonal coolers. Now we have three chefs, of course with their entourage, to prepare food for us, adds Abaji, saying that present rasois can be a combination of the previous kitchens. Hes done the Thanjavur food promotion in Chennai, Bombay and Delhi.Chef Praveen informs All the delights that we sample are the recipes from the palace. The medium of cooking is only ghee and a lot of poppy and dry coconut (khopra) is used. Pepper is used much in the cooking, while the ghee balances the heat, making the dish not-too-hot on the tongue. We try Komdyachi Sherva chicken soup, which is a comfort on a rainy afternoon. The Fish Korma, savoured with laat bakhri (rice chapatis) is delightful cooked with tamarind, mustard sauce, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, poppy and khopra as isMashyache Kebab done in hung yogurt, khopra, poppy seeds, green chillis and marinated for six hours before it is deep fried in a batter-coat. The result is a soft-fluffy delight. The fish used is murrel. What we liked the most is Rostam Gola, spiced meat balls relished with ginger chutney. And no its nothing to do with the fabled Persian army chief Rostam.Other than secret ingredients, whats the secret of the exclusive taste? Shares Abaji, The spices for non-vegetarian dishes are used in vegetarian items along with poppy seeds. Thats the reason. He runs a hotel called Thanjavur Inn which ignited his keen interest in the royal recipes. Ask him whats a normal royal meal is like, and he smiles, I like idlis, appam and sambhar for breakfast. Phulka, rice, daal, vegetable curries and non-veg items for rest of the meal times.Food promotion at Dakshin on till October 20Charges: approx `2,000++ Saima Afreensaima@newindianexpress"

2019-10-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/discover-bengal-inspired-food-at-puducherrys-coromandel-cafe/article29699681.ece,When paturi gets a makeover,"In the French quarter of Puducherry, a British chef is using local produce to create Bengal-inspired food.I wouldnt call it Bengali, says Chef Jay Adams, with a nervous laugh. I would get into trouble... But it is an exciting project, using those flavours with locally grown ingredients. It is something different for Pondy, and is drawing a fresh audience to the caf.It all began when home cook and food consultant, Kolkata-based Iti Misra, collaborated with the team to create a menu for Durga Puja, in early October.At Coromandel Cafe, amidst the cheery buzz, weekend-trippers in shorts and suntans are scarfing down Itis spicy fish rolls dipped in kasundi, along with Jays signature pink tagliatelle.Iti, who has a graceful energy that fits in comfortably with the restaurants elegant setting, discusses the challenges of creating a Bengali pop-up in a European caf ambience, over large butterflied prawn fritters served with a tangy pomelo and cucumber salad. Instead of an elaborate course-by-course menu, Iti says they decided to create a short, versatile set of dishes that work for lunch, dinner and cocktail evenings.The result: reinterpretations of languorous Bengali meals, each thoughtfully curated, often with modern tweaks. I picked dishes that were typically Bengali, but also could be interpreted for this more Westernised space, says Iti. So she avoided fish with bones and highly spiced curries, for example, focussing instead on highlighting the intricacies of traditional flavours and juxtaposing them with local produce, to create a modern menu with an authentic Bengali heart.The spinach luchis, for example, came with a rich cholar dal, spicy baby potatoes, fried eggplant and a tamarind glaze. More traditional dishes included a prawn malai curry served with saffron pulao. And kosha mangsho with flaky parathas.Of course, there was Kolkatas favourite fish paturi, wrapped in a banana leaf, and served with crisp okra. And to snack on, banana flower rissoles with a powerfully fragrant smoked eggplant pure infused with mustard oil.Now that the pop-up is over, Jay and her team are reworking some of these dishes to fit them into the regular menu. It helps that Jay is a fan of the cuisine. I worked with Bengali chefs in the Andamans and immediately loved their food. Even something as simple as aubergines in mustard oil... I had never seen mustard oil before. It is such a unique flavour, she says, adding that kasundi is another favourite.Homage to pinkItis kosha mangsho stays on the menu, unaltered. The okra is now a Japanese-style crispy fried bhindi with beet pickled onions. There is a light cornflour batter to emphasise crispness, and a cheeky thread of pink running through the menu.The colour, a homage to the pink bungalow that Coromandel Cafe is housed in, is Jays signature and it resurfaces in the hot pink puris, bright with beetroot and served with spiced cauliflower. Itis sweet lime salad is now plated up like a garden, with green papaya, goat cheese and a hibiscus-lavender dressing topped with spicy lotus seeds.There are fish rolls filled with creamy, lemony mousse. And poppy seed aloo chops with sweet-and-sour beet pure, tinted with red wine.In the kitchen, the restaurants Bengali cooks were both delighted and surprised to see dishes from home being celebrated in their Pondy-style caf, known more for its banana French toast, steaks and fettuccine. They were really happy and proud, and I loved seeing that, says Jay. They definitely took charge with this menu, and I got to take a slight back seat, which was nice. While continental food is a bit alien, this is from their roots.Though the Bengali chefs did cook intuitively, because they knew just how these dishes should taste, Iti says that they still required coaching. Remember, these are the dishes that their mothers and aunts cook, she says, adding, Though they work in professional kitchens, they do not spend a lot of time in their own kitchens at home.Perhaps that will change. The enthusiastic response underlines the fact that Indian diners have a powerful, visceral response to food that is familiar, no matter which State it comes from. Good news for Indias many colourful, inventive micro cuisines.Coromandel Cafe is at La Maison Rose, 8 Romain Rolland Street, White Town, Puducherry. Items from the new menu start rolling out from this weekend. Call 0413 2221100 for details."
2019-10-17,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/oct/17/deliciousness-delivered-2048928.html,Deliciousness Delivered,"Ayesha Singh ByExpress News ServiceIn a happy coincidence, our quest for food on a lazy weekend ended with an order from a recently launched takeaway and delivery place called 1900 AD  A Kitchen Love Story. On that day, judging a book by its cover turned out to be the best thing. If it wasnt for the unusual ring to its name, we probably wouldnt have made it past the first page of the menu.The executive chef, Sanjeev Dogra, from Gaggal Himachal Pradesh, has bought the quintessential culinary style of slow cooking from the mountain tops to citys hurried gourmands. He cooks most things in clay posts and smokes them on charcoal till his olfactors give a nod of approval.Our short-listed selections included Dum Chicken Curry, Chefs Special Paneer, Daal 1900, and the thing that we were most excited about, The Khatta Mutton, a signature Himachali dish, also the only regional dish on the menu. That was a disappointment since the chefs indigenous knowledge could have been tapped into to display Himachali cuisine that is anyway a niche in Delhi. Also, there is no sweet section in the menu, a big letdown if youre looking for dessert.The food arrived 10 minutes before the requested time setting a good first impression. It came in well-tied cardboard boxes labelled accurately and neatly. There was no leakage or spillage, and every preparation inside had a seal. An accompaniment of vinegared ring onions, mint chutney and tissues came intact.All mains were in earthen handis sealed with dough. Each carried a printed label. The pot was received hot and it remained so for 20 minutes until we all sat down for a meal that was to become a treasured one for a long time.We dug into The Khatta Mutton curry right away. This is traditionally a staple of the Dogri community of Himachal Pradesh and Chef Dogra has used the best of his understanding to make this. No improvisations or innovations its prepared the way it was cooked traditionally in his family.The dish is not khatta (tangy) in the way you imagine it to be but was well laced with amchur spice (mango powder) that lends it a subtle pungency. The meat was tender and the gravy accompanying it filled the air with a satisfying aroma that could only come from pot roasting.The Dum Chicken Curry oozes out whiffs of ginger and garlic adorned with fresh minty flavours. The balance of spices has been achieved skillfully and chilli is thrown in moderately.Both conventional orders but also house specials, the Chefs Special Paneer and Daal 1900, were predictably good. The former had thick, rich tomato gravy with large chunks of paneer and a generous dollop of butter submerged under it. The piquancy of these dishes is best enjoyed with a simple naan or roti accompaniment to ensure the robustness is balanced with the neutrality of the bread.The menu comes with a large selection of other popular North Indian food options from Mutton Chaap, Makhmali Seekh Kebab, Allo Nazakat, Soya Chaam Masala to biryanis, all of which is prepared with the minimal use of machines. The most used implement is the motor and pestle which has replaced grinders, and mud pots have substituted a lot of the steel ware.The food is cooked in desi ghee, mustard oil and rock salt and each is simmered in pots to keep the moisture circulating evenly. And the result is right in front of us. A dexterous curation is rarely found in takeaway/delivery services. Try it."

Only when I had my child did I become aware of how difficult it is to buy clothing for tiny people. The number of retailers who sell cute but good quality clothes for children is embarrassingly low. And if you have a boy, rest assured that every time you take him to the playground, there will be a minimum of three other boys wearing the same T-shirt as him. Additionally, children outgrow their clothing at a lightning pace, making shopping for them not only exhausting, but expensive. Thankfully, things are changing. Today, there are a number of homegrown brands  most of them started by similarly frustrated mothers  that are changing the narrative when it comes to childrens clothing.We scoured scores of them and highlight seven. These brands apply contemporary, fun and clever design sensibilities on locally-sourced fabrics to make kids clothing last longer and allow multiple styling options. It is clothing that will make grandma proud.NeembooNothing beats natural fibres when it comes to comfort, says founder Sirisha Gadepalli. We only use 100% cotton, many being traditional fabrics like handwoven ikats and indigo block prints. Our buttons are also wooden, coconut shell or shell. Sustainability is at the core of Neemboos manufacturing process, and they are focussed on minimal waste generation. We are constantly finding ways to upcycle fabric scrap into accessories like hair clips and covers for sunglasses, says Gadepalli, who recently launched simple shirts for boys. She is also working on a festive edit which will be made only from cotton. The market is flooded with synthetics and sequins, but we strongly feel that pure, simple beauty needs none of that. From 699 onwards. Details: neemboo.inOriOri KidsWearIf you are looking for 100% soft, luxury cotton that has experiential and educational elements, head here. One of their night suits, for example, has a dinosaur print with meanings of their names, to encourage conversations between parents and children.

Many mothers would often comment that they wanted a girl because it is more fun to dress them up, she says. A graduate of NIFT, James had dabbled in experimental menswear during her studies, which led her to launch MiniMen. One of the biggest challenges she encounters with her line of boys clothing is having to break stereotypes on what is appropriate for them. So apart from the usual race car and anchor motifs, you will find tropical fruits and bird prints on the shirts. For the upcoming festive season, silk waistcoats are paired with ikat shirts and matching bow ties. They also make dapper birthday sets of silk shirts with coordinating waistcoats and bowties; twinning sets for the whole family; and a selection of fun, pint-sized suspenders. From 650 onwards.

She was unable to find cotton outfits that were locally made or used traditional fabrics. The brands that did, she says, catered to international clients or were too pricey. Sharmas brand creates clothing using Indian fabrics like dabu, ikat, ajrakh, kalamkari and handloom cotton. Their USP is the contemporary twists they add to conventional fabrics: like jumpsuits in ikat and wrap dresses in Mangalgiri cotton. Our design approach is minimalist and gender-neutral, says Sharma, adding that regular clients keep our clothes for younger siblings, regardless of gender. This contributes to the brands sustainable values. From 449 onwards.

Seeing the immense potential of the kidswear market, she enrolled herself in a Fashion Business course at Instituto Marangoni in Mumbai, then started the eponymous baby and kidswear brand. There is a distinct European influence: think white dresses, ruffled jumpsuits and tops with tiny florals. We cater to an age group that outgrow their clothes in the blink of an eye, says Damani. She is mindful of these needs at the design stage, including details like adjustable straps and waistlines. Anything that can give them more wear and value for the money spent, she says.

Its an indication to not expect a manicured farm. At a given time, different patches of land have fruit, vegetable, pulse and grain-producing plants and trees in various stages of growth. A few segments are dedicated to growing fodder for the farms chickens and buffaloes, a few pockets are left vacant to give sufficient time for soil nourishment after a seasonal crop.The produce from Baby Elephant Farm in Shankarpally powers Kavitha and Ravis pet project, Sage Farm Caf, Hyderabads first farm-to-table caf.Heirloom varietiesKavitha and Ravi set up the farm in 2015, when they returned after living a few years in the US, UK and Singapore, and learnt that it helps to grow produce thats in sync with the local environment. The farm grows many leafy vegetables. Did you know that at one point, 104 varieties of greens were grown in Telangana? asks Vijay Kumar, an electronics engineer turned farmer, who looks after the operations. He wants to grow at least 30 leafy vegetables.A day at Baby Elephant Farm Check sageorganics.in to book field trips to the farm.Soon, weekend yoga sessions will be introduced for small groups. Cottages have been built using eco-friendly hollow clay blocks to keep the premises naturally cool.Sages new endeavour Thrive by Sage will open shortly on road no.2, Banjara Hills, with focus on health food. Think of rajma salad with almonds or palak paneer where the greens arent mashed too much.The penchant for native varieties holds good for grains and pulses as well. Kavita points out that it has increasingly become tough to source heirloom seeds, as the market is flooded with imported varieties.The farm grows approximately 50 vegetables, eight fruits and eight pulses and grains  papaya, banana, guava, lemon, chikoo, pomegranate, badam, toor dal, jowar, peanuts, chickpeas, green moong, black eyed peas, and more. The couple also manages a mango orchard in Gandipet.Walking through the farm, spotting butterflies, dragonflies, colonies of earthworms, ant hills and mycelial networks near the compost area, Kavitha comments that biodiversity is an indicator of a healthy ecosystem.Truly chemical free?If you believe in the adage you are what you eat, its also true that you are what you eat eats, says Ravi, quoting American author Michael Aaron Pollan. Ravis statement comes in the context of the need for chemical-free feed for chickens and buffaloes.One of the indigenous Ongole breed of buffaloes at the farmThe farm places emphasis on natural, chemical-free farming. Ravi and Kavitha state that nothing sold in the market can be trusted easily. They debunk the myth about eggs and meat labelled as chemical and antibiotic-free. They state that some of the ready-made feed for poultry comes laced with chemicals. Hence, they began growing fodder for their animals.What is regenerative farming?Baby Elephant Farm harnesses solar power, harvests rainwater and recycles grey water. Beyond that, it follows regenerative farming. By definition, its the process of creating the right micro and macro life systems to make both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and bio enzymes thrive in the soil. Enriching the soil and improving water systems help enhance the ecosystem. This is done by following diligent steps of composting, using green manure and minimal tilling of soil.Sage Farm Caf divides its waste into nine portions  like separating sea food, meat, vegetable waste, cooked food waste, etc. Though the caf doesnt harp on being zero waste, they strive towards that each day. In addition, they also get ground coffee waste from Roastery Coffee House (approximately eight kilograms per day) and a preliminary compost from hotel Hyatt, which is again worked upon.Vijay Kumar oversees the farm operations | Photo Credit: Sangeetha Devi DundooVijay oversees the meticulous process of composting; he learnt permaculture from Aranya Agricultural Alternatives, and also incorporates a few Korean and other sustainable farming principles. To give an idea of different methods employed, he says that a small quantity of cooked rice when left underground is acted upon by bacteria and fungi and that in turn helps the quality of compost. Waste Decomposer liquid sourced from National Centre of Organic Farming in Ghaziabad, is also used in some processes. Leftover fish, shrimp and even bananas are composted differently. All these generate a range of bio enzymes that enrich the soil. The farm also uses in-house bio-charcoal for soil health.Minimal tillingOne of the guidelines of regenerative farming is to minimise soil tilling, which can disturb the balance of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. How do they work around it? Kavitha shows a row of bamboo plants near which theyve sown nine varieties of seeds  fenugreek, mustard, flax, coriander and others. Until the bamboo grows, theres enough sunlight to nourish the greens. About 45 days later, the greens are cut and left on the spot; they become manure for the bamboo and nourish the soil.The cottage complex at the farm | Photo Credit: Sangeetha Devi DundooSolar dryingA solar dryer is used to process excess seasonal produce. One season they were left with excess chikoo, which was sliced, solar dried and used throughout the year as dry fruit, chips, for jams, kombucha, or made into chikoo flour and used for cakes. Sage Farm Caf has its share of innovative recipes. Why should the multinational pizza chains dictate what goes into a pizza? asks Ravi. Their whole-wheat and ragi thin crust pizzas are topped with mozzarella made from buffalo milk from the farm, an assortment of seasonal vegetables and topped off with sprigs of amaranthus (thotakura) instead of basil. Ridge gourd or Beerakaya chips become the base for innovative bruschetta.This column celebrates eco-conscious initiatives. If you know a Planet Healer, write in to hydmetroplus@thehindu.co.in"

Food, I tell myself (during these brief moments), is not just about eating; its also about delving deep into history. There are some people who do the digging for us  and I am always thankful to them for all that they bring to the table: not just food, but the stories behind it.One tireless researcher is my friend Pritha Sen. When I first met her, many moons ago, I had heard that she was a good cook. But in the last many years, she has been going into the roots of food. One of her passions is the food served in the Goalondo Steamer.The steamer connected parts of what was then undivided Bengal to Goalondo, where the Padma meets the Brahmaputra. Legend has it that the food on the steamer was superb. I remember my mother, who was from Faridpur in what is now Bangladesh, talking about the delicious curries that she had while travelling on the steamer. She may have been referring to the Goalondo fowl curry.This curry  along with a host of other mouth-watering dishes  figures on Prithas menu that she has curated for a special festival at threesixyone, at The Oberoi, Gurugram (on till October 20; about 3,000 per person). She oversees the cooking with the help of the Kolkata-based chef, Surojit Raut, and chef Manish of the hotel. And the menu includes some long-lost dishes or ingredients.Fowl Curry | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementTake the starters. We had something called Batabi Lebu Makha  pomelo salad, with the fruit tossed in mustard oil, rock salt and green chillies. Then we had a small portion of black rice and bamboo rice, mixed with hung curd and kasundi, a wonderfully heady mustard sauce. I loved the crunchiness of the rice, and the mildly tart taste. The bamboo plant flowered once in 12 years, and the villagers preserved the seeds for their nutritional value and had them during times of shortages.Pan-fried Stuffed Teasel Gourd (kakrul in Bengali) followed, and then a small chop of black sesame seeds and steamed and spiced spinach puree on a coin-sized paratha. I was more interested in the non-vegetarian fare, and loved the Chonga Kebab, minced meat cooked in a hollowed bamboo section, a method that is followed in many parts of the northeast but has mostly disappeared from Bengal. There was Murgi Pora, a spiced piece of chicken wrapped and cooked in banana leaf. Pritha points out that the original recipe used goat meat. Even the Goalando fowl curry, now cooked with chicken, would have been prepared with something like duck or perhaps game birds once.Aam Adaa Gondhoraj Sharbat | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThe curry, by the way, was delicious  light, yet well-spiced, with an appetising red gravy. I enjoyed the lightly cooked Hussaini Kalia, too. This was lamb cooked on bamboo skewers with pearl onions and ginger, and dated back to the Hussain Shah Dynasty of the 15th and 16th century.There was much more  sweet and sour baby brinjal, tawa roasted cabbage with mustard paste and coconut, a wonderfully light and tasty dish called Moricher Jhol (gourd stalks in a mildly tempered curry), pointed gourd cooked with a spice called radhuni, duck cooked with bamboo shoot and prawns in a gravy flavoured with coconut, cumin, pippali (a kind of pepper), mustard paste and tamarind. The bhetki flavored with fenugreek, coriander and garlic was outstanding  the curry was mild, and fish had soaked in the flavours of the gravy.As always, Prithas food was more than just a meal: The table came laden with flavours and legends.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Special CorrespondentOpens up fuel retailing to non-oil companiesThe government opened up fuel retailing norms, allowing non-oil companies to set up petrol pumps to increase competition.Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said the opening up the fuel retailing will increase investment and competition.At present, to obtain a fuel retailing licence in India, a company needs to invest 2,000 crore in either hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining, pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved review of guidelines for giving authorisation for marketing of transportation fuel, he said.Companies with 250 crore turnover can enter fuel retailing, subject to condition that 5% of the outlets will be in rural areas.State-owned oil marketing companies  Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (HPCL)  currently own most of 65,000 petrol pumps in the country.Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) and Royal Dutch Shell are the private players in the market but with limited presence. Reliance, which operates the worlds largest oil refining complex, has less than 1,400 outlets.Approves proposal to grant ownership rights to people in unauthorised colonies in DelhiIn a move that will benefit 40 lakh people, the Union Cabinet approved a proposal to grant ownership rights to people living in unauthorised colonies in Delhi, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said.The proposal is based on the recommendations of a committee, he said.Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the Centre would also bring a Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament to give relief to residents of unauthorised colonies in the national capital.The move comes ahead of the Assembly polls in the national capital, scheduled for early next year.The decision is applicable to 1,797 identified unauthorised colonies spread over 175 sq. km and inhabited by people from lower income groups, he said.It does not apply to 69 affluent colonies identified by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) including Sainik Farms, Mahendru Enclave and Anantram Dairy, Mr. Puri added.In July, the Delhi government proposed a set of parameters to regularise the 1,797 colonies, which included charging 1% cost of the circle rate of land for up to 200 sq. metre plot from occupants, besides a nominal penalty.Approves agreements with other countries in various fieldsThe Cabinet gave approval to agreements signed with other countries in various fields including traditional medicine, and science and technology.These include administrative arrangements for cooperation in the field of railways between the Ministry of Railways and the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission.According to an official statement, a proposal for cooperation in science and technology between India and the U.S. was also approved.The agreement would provide an opportunity to promote high quality and high impact research and innovation partnerships, as well as broaden relationships between the extensive scientific and technological communities, it said.It will open a new chapter in bilateral relations with the U.S., as both sides will leverage complementary strengths spurred by a significant convergence of mutual interests, the statement said.The Cabinet also approved a Memorandum of Understanding to provide a framework of cooperation between India and St. Vincent and the Grenadines for the promotion of traditional systems of medicine. This will mutually benefit the two countries in the said field, the statement read.It will lead to promotion and propagation of traditional systems of medicine in St. Vincent & the Grenadines. Activities mentioned in the MoU will boost the importance of AYUSH in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the statement said.(With inputs from PTI)"

I had one such experience the other day. A dear friend and her daughter (our much loved niece  henceforth referred to as OMLN) said they wanted to take us out for lunch. They suggested a few places where they like the food, but I wanted to try out a new restaurant. There was one in Khan Market which had some interesting east European dishes on the menu. So we decided to meet there.We went, we saw, we left. The place was dark, the servers were new and knew little about what was on the menu, and the chef seemed equally at sea. So we quietly left without ordering and went looking for a restaurant called Foxtrot.As it happened, on my way to the restaurant which shall not be named (though, to be fair, OMLN said shed had a very nice meal of Dal Makhni and veggie stuff there some weeks ago), I bumped into chef Agnibh Mudi, who had delighted us with his superb creations at The Perch, another Khan Market restaurant, several months ago. He was now at Foxtrot, he told us. So, after emerging from the dark eatery, we quickly made a beeline for Foxtrot, which was just a few buildings away.Foxtrot is a newish restaurant, situated in the middle lane (if you turn into the lane from the bookstore Bahrisons, turn left and it will be on your left). We went up a flight and found  to our delight  the restaurant was well lit, with natural light filtering in through the windows, too. Chef Agnibh (and the other cheerful employees) helped us navigate the menu. OMLN wanted pasta, but nothing too heavy (so Pasta Linguine with Cherry Tomato and Basil for her), the friend wanted something different (Smashed Galouti Biryani for her), my wife wanted something porky and sharp (so Crumbled Sausage Flat Bread with Peri Peri Sauce with Jalapeno and Olive for her) and I was ready to cross some health barriers (Tenderloin Steak with Pommes Dauphine for me).For starters, we asked for a salad: warm goat cheese with walnuts and honey mustard dressing, and lots of rocket leaves. And the chef sent to the table a plate of their signature kulchas  some stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese, some with beetroot, and served with a curd dip, crumbled roasted papad, tomato chutney and so on.A meal for four should cost between 2,700-3000, including service charge.This doesnt happen very often, but each dish was superb. The salad was outstanding, with caramelised walnuts and fresh rocket leaves, small grapes and cherry tomatoes, all tossed in a light dressing. The kulchas were delicious, too  soft, yet crispy, with just the right kind of stuffing and dips. Our entrees were all perfect. OMLN enjoyed the pasta, which she said had a nice texture, and a light touch. I had some of the crumbled sausage flatbread, and loved it. It was like a very nice, thin pizza, but wonderfully crunchy and full of all of the good stuff. The friend enjoyed her biryani: the galouti came well merged with the fragrant riceI loved the tenderloin (buffalo meat), cooked just so, with the sauce on the side, a mashed and crispy potato chunk and lots of flavourful green veggies: asparagus, broccoli, snow peas. The meat was tender, and I actually liked it even without the sauce. The chef told us that the ingredients all come from specialized places, the greens and micro-greens from a farm on the outskirts, the ribs from Bengaluru.Our meal was, in a word, outstanding. We were happy that fate (bumping into the chef, finding the other place inadequate) did its bit for us. The silly smile is still on my face.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Pollinators, which include bees, need a major protection boost.There are 2,00,000 pollinators of which honeybees are the most sought after, why?Theres a popular saying as busy as a bee. That term comes from the fact that honey bees are the only species who identify a flower and make multiple visits to the same flower until they get all the nectar and pollen out of it. They are the best pollinators and work in the most methodical fashion. From identifying to communicating and dividing work. Their social structure is fascinating and one that we can learn a lot from. There are 20,000 types of bee species of which the ones mentioned below are the most popular types in India. Indian and European bees are the most sought after while stingless bees are slowly catching our attention for its medicinal properties.Common Name Scientific Name Natural Nesting Site Honey Yield (KG) Indian Bees Apis Cerena Cavity, Termite Mounds, Tree Hollow etc. 8-10 European Bees Apis Mellifera Cavity 25-30 Rock Bees Apis Dorsata Tree Branches, Buildings etc 30-35 Dwarf Bees Apis Florea Twig in a bush <1 Himalayan Rock Bees Apis Laboriosa Underside of rock cliffs 40-45 Indian Stingless Bees/Dammer Bees Tetragonula Iridipennis Cavities, Hollows in tree trunks and walls <500 gramsTheres been a lot of buzz about bees going extinct and people have been trying to find a way around it.Here is a story from beekeepers who have found it very lucrative to harvest them.There are multiple beekeepers like Apoorva - the bee man of India and organisations like the University of Agricultural Sciences in GKVK, Bangalore who conduct workshops and help people understand the importance of bees, train them on beekeeping and provide them with bee boxes.Apoorva visits his bee farm in Bidadi regularly to check the health of the bees. He is a mechanical engineer but a beekeeper by profession. He found his passion for bees even before he graduated and took it up soon after. Hes been working on bees for over 10 years and works closely with farmers across the country. He travels, meets farmers, trains them, gives them bee boxes, follows up with them on the progress and reviews the health of the bees regularly. He also helps them sell their produce. While Apoorva works with a lot of people across the country, this is a story close to home where hes been working with flood victims in Coorg.He is involved in multiple activities such as honey production, bee breeding, manufacturing beekeeping equipment, selling honey and beehive by-products, mainly wax. His company's annual turnover is over 2 crores. He has both Indian and Italian bees.He initially collected bees from hives and then started breeding them in his apiary during the natural division season of bees. He also buys colonies from farmers when they multiply. This bee farm is near a cornfield which is rich in pollen. It is important to understand your demography he says. Having bee flora next to an apiary is very beneficial to harvest more honey and keep bees in good health. He harvests Indian bees in forests and hilly regions and also promotes only Indian bees to farmers as its easier since most of them cannot handle migratory beekeeping.European bees which in India are Italian bees requires 4-7 migrations in a year for which, he travels around 1,200 kms pollinating thousands of acres in North Karnataka mainly Sunflowers, Til, Niger, Coconuts, Arecanuts, Banana, Avacado, Litchi and more. Honey yielding fields for Italian bees are Sunflowers, Eucalyptus, Til and Niger. He has more than 200 colonies now and will split them to make about 800 during the breeding season. A farmer keeps anywhere between 4-25 boxes. He needs about 3 boxes per acre and has to distance each colony by at least 10 feet.Bee Harvesting has helped Coorg flood victims make a livelihoodVijay Panduranga talks about the effects of the flood and the rehabilitation work in Coorg.After the floods in 2018 that hit Coorg, a lot of farmers lost their land in turn livelihood and havent received much relief from the government. There were rescue operations but then not much is being done on the rehabilitation front.With paltry compensation from the govt. Coorg flood victims are finding solace in the new beekeeping venture. Nectar flow is an initiative/program started by a few local people, spearheaded by Retd. Brigadier Devaiah to help provide a steady income to people interested in beekeeping. People have seen returns in the 1st few months. They say that the money that comes in lets them breathe. While beekeeping in an age-old tradition in Coorg, the methods are ancient. Devaiah was on the lookout for someone with a scientific approach to help them and thats when he found Apoorva and sought help. Apoorva readily agreed and continues to work closely with the farmers. He has helped the farmers understand the species better, eventually getting them better yields. At Coorg, each farmer makes a minimum of 5 kgs of honey per year and each box sells at Rs. 600/- per kg. They also make money by selling colonies at Rs. 1,500/- per colony. Farmers produce about 2-3 kgs of beeswax per year which is approximately Rs. 350/ kgFarmers from the North East, Chhattisgarh, Coorg and other parts of India find it difficult to sell the honey and wax that they produce. Apoorva helps them by buying the whole lot from them, filters them further if theres moisture and sells them as and when he gets enquires. Honey is labeled as per the flowering season such as litchi, cardamom, clover, mustard, chilli, etc., the honey tastes different too.The by-products such as beeswax, royal jelly and bees venom are other sources of income and, used in pharmaceuticals and beauty products.The below-mentioned statistics are only an example of how bee pollination increases the yield anywhere between15%  80%. These are scientifically proven numbers in ideal conditions (these are underestimated values).Estimated global economic value of pollination is 217 billion USD in 2005Crop Increase in yield per acre (%) Increase in yield per acre Income generation by pollination per acre Coffee 15% 5 Bags 15,000/- Aracanut 25% 2 Quintals 64,000/- Coconut 20% 3,000 nuts 36,000/- Banana 20% 5 Quintals 10,000/- Watermelon 80% 4 Tonnes 20,000/-Farmers tell us their personal stories of how beekeeping has helped increase their yield with pollination in crops such as coffee, fruits and spices. They also make a good livelihood but extracting honey and wax. What they make is pure and unadulterated making the quality far more superior than the ones available off the shelves at supermarkets.This is what a bee box looks like. This is one bee colony. They come on top to feed. There are multiple wooden frames inside quoted with wax, which help them construct combs.Every bee box has an opening at the bottom which allows the bees to move in and out of it, to go out and collect nectar and pollen. Some farmers who have these bee boxes are also given out on rent for pollination to seed producers or other farmers who are in need of pollination.Naganna (Saachi) Kalappa lives 3 kms away from the main Madhapur town in Somwarpet Taluk. He has been harvesting bees for 18-20 years. Bees were available in abundance then as the ecology was healthy and rich, and filled with plants that the bees needed to survive. However, the species has seen a massive decline in numbers as the human population has been increasing and trees are being cut down for personal benefits such as planting silver oak trees as it yields timber and in a short span of time. Since the decline in numbers, they now need to procure boxes and up their skills and knowledge. After adopting this scientific method, he has benefited as his crops are multiplying. He is making enough money to take care of the needs of his family. He also says I request people to stop destroying forests and help in sustaining them and grow trees that are required for agriculture instead of timber to improve the ecology.Thammaiah CB (Dolly) lives 7 kilometers away from the main Madhapur town in Somwarpet taluk in the Coorg district. This part of Coorg witnessed the worst of natures fury in 2018. While he has been harvesting Indian Apis Cerena Bees in boxes he also harvests stingless bees in pots. The quantity of honey is way lesser than what is produced by other bees however, the quality is far more superior as it has a lot of medicinal properties and is sold at a much higher rate.Thammaiahs mother tends to her garden every day. She says it isnt enough if you just harvest bees and have a coffee estate, it is very important to understand what kind of flowers and fruits attract them and cultivate them in your garden. This helps in increasing pollination and nectar production.Fruit especially those with seeds are good pollinators.Plants that one should cultivate to yield better resultsNectar: Plants such as Avocado, Litchi, Hibiscus etc.Pollination: Plants such as Sunflower, Sesame, Mustard, Coriander, Niger, Coconut and more (bees are attracted to vibrant colours such as yellow and blue)She also makes beeswax at home which is another income generator. She says that it is not a very laborious process and demonstrates. You first break the comb into a utensil with enough water and let it boil.You let it boil until it reaches the required consistency.You then squeeze out all the excess water and use the residue to make wax cakes.This is the final product.Apoorva pays regular visits to all the farmers across the country and conducts a health check.It is very important to taste it as well. Every house he goes to gives him honey to taste. He jokes and says I am glad I dont have diabetes. If I did, for the amount of honey I consume, I would be in a lot of trouble.Bose Mandanna is the fourth generation coffee grower. He moved back to Coorg 53 years ago after completing a bachelors degree in Agricultural Economics. He talks of how he has seen farming change in the years to come. Back in the day farming was done in a very environmentally friendly way. Over a period of time, when they found pests taking over the plantation, they used some chemicals to deal with the pest issue. However, they soon realised that they were not only harming humans but also the bees and other pollinators in the environment. These chemicals known as weed killers have cancer-causing properties. On realising this, they decided to go back to organic farming. However, a lot of farmers have been affected by this chemical especially in Punjab as they are one of the largest agriculturists, and the Punjab mail is popularly called the cancer express as a lot of them are coming to Bombay for treatment. Also to note the groundwater gets affected by these chemicals. People are saying that there are bee-friendly pesticides available. He jokes and says there are all chemicals and they cannot be friendly, they might not kill you but make you unconscious. Please avoid chemicals and use bio controlled agents.White Stem Borer Problem: These pests are known to attack the coffee plants and wreak havock hencethey wrap the plants with white cloths to avoid this menace. There is a mild chemical in it but it onlytouches the trunk of the plant and does not reach the coffee flower thereby not harming humans orbees.May 20th is International Bees Day. UAS in GKVK conducted a 2 day class for people interested in beekeeping. Urban beekeeping is also becoming popular as people from the cities have started showinginterest.The staff showed them how to identify and dig out for a beehive as they can build hives anywhere. Thishas to be done with caution so as to not break the hive.You then mildly sedate the bees with some smoke by burning dry cotton cloth and get the comb outOnce you get the comb out, you tie them tightly to a frame but not so tight that they break.Students learn to tie the comb to the frame.While they learn to make honey, a student observes the comb.Santosh from the faculty shows the class how to peel the comb before you can put it into a vessel to churn honey. The peeling has to be very fine.These are the machines in which you put the combs in to extract honey. These machines are also made by Apoorva and sold to the farmers. There is a particular way the combs have to be kept and then manually churned.A small community of farmers can only do so much, the government needs to step up and help take this initiative forward, make this bigger and reach more people."

The air we breathe contains a number of harmful pollutants. These pollutants are always present in the air, however, when the concentration goes high; it becomes dangerous for the health. Additionally, factors like cigarette smoke, dust particles, pollutants like carbon mono-oxide and radon makes the air more harmful.While wearing marks and taking measures to avoid harmful air always helps, one should also be careful about the diet around this time. It is necessary to have enough immunity and nutrients to make the body strong enough to fight these pollutants. Most important of all is to have enough antioxidants in the body, which can help your body. Here are a few tips on the food intake:1. Vitamin C: The single most potent antioxidant for our body, Vitamin C is also easily available in Citrus fruits. Vit C is water soluble and scavenges free radicals. Most importantly, it also contributes to vitamin E regeneration. Include vegetables like coriander leaves, chaulai ka saag, drumsticks, and parsley, cabbage and turnip greens. For fruits, amla and guava are rich sources.2. Vitamin E: The fat soluble vitamin E provides the first line of defense against injury to human tissues. Our body consumes vitamin E from plant based cooking oils like sunflower, safflower and rice bran oil. Other rich sources are almonds, sunflower seeds, and nuts. If you are non-vegetarian, include salmon, roe and eel for vitamin E content.3. Beta Carotene: With an important role in controlling inflammation, Beta Carotene converts to vitamin A in our body. To have it, depend on food items like Leafy vegetables, amaranth (chaulai ka saag), coriander, methi(fenugreek), lettuce and spinach. Other great sources are radish leaves and carrots.4. Omega -3 Fats: Having these in the body helps in protecting the body against the detrimental effects of air pollution. The rich sources of Omega-3 Fats ate fishes. However, for vegetarians, you can try nuts, seeds like walnuts, chia seeds and flax seeds. You can also add Methi seeds, mustard seeds, green leafy vegetables, kala chana, and rajma andbajra.5. Ayurvedic Solutions: Apart from these vitamins and fats, certain herbs and spices are also known to have antioxidant qualities. Turmeric is a well-known antioxidant. Mixing turmeric and ghee can relieve cough and aid during asthma.

It is not just about using natures wealth, but also about delightfully treating the tastebuds in the process. One such hidden gem is the pumpkin flower. The squash plant grows with an edible flower that has an orange and yellow hue.AdvertisingPumpkin flower consists of a rich amount of vitamin B9 that is essential for sperm creation. It is also blessed with Vitamin A that can aid in improving vision. It enables your eyes to adjust to light changes, keeps them moist, and also improves night vision. Also, the phosphorus found sufficiently in pumpkin flower is a vital part of the growth process and the maintenance of bones and teeth.Its a popular dish in Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala, wherein people savour as deep dried pakodas, stir fry veggies, etc.* Mathapoo thoran is the stir fry of pumpkin flower which is popular in the south. It is generally plucked from the garden, since it is grown widely within the campus. It is mixed with grated coconut, turmeric powder, curry leaves, cumin seeds, and the like.Advertising* In Bengal and Bihar, pumpkin flower is eaten in the form of crispy snacks, generally served with mint and coriander chutney. It is dipped in gram flour batter or besan and then deep-fried in mustard oil. It is a traditional fritter in both the states.* In the west, Americans call it classic stuffed peppers. The flower is filled with a mix of beaten and whisked eggs, and bread crumbs, later baled for about 10 minutes till it has turned golden brown.* In Mexico, they are known as Flores De Calabaza. Their delicate flavour works beautifully with mild, creamy cheese in quesadillas, making for a yummy snack."
2019-11-02,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-its-deep-fried-its-bengali/article29863705.ece,"If it’s deep-fried, it’s Bengali","The main industry / in Kolkata  real estate / and telebhaja: Amit Chaudhuri, from TelebhajaMy friend from Berlin was delighted to discover pumpkin flowers in the markets of Kolkata.You eat pumpkin flowers too? she asked. How do you prepare them?Oh we dip them in batter and deep-fry them, I replied cheerily. She seemed rather crestfallen. She had been thinking she was about to discover the Bengali equivalent of Italian zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese. Just dunking them in besan and tossing them in a kadhai of hot bubbling oil seemed less inspiring.I could see her point. Once you dip something in heavy batter and deep fry it, it didnt much matter anymore whether it was yellow pumpkin blossoms or white bokphool flowers or any other flower to start with.The fact is Bengalis like to deep-fry everything  pumpkin slices, eggplants, greens, even the crunchy seeds of overripe parwals. Everything is fair game  vegetables, flowers, tiger prawns, fish roe, chicken lollipops. I am surprised our fairy tales arent filled with wicked witches who try to deep-fry little children.Pakoras and dumplingsDeep-fried is an adjective in English. In Bengali it acquires the solidity of a noun, telebhaja. Which literally means Things Fried in Oil. It could be begunis, batter-fried eggplant slices; or peyajis, little pakoras made of fine-chopped onion and green chillis; or it could be aloo chops, first cousins to aloo bondas but with thinner besan coatings. Winter lunches mean little florets of batter-fried cauliflower, while deep-fried crispy tiny mourala fish are perfect for any season. In recent years dal-vada wallah carts have sprung up in street corners all over Kolkata, frying up mounds of spicy little lentil dumplings that are served piping hot in newspaper packets, the oil stain spreading deliciously over the newsprint as if tracing a map of illicit pleasures.The Bengali romance with the deep-fried is not new. Pragyasundari Devis seminal cookbook of Bengali recipes from 1902 has over 100 recipes under Bhajibhuji aka Fried-This-And-That. She fries things I did not even know existed  gaandaal leaves, delo and punko saag  as well as things I would have thought defied frying  like pineapples, green papaya and jackfruit. Do not skimp on the oil, she warns. It will become limp instead of crunchy. Fry in batches. Dont overcrowd. Haste makes soggy.She assures us that something fried, whether batter-fried or shallow-fried, can accompany almost everything on a Bengali plate.With rice and khichdi you can try fried vegetables or fuluris, puffy besan dumplings. With pulaos, she recommends koftas and chops, the Bengali answer to croquettes. With puffed luchis (themselves deep-fried), you can have fried eggplant or fried parwal.Fried potatoes pair excellently with mutton or duck roast. And all this does not include the procession of deep-fried treats that accompany the afternoon cup of cha.The devilled eggTea-time snacks or jolkhabar is a Bengali orgy of deep-fried excess, starting with the humble singhara and the simple kalonji-speckled kucho nimki munchies to the vegetable chop, that curious ball of grated beetroot with raisins and peanuts. From here we quickly climb the food chain to diamond fish fries, mutton breast cutlet, fowl cutlets, fish fingers, and the lethal butter-fried Fish Orly. Many of these have colonial roots, though now thoroughly Bengalicised. A devilled egg in the rest of the world is a cold snack made with a boiled egg, its yolk mashed with mustard and mayo. An Egg Devil in Kolkata is a boiled egg wrapped with minced meat, dunked in breadcrumbs and deep-fried.I remember going to a Calcutta Classic Food Festival that celebrated some of Kolkatas most legendary snack shops. Chitto-das Suruchee, Niranjan Agar, Apanjan, Allen Cafe, Mitra Caf, started in 1910-11 not by a Mr. Mitra but by a Mr. Sushil Roy who wanted to create a hangout for friends or mitra. Each eatery has its own iconic dish, deep-fried of course. Allen Kitchen has its gloriously batter-fried Sp. Prawn Cutlet Big (Pure Ghee), though its Fish Fry sticks to refined oil. They say Bengali superstar Uttam Kumar frequented Mitra Cafe for its Chicken Kabiraji  the Bengali version of the British cover egg cutlet  where the chicken fillet is covered with a coating of deep-fried egg batter that makes a lacy egg doily oozing oil. It is not meant for the faint of heart.Iconic brain chopMitra Cafes real speciality, though, is its iconic brain chop. Imagine a deep-fried tennis ball with gooey goat brain inside. For those less daring, theres Chitto-das classic Diamond Fish Fry or Fish Roll, minced fish surrounded by a layer of Kolkata bhetki, then deep-fried.The only vegetables in sight at that food festival were raw onions and slivers of cucumber pretending to be a salad. I did not touch them. After all, you can get E. coli from cut raw vegetables.Perhaps thats the scientific reason behind this love for all things deep-fried. It might clog the arteries but at least no pesky germ can survive that wok of boiling oil.Yet, it is still the humble telebhaja, minus the attraction of a Kolkata bhetki or chicken breast, which remains the true marker of Bengali-ness. The hole-in-the-wall telebhaja shops rarely have names, or if they do, they are names like Potlas Shop or Naren-das Shop, but their clientele is devoted. And some have a hallowed history.Netajis snacksOn a road once named after Lord Cornwallis, theres a telebhaja shop that specialises in the usual favourites along with more exotic offerings like mango chop, soya bean chop and coconut chop. But thats not why its famous. Lakshmi Narayan Shaw & Sons was opened in 1918 by one Khedu Shaw. Back in the day it apparently supplied young Subhas Chandra Bose with all things deep-fried, especially during the secret meetings he held with other freedom fighters. In 1942, Shaw babu started to secretly distribute free snacks on Netajis birthday, a grease-stained act of subversion in our freedom struggle that we remain tragically uninformed about. Somehow, it makes our heroes more human, knowing that on a rainy monsoon evening, between meetings plotting how to throw off the yoke of colonialism, they paused for some aloor chop.But our favourite telebhaja shop was more humble. Nalin-dada was the cook who accompanied my mother as a new bride into the jungles of Madhya Pradesh where my civil engineer father was building a bridge. When they returned to Kolkata, Nalin-dada set up a telebhaja stall outside our house where he fried eggplants and onion pakoras every evening while his children and I played hide-and-seek.I can still picture his little display case lit by the flame of a kerosene lamp, with fresh-fried begunis and peyajis piled in a basket.My great-grandmother was a huge fan of his telebhaja. Actually, she was a fan of all things deep-fried, her appetite undiminished till the very end. Once in her 90s she fell down and bust her head. As the family scurried around trying to staunch the blood, she called out plaintively to the old maid, Jamuna, remember to soak the dal. I want to have dal bada tomorrow. My mother scolded her for her insatiable appetite for fried food but now, whenever we eat dal vada at lunch, she remembers her wistfully.In these parts, even our nostalgia is deep-fried.Moong BeguniAs found in Amish o Niramish, Vol. 1, the cookbook by Pragyasundari Devi.Getty Images/ iStockIngredients60g whole moong dal2 tbsp rice flour15g white sesame seeds75g eggplant1/2 tsp salt3 tbsp gheeMethod1. Soak the moong dal in water. After one hour remove the peels and wash the dal several times and grind to a paste. Rinse the sesame seeds.2. Cut the eggplant into round slices and rub salt on them. You should have 13-14 slices of eggplants.3. Beat the dal paste vigorously. Put a drop into some water, if it floats you do not need to beat it any more. Now add the rice flour, sesame seeds and salt. Smear the eggplant slices with the mixture.4. Heat the ghee. After a few minutes add the eggplant 3-4 at a time and fry till they are crunchy and brown. Each should take about three minutes.The author of Dont Let Him Know, like many Bengalis, likes to let everyone know about his opinions."

Could they have found solutions to redeem a city whose groundwater is estimated to run dry in 2020?may want respite from the rains now but a few months ago, even as recent as June, the outlook was bleak on the water front. The monsoon was delayed over Karnataka and water levels in reservoirs were falling rapidly. TheWater Supply and Sewerage board had said that it had reached its peak limit of water supply toin March  April, 1453 MLD, and it could not supply any more water for love or money. At one point, it looked like the prediction that Bengaluru was one of the many cities which would run out of ground water by 2020 was going to be a reality sooner.Then the rains poured and rivers were in spate, and floodwaters displaced thousands in Karnataka. But its getting abundantly clear that we cant depend on the vagaries of the monsoon but must have ways to conserve, recharge and use water efficiently.Just 30 km from the heart of Bengaluru, in Kaglipura, off Kanakapura Road, Dr Prabhakar Rao, trustee with the Agriculture Trust of the Art of Living Foundation, has no such worries about water scarcity. He has 2.5 acres of land in which he does natural farming, growing indigenous and long-lost varieties of exotic-sounding crops, including purple corn with a lemony flavour, mustard leaves with a wasabi bite to them and basil leaves boasting strong camphor or cinnamon flavours.Even as his crops flourish, six years since he began natural farming, the groundwater level in his plot has risen to 180ft compared to 1,000ft at which plots around his are trying to find water.Dr Prabhakar, who hails from an agrarian family and did his Masters and PhD in agriculture, did his post-doctoral thesis in landscape architecture instead to stay away from industrial farming that was being initiated in the country back then as it encouraged introducing chemicals in the soil. After working around the world as an architect until 2011, he returned home and began farming in his 2.5-acre plot to preserve native vegetables. But I realised they cannot be grown using chemicals.Moreover, they had twin negative effectson ecology and human health. Additionally, chemicals kill nutrients in the soil, making it hard and impermeable. The dry and dead soil cannot recharge groundwater, says Dr Prabhakar.Hed learnt that even organic farming, introduced in India in 1940 as an alternative to chemical farming, didnt add up economically or ecologically. Its cost-intensive and depends on compost creationa heat-generating process that kills nutrient-solubilising microbes in the soil. So while it improves the tilt of the soil and increases its porosity and water-holding capacity, it doesnt add nutrients to the soil, elaborates Dr Prabhakar, who then discovered natural farming at Art of Living.He tells us that natural farming focuses entirely on nutrient solubilising microbes (NSM) and that the entire spectrum of microbes that solubilise all the nutrients required for plant growth is found in the gut of the indigenous cow or the desi cow (Bos indicus). In natural farming, fresh cow dung, which has NSMs, is mixed with cow urine, which has growth-promoting hormones. It causes microbes to multiply exponentially over a couple of days to create growth stimulants such as jeev amruta, gana jeev amruta, beej amruta and panchagavya, explains Dr Prabhakar.After adding either the jeev amruta or gana jeev amruta in the soil and mulching the soil with leaves or any biomaterial, earthworms take over. These creatures create a vermicompost in situ 24/7, tilling the earth as they tunnel up and down through six feet of ground twice a day, making the soil more permeable, which helps in recharging the aquifers, says Dr Prabhakar. Aquifers are the saturated zones beneath the water table, which are huge storehouses of water.Through natural farming, Dr Prabhakar increased his groundwater level in his plot to 180ft. Dr Prabhakar, who is now also a teacher of natural farming, has reached out to about 22 lakh farmers across 22 states in the country.About 50 km from Dr Prabhakars plot in Kaglipura is a 3-acre plot in Whitefield on which S Madhusudan grows over 90 varieties of fruits, vegetables and greens in a chemical-free environment. What began as a hobby after he left his high-stress job in the corporate world in 20112012, went on to become a commercial venture. Today, Madhusudan does organic farming in 500 acres across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which are largely on a 10-year lease. His produce, sold under the brand name of Back2Basics, is being home-delivered in some parts in Bengaluru as well as exported to Germany, UK and Singapore.Madhusudan, who, unlike Dr Prabhakar, hailed from a family of chartered accountants and had no background in agriculture, got into it because he wanted to do something more fulfilling and to counter all the untruths in the market by retailers who sold chemical-ridden, exorbitantly priced produce in the name of organic farming. He began growing greens in a 30-by-40ft site he had in Whitefield using the previously set up borewell in the plot. A farmer named Muniappa taught Madhusudan everything he wanted to know about farming. But in 20092010, Madhusudan moved from vocational to commercial agriculture after a friend gave him an unused 3-acre plot outside Whitefield on the Chikkatirupati Road, asking him to do something with it. The corporate-honcho-turned-farmer went around the globe until 2012 learning how agriculture was done. Then, in 2013, Madhusudan dug a borewell in his 3-acre plot.Madhusudan hit water at 550ft; the next year, he had to go 1,000ft deep for a secondary source of water. Today, his plot does more than just growing safe, high-quality edible produce. It has raised the water table in his 3-acre plot to 48ft (5ft) and 150ft800ft across his other farms.In addition to using natural farm-based fertilizers such as poultry manure, neem and oilseed cakes from a gaushala in Hoskote, Madhusudan created an artificial stream around his plot with gentle slopes.Patented by Madhusudan, the technique he used was based on the principles that the Suez Canal is built on. He built a Steppes-like moat around his plot (with lush weed flora growing in it). While the gentle slopes cause the water to overflow into the lower-lying areas without causing the top soil to flow away, the flora in the moat ensures minimum evaporation. The water system has even been covered by the BBC to better understand rainwater harvesting.Now, using techniques to facilitate the filtering process of the soil to cleanse water, Madhusudan procures sweet drinkable water right off the ground in Whitefield.Could Madhusudan have, unwittingly, found answers to water problems for places like Whitefield, where even if ones lucky to get water below 1,000ft, the water is heavily silted and unfit for consumption?Popularly known as the Rainman in the city, Vishwanath Srikantaiah has been in the news recently for his ambitious project to build one million recharge wells in Bengaluru. We spoke to him about the possibility of increasing groundwater levels in the city by undertaking natural and organic farming in and around the citys perimeters, as in the above examples.While both natural and organic farming would increase the absorption of the soil, it is a slightly more complex than that when dealing with hydrology and increasing the citys groundwater levels. For one, in places such as Kaglipura and Whitelfield, 10% of the rain water drains into the aquifers as against only 3% in the city areas, explains Vishwanath.As for our excitement over the stated increase in the groundwater levels in both the farmers farmlands, he cautions us about understanding the time of the year when the levels were tested to make accurate assessments of the situation. Kitchen gardens and farming in gated-communities can help water levels increase, but a city will turn around results only by mostly rainwater harvesting, building recharge wells and planting trees, he adds. And while at it, we could even take Dr Prabhakars suggestion of introducing earth worms in public gardens, open-lung spaces and gated-communities to let the natural farming tools do their work to increase the soils water-retention and nutrient-quotient."

There will also be American Spanish and Mexican dishes, a food market with indie food labels and workshops with top chefs. We loved the idea of bringing the worlds most outrageous, exotic and truly different food to Mumbai, and serving it alongside the regional gems of Indias restaurant scene, says CEO of 70 EMG and organiser of the event, Martin da Costa. Curators Mody and Swamy pick nine unique stalls you must try this weekend.Kalkatta Shahi Mutton Biryani By Manzilat FatimaAn authentic Awadhi offering, Manzilat Fatimah takes pride in showcasing the food of her ancestors. Food in Awadh was like a sport for the Nawabs and the kitchens like the fields with bawarchis and rakabdars as the players. There was healthy competition, and challenges were thrown at each other to exhibit better gastronomic skills. A lot of money was spent in maintaining the royal kitchens and for hiring the best experts available from the culinary field.Gradually Matiaburj, the suburban area of Calcutta started to grow into a miniature of the Nawabs beloved Lucknow, with influences of circumstances showing through, says Mody.Mok Mok (momos from Ladakh) and Gur Gur Chai (Ladakhi Butter Tea) By Alchis KitchenEntrepreneur Nilza Wangmo of Alchi Kitchen offers a mix of traditional Ladakhi foods with a modern twist. Its a warm and welcoming open kitchen style family restaurant, named after the village that Nilza hails from. Wangmo is known to experiment with local spices and flavours to spice up the otherwise bland Ladakhi cuisine. Ladakhs mountainous ecosystem has led to the development of a unique agricultural economy and lifestyle. Meat - mutton, chicken and yak - are an important part of the cuisine, as are locally grown vegetables. The food is warming, with thick soups and broths prevailing, along with the use of spices like cinnamon, clove, cardamom and saffron. Yak meat and milk are used to great effect in the winter, adds Mody.Vajri (Tripe) By Rekhas KhanavalTired of working in kitchens at different homes, Rekha started serving her home-cooked food at a stall in Prabhadevi, which serves almost 150 people a day. But if youve got the guts for it, try her liver masala and Vajre (intestines) cooked in different ways. Konkan food is well-flavoured and uses a lot of fresh ingredients and freshly ground masalas. Along the coast they use a lot of fresh coconut. A bit into the interiors, they use dry and desiccated coconut, says Mody.Rabbit Fry By Kerala Toddy ShopWe visited four iconic toddy shops (Kaavalam, Manthoppu, Mullapandhal, Karimpinkala), spoke to the family of the doyen of Kerala food, Mrs KM Mathew and visited some remote corners (Kothamangalam/ Muvattupuzha, Kochi, Kuttanad / Alleppey, Kottayam) to get a full representation of the Travancore region. [Of all the dishes] rabbit is not something one eats in Mumbai, explains Mody.Banana Flower Relish and Braised Pork with Roselle Leaf by Meghalaya KitchenThe Garo Tribe is an indigenous Tibeto-Burman ethnic group from the Indian subcontinent. Lactcia S Momin, who belongs to the Garo tribe will present the traditional flavours of her community. Pork, beef, snails, crab, dry fish, they cook everything with locally grown organic vegetables like yam, roselle, ginger, chilli, bamboo shoot, and tons of greens, reveals Mody.Silkworm Pupae with Roselle leaves - Gitikas PakGhorGitikas Pakghor offers food from different states of the North East and her food is based on family recipes, as well as contributions by local communities gathered during her home visits.Assamese cuisine is characterised by the use of an extremely wide variety of plant and animal products, and very little use of spices. Various indigenous groups also eat silkworm, water bugs, grasshoppers, and other insects. Insects are fried, cooked or roasted in leaves, explains Mody.Mutton Kastoori Naan Sandwich by Jilani KebabsAlam of Jilani Kebabs serves a blend of Mughlai food, Muslim street food and Tava food that is popular during the season of Ramzan. While a lot of them claim lineage from Lucknow and Delhi, the food is truly Bambaiya Bhendi Bazaar  and Swamy found him in a small corner of Bohri Mohalla.Jilani Kebabs was founded by Alams father in Bori Mohalla in 1986. Mughlai food has its origins in the Mughal rule in India and the flavours range from mild to spicy, and are associated with their distinct aroma and the use of whole and ground spices, says Swamy.Kadumbutt & Pandi Curry (Steamed rice balls + Pork curry) by Coorgi StallCoorgi food is subtle yet pungent and uses a lot of chilli. Kadampuli is a fruit from which a special vinegar called Kachampuli is made and is used as a souring agent and pork dishes and Pandi curry are the highlights in these parts.Many dishes are Kerala oriented in nature as the southern bit of Coorg touches the state. So appams, puttus and many rice-based dishes abound in the Coorg district, says Swamy, while promising that this food stall will offer the real deal.Eat street: (Clockswise from left) Pork in mustard leaves; Lucknowi tundey kebabs; Nicole Mody; Michael Swamy; Tara Deshpande; and Kunal VijaykarWai Wai Noodles and Fish Fry by Dolly SinghDolly Singh spent her younger years in different parts of the country and gained knowledge from all the local cultures. Her cookouts include delicacies from Bihar, where she hails from, as well as Bengali, Tibetan and other cuisines. Her idea is to introduce people to the rustic flavours of the east. Bihari cuisine is similar to North Indian cuisine, but borrows influence from the East (for example Bengali), says Swamy. And if you love noodles, especially the instant variety, try her version of Wai Wai and some fish fry.Isuzu XFood Festival, Royal Western India Turf Club, Mahalaxmi Race Course on November 16, 4 p.m. to 10 p.m and November 17, 10 a.m to 10 p.m; see Insider"

2019-11-18,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/clothes-inspired-by-delhis-winters/article30006885.ece,Designs from the past,"Karan Torani admits he is old-fashioned. A 90s kid, his most vivid memories of winter are of his family and him lazing in the afternoon sun on the terrace of their home in Delhi; flying kites, making pickles and knitting sweaters. With adjoined terraces, the neighbours became like family. We shared food, stories and a few laughs, he reminisces. These are such simple but strong memories. Today, in this chaotic world, I dont know if kids understand the simple pleasures of just being and observing these little things as they unfurl. My Autumn/Winter collection Chatt (meaning terrace in Hindi) is the peace I found amidst the everyday chaos, says the designer, who was in Chennai to showcase this collection at Collage.It is a rather unassuming name for a collection, isnt it? Agreed, smiles Karan, adding, But that is how the brand has always been. Nothing over the top, both in terms of design and name. Each collection stems from a story that has a personal connect. For example, his first collection Airavata was inspired by his nani and how she lived in her hometown in Bhopal. Gulabi Mela was thus named because it was the first time he held hands with a girl as he walked around a carnival with 50 in his pocket and everything felt rosy. Then there was Pithoo: named after his favourite childhood game that made him race back from school everyday, and Sindhdi that drew elements from his ancestors, their clothes, music and folklore.Chatt is a blur of mustard, black, aqua, red, maroon, orange and blue. There are phirans, lehengas, jackets, kedia tops, saris and scarves in organza, chanderi and cotton silk. For the men there is the option of choosing from sherwanis, kurta sets and jackets.Like chintz, the bird chakor too features prominently on most of the garments in this collection. They are embellished with ghungroos, shells, mirror and moti work, lace embroidery, ari work and bulbous tassles that look like genda phool. Flowers are something that Karan often uses in his creations. He is obsessed with them, he says. That explains why the room, with his displays, is lined with orange and yellow marigold, and red roses. My store in Shahpur Jat (Delhi) has to have flowers. Or my team knows I am not happy. It is a way of bringing Nature into work, smiles the 27-year-old.With this line, Karan forays into kids wear. So now he designs for the entire family. But when Karan launched his label Torani last July, his first thought was: these are clothes for people my moms age. They had full sleeves, nothing tight-fitting or revealing. But I was wrong. Young shoppers are not trying to look sexy. They are looking to find their roots and are happy to be close to their heritage and culture, says Karan."
2019-11-19,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/gastric-digestive-issues-ayurveda-herb-pippali-long-pepper-diabetes-6114405/,Suffering from gastric issues? Here’s how this Ayurvedic herb can help,"Many people suffer from gastric issues. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Many people suffer from gastric issues. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Many people complain about suffering from gas-related issues that can cause indigestion, heartburn and even loss of appetite  and a simple and effective remedy for the same is the regular consumption of Ayurvedic herb pippali or long pepper. Whether brewed into a healing decoction or as a digestive churan or even in a simple soup, this spicy Ayurvedic fruit is known to fight many digestive issues.Considered as one of the most important spices, pippali also has other benefits. Here are a few:Treats respiratory problemsPippali is well-known for its effectiveness against conditions affecting the respiratory tract like colds, coughs, bronchitis, and asthma, as it acts as a counter-irritant and eases inflammation. It helps fight infections by virtue of its anti-bacterial properties and also works to help thin phlegm and ease congestion. For normal colds, a pinch of crushed pippali pepper can be combined with some honey or hot water and consumed.Pippali is known to fight and protect against ulcers owing to its anti-inflammatory properties.

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Digestive issuesPippali can help in case of problems like flatulence and heartburn, as it stimulates the digestive system and boosts appetite. It is also known to fight and protect against ulcers owing to its anti-inflammatory properties.Helps relieve toothacheMix two grams of long pepper powder with rock salt, turmeric powder and mustard oil. Apply this mixture on your teeth to treat toothache.Helps treat irritable bowel syndromeTake equal quantities of long pepper powder, ginger root and Indian hemp. Take this dose thrice a day before meals to ease irritable bowel syndrome. This preparation is known to cure even severe cases of the syndrome.Help in diabetes managementAnimal studies have shown that the plant extract from pippali can help manage hyperglycemia or high blood glucose levels typical of diabetes. In a 2013-study, pippali extracts showed significant antidiabetic activity in diabetic rats  their fasting blood glucose levels had dropped significantly when tested after 30 days of treatment.As per Ayurveda, pippali as an alternative remedy is not just for diabetes but also oxidative stress that many diabetics experience. For instance, it helps maintain normal function of the liver, keeps heart problems, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory problems at bay, and also has anti-microbial properties to keep the body healthy.InsomniaPowdered pippali is given along with honey as a remedy for sleeping problems like insomnia. One could also take it with milk at bedtime to sleep better. In one study, people with stress-induced insomnia were given a herbal formulation called pippalimulyadi vati at night. This combined pippali with other herbs like ashwagandha and jatamansi. At the end of the trial, the subjects reported better sleep and showed considerable improvement in overall well-being, alertness, and fitness, scoring on both subjective and clinical markers of sleep.

A look closer at the menu and its not difficult to ascertain that most of the ingredients used are procured from the very source  Nature given the tribe doesnt believe in artificiality and modern culinary approaches.The tribe uses the local produce like lentils, ragi and other millets. Shares chef Vellu, The settlers entered through Tamil Nadu and settled in Marayoor, Kerala 42 km north of Munnar. They dress up nicely in white attire and pagdi and have deep religious belief. The root vegetables are offered as the prasad. With the permission of government he reached to people there and brought back the recipes.As the region is known for production of pepper, lemongrass, tea, cardamom, jaggery and a few other spices we found a generous hint of many of these in the dishes. The welcome drink sambaram was buttermilk spiced with lemongrass. The herb gave it a unique freshness.In the starters we liked Meen Varthad, fish smeared with ground peppers, rolled in betel leaves and then shallow fried. We loved Kootu Curry, a combination of yam and Bengal gram, tempered with mustard and coconut. Nei Choru, the ghee rice sprinkled with fried sliced onions was the star among staples. Erachi Melagu Curry was a mix of boneless mutton in spicy black pepper gravy.The taste can be overwhelming for some as the dishes are quite spicy and a bit above tangy. What we loved the best was the steamed salted rice cake named Aatu Kari Charu which had tiny chunks of mutton. Shares the chef, To prepare this, rice batter and coconut water are fermented separately, then they both are mixed together and again allowed to ferment for some more time.

I am also trying very hard to stick to my truism that praise comes from me quite miserly. I am trying not to overstate the elation and rapture I felt, as I left the restaurant after eating that meal.So before I turn into a gushing fanboy, let me talk about Akerkar himself. Somewhere in the 90s, south Mumbais beau monde started prattling about how theatre actress Jinx Akerkars son had returned from abroad armed with an engineering degree and wanted to give it all up, to do some catering.I knew the Padamsees and the da Cunhas and Jinx had dabbled with The Theatre Group, so I heard the news too. Even at that time I thought to myself, that fellow must have gumption. The next nugget the grapevine brought in was that the Akerkar boy had started a catering service from home called The Moveable Feast, which did French-European food for home parties. This was a time when catering for parties from home meant you either slaved in the kitchen along with your cooks and maids, or hired a chef for the day or ordered in from an Indian or Chinese restaurant.Just as The Movable Feast was making the citys movers drool came Just Desserts. Along with AD Singh, Rahul appropriated Parisian Bakery and Caf, an Irani eatery in Fort, for the evenings. The caf downed shutters at 6 pm, and thats when Rahul and AD brought it alive with desserts and coffee. It was insane. Bombay thronged to this place; there was music, coffee, pastries, not only in the caf but flowing out onto the pavements and on top of bonnets of cars.Just Desserts then moved over the weekends to The Ripon Club, but permissions and landlord woes shut it all down.I lived at Breach Candy then. A faux hard rock caf had opened near China Garden, and Open House, under the Kemps Corner flyover, was quite the rage for burgers and stuff. One fine day, Open House shut and Under the Over opened. It was 1992 and we had never seen a caf like that in our little lives. Rahuls personality was written all over the smart, stylish, bright, simple restaurant. Twenty-seven years later I still remember the menu. Stuffed potato skins, cheesy nachos and chicken Dijonnaise (a creamy mustard sauce with bacon bits). And the piece de rsistance, the Hungry Mans Barbecue. Half a chicken roasted and smothered in a smoky, sweet and tangy sauce. And brownies and Baileys cheesecake for dessert.Here Id like to emphasise that Id never heard of brownies or cheesecake before that, and neither had most people. By that time I had met Rahul, but by chance. I was art directing an ad campaign that was being photographed by the then young shutterbug Atul Kasbekar. Rahul (with hair), featured prominently in the photograph, all double-breasted with a hand-tied bow. Id then meet him as he bustled around in and out of the kitchen of Under the Over.I have very fond memories of that place; two stand out for me. The first a very spirited lunch with writer, author and friend Nisha da Cunha who accompanied me thinking shed have to settle for a salad, since she was vegetarian, but was pleasantly surprised. And the second, a heart-to-heart with Cyrus Broacha who had quit his first proper job that morning so that he could head to New York to study acting. Unfortunately Under the Over shut down, and my lament will always be that very little remains documented about a restaurant that changed the way we ate in Bombay.Then came Indigo. The first standalone fine-dine restaurant in the city. Rahul took over this little cottage in a bylane of Colaba and shook all five-star hotels out of their complacency. Indigo elevated the dining experience to the highest level, with design, cuisine and a focus on modern and classic-modern food. The clubby bar counter with dining areas, its terrace with a deep, brown cigar lounge. The lobster bisque with hints of fennel, Camembert souffl truffle fondue, beef carpaccio with capers, the risottos made to perfection, pork belly slow-cooked with bacon jam. This was gastronomy at its best. I had many a good meal and dozens of great boozy evenings stumbling down the wooden staircase and onto the pebbled exit, looking up at the lonely dome of the Taj at night.Then another first, Indigo Deli, which opened where Nanking once stood. Top-notch design, lots of wine, the best charcuterie and fromagerie, great sandwiches, pizzas, mains, dessert and breads. And then Neel at Tote on the Turf, the finest Awadhi food. I could go on and on, but I need to get to Qualia before I run out of ink and space.Staged with high ceilings, chainmail curtains, jars of pickled viands; you enter to the soothing crackle and pop of a wood fire that heralds warmth and energy and embraces you. Qualia is a spectacular space. Its posh, yet approachable. The staff is friendly and warm, yet proper. In his words, Rahul brings his international and Konkani tastebuds together in a chorus of strong flavours and vibrant textures.I started with the oxtail tortelletti. Little packages of pasta stuffed with tender meat in a reduced and flavourful bold meat stock with roasted onions a la a French onion soup. It was fresh and resolute. Next the steak tartare. Smarting and pickled, perfectly denatured meat served along with cured egg, pickled mushrooms, capers, chives and a slice of homemade sourdough.Coimbatore pork chops in a cider cumin glaze with white beans, poignant candied tomatoes and crunchy sage leaves. And pizza for my finale. Half with steak and eggs and the other with clams and mussels. The steak and poached egg, with mushrooms, tomatoes, aged cheddar and mozzarella, and the mollusk with black garlic, confit potato, Emmental and arugula. Not about to leave without dessert I finished with the Textures of Bitter Chocolate soil, ganache, wafers and wonderful things.Ill put it this way: there are gimmicks and mimics and then there is Rahul."

He went there on work, but his trip reminds me of my holidays there. Kashmir was troubled even then, but those were happier times. And a lot of the happiness was enveloped in the food that we ate.Since Kashmir was on my mind, my ears perked up when I heard that a new restaurant had opened up in the Jammu and Kashmir House on Prithviraj Road. I went looking for the place a few days ago and was directed to the back of the building by the guard in front. I drove up to the back lane (which leads to Rabindra Nagar and Khan Market) and was told by the friendly guard there that I could park on the side of the road (Amrita Shergill Marg), and then walk in. I did just that  and found the restaurant to my left.Mealability  the Flavor of Kashmir is quite a nice looking restaurant, with a pleasant open-air seating arrangement, too. The interiors are fairly plush, with well laid out tables. The restaurant is open from 12 noon to 11 p.m., and the menu includes everything that Kashmir is famous for  Rishta, Gushtaba, Roganjosh, Haak Saag and so on.I asked for a plate of Seekh Kababs as a starter, and then for Haak and Roganjosh. The two main dishes came with rice -- so there was a small hillock of the cereal on my table. I like Kashmirs Tabakh Maaz, but opted for the leaner Seekh Kabab. The kabab turned out to be surprisingly good. While it wasnt the melt-in-the-mouth kind, the meat was juicy, and had the fragrance of spices, especially of cloves.The beginning was promising. Until then, I had been a bit apprehensive about the food. For one, there was nobody in the restaurant while I was there (of course it was a bit early  I had reached by 12.30 p.m.). And, second, the rates are a bit high. But the Seekh Kababs were encouraging. And, as it turned out, the meal was quite nice.The Haak  a special regional greens dish that I am greatly fond of  was superb. It was tender without being mushy, was mildly bland and perfectly complemented the somewhat spicy Roganjosh. There were two large pieces of meat in the lamb meat curry. The meat was soft, and the gravy lightly flavoured with fennel seeds. A thin layer of oil in the gravy added to the taste.The food had been cooked in mustard oil, which added its own flavour to the dishes. The rice had been well cooked, too (do not scoff  your timing has to be just right for the perfect rice), and went deliciously well with the saag and the meat curry.We paid about 1,700 for this meal. But then this is not a state house canteen with subsidised rates. The Gushtaba, Rishta and Roganjosh, for instance are for 599 and the kababs for 499.But the food was very good, cooked in both the Kashmiri Pandit and Kashmiri Muslim style. The Haak, for instance, was prepared in the Pandit way  with a pinch of hing in mustard oil, and topped with green chillies. All in all, it was a nice meal indeed -- and worth a second visit. Kashmir is going to stay with me.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Hes busy with his weekend ritual of preparing a full-course lunch for the family. The kitchen is a reflection of his personality  meditative and calm.Its a blessing to have a husband who loves to cook more than you. The positive vibes and love he puts into the food reflect in the delicious meal he prepares. We relish all his items, especially crispy variations in dosa and puliyogare, says Shoba C, his wife.R Padmanabhan,retired senior assistant sales managerBharat works in Mumbai and gets to visit his family only during the weekends. My wife stocks up the requirements for the preparation and the kitchen is all mine. By cooking, Im able to equally commit and take part in the welfare of the household. One does not get that satisfaction just from earning money for the family but also spending quality time, says Bharat while making lemon-sized balls out of vada batter.He has been cooking for almost 25 years. While growing up, cooking was a necessity for him and his four siblings because his parents used to be away at work. Recipes were learnt from observation. It eventually developed into passion and experimentation.From college to work, there have been several commitments at various stages. I always find time for cooking because it gives me a high and sense of liberation. Im attempting to make different temple cuisines out of interest. Saying that youre busy is not an excuse anymore, try cooking once and youll know how much it helps with your management skills, he shares, adding that colleagues back in Mumbai enjoy his home-cooked food.Kovil DosaIngredientsRaw rice: 1 cup, Black urad dal: 1/3 cup, Black pepper powder: 1 tsp, Dry ginger powder: 1/2 tsp, Curry leaves: as required, Ghee: half a cup, Water as required to mix the batterMethodlWash and soak raw rice for at least two-and-a-half hours l Drain water completely and spread it on a cloth towel l Keep it under the shade and allow to dry for 40 minutes l The rice should be just dry enough for you to feel the moisture in the rice l Grind this rice into a rava consistency and keep it aside l Wash and soak whole black urad dal for three hours, drain water and grind into a smooth paste by adding few tablespoons of water l Dont throw away the husk, you can grind them as well l Now add half a cup of water to the rice flour and mix it welll Then, add the urad dal batter and mix well l You can add water as required l Thick consistency is good for this dosa l Add salt as required, dry ginger powder, black pepper powder and curry leaves and mix it well l Heat the tawa once hot and pour a ladle full of batter and spread ghee around the edges.

He likes innovating, playing with ingredients, and is a perfectionist with following a particular method of preparation. His enthusiasm defies his age. He started cooking under his elder sisters guidance from the age of 16. The desire for perfection and feeding people has only expanded with age. Hes 73 now.Although the women of the house predominantly handle the cooking department, I often like contributing my share. My wife and I work on our timings and cook on alternate days. There are a few delicacies that Im known for in the family. Nobody but I can cook them with efficiency. One need not prepare delicious meals to be a good cook. Even basics help, says Padmanabhan who made pongal and bajji for the day's breakfast.K Anand Bhattar, priestHis level of dedication extends beyond cooking to the cleaning process. No item goes waste. I like arranging things in a certain way. The environment while cooking has to be serene and organised. We grew up in a generation that never relied on outside food. Everything would be made from scratch at home. Ive passed on the cooking skills to my children to take care of their basic needs. My spicy chutneys are peoples favourite. I also like trying out different kinds of kuzhambu and traditional items, he says. To date, he prepares an array of sweets and savouries for festivals and sends it across to relatives.Nenthram pazham raceIngredientsNenthram: 3 (a variety of banana), Jaggery: 1/4 cup, Red chilli: 5, Pepper: 10, Channa dal: two tsp, Dhaniya: 1 tsp, Urad dal: 1 tsp, Aesofittida: 1 pinch, Tamarind: 1 amla size, Salt to taste, Turmeric, Grated coconut: 2 tsp,Methodl Add salt and turmeric to the tamarind water and boil the nenthrams l Take a pan, add oil, chilli, pepper saut and grated coconut l After cooling, grind to a thick paste with water l Add jaggery to nenthram l Add everything and boil l Garnish with mustard and curry leaves in coconut oil.Hymns and ladlesHymns and prayer chanting fill Anands kitchen. Its a delight to watch him slice merakai (Chow Chow) effortlessly, and saut it in a pan with urad dal. A simple vegetable curry for the day is ready. He picked up the art from his father and grandfather who were excellent cooks.My grandfather was a caterer. Id accompany him for marriages and help in laying banana leaves. In one such instance, at the age of 15, I had to make kaju cakes since the head cook fell sick at the last minute. It turned out to be tasty and people loved it. Since then, Ive been equipped to cook in bulk for even 1,000 people, says Anand, who loves to read about ancient cooking practices and regional cooking. He takes turns with his wife for cooking depending on his work timings. Both his kids are also trained to cook.Anands job demands him to travel across the world for different kinds of rituals. Once in Rajasthan, we were gearing up for the days puja. The cook, who had to come, met with an accident and I had to take over. I had to cook in the freezing temperatures without even tasting the food. One needs to identify everything with smell. Its a different kind of experience that not many will get, points out the priest.Anand believes in educating his children on the consumption of organic and healthy vegetables. They never order or buy from outside. Its the homely familiarity that he has passed on to his children.BisibelabathIngredientsRice: 1 kg, Tur dal: 300 gram, Turmeric: 1/4 tsp, Red chilli: 5-8, Coriander seeds: 50 g, Black pepper: two tsp, Cumin seeds: 2 tsp, Hing (Asafoetida): 20 g, Fenugreek: 30 g, Kadala: 50, Urad dal: 50, Mustard seeds: 20 g, Jaggery: 50 g, Tamarind: 50 g, Gingelly oil: 100 ml, Ghee: four tsp, Salt (rock salt), to taste, Green chilli: 2, Salt: 80 g, Vegetables: (100 g each), Brinjal, Ladys finger, Chow Chow, Capsicum, Small onion (if need be), Dry coconut, grated: 100 g, Curry leaves, Coriander to garnishMethodl Boil tur dal, add turmeric and keep asidel Boil rice, mash and keep it asideFor the powderl Pour oil in a panl Add coriander seeds, red chilli, pepper, fenugreek, curry leaves  saut and grind itl If you need more spice then add bay leaves, cardamom (4), anise (2), fennel (4tsp), add jaggeryl Roast all the ingredients, grind and keep it asideFinal mixingl Pour oil, mustard seeds, red chilli, urad dal and channa dall Add capsicum and onion separatelyl Add the other vegetablesl Salt 80 gl Keep it on simmer and close the lidl Add tamarind waterl Add the roasted powder and boil them all togetherl Now add the boiled tur dal and mix them all to rice.

In a time when both men and women are on par in everything, why attach pride to the aspect of cooking alone? Why does it become special when a man cooks for his wife while the latter does it every day?, asks Jagannath R who has too many questions about the kitchen conundrum.Jagannath grew up in Kolkata in a household where everybody cooked. It was a family affair. He forayed into cooking at the age of six under his parents supervision. It helped him during his scouts and guides camps when they were asked to make a basic meal for survival without the luxury of having appliances or ingredients.I spent most of the time in boarding school, college, and now I have a travelling job. During college days in Chennai, my sister and I would cook to unwind from everyday stress. I do the same now. After long hours at work, we find it to be therapeutic, he says.A good set of knives, minimal cooking appliances, and western music in the background  this is the ideal mood for Jagannath to get him cooking. He loves having friends over for parties frequently and likes to prepare multi- cuisine delicacies. Warm appreciation and motivation from friends make him want to cook more food. Im proud that I can cook anything and dont have to be dependent on anyone. My friends envy me for that, he shares.Spaghetti with tomato sauceIngredientsStore-bought spaghetti: 200 gram, Garlic: 10 cloves (finely chopped), Onion: 2 medium size (finely chopped), Tomatoes: 2 medium size, Olive oil, Salt to taste, Oregano to taste, Chilli flakes to taste, Thyme to taste, Fresh/dried basil to taste, Parmesan cheese: 30 gMethodl In a deep vessel, add water and bring it to a boil l Add salt to the water.

From helping his mother out in the kitchen to learning the nuances and tricks of cooking from his aunts, hes come a long way to preparing a meal for an entire household.My father was a flawless cook. Even if its a basic flat beans curry, hed do it with perfection. I admired and liked his cooking better. Hed make roti for me and my grandfather on the terrace under the moon, just the traditional way. He died when I was young and I decided to carry forward his memories through cooking, reminisces Muhilann.The budding architect grew up in a big household. To help his aunt, hed wake up early morning and get started with the days cooking. During his childhood hed leave for school only after washing and drying the used vessels. I appreciate criticism. But if they touch my nerve by finding faults often then Id deliberately prepare it in a way they dont like. Im mischievous in the kitchen, says Muhilann.During his college days in Ooty, Muhilann used to cook and have his friends over whenever they felt homesick. There was always food in his room. My mother used to visit me with traditional sweets and candies. Everybody in college loved it so much that I opened a stall and made money out of it. I also used cooking as an incentive to study better. Whenever I scored low marks, Id make a demand for a kitchen appliance and when my mother promised to buy it for me then I would clear the paper with good scores. Its a lifelong skill that I carry everywhere to make people happy, he says.Vennai puttuIngredientsRice: 1 cup, Bengal gram dal: 50 gram,Jaggery: 2 cup, Coconut:  shell, Cardamom: 5 nosMethodl Soak rice for two hours, finely grind it to a batter consistency l Boil four glasses of water and add Bengal gram dal l Once Bengal gram dal is half cooked, then add rice batter to itl Stir it well until the rice batter is cooked.

Talking about their experience with CE, the two say that they have learned a lot about running a business, sitting in their shop with fabric for all kinds of events.How did you get into the industry?Idris: I grew up in a family where designing only meant being a tailor. Once I got into this, I started taking my family members to various shops and telling them that all the clothes they see are designed by someone. Thats how they got used to the idea of me being a designer. I studied graphic designing and then when I found it was too monotonous, I took up an allied field. My roommate in Pearl Academy college was also into the field. I helped him with his projects. That is when I realised that I enjoy it.Rishab (L) and Idris (R)studied together in college Ashwin PrasathRishabh: I am an Economics graduate. I come from a family that is related to fabrics. My father is into the fabric business. I realised I am interested in it. I joined Pearl Academy the same year as Idris. Both of us cracked the entrance.What prompted you to choose mens fashion?Rishabh: Our course structure at Pearl Academy was purely directed towards womens fashion. But, we always tried to look beyond this. Our interest was in mens fashion. When there was an assignment for mens fashion, we were the first ones to show interest in the class. We did think of taking mens fashion as a carrier, but did not pursue that idea back then because we knew we were too immature to take decisions.How did you both come together and start this brand?Rishabh: One day, we met again in Chennai when we were working with our respective designers. We thought it would be a good idea with the experience we have. We sat for months together. We planned a budget to start a boutique. In the process, we learned that we could start a boutique at home and the fabric needs to be of good quality. We started as freelancers, initially. We started taking our clients to the fabric shops so that they get an idea of the fabric quality apart from actually drawing the designs for them. This went on for 18 months, after which we started a boutique. At the end of 2016, we opened our shop. We found it difficult to pay carpenters and other daily wage workers because of demonetisation as we could not tender cash. But, we managed, and started our business. We shifted to the current location in July 2018.Do you see a market formens fashion in Chennai?Idris: It is a myth that only women want to look fashionable. Men also want to style themselves. It is just that they do not always come out and say it. They also need some guidance. They do not always understand skin tones and fabric colours. Veshti and shirt are not the only fashion for men. They watch movies and enjoy the fashion, but they will not experiment. Now, we are slowly making them comfortable. We are playing with shades subtly to make them comfortable yet making them look stylish. Due to movies, people are changing.How do you both unwind?Idris: We make sure one person is in at all times. If one is busy with domestic commitments, the other is one at work. Apart from our work, I like to go out to the gym and I am also a model. Rishabh enjoys music. He plays the guitar. He loves to do hip-hop. We watch movies with together, with our families and our separate friends.What are the must-haves in a mans wadrobe?Rishabh: One must have whites and blues in shirts. One trouser should be white. Eighty per cent of men do not have this. A perfectly suited and fitted classic suit is a must in the wardrobe, and one set of traditional clothing.Idris: They should have a casual bandi and mustard trousers.What are your personal style choices? Any favourite desingers?Rishabh: Indian wear and bandhgalas are my favourite. We are both fans of Sabyasachi.Idris: My travel jacket goes with me everywhere."
2019-11-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jharkhand-elections-mandal-dam-project-gets-forest-clearance-8-villages-face-threat-of-displacement-6141883/,"Jharkhand elections: Mandal Dam project gets forest clearance, 8 villages face threat of displacement","At Kutku village in Garhwa district. (Express) At Kutku village in Garhwa district. (Express)More than 100 tribal families from Bhajna and Kutku villages of Garhwa district leave their villages each year for the upper reaches of the forest to survive during rainy season. From a distance, they see their houses washed away, and poles erected to support their homes. If the wood is not wet, they manage to prepare rice meals, and return home once the water recedes, knowing well that they will have to repeat the drill the next year.The villagers have been compelled to leave their lands each year since 1987, when the dam walls were constructed, as the water swells up during rains at the stalled Mandal Dam Project, also known as the North Koel Reservoir. However, they now face complete displacement.Eight villages, including Kutku and Bhajna, will be completely submerged, affecting more than 3,000 tribals, once the project, which recently received clearances from the Union forest ministry and the state forest department, is fully functional.The dam spanning Garhwa and Latehar districts was conceived in 1970 by the erstwhile Bihar government on Koel  a tributary of river Son  with an aim to boost irrigation in Gaya, Aurangabad and Palamu (now in Jharkhand), and to generate 24 MW electricity. Construction began in 1972 but the project was stalled in 1993 after the Bihar forest department raised concerns.Also Read | Jharkhand elections: In BJP manifesto, job for each BPL family, cellphone for farmersAfter the project was revived in 2016, it was agreed to restrict the water capacity at a level lower to reduce submergence of villages. At his first rally ahead of Assembly polls in Jharkhand, PM Narendra Modi, who laid the foundation stone for the project earlier in January, sought a mandate to continue development work under the state BJP government while the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha promised to reconsider the project if elected to power.The eight villages are under Daltonganj constituency, which will go to the polls in the first phase on November 30. The BJP has fielded Alok Chaurasia against Congress candidate K N Tripathi.Far from the heated political rallies in poll-bound Jharkhand, through the circuitous route to Kutku via Daltonganj-Chainpur-Ramkanda-Bhandaria-Madhgari after crossing a river, The Indian Express spoke to a few villagers on their concerns over the dam.Also Read | Jharkhand election: Tough contest between Congress, BJP in Daltonganj; Modi deciding factorI am married for the last 12 years and every year we make plans to deal with it. We are not able to construct our houses fearing submergence We somehow manage it thinking that after the rains we will still have our lands with us. But now we will be completely displaced. I have not seen any political leader coming to us to discuss our problems, said Anita Minz, a tribal Christian at Kutku village.Ramdhani Bhuiyan, in his mid 40s, said his house is submerged under 20 feet water every rainy season. We build everything from scratch every year because from October to February we reap mustard oil. This sustains our family. Once the dam is constructed we will be left with nothing, he said.While some such as Bhuiyan and Minz are sustained by the fertile land, many seek employment as daily wage labourers in the state and outside.Pratap Tirkey, who claimed to be a local activist delivering rice, salt and kerosene under the public distribution system to these villages, said most of the families still use wood for cooking. The government says they will give Rs 15 lakh to each family, and talks have been going on for long, but they need to be given land, a place to live and hospital facilities Just giving money to the tribals, who have no idea of managing money, will lead to devastation, he said.Dr D S Srivastav, secretary of the Nature Conservation Society that prepared and submitted a wildlife management plan for the project before the 43rd Standing Committee meeting of the National Board of Wildlife, said that villagers must be rehabilitated before construction begins. Construction should not be started till the villagers are re-settled outside of Palamu Tiger Reserve area The conflict with wildlife will be extreme because of regular presence of elephants, tigers, leopards and other wildlife in the vicinity, he said.However, Aftab Alam, the Executive Engineer of the Water Resources Department, overseeing the revival of the dam, said all displaced families had received compensation three decades ago under the Bihar governments rehabilitation policy.However, for smooth implementation, we have identified around 800 families who currently stay in the villages and will give them one-time financial package comprising Rs 117 crore, Alam said, adding that, The dam will facilitate irrigation and various other projects like fishing, tourism will be started.

2019-11-28,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/chennais-mkc-serves-vada-pav-and-other-regional-street-food-in-plush-settings/article30107514.ece,Chennai’s MKC serves vada pav and other regional street food in plush settings,"There is an odd sort of dissonance to being seated in a clearly upscale restaurant, on the upper floor of The Westin, and looking at a menu full of street food.A menu, moreover, designed to look like a newspaper, in an obviously painstaking attempt to appear street. But that is how Madras Kitchen Company (or MKC, as the team likes to call it) wants it to be. With a bar and lounge right next door, they even encourage you to get a cocktail with your vada pav.The good thing about said vada pav is that it comes smeared with Kolhapuri thecha (a Maharashtrian condiment of finely ground green chillies) and a sizeable, single, deep-fried green chilli, and would taste appealingly familiar to anyone who has spent some time in Mumbai. The not-so-good thing is that, it is just vada pav, but costs almost 200 per plate. And if Kolhapuri thecha is not hot enough to make your eyes water, it cant be a clear winner.But then, the menu is all about simple foods that tap into nostalgia, in that part of you that yearns for comfort. Take, for instance, the ghee-tossed podi idli served with vegetable kurma. A brightly-coloured tiffin carrier contains eight little pieces of idli in one tier, and steaming kurma in another. You might think that less than satisfying, but wait till you pop a fluffy little idli, redolent with ghee, into your mouth. As indulgent as those little bites feel, the mild and warm kurma is both filling and comforting.After this, we take a trip North with some chole kulcha. Surprisingly, it is the bread that steals the show in this particular performance, outshining even the single, large, dripping-with-mustard chilli that decorates the dish. The kulcha is thick, soft, and almost yellow in colour, with a generous smattering of coriander and a taste that holds its own for diners who find comfort in munchable breads. Though it accompanies a bowl of aloo chole, it is the latter that plays the role of sidekick: understated and only slightly spicy, but a pleasant enough companion.Not all breads are that good, however. MKCs menu has an entire section dedicated to baos, dumplings and wraps, among which the pan-seared barbecue chicken bao looks promising. On page. On the table, it ends up being a disappointment: the bread is more than a tad too sweet and the filling is just not enough. Eating it, for the most part, feels like biting into something soft but empty.The tofu open bao with edamame, on the other hand, is more substantial, even if the taste has nothing memorable about it.And then there is the karimeen polichathu, which we are informed is marinated for 24 hours with coconut and kokum, then grilled, and then steamed. The result is a fish that is rich, flavourful and almost smoky  the kind you wouldnt mind picking apart with your bare fingers.Madras Kitchen Company @ Level 1, 154, Westin Chennai, 100 Feet Road, VelacheryLevel 1, 154, Westin Chennai, 100 Feet Road, VelacheryHits: Butter chicken, podi idli with kurmaButter chicken, podi idli with kurma Misses: Chicken barbecue bao, vada pavChicken barbecue bao, vada pav Meal for two: 1,0001,000 66205547Another enjoyable dish is the butter chicken, which is thankfully not sweet at all. Instead, it tastes of semi-roasted smokiness and mildly teasing spices, that fall just short of red heat. Beyond doubt one of the more authentic butter chickens I have tasted in this city.However, the one thing MKC claims to be really proud of is its hot chocolate, made with a single-estate Earth Loaf dark chocolate bar. It is thick, it is not too sweet, it is certainly indulgent. Not a bad note to end a meal on."
2019-11-28,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/from-amaranth-to-water-spinach-locally-grown-produce-make-a-comeback/article30107334.ece,"From amaranth to water spinach, locally-grown produce make a comeback","Are you fed up of the rainbow on your plate? The spectrum of coloured bell peppers, zucchini, broccoli and red cabbage? It could also be the ruby-red lola rosa lettuce or napa cabbage in your salad, sprinkled generously with rucola leaves or the dark-hued micro greens of purple basil, red cabbage or beetroot if you live in a metro.We all know that colourful fruits and vegetables are packed with antioxidants; but the rainbow garnish leaves a big carbon footprint in its wake. In fact, the food on our plate is much more than the colours, it can become an instrument for climate change reversal if taken seriously.Imagine the supply chain of such produce: procuring, packaging and transporting them involves using up a lot of energy and generates immense plastic waste. This produce is grown all year round, using up a lot of water that could instead be used for the main food crops; it also translates into disproportionate use of resources and fertilisers and pesticides. The point to ponder here is whether it is the diners who want to see such food on their plates, or if it is lack of creativity and willingness by restaurants.Think localThankfully, there is a new wave of awareness amongst chefs, with some of them taking initiatives to bring about a change. On the other hand, diners and travellers have also begun appreciating local cuisines.Vegetables and greens such as water spinach, guwar phali (cluster beans), kachri (wild cucumber), chaulai (amaranth), moringa and herbs like jakhia (dog mustard), jimbu (allium), timur (red pepper) or stinging nettles are finding their moment in the sun, with chefs procuring them from local markets; some grow them in their own vegetable and herb gardens. This is a shift that may become a game-changer in an industry that feeds the market-led economy.On the tableAmong the boutique hotels, Narendra Bhawan in Bikaner has a range of regional curries and pickles like guwar kachri ki subzi, kaachra ki subzi, chaurai ka saag, aloe vera ki subzi with bajre ki roti and chana kadhi that are winning guests over for their novelty factor. The hotel sources ingredients from the local vegetable markets and has been growing some of them in the kitchen garden as well.At JW Marriott Mussoorie Walnut Grove Resort & Spa chefs use foraged stinging nettle to make kandali ka saag and use jakhia to temper several dishes. Given Uttarakhands rich flora of wild edible greens, the ingredients available to the hotel are diverse. They use pahadi kheera and pahadi palak, apart from the local millets to create Garhwali meals.Even Vivanta Guwahati has a special Assamese breakfast buffet and seasonal Assamese thalis that make extensive use of local greens and vegetables, apart from the local fish, shrimp and pork. Local herbs and vegetables like elephant apple, chayote squash, bamboo shoots, fiddlehead ferns, ash gourd, cilantro, skunkvine etc figure prominently in their thalis.Restaurants in the metros follow close on the heels of their counterparts in resort towns. Kitchens now focus on sourcing ingredients directly from local farmers, and chefs take great interest in introducing diners to native produce.Chef Thomas Zacharias at The Bombay Canteen has been actively promoting native produce. He successfully uses the seasonal moras bhaji foraged from the mangroves in Vasai to make vada and a salad.Under The Neem in Gurugram, has a menu based on whatever grows in their kitchen garden. While their mezze platter uses brinjals and leafy greens, dishes like jowar paratha with fresh radish and assorted greens, and the vegetarian mung bean omelette, accommodate seasonal greens like mustard, amaranth and dill.VietNom in Gurugram has an eclectic Vietnamese menu, featuring herbs and greens sourced from local markets and farmers. Chef Vaibhav Bhardwaj uses locally sourced water spinach or morning glory as a side dish for grilled salmon.Native ingredients are also being reinterpreted in interesting ways by several chefs. Take for instance, chef Manish Mehrotra of Indian Accent, Delhi, who has been using vegetables like kundru (ivy gourd) and lauki (bottle gourd) in innovative ways in his salads and curries. Similarly, an innovative bathua and ricotta ravioli has been a hit at Manu Chandras Toast & Tonic in Bengaluru.Sridevi Jasti from Vibrant Living Foods in Hyderabad, caters meal boxes using moringa greens in hummus and dips, gongura leaves in chutneys and salads and purslane in raita.While this new wave of innovation is restricted to fine-dining restaurants for now, it is a welcome step into making a dovetail effect that is sure to trickle down to the masses. Small steps count."
2019-11-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/champaran-meat-curry-gopal-kushwala/article30113688.ece,Champaran meat curry now shines as a regional delicacy across Bihar,"At Old Champaran Meat House in Patna, the crowd waiting is restless. What keeps them engaged, however, is a dramatic kitchen scene. A line of whistling earthen pots sits atop gas burners, with jets of steam gushing out of small openings on their lids. The mouths of the handis or ahuna are sealed with kneaded flour, and an aroma of mutton stewing in mustard oil floats over the expectant diners.This scene unfolds regularly across Patna, where the popularity of Champaran meat curry, served in takeaway handis, rages. The curry from the nondescript town of Champaran, from where Gandhi famously started the Satyagraha, has recently been making it to the tables of the rich and famous. Gopal Khushwaha, who claims to be its originator in current recipe and form, says it has even made it to the banquet at Raisina Hill.An innocent query about the dish from a client inspired Gopal to trace the dish to Ghorasahan, a small village 30 kms from Motihari on the Bihar-Nepal border. The dish has its origins in Nepal, where it is cooked in open handis. On the Indian side, it is cooked covered, but stirred often. Mutton is marinated in mustard oil mixed with onions, a paste of ginger and spice powders, and cooked slowly over a low flame.Gopal says the goodness of the curry depends on the quality of mutton, or more precisely, the type of goat used. Meat of a hilly goat will taste different from one that has grazed on grass; meat of a goat fed on herbs is dark, as is the case of mutton in Champaran. The cooking time for a goat weighing six to seven kilograms is about an hour, during which the pot has to be tossed six to seven times.Mohan Thakur, a food connoisseur from Sitamarhi in Bihar, says that migrant workers from the villages of North Bihar brought the dish to Patna. It was not sophisticated food made in the kitchens of zamindars, and thats why it had not received the kind of exposure it has now found. The farm hands or labourers generally marinated the mutton with whatever spices they had, mixing all ingredients with the meat and cooking it over slow charcoal or wood fire. It is a hearty, thick and strong curry, not subtle but forceful.Babloo Roy recalls eating it in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, prepared on wood fire. He remembers an earthy taste that is absent when the dish is cooked in a pressure cooker on a gas stove. After cooking on high heat, it is left to stew for a long time on doused charcoal. This slow cooking tenderises the meat and allows it to soak in the spices.Puja Sahu, who runs Potbelly, a chain of Bihari cuisine restaurants in New Delhi, says the ahuna mutton is marinated in a mix of ghee and mustard oil, with whole spices, along with onions, garlic and ginger paste. The cooking pot is sealed and tossed frequently in the one-hour cooking time.In a richer version, it was called batlohi mutton and cooked in a bell metal pot, much the same way, but enriched with spices and dry fruits. But even as a discussion on its origin and evolution rages, it is evident that the Champaran curry began as the poor mans party fare."

2019-11-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-its-alkaline-it-must-be-khaar/article30116273.ece,If it’s alkaline it must be khaar,"Such a humble dish, khaar, yet so addictive, and a defining one for the Assamese. Simple to make, with ingredients that are easily available around the house, khaars had with rice. It has a unique taste that is neither salty nor umami, but alkaline.Both the dish and the taste are called khaar. This taste comes through the addition of a particular ingredient. This khaar agent is of two different kinds, which I would call the traditional and the contemporary. And thereby hangs the tale of khaar in my home.From father to kidsMy father worked in different countries, my mother set up home in all of them, with us siblings in tow. And though schools, textbooks and friends changed, the one constant was the food that ma churned out. True, the local cuisine invariably left its mark on her cooking. But there was rice, perhaps a fish or meat curry, dal and a vegetable for many of the meals.My father, though, was a khaar aficionado. Having grown up in a Sattra, a monastery-like religious and socio-cultural institution associated with the Vaishnavites, he was used to eating it, and he passed on his love of khaar to us, the children. I remember the cavernous kitchens of the Sattra, with its earthen wood-fired fireplaces and mud-wiped floors, where something or the other always seemed to be bubbling in the vast iron kerahis.On a normal day, there would be around 30 people for a meal, many more during festivals. There were professional cooks, baputis, who did both the daily and the ceremonial cooking, though I also remember my grandmother going in to cook sometimes. She would discard the mekhela sador she was wearing, and after a bath, don one of the two red saris that were kept specifically in the kitchen for her. This was customary.A lot of fishIt was the taste of the khaar she cooked that had my father hooked for life. Which was strange, because there were so many other things that those kitchens turned out  fish fresh from the pond; turtle meat curry; pigeon with pepper; duck cooked with ash gourd. Venison, too, and, of course, lots of goat meat, but no chicken. The turtle gave me a severe allergy, but I relished the fish, which my cousins hauled out of the ponds with shouts of joy and triumph. They tasted of the pond and the earth, and I loved them.But it was the khaar that pita, my father, missed the most.Craving itThe problem was that ma did not come from a khaar-eating family. She was from Dhubri, where the food traditions are different. The food that came out of my Dhubri grandmothers kitchen was what a Brahmin widow would be allowed to eat those days. Vegetarian, of course, with no hint of onion or garlic. But she treated us, her grandchildren, to delicious discs of crunchily fried sesame held together with rice flour, and payox, kheer, that was sweetened with nolen gur and served in stone bowls. There was a separate non-veg kitchen too where meats and fish were cooked. No chicken though  that was taboo.And never khaar. Dhubri shares many traditions, including culinary ones, with neighbouring Bengal and Bangladesh. And khaar is something that is not seen there. One encounters khaar in a variety of forms as one goes more to the east. Some variants of this dish are popular among the ethnic communities of the hill states of the Northeast. Mizorams bai, for instance, though more watery than khaar, has a tinge of the same taste. Alkaline.Ma learnt how to make it quickly enough. Its not difficult. Like most Assamese fare, it does not require spices. It was that other Assamese dish, the tangy fish tenga, that she never mastered. I fell in love with it after my marriage to a family from eastern Assam, where it is a staple. And when I went back to mas kitchen on visits, I cooked tenga for them. But they never acquired a taste for it.Burnt flavourTraditionally, the agent that brings in the khaar taste is made by burning the peels of a particular kind of banana, and then distilling the ashes. But the faster way is to use baking soda. There is perhaps a slight difference in taste, but I dont really notice it. But it mattered to pita. Wherever he was, he would experiment with different kinds of bananas found in those places, roasting the peels to make khaar. But it never really worked, and he had to be content with baking soda.Pitas search for the perfect khaar, though, does have a happy ending. These days, bottled essence of banana peel ash is available commercially. Ma would use that to make khaar, and he would relish it as much as he had in his Sattra dining hall. He also loved the khaar in my marital home, my mother-in-law being an expert khaar maker.Her specialities were the delicious tenga she made with elephant apple and fish, and the khaar, always for lunch, never dinner, made with the leftover prasad of chickpeas and mung after a puja in the house. Khaar and tenga, however could never be served together. Her khaar was something I looked forward to, and though I make it myself now, that flavour that came from the touch of her hands is missing.Sunday recipeOmita (green papaya) khaarFor kol khaar (khaar made of banana peels)Use the peel of the bheem kol banana. Sun-dry the peel, then roast on flame. Dunk it overnight in a bowl of about two cups of water and strain. Discard the peel and ash, keep the water. Half a cupful of the freshly made liquid is needed. Or, use bicarbonate of soda  half a tsp.IngredientsGreen papaya  peeled, with the seeds removed and cut into medium-sized cubes (about two cups)Grated ginger  approx a tspTwo fresh green chilliesSalt to tasteMustard seeds  approx a tspMustard oil  two tbsp, and a little extra to drizzle over the finished khaarWater  one cupMethod1. In a kerahi, heat the oil till it is smoking. Throw in the mustard seeds, lower the flame and cover till the crackling stops.2. Add the green chillies and the papaya. Stir, add the ginger and salt.3. Add enough water to cover the papaya cubes.4. Sprinkle the soda, and cook till the water decreases and the papaya is a soft mush.5. Sprinkle raw mustard oil before serving for added pungency.The writer is a novelist, short story writer and translator whose latest book is A Full Nights Thievery."
2019-11-30,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/finding-khorika/article30123914.ece,Finding khorika,"I feel sorry for the poor pig. Its nothing personal, I want to tell them. But when it comes to pork, alls fair in love, war  and food. In Delhi, pork is usually served in Chinese eateries, and in some high-end restaurants. But its not easy to find regional dishes such as Goas Sorpotel or the Coorgi Pandhi Curry.One of the first to offer a variety of pork dishes was a restaurant in Connaught Place called Mosaic, which shut many years ago, and later took some of its dishes to the YWCA Kitchen on Parliament Street. But thats been closed for a while, too.To cut a long story short, it was my fondness for pork that propelled me towards a restaurant called Mustard Seed. As it happened, a friend had sent a message saying that the restaurant at Assam Bhavan (called Baankaahi) had moved to the Uphaar Cinema Market. I was looking for that on the internet when I suddenly came across an eatery called Mustard Seed in the same market. To my surprise, it turned out to be the very same. The people who ran Baankaahi had now opened this. Whats more, they were the very people who were behind Mosaic and the YWCA Kitchen. To top it, a group of old friends of mine had all gathered there one afternoon for lunch  and said they'd had a great meal. So, that very evening, I found myself at Mustard Seed (011-40072565 and 9999459462).The menu has various kinds of dishes from across the country and elsewhere and quite a few pork preparations. The starters include East Indias much loved Mochar Chop (prepared with banana flower florets, 325), Thai Fish Cake (400 for full, 250 for half) and Pork Khorika (a variation of Pork Satay, 400 for full and 250 for half).Among the entrees are Kosha Mangsho (475/300), Alkas Mutton Curry (a Bhagalpur speciality, 475/300), Pork Dos Noing (Khasi pork with black sesame gravy, 400/250), Puducherry Chicken Curry (475/300), Dahi Fish (350/200), Seafood Sizzler (prawns, squids, fish, corn, salad, garlic mashed potatoes, 600) and Pork Sorpotel (500). The tea plantation specials include Shepherds Pie (475), Chicken Potpie (425), Fish and Chips (500), Vegetable Cutlets (350) and Vegetable Potpie (240).We were in a hurry and did not want an elaborate meal. So we asked for an Assamese non-vegetarian thali (450), a dish called Paas Torkari (a mix of five vegetables, 325), Fried Pork (345/250 for half) and Cocktail Mutton Chops (400/250).The pork came first, and was superb. It consisted of thin slices (with fat on the side, I was happy to note) fried with onions and bell peppers and what the menu described as a special sauce. I loved its piquant taste, complemented by the sweet touch of the onions and peppers. The mutton chops consisted of minced meat that had been crumbed and fried to perfection.The thali was as grand as it looked: rice at the centre, with a fried brinjal (beguni), a bowl of Mung Dal, Posto-Aloo (poppy seeds with potatoes), Tenga Fish (an Assamese preparation), khar (a digestive), Aloo Pitkia (mashed potatoes) and Gur Ka Kheer. The Paas Torkari was a delicious mix of carrots, beans, spinach, capsicum and potatoes, cooked lightly with just a sprinkling of spices.I love Aloo Pitikaand this had been nicely sharpened with mustard oil and green chillies. The dal  roasted and then cooked with peaswas superb. I didnt have the fish, but was told it was nice and tangy. And the kheer was finger licking good.Mindful of a friends comment that I seldom have a word of criticism, I thought hard about what I didnt like. I realised what it was. In front of me was a wall TV, and on it was an anchor who gives me nightmares. Thats one way of curbing ones appetite!But it was truly a great meal. And I felt as if I had found an old friend.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

This ensures that you achieve satiety and stay fuller and stuffed for longer. Controlling your hunger pangs is one of the key ways to moderate your eating habits and keep a check on the weight.

2019-12-09,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/dec/08/going-full-stem-2072018.html,Going full stem,"Kaushani Banerjee ByExpress News ServiceCall it satavar, shatavari, shatamull or shatawari, asparagus is the new vegetarian staple that is being dished out across restaurants and fine-dining establishments. From asparagus pastry, asparagus risotto to asparagus pizzathis vegetable, which was earlier completely unfamiliar to the Indian palate, is here to stay in our menus.With new dietary trends and unique distinctive and cultural diversity, asparagus is now used in various Indian cuisines. Places like Ooty, Himachal Pradesh, Northeastern regions are producing local asparagus aiding in its increasing availability. Dishes like Asparagus Poriyal, Chorchori and mix vegetables form a large part of healthy cooking and incorporate the vegetable. The blend of Indian spices garam masala and mustard add to the taste of the dishes and is moreover a substitute to beans in many of the dishes, says Sanjeev Ranjan, Executive Chef, Kathmandu Marriott Hotel.PHOTO BY SHEILA JOY ON UNSPLASHOften mistaken as a type of beans, asparagus can be identified as having stout stems with much-branched feathery heads. Interestingly, its Hindi moniker shatavari roughly translates to having hundred roots and in Ayurveda texts it has been used for centuries for balancing pitta and vata. It gives a boost to immune system, elevates energy levels and strength. Regardless of its medicinal value, asparagus is largely considered a western vegetable.Most popularly, it is served as a side with grilled steak. On how Indian cuisine has adopted the veggie, Shivneet Pohoja, Executive Chef, ITC Grand Bharat, Gurugram, says, It is a unique ingredient when it comes to Indian cuisine. While it has been in use for centuries in our food for medicinal purposes, asparagus as most of the world knows it today, certainly does not find place in heirloom Indian recipes. This does not mean that new recipes cannot be written.More farmers are growing asparagus indigenously across certain climatically suitable parts of India. Chefs are more adventurous than before, willing to try non-traditional ingredients in their native cooking styles. All of these factors have made asparagus a global ingredient. The day is not far where it would be as common as the humble bhindi.Mostly served as sauted or lightly fried, asparaguss bitter and sweet taste has a cooling effect on the digestive system, and its unctuous nature makes it a great support for anyone looking for a nourishing effect to their meal. As a general rule, care must be taken not to cook asparagus over high heat or for too long, says Chef Pohoja. Chef Ranjan agrees: Asparagus should not be overcooked. It should be fresh and tossed with spices till it remains crisp . Ingredients such as fresh coconut, Indian mustard, ginger garlic, garam masala should be cooked first and then asparagus should be added. Basically, cook the Indian masala first and then simmering or tossing the fresh chopped or cut asparagus into the dish will give a better taste.But what are the best ways to make asparagus palatable? Chef Vinod Saini, The Leela Palace, New Delhi, has a few tips. It can be consumed in the form of puree or paste, as an accompaniment or dip. Crispy asparagus for garnishing adds a pleasing hint of flavour. It can be used as a small salad to present as a side dish. Sauted asparagus with Indian herbs as a garnish of any light-flavoured dishes are also delectable, he says.Despite having a bean-like shape, the fleshiness of asparagus adds to its versatility. Asparagus samosa (asparagus instead of green peas), Asparagus pakora (batter fried Indian spiced strips), Asparagus and Barley Shorba (healthy soup), Asparagus and Olive Kulchas with cheese, are some of the best variations of that I have tried with the vegetable. I have also included Asparagus Poriyal in a Lufthansa Airlines first-class menu that I cooked and it had been appreciated by the passengers, says Chef Saini on how the vegetable can be used as a solid substitute in many dishes.Chorchori RecipeIngredients Potatoes (diced): 200gm Asparagus: 1/2 inch pieces 6-8 Mustard oil: 3 tbsp Panchphoran: 1 1/2 tsp Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Green chillies (slit): 3 Sugar: 1/2 tsp Salt to tasteMethod Heat three tablespoons of mustard oil in a pan till it just reaches smoking point Add panchphoron and when it starts crackling, add red chili powder, stir briefly and add the prepared vegetables. Stir and add turmeric powder, slit green chilies, sugar and salt to taste. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally or till potato pieces are cooked Stir-fry and in the end add asparagus. Cook till chorchori is dry.Credit: Chef Sanjeev Ranjan, Executive Chef, Kathmandu Marriott Hotel."

2019-12-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/buttermilk-chaach-chaas-benefits-curd-yoghurt-winter-night-6159496/,Buttermilk or chaach: Why you shouldn’t avoid it this winter,"Buttermilk shouldnt be entirely off your plate. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Buttermilk shouldnt be entirely off your plate. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)People usually drink buttermilk or chaach on hot summer days but tend to avoid it when there is a nip in the air. So is it safe to include a glass of buttermilk to your diet during winter? The sour, creamy beverage consumed in many parts of the world is prepared by blending together a few spoons of natural yoghurt/curd and water. It contains no butter and is low in fat and calories, making it a healthy drink. In fact, what it contains are many vitamins and minerals. Often, spices such as cumin powder, pepper, ginger, green chillies, curry leaves and coriander leaves are crushed and added to the mixture to enhance its taste and therapeutic benefits.The spices in chaach are excellent digestive aids that prevent indigestion and excessive burping. Yoghurt is loaded with probiotics, which encourage the growth of healthy gut flora which helps improve everything  from your digestion to your immunity  even in winter.Here are the benefits of chaach or buttermilkHigh in vitamins and low in fatBeing a good source of calcium and vitamins, it can be included in the diet on a regular basis. Along with calcium, buttermilk is also high on proteins and carbohydrates. Low in fats, buttermilk contains good bacteria called the lactic acid bacteria which helps in improving the bodys immunity. It is vitamin dense and hence, very healthy.Cool off after a spicy mealDid you know that chaach is categorised as a sattvic food in Ayurveda? If you suffer from acidity after eating a heavy or spicy meal, drink a glass of chaach instead of popping an antacid. This yoghurt-based drink is both delicious and healthy, making it the perfect accompaniment to your meals. Its also a great way to cool off the stomach.Acts as a cleanserButter milk detoxifies the body and cleanses the intestines, relieves constipation and helps replenish intestinal flora. Since it has less fat compared to milk and is rich in calcium, potassium and vitamin B12, it makes for an apt drink.AppetisingIt is easy to digest, has astringent properties and a sour taste which helps improve digestion and alleviates the feeling of puffiness. It is a natural treatment against swelling, irritation and digestive disorders, gastrointestinal ailments, spleen maladies, anaemia and lack of appetite.HydrationAs over 90 per cent of buttermilk is water, its consumption helps to maintain the water balance of the body. It is absorbed slowly from the intestines as its contents are mostly combined with proteins. It is better to drink buttermilk than any other flavoured drink. Though fermented buttermilk is sour to taste, but biologically is very nutritive for the human body and tissues.Alternative for milk-intolerant peopleButtermilk is easy to digest and is a good option for people who cannot tolerate lactose.Should you have it during winter?Considering the nature of buttermilk, it is apt to consume it in the morning with breakfast or after lunch during winter as it has a buffering action (resist the changes in pH value on the addition of small amount of an acid). It is better to avoid it at night during dinner. Buttermilk with roasted cumin (jeera) in a thin consistency makes for a good appetiser.However, you may want to avoid chaach in the following situations:*For those who want to gain weight or for malnourished children. For them, curd is a better option because it is more nutrient dense.*For people who are on a fluid-restricted diet but need proteins, such as those who have kidney problems or are on dialysis.Here is a recipe that you can tryIngredients1 1/2 cups  Yogurt3 cups- Water1tsp- Mustard seeds15 no  Curry leaves2 to 3 no  Green chillies, chopped1tsp  Finely chopped gingerSalt to tasteA pinch of asafoetidaMethod*In a large bowl or jug, whisk yogurt and water together.*In a small pan, heat the oil and add the mustard seeds. As soon as the seeds start to splutter, add the curry leaves, chopped green chillies, ginger and asafoetida. Heat only for about 30 seconds or so, until the spices become aromatic. Take it off the heat and stir into the chaach. Add salt to taste, and serve chilled. Stir before serving. For a more healthy twist, you can also blend in pieces of beetroot.

2019-12-11,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/dec/11/go-natural-to-heal-rheumatoid-arthritis-2074348.html,Go natural to heal rheumatoid arthritis,"Dr HP Bharathi ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Any patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis will tell you that the condition can be quite a challenge. Intense pain, fatigue, disability and other debilitating symptoms are common with this autoimmune disease. Conventional medical treatment for rheumatoid arthritis involves Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Disease-Modifying Anti rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). Both these class of drugs can have serious side effects when taken over a long term including potential harm to the liver and kidneys. Naturopathy is one of the most effective systems of alternative medicine to deal with symptoms of arthritis.Naturopaths favour a more patient-centric and holistic approach, taking into account physical, environmental, psychological and social factors before prescribing a course of treatment. They integrate diet and yoga with a whole host of treatment such as hydrotherapy, therapeutic massage, mustard packs, immersion bath with Epsom salt, mud packs, enemas, acupuncture, biofeedback, and counselling to treat patients. Naturopaths are accredited physicians, and follow rigorous scientific principles to treat patients.According to naturopathy, rheumatoid arthritis is the result of a combination of factors. These include, but are not limited to, food allergies, inflammatory properties, gut permeability, and others. The treatment encompasses various techniques designed to address all these factors. Guidance on naturalmedication: One of the most common beliefs is that herbal medication is safe because they are natural. However, they can interact with other substances, both allopathic and natural. Naturopathic physicians make recommendations after reviewing your medical history. Acupuncture: It involves inserting sterilised fine needles through the skin at specific points to various depths for pain relief. Most naturopaths are trained in acupuncture and use it to treat conditions that cause pain, including rheumatoid arthritis. Diet: A naturopathy treatment may involve a process of food elimination to identify if and which food components are triggering your disease. You will be required to go on a limited diet until your symptoms improve. Reducing the side effects of treatment: All medication has potential side effects and the drugs prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis are no exception. The digestive system is one of the main target areas when dealing with this disease. They focus on normalising bacterial flora. Probiotics, when taken according to prescription, are very effective in maintaining the bacterial balance in the gut. They also prescribe natural nutritional supplements like curcumin to bring down the inflammation in the body. Improving your overall health: Since rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic condition, it affects more than just your joints. It may have an adverse effect on other organs, including your heart. By focusing on being as healthy as you can, you can battle the challenges posed by rheumatoid arthritis. A naturopath can assist you in choosing the right natural remedies, vitamins, diet and yogic exercise plan to improve the quality of your health. Manage fatigue: One of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis includes intense fatigue, which is sometimes exacerbated by the medication. Naturopathy has a lot of pain management regimens to help combat fatigue, including but not limited to botanical and herbal supplements, chiropractic care, acupressure, hydrotherapy and a lot more.The author is the deputy chief medical officer of Jindal Naturecure Institute, Bengaluru.For all health queries, write to healthexpresschn@gmail.com"

2019-12-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/kadhi-why-you-should-not-avoid-winter-night-curd-buttermilk-6162088/,Kadhi: Why you shouldn’t avoid it this winter,"Kadhi has various benefits for health. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Kadhi has various benefits for health. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)There are some dishes that everyone enjoys, and one of them is kadhi  the Indian yoghurt and gram flour curry that is served with rice or roti. Made differently in different regions across the country, kadhi is known for its distinct taste and aroma. But it is not just the taste, the gravy dish is also healthy considering it is loaded with vitamins and minerals which help improve body functions. Kadhi-chawal has always been a delicious combination, and tastes divine when served with a portion of fried potatoes.The dish is rich in protein, calcium and phosphorous. So if you are a kadhi lover, here is some good news for you.*Besan kadhi includes besan (chickpea flour) and chaach as the main ingredients. Besan has more good fat and protein than whole wheat flour. It is rich in complex carbohydrates, folate and has a low glycemic index. Chaach helps in losing weight, building your immunity, and is also good for the heart.*A cup of kadhi consumed regularly can be beneficial for your skin and hair, as gram flour boosts collagen formation and has anti-inflammatory properties. Be it acne, dark spots or any skin issue.*Kadhi is also a recommended diet for pregnant women as it is rich in folate, vitamin B6 and iron and ensures the growth of the baby which reduces the change of miscarriage.Consuming kadhi during pregnancy is considered to be beneficial for both the mother and child. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Consuming kadhi during pregnancy is considered to be beneficial for both the mother and child. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)*Diabetes can also cause heart problems, and the blood pressure to rise. Kadhi helps to keep blood pressure under control and also directly controls diabetes as it is low in glycemic index and therefore helps to keep the blood sugar low and controlled, and improve insulin use in the body.*Besan kadhi is loaded with good bacteria, which is healthy for the gut. It helps in maintaining gut flora and improves nutrient absorption. All this, in turn, helps in improving the digestion.*Kadhi is rich in magnesium, which relaxes your muscles and helps in maintaining heart health. The phosphorus helps in regulating the lipid mechanism.Turmeric and black pepper are known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties that can provide relief from severe cold. These ingredients also induce good sleep when a person is suffering from cold and cough. It is known to be a winter comfort food and can surely be had in winter, but have it warm and not out of the refrigerator. Many people say that because of its sour nature, it is best to not have it at night time.How to make itEvery house has its own unique way of making this dish. There is not much similarity between a Gujarati kadhi, Sindhi kadhi, Rajasthani kadhi, Bohri kadhi or a UP kadhi except that all are yoghurt-based (except sindhi kadhi which has a tamarind base) and it may or may not have pakodi (gram flour dumplings, and those too vary from one cuisine to another) and other veggies. Its consistency can also vary; Gujarati kadhi is thin and also sweetish. Sindhi kadhi has loads of vegetables in it and tamarind pulp is added for sourness. But whatever way you like it, kadhi always tastes good, is very simple to make and can be had any time of the year.Heres a quick recipe of Gujarati Kadhi by Ashima Goyal SirajPreparation Time: 10 mins| Cooking Time: 15 mins| Serves 2Ingredients2 cups  Skimmed milk yoghurt1 1/2tbsp  Gram flour (besan)1tbsp  Grated jaggery1 no  Chopped green chilli1/2tsp  Fenugreek seeds1/2tsp  Mustard seeds1/2tsp  Cumin seeds1tsp  Ginger paste8-10 no- Curry leaves1 no  Dried red chilli, broken into two3-4 no  Cloves1/2 inch  Cinnamon stickA pinch of asafoetidaSalt to taste1tbsp  Olive oilMethod*Whisk together yoghurt, gram flour and four cups of water to make a smooth paste.*Add the chopped green chillies and jaggery.

Then comes the second most affected part of the body  joints. The result: chapped lips, cracked heels, dry hands, acne breakouts and the most painful of all, knee ache. Add to this, choosing a wrong skincare product, forgetting to drink enough water, indulging in spicy and fried foods, frequent use of peel-off masks and forgetting to apply sunscreen daily, is the recipe for body damage.Winter tends to naturally increase the vata dosha in the body, which causes these problems. For the face, a few face masks that will help include papaya and lemon mix, hibiscus, honey and coconut oil mask, banana and lentil masks, says Dr Pratap Chauhan, director, Jiva Ayurveda.There are so many factors that can impact the state of your skin, including wrong habits. So, if a skin issue is bothering you, check out the most common skincare mistakes you are making thats blocking your way to an ultra-clear and glowing skin, before you spend money in search of the next miracle, holy grail product, says dermatologist Dr Sruthi Gondi, MD and Founder, Science Of Skin.Peel off mask is a big no! Its regular use strips off the natural oils from skin. Also, choosing a strong acne face wash for dry acne prone skin worsens the damage, she says, adding that people with acne-prone skin should opt for non-foaming, less drying cleansers and face washes.Listed here are some of the common woes in winters and healthy ways to deal with them:Chapped lipsThis is a sure shot indicator of the lack of water in the body. So drink lots of water. If you are using room heaters and warmers, use a humidifier. Do not lick lips as it worsens the condition. Apply beeswax or petroleum jelly on your lips, or better still, massage your navel with some desi ghee (clarified butter) or mustard oil, says naturopath Bhupender Sharma, founder of Noida Naturopathy & Acupressure Centre.Cracked heelsThis is another common problem caused due to dry winter winds. Dry, cracked heels can make walking painful and in some cases, may cause infection. Before you go to sleep, apply generous amounts of petroleum jelly and put on a pair of socks, and notice the effect. Soaking feet in warm water with a little oil is a good idea. Apart from moisturising, it helps tired feet a great deal, says Sharma.Dry handsCold winter air hits hands hard. While washing hands frequently helps eliminate cold and flu germs, the downside is that dryness increases. It helps if you wear gloves every time you go out. Otherwise, apply a glycerine-based moisturiser every time you wash your hands.Itchy bodyDry winter skin can be irritatingly itchy. To tide over this, avoid hot water for bathing. Use lukewarm water. Add a few drops of mustard/coconut oil in your bucket of water to keep the skin moist. Those suffering from severe skin itching must see a dermatologist.Painful jointsWinters can directly effect your bones and joints. Problems like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, idiopathic arthritis or ankylosing spondylosis get more pronounced in the chilly weather. It is important to include kapha balancing foods like bhindi, sprouts, pumpkin seeds, spinach and black beans as these facilitate painless movement of the joints, says Dr Chauhan, advising that patients of joint pains should consume a teaspoon of fenugreek power mixed with honey and a glass of lukewarm water every morning."

While riffing off that, Dhansoo Caf, the new modern Indian restaurant at the culinary collective that is Sangam Courtyard, doesnt play favourites, with its menu branching out to all regions of the country.Coming from the pedigreed stable of Caf Delhi Heights run by the Batra family, with interiors framed by full-length windows at one end, the restaurant offers a full view of the outside world, which you can happily ignore in order to gorge on the selection of dishes on the food menu. And yes, theres a full bar menu as well.The menus non-vegetarian parts are helpfully divided by type (poultry, meats, and seafood) and no section of society is ignored. Its deliciously democratic, in fact.We learn this while making the acquaintance of our starters, comprising Chettinad Pulled Chicken, Koliwada Fried Bhetki, Tenderloin Chapli Kabab, and Pork Seekh. Theres also a vegetarian Japani Samosa so we cant be accused of playing favorites.Starting from the end, the samosa presents an interesting visual, comprising a bow-tie shaped puff pastry, which breaks remarkably easily in the middle to split into two. The stuffing is typical in taste to that found at your favourite chat wallah, but is texturally mousse-like, rather than stolidly chunky. The seekh, coming studded with fried bacon bits is sublime with its accompanying mango jeera chutney, providing a splash of summer in a gloomy winter.The tenderloin kebab is firmer in texture and more direct in flavour, not needing any accoutrements to state its case. Generously sized and spiced, each piece makes for more than a mouthful, keeping in tone with the current political climate.The fried fish comes brackish and battered, not trying to hide its salt water origins. Accompanied by a smashed chilli thecha (relish for snobs), and a Jackson Pollock-like splatter of tart mustard, these are fillets you can safely swipe right on. The pulled chicken is just that, with shredded and gorgeously marinated chicken populating our plate, and then palate.Given that weve given more emphasis to our baser instincts thus far, we decide to be slightly more cerebral and go with a Bheja Masala for our mains. We also get a BBC (British Roast Butter Chicken) for old times sake, with the preparation harking back to the days of the Raj and the subsequent creation of the butter chicken, post the Partition.Paired with naan bread, the chicken is anything but dreadful, with red-roasted poultry pieces curried in classic butter chicken gravy (surely a tip of the hat to the storied Batra banquets Punjabi lan), while the bheja is the absolute opposite, a delicate coddling of brains and spices, begging to be scooped up until nary a neuron remains.Going with the flow by this point we get the Delhi Belly (actually an almond halwa quiche) and the Churri for dessert. The former comes masquerading as a western slice of pie, which tastes exactly like the halwa from your grandmothers kitchen. And speaking of childhood memories, the churri is just that, a pastiche of roti, ghee, and sugar, which comes served in a contemporary aesthetic. Dhansoo indeed.Meal for two: Rs 2000 (including taxes)At: Sangam Courtyard, RK Puram"

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock) It can be extremely irritating to live with sinusitis, cold, flu, allergies and other symptoms of the common cold. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)December is here and winter has arrived, along with it comes seasonal flu, colds and other ailments. The weather is colder, the days are shorter and many struggles to maintain a happy, healthy mindset. Its a myth where many people believe that cold is caught by not keeping yourself warm in winter or being exposed to chilling weather.Cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract when the virus particles are inhaled. The common cold is spread through infected persons sneeze, speech and from loose particles from the nose while wiping. The virus can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with respiratory secretions, says Dr Saad Hafeez Usmani, Consultant- Internal Medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital Whitefield.Common health problems in wintersSore throat: Painful, scratchy or dryness in the throat which later leads to pain is some of the most common symptoms of sore throat. It is mostly caused due to infections and weather circumstances.Asthma: It is a lung disease, in which inflammation and narrowing of the airways occur. Sneezing, coughing, chest tightening are some of its symptoms. There are two types of asthma:Allergic: Which is caused due to exposure to an allergen, such as dust, pollen, paint dust, smoke.Non- Allergic: Caused by cold, flu, stress or extreme weather.Painful joints: Orthopedicians say that in cold weathers, the human body will conserve more heat, and more blood would be circulated to the heart and lungs. So, when this happens the arms, shoulders, knee joints blood vessels will contract leading to pain.Flu: Flu also called as Influenza, which is a severe illness caused due to contagious respiratory viruses. The symptoms vary from mild to severe which at times can result in hospitalization and rarely death. Usually, young kids or older people whose immune systems are weak are often targeted to flu.Heart attack: Elderly people are more at risk due to a drop in body temperature (hypothermia) in the colder months. The heart is affected by increased heart rate and blood pressure, where the heart needs to function harder to keep the body warm. These changes increase the risk of blood clots or thickening of the blood vessels which leads to heart attack and stroke.Possible prevention and care* Washing hands thoroughly, covering mouth and nose to avoid dust, drinking plenty of fluids, eating a healthy diet with fresh fruits and vegetables to keep the immune system strong.* Regular exercise especially such as yoga and swimming is beneficial for the long run.* Use of antibiotics and self -medication is to be avoided.* Vaccination recommended for elderly, children and people with chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes.* A constant in south Indian cuisine  Rasam and savoured in every meal, it is prepared with a base of tamarind juice, pepper, tomato, cumin and other spices. It is traditionally prepared using tamarind juice as a base, with the addition of Indian sesame oil, turmeric, tomato, chilli pepper, pepper, garlic, cumin, curry leaves, mustard, coriander, asafoetida, sea salt and water. Rasam is a classic example of traditional functional food with all its ingredients medicinally claimed for various ailments.* Ginger helps break down mucus formed around the lungs and helps in easy breathing. It even reduces inflammation in the airways and respiratory tracts. Include sliced or grated ginger in your morning water.* Rich in antioxidants, cloves have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and dental-soothing properties.

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock Images) It mentioned that methi dana (seeds) water has the ability to lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock Images)Aiming for an ideal weight is a constant struggle despite hours of intense workouts and strict calorie-restricted diets. However, there are certain herbs that can help boost digestion, improve metabolism and accelerate weight loss, when used in proper amounts, especially fenugreek or methi. This potent natural ingredient can trigger the burning of belly fat and other adipose tissues.It is believed that drinking warm water mixed with fenugreek seeds or powder can reduce weight quickly. A 2015 study published in the International Journal For Vitamin and Nutrition Research, found that a daily dose of 10 grams of fenugreek seeds soaked in hot water may help control Type-2 diabetes. It mentioned that methi dana (seeds) water has the ability to lower blood sugar in people with diabetes.Whats the best way to consume it?Add one tsp of fenugreek seeds in a glass of hot water and let it steep for about 10 minutes. Strain and add lemon and a pinch of honey for flavour and enjoy your cup of hot tea.Benefits of fenugreek* The seeds are known to contain fibre that can help to slow down digestion, reduce the rate at which your body absorbs sugar, and also increase the amount of insulin that your body releases.* For those suffering from Type-2 diabetes, it is considered to improve the bodys insulin secretion as well as insulin sensitivity due to the presence of an amino acid called 4-hydroxyisleucine, which is known to have anti-diabetic properties.* Galactomannan, a water-soluble fibre found in fenugreek seeds, curbs your appetite by enhancing the feeling of fullness, which helps in weight management. Galactomannan also increases the bodys metabolism, which boosts fat burning as well as overall health.* Fenugreek seeds can be consumed as a whole or can be used in powdered form as a flavouring agent in dishes. Methi powder can also be used to make a healthy tea.Heres a recipe of sprouted fenugreek pickle in a tamarind sauce that you can try out:Ingredients1,500g  Fenugreek sprouts (obtained from 500g seeds)25g  Mustard seeds for seasoning750g  Cleaned tamarind, obtain thick extract using water125g  Jaggery, grated400g  Chilli powder25g  Turmeric powder10g  Asafoetida, roast in oil and powder500g  Salt750ml  OilMethod* Stir-fry the fenugreek sprouts over low heat for exactly 2 minutes, and set aside.

The Union government has sent 11 teams to help the state administration tackle the menace.""We have formed 27 teams, comprising central and state government officials, to keep a watch on the movement of swarms and to spray pesticide. Till now we have sprayed pesticide over 1,815 hectares in Banaskantha,"" Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told reporters.The state government would conduct a survey and compensate the affected farmers, he assured. The state government is also exploring the possibility of using drones to spray pesticide, he said.Union Minister of State for Agriculture Purushottam Rupala said that the Central government will provide all possible help to Gujarat to tacklethe problem of locusts.""To tackle the menace, the centre has sent its team to Gujarat and the problem is expected to be solved in 6 to 7 days,"" Rupala told PTIFarmers have been directed to use various measures to keep off the swarms, including burning tyres, playing drums and clanging metal objects, installing table fans in the fields and even playing music loudly, an agriculture department official said.Locusts were first seen in Suigam, Danta, Deesa, Palanpur and Lakhni tehsils of Banaskantha last week. From there they moved to Satlasana tehsil in Mehsana district.""They entered Gujarat from the desert areas of Pakistan. This is the second time in a month that locusts have invaded the fields in north Gujarat,"" Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said earlier.Local farmers said they were witnessing the phenomenon after almost a decade. Punamchand Parmar, Additional Chief Secretary in the state Agriculture department, said the locusts have affected crops over 5,000 hectares in Banaskantha district.A few days ago a huge swarm, spread across 30 to 35 square kilometers, descended in Tharad tehsil and devoured mustard, castor, funnel and wheat crops, he said, adding that locusts are still present in neighboring areas of Jalore district in Rajasthan and in Tharparkar desert of Pakistan.""We have deployed 45 teams in Tharad where a large swarm descended two days ago,"" he told reporters in Gandhinagar.Of the 11 tehsils of Banaskantha where locusts were seen, Suigam, Danta, Tharad and Vav are the worst-hit.""Though we have been able to kill around 25 per cent of locusts so far, it will take another four days for the teams to completely eliminate them. Looking at the wind patterns, it seems the locust swarms in Jalore and Tharparkar may not enter Gujarat,"" Parmar added.Parbat Patel, local MP, said the attack was unprecedented. ""We have never seen such a large number of locusts. The swarms have caused large-scale destruction.Government is trying to ensure that they do not invade new areas,"" he said. Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Paresh Dhanani said the state government's measures to contain the attack were inadequate.The government should have used aircraft to spray pesticides, they said. However, agriculture minister R C Faldu said this method could be dangerous for animals which graze in open fields.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

The state government further claimed that with the help of the central governments locust control team, nearly 25% locusts had been destroyed using pesticide.Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Poonamchand Parmar said, The locusts have affected crops over 5,000 hectares in Banaskantha district alone. A few days ago a huge swarm, spreading across 30 to 35 sq km, descended in Tharad taluka and devoured mustard, castor, fennel and wheat crop.He said that the locusts have flown in from Tharparkar (Pakistan) and Jalore (Rajasthan) side. Their original flight path was towards Pakistan but due to suitable wind direction and moisture, they landed in Banaskantha and other parts of the state. These are young locusts in 20-30 days age group and therefore theres no reason to worry about their breeding which only starts after they are 70-80 days old, added Parmar.Of the 11 talukas of Banaskantha where locusts were seen, Suigam, Danta, Tharad and Vav are the worst-affected.Though we have been able to kill around 25% of locusts so far, it will take another four days for the teams to completely eliminate the pest. Looking at the wind patterns, it seems the locust swarms in Jalore and Tharparkar may not enter Gujarat any more, Parmar added.He added that the state government has decided to give relief to locust-affected farmers from the states disaster relief fund after a damage assessment survey.Agriculture minister R C Faldu on Thursday visited a few villages affected by locust. He said that from Friday onwards, 100 tractors carrying pesticide will be moving around in the village to terminate the insects. Our priority is to prevent locusts from spreading into neighbouring districts, he added.In Video: Villages of Gujarats Banaskantha hit due to locust attack"
2019-12-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/unusual-foods-that-thomas-zacharias-had-in-2019/article30402076.ece,Thomas Zacharias lists the dishes that surprised him during his Chef On The Road trips in 2019,"His Instagram feed is usually filled with posts of him travelling either through the country or abroad. His trips are typically centred around food; after all, they are the Chef On The Road trips that Thomas Zacharias, executive chef and partner at The Bombay Canteen, undertakes several times a year. These trips go on to inspire his innovative menus at the restaurant that has gone on to be voted as one of the best in the country.Here, he shares the five best foods he got to try this past year during his travels.Chicken sashimiChicken Sashimi at Kuchibashi Modern in KyotoId gone to Japan early this year, and one of the dishes that completely blew me away was a chicken sashimi I had at a yakitori place in Kyoto called Kuchibashi Modern. They have a special breed of poultry that is bred for sashimi; the bird is processed just before it is served to ensure freshness. It is typically eaten with wasabi and soy; and honestly, the dish made me rethink a lot of things about textures and flavours. Until then, I had never thought that chicken sashimi would be so enjoyable or that I would be wowed by it. But it was one of those dishes that I wanted to order again.Mushroom cevicheMushroom Ceviche at O PedroThis one was closer home; a delightful mushroom ceviche created by Chef Hussain Shahzad at O Pedro in Mumbai. It was a simple enough dish with some pickled oyster mushrooms, lima beans and a crisp tempura. However, the depth of flavour the dish boasted was something else. I simply loved it.Wild thaliWild Thali at AkoleBefore the monsoon season, I had gone with the guys from the OOO Farms to Akole in the Sahyadri hills. Here, I met tribals and got to sample their cooking. They use vegetables that are either foraged or locally found, like pendra, gharbandi, chai vel and mahua fruit. Their cooking technique itself was quite simple but flavourful. All they would use was some green chillies, onions and garlic. I realised just how little we know of local produce; it was a turning point for me and also paved the way for the evolving food at The Bombay Canteen. It was following this trip that we hosted Taste of the Wild, a two-month-long exploration of vegetables found in Maharashtra.Chhatu patra podaChhatu patra podaDuring my trip to Odisha, I happened to dine at the home of Alka Jena, where I had the chhatu patra poda. It is basically straw mushrooms, mustard, green chillies and onions that are wrapped in sal leaves and charred. I loved the technique and the way the different flavours came together. It opened my eyes to how different Odiya food is.Beet steakIn November this year, I visited the Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Helmed by Dan Barber, it is a modern farm-to-table restaurant. I have followed Dans work closely and to be able to talk to him was undoubtedly the highlight of my year. Towards the end of my week there, the team treated me to a 30-course meal that lasted four-and-a-half hours! It was here that I tried the beet steak; it was one of the last savoury courses. The beet was charred and sliced to look like steak; it was then served with some beet greens, beet pure and four slices of beef. The coolest part: the sauce basically looked like a candle and wed assumed it was part of the table dcor. The wax, however, was made of beef fat, which was then poured into a gravy boat. The meal was a re-look at how to achieve a balance on our plates, which are usually meat heavy with some starch and vegetables. Here, the vegetable was the star and the meat a mere accompaniment."
