While he was happy with the yield 4.5 tonnes per acre the farmer was disappointed by the market price. He decided to wait it out, only to see the prices tumbling down.He is staring at a loss of Rs 4.5lakh, Kadhiresan told TOI. With a total yield of 45 tonnes, I was expecting about Rs 40/kg. When traders initially offered Rs 20/kg, I was waiting for it to go up to at least Rs Rs 35. However, after more stocks began to arrive in the market, including a variety from Palladam and Mysore that can not be stored for long, the price first dropped to Rs 15 and went down to Rs 13/kg. I am ready to sell it for at least Rs 25/kg to break even.Like other small onion farmers in the district, Kadhiresan now plans to offload some of the stock if prices dont go up after Pongal.Small onions are cultivated on 4,500 acres in Coimbatore, said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association S Palanisamy.Many farmers are getting offers as low as Rs 7 to Rs 8/kg, which will not even cover the cost of seeds, said DK Ramaswamy, another shallot farmer from Thondamuthur. It is almost like throwing away the stock.The farmers say small onions are an expensive crop to cultivate. While the seeds cost about Rs 22,500/acre, fertilizers, biofertilizers and the labour push the expense to Rs 70,000/acre, onion farmer TN Karuppusamy, who cultivates on five acres, said. I finally ended up selling some stock for Rs 13/kg. The trader has promised to give me some more money once he sells the stock at a higher price.Many shallot farmers have taken loans for cultivation, said Palanisamy. They are facing debts, for which they can not even pay the interest. The government should fix a minimum support price, he said."

It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities."

""The amount will come in two tranches during rabi and kharif farming. In Bengal, there are many small and marginal farmers who own less than an acre. The cash support will be calculated on their landholdings based on the Rs 5,000-per-acre formula,"" the CM said.Target beneficiaries will be able to apply for the cash support from February 1.Banerjee's New Year gift to farmers will be a political weapon for Trinamool MPs. Banerjee has been taking on the Modi government, pointing to farmer suicides and falling prices of crops such as onions."

The produce reaching the market is not getting sold or getting low price from traders, who still have stock to clear.Nashik traders send onions to New Delhi, Bihar and other states in North India, West Bengal, and the North East states. They prefer to transport by rail rather than road as it is cost effective and quick. While it costs Rs 5 per kg to transport onions by road, it costs only Rs 2.5 per kg by the Railways.The traders claimed that at present, they are getting one rake (each with 40 wagons) once in two-three days, though they have sought three rakes a day, considering the huge supply of onions from farmers. A delegation of Nashik traders led by the chairman of the state agriculture commission, Pasha Patel, discussed the issue with Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari a couple of days back.Railway is an effective means of transportation. About 1,600 tonnes of onions may be transported at a time through one rake. While there is demand of three rakes a day, onion traders are getting only one rake after every two-three days, Patel said. He claimed that during their meeting, Gadkari spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal , who has assured them that more rakes would be sent. The railway minister has assured Gadkari that immediate steps would be taken to increase the rakes in Nashik, said Patel.According to him, traders do not buy fresh onions from farmers till their stock is cleared. Hence, there is need to increase the transport of onions by rail and adequate rakes must be made available for the purpose, Patel added.About 2 lakh quintals of onions are auctioned a day in district APMCs during peak period. Sohanlal Bhandari, president of Nashik district onion traders association, said that recently, there was huge arrivals of onions in Agriculture Produce Market Committees. Ideally, Nashik traders need 20 rakes a week, he said. Recently, we had urged the railway administration to provide us more rakes, but it did not. This affected our despatch of onions during the peak period. We want railway administration to provide rakes as per our demand, said Bhandari.A railway official, requesting anonymity, told TOI that they had provided rakes whenever they got a demand. He claimed that the railways had provided 700 wagons from Niphad and Kherwadi stations in the past one month. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest wholesale onion market in the country, said that wholesale onion prices may increase by Rs 200 per quintal if traders are able to despatch their consignments by rail on regular basis.Availability of rakes on regular basis will help traders to increase onion procurement and that may result into rise in wholesale onion prices by at least Rs 200 per quintal from the present level, said Holkar."
2019-01-03,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/man-with-the-moves/cid/1685999,Man with the moves,"A man from the small African nation of Ivory Coast has made a big impact on his housing complex at Uniworld City in New Town. At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

2019-01-04,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/hope-with-concerns-in-2019/article25904743.ece,Hope with concerns in 2019,"The New Year is always looked forward to with hope, whatever the conditions might have been the previous year; 2018 has been a mixed bag, both globally and domestically.Globally, the growth rate in 2018 was high, particularly in the United States. But strong signs of a trade war emerged, dimming hopes of faster international trade. Britain is passing through the pangs of separation from the European Union. Domestically, the first quarter growth rate was high. But signs are not good for the balance of the year. The rupee underwent a severe shock as crude oil prices rose, and abated after a fall in oil prices. While prices fell, agrarian distress accentuated.Indias growth rate in 2018-19 is forecast at 7.4% by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). But it looks to be a touch-and-go situation. More likely, it will be slightly lower. Looking ahead, 2019 may not show any substantial rise in the growth rate. Even though the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has stabilised, much will depend on the pickup in the investment rate.The international environment is not that conducive for growth in our foreign trade; this will have an impact on our exports and, therefore, growth. Perhaps the growth rate will be between 7.2% and 7.5%. Though this may be the highest growth rate of any country, it falls short of our requirements.Going ahead, what are our major concerns?Investment ratioIn the final analysis, the growth rate depends on the investment rate and the productivity of capital or its inverse incremental capital-output ratio.The incremental capital output ratio is a catch-all expression. It depends upon a multiple number of factors such as quality of labour, which again depends on education and skill development levels, and technology, which is constantly changing. For ensuring a sustained high growth, we need to raise the investment ratio and keep the incremental capital-output ratio at 4. The Gross Fixed Capital Formation ratio has fallen from 35.8% in 2007-08 to 28.5% in 2017-18. The journey to raise the investment ratio is not going to be easy. Animal spirits must be revived. A tranquil political and economic environment needs to be nurtured.Banking systemAn important factor affecting economic growth is the condition of our banking system. Non-performing assets (NPAs), including stressed assets, as a proportion of loans of public sector banks stood at 16.7% as of March 2018. As many as 11 public sector banks are under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). This restricts the lending abilities of these banks. Added to this, the non banking financial company (NBFC) system is also under stress. This is partly a reflection of the stress in the banking system since most NBFCs borrow from banks. Recapitalisation of public sector banks will partly solve the problem. It is not clear at this point how much it will help in adding to lending capacity.Some have advocated providing more capital to banks outside the PCA framework as that will increase their lending capacity immediately.Today, banks are responsible both for short-term and long-term lending. Their inability to lend affects the availability of working capital as well as capital expenditures.The decision to pump in more capital to public sector banks must be completed soon. The growth rate in the industrial sector will depend on how quickly the banking system comes back to normalcy.Employment growthThere is a great concern about the inadequate growth of employment. Honestly, we do not have satisfactory employment numbers. The employment data in the organised sector are reliable. But the employment in the informal sector is much larger. One question that is asked is that if growth is around 7%, why is there no corresponding growth in employment? We need to keep two factors in mind. Growth can occur either as a result of increase in investment or because of better utilisation of existing capacity. It is growth which is led by new investment that leads to a significant increase in employment. But growth caused by improved efficiency of utilisation of existing capital can lead only to a marginal increase in employment. Much of the growth seen in the last few years is of the latter variety.Second, the increase in employment seen in the period between 2004-05 and 2009-10 was because of the rapid growth of the information technology (IT) and financial sectors. The IT sector has slowed down. The financial sector is under stress. Employment in these sectors was visible and educated entrants into the labour market found ample opportunities. The IT sector growth rate is not likely to pick up significantly as this industry is undergoing many structural changes. The revival of the banking system depends on a number of factors. Thus, even from the point of view of employment, the key factor is the pickup in investment.Indias external sector has grown and is well integrated with the rest of the world. Indias trade in goods and services as a percentage of GDP has grown to 42% of GDP. Therefore, what happens in the rest of the world affects Indias growth very much. Indias balance of payment situation has been comfortable since liberalisation. However, there are vulnerabilities as seen in September-October 2018, when the value of the rupee suddenly plummeted when crude oil prices rose and there were simultaneously capital outflows. RBI intervention and the subsequent fall in crude prices have restored the value of the rupee. In April-November 2018, Indias exports of goods grew by 11.6%. However, we need to note that exports growth was 5.2% (2016-17) and 9.8% (2017-18). Strong growth in exports is a must if we have to keep the current account deficit (CAD) at a manageable level.The forecast for world trade and output is not encouraging. There are too many uncertainties which include an intensification in the trade war. Along with export promotion, we also need to contain some of our large imports. A watch on Indias CAD is critically important if we have to achieve growth with stability.Agrarian distressThe future growth also depends on the performance of agriculture. Agrarian distress is widespread. Strangely, the fall in prices of agricultural products is in one sense a reflection of our success in raising output. Some years ago, the concern was a rise in the price of pulses to abnormally high levels. But today the picture is reversed. Thanks to increase in production, prices have fallen. Similar is the case with respect to vegetables, particularly onion. The need of agriculturists is income in current prices. The solution to the fall in prices lies in government intervening in the market and buying off the surplus over normal levels. The market will then automatically take prices to the normal level. The important requirement in this context is not only the financial capacity of the government to procure but also adequate physical arrangements to procure and store. The procured agricultural products can be sold by the government in later years when output is low or utilised in any safety net programme.Loan waivers are at best short-term solutions. The fundamental problem is one of increasing productivity and enabling farmers to achieve increased output and better prices. There is also a basic weakness that we have to address. The average size of landholding is so small that any amount of increase in productivity will not give adequate income. Farmers have to think in terms of consolidation of landholdings so that they can get the benefits of larger size. Small farmers will also have to think in terms of higher value-added products like vegetables. A combined attack to increase productivity, consolidate landholdings and improve marketing is needed to assure farmers of better income.Thus there are five concerns as we stand at the beginning of 2019. These are: raising the investment ratio; putting the banking system back on the rails; employment generation through better growth; enhancing export growth to contain the CAD; and removing agrarian distress by increasing productivity and consolidation of small landholdings. These issues need to be addressed comprehensively, if we have to achieve sustained high growth.C.

Time was when I would make a detour to the Pandara Road Market on my way back home from somewhere or the other and pick up two or three bowls of hot and sour soup from one of my favourite restaurants, Ichiban. Winter evenings are just right for the soup, which is, yes, hot and sour, and full of the good stuff  little pieces of fatty pork, nice plump shrimps, tender chicken, and a host of veggies.Wide assortmentSo, when the temperature dipped some nights ago, my heart sang for something suitably hot to placate the spirit and the body. I have tried out most of the Chinese restaurants in and around East Delhi. This time I thought I would order some dishes from a place called Dragon Noodles  a seemingly popular Chinese restaurant with outlets in Indirapuram and Vaishali.I placed my order through Swiggy. I asked for a plate of stir-fried Chinese vegetables (Rs. 180), shredded chicken in black pepper gravy (Rs. 210), roasted lamb in spring onion sauce (Rs. 230), mixed Thai basil fried rice (Rs. 170) and chicken Chinese chop suey (Rs. 180). There was hot and sour soup on the menu, too, but I am a bit finicky when it comes to this hearty soup  and like the Ichiban version more than what the others offer. So I decided Id try out the other dishes instead.And I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I had my dinner, for the dishes were, indeed, rather nice. Chinese takeaway can be awful, and I live in fear of being presented with lamb in a thick red sauce, or chicken in a gelatinous white one. But I found the food had been cooked well, and each dish had a sauce that tasted different. The stir-fried veggies were deliciously crunchy, and the Thai basil fried rice was aromatically flavoured and topped with everything from shrimps to chicken.I enjoyed my chop suey, which had crunchy noodles with chicken in a light sauce. I had the pepper chicken but thought would eat the lamb with spring onions at lunch the following day.Piquant sauceThe chicken was in a pleasantly piquant sauce. The pieces were soft, and had infused in the flavours of the black pepper. I mixed it with my fried rice, and had a satisfying meal. The next day, though, my lunch was a bit of a surprise. I got some hot rice cooked at home, and mixed it with what I thought was the lamb. But every now and then, I got the feeling I was eating chicken, too. That was when I discovered that our (wo)manager of the hearth had thought the chicken and the lamb  with similar looking brown sauces  were two plates of the same dish, and heated them together. So I ended up eating shredded chicken and roasted lamb in black pepper gravy and spring onion sauce. And it wasnt half bad!Dragon Noodles gives me hope. One day I am going to try out its hot and sour soup, along with a dish called Dragon cottage cheese with spinach .But if anything has to be heated the next day, I am going to supervise the proceedings. Or maybe not."

Moreover, the average wholesale price of Kharif onions has also dropped by 23% to Rs710 per quintal in the last three days.The lack of demand for summer onions has led to drop in average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon. The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs160 per quintal on Thursday, against Rs150 per quintal on December 3, 2016.The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs100 and Rs235 per quintal, respectively on Thursday. In the retail markets of Nashik city, summer onions were sold at Rs10-12 per kg, while fresh kharif onions were sold at the price range from Rs 15-20 per kg.On December 28, 2018, the union ministry of commerce increased the incentives on onion export from 5% to 10% in order to boost onion export of the country to increase the demand for onions and thereby stop the crash in wholesale onion prices.Although the price of summer onions continued to crash, the average wholesale prices of fresh kharif onions had increased by Rs200 per quintal  from Rs700 on December 28 to Rs931 per quintal on Monday. But the average wholesale onion prices have again dropped by Rs220 per quintal in the past three days to Rs710 per quintal on Thursday.The minimum and maximum wholesale price of new kharif onions were recorded at Rs 300 and Rs898 per quintal respectively on Thursday.Last year, the average wholesale price of summer onions was recorded at Rs951 per quintal at Lasalgaon on the last working day before Diwali vacation on November 1. Thereafter, the Lasalgaon APMC remained closed for 10 days till November 11.The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 800 per quintal once the market reopened after Diwali vacation on November 11 and the wholesale prices of summer onions were in the price range up to Rs700 for next few days.

Time was when I would make a detour to the Pandara Road Market on my way back home from somewhere or the other and pick up two or three bowls of hot and sour soup from one of my favourite restaurants, Ichiban. Winter evenings are just right for the soup, which is, yes, hot and sour, and full of the good stuff  little pieces of fatty pork, nice plump shrimps, tender chicken, and a host of veggies.Wide assortmentSo, when the temperature dipped some nights ago, my heart sang for something suitably hot to placate the spirit and the body.

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: For the next few days, Ramilia Maidan in New Delhi is going to be a saffron citadel and Delhi BJPs virtual camp office. Beginning Sunday, the next three weekends will see three grand events on the sprawling grounds: Bhim Mahasangam, a meeting of the citys scheduled caste communities on January 6; a two-day convention of national leaders, elected representatives and state office bearers on January 11 and 12; and Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20, when party leaders will address the youth.Senior party leaders claimed Bhim Mahasangam will be a unique event in which chef Vishnu Manohar will break his own record by preparing 5,000 kg of khichdi in a single vessel. Manohar had entered the Guinness Book of Records with a 3,000-kg khichdi event in Nagpur in October 2018. The oversized vessel Manohar used at the Nagpur event has been retrofitted for a bigger quantity of food and transported to Delhi. Gas stoves will be installed on a 15ftx15ft platform constructed close to the dais.We have collected over 10,000 kg of rice and lentils from about three lakh SC families in the past few days for the dish, disclosed Ashok Goel, media convenor, Delhi BJP . The rest of the ingredients  tomatoes, garlic, onion, salt, etc  have been arranged by the party. We will set up distribution points on the ground and a team of 1,000 people will serve the dish to people attending the meet.The party is expecting over 25,000 people at the event. The idea is to bring all sub-castes of the SC community under one roof and deliver the message of unity in diversity. The party leaders will elaborate on the work the Modi government has done for the community, said the head of media and IT cell.The bigger challenge for the party workers, however, is the organisation of the national convention on January 11 and 12, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and top leaders from different states. More than 12,000 delegates are expected to attend.Apart from the main event area from where the top leaders will address the delegates, we are also setting up separate lounges for the Prime Minister, national president and the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states, said a party leader. There will be two separate halls where the members of the national executive and other delegates will be served food. Arrangements are also being made for the PM, Union ministers and CMs to discharge urgent administrative work from the ground itself.BJP has formed 24 teams to look after the travelling arrangements, local transport and accommodation for the delegates and manage the logistics, work stations and internet connectivity, sound and LED screens and well as the internal and external beautification of the venue. Over 80,000 city youths are expected to participate in the Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20."

While the foundation has started supplying hot milk to some schools on a pilot basis, it has categorically said it will not add onion and garlic.Why does it matter?An official of the State Food Commission said it had received complaints about students skipping the midday meals as they did not like the taste of the food without onion and garlic, which are an integral part of the food culture among most communities.Children skipping meals is worrying because malnutrition is a serious issue. According to the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS) data for Karnataka (2015-2016), 36.2% of the children below the age of five are stunted, while 26.1% are wasted. The survey also reveals that 10.5% of the children were severely wasted, while 35.2% are underweight.The Central Food Technological Research Institute has sent a report to the Department based on its earlier research findings that both onion and garlic were found to enhance the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from grain.But the institute has stated that during its survey across 270 schools in Mysuru district between January and May 2017, it found the average calorific value of the meals supplied by the APF was more than a school-cooked meal. The APF has said in a statement that its cooked meals are in compliance with the nutritional norms prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.What is the governments stand?Principal Secretary S.R. Umashankar said a final call would be taken after considering the feedback from students and teachers. The APF has had a series of meeting with several stakeholders, including officials of the State Food Commission and the Education Department. The government will have to either accept the dietary norms of APF or make alternative arrangements for supplying food.Are health activists worried?Around 145 health activists, experts and citizens, who are part of the Right to Food Campaign and the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, have written to the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Chief Minister, stating that children are eating less as they find the food bland.Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher who is one of the signatories, argued for cooking culturally appropriate food in de-centralised kitchens.Activists have also demanded that eggs be served as part of the midday meals as it is a good source of protein. They want the contract with the APF terminated, and meals prepared by self-help groups and other community-based organisations in accordance with nutritional norms and cultural practices, using fresh local produce.Veena Shatrugna, a clinical nutritionist and former Ddeputy Director of the National Institute of Nutrition, said, Normally, phytates and oxalates found in vegetarian diets precipitate iron and zinc and prevent their absorption from the gut. Onion and garlic appear to enhance absorption of these minerals. This is significant, she pointed out, because around 50% to 70% of children in India are anaemic.Tanu Kulkarni"

One, a chef, cleaned fresh red snapper filets with a sharp knife. The other, a filmmaker, pointed her camera into a large pot of simmering vegetables.What would you say this is, low heat or medium? Tuleka Prah asked, setting the camera aside.Low heat, said 38-year-old Touty Sarr, who runs the kitchen of a popular cafe in Dakar. She turned to her daughter, who was watching her cook.

All this from an investment of just Rs 2lakh.At a time when sugar cane and onion cultivators are struggling to make adequate returns from their produce, some farmers in the Junnar tehsil are making a killing from coriander thanks to the demand-supply mismatch for the herb caused by extreme cold conditions and a paucity of water. Junnar is about 92km from here on the Nashik highway.Kute said this year has been exceptional. In the past decade, I have never got such good returns from coriander. For the past two years, I have been growing tomatoes, leafy vegetables and summer fruits like watermelon and muskmelon, but I never made so much money due to the low prices in the market. In fact, a few months ago, I had to throw away hundreds of crates of tomato due to market fluctuations and suffered heavy losses, he said.Like Kute, many coriander farmers have made good profits from the high prices their produce is fetching due to the demand-supply gap this year. Reports from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Narayangaon and Pune reveal that the kitchen staple, which usually sells for Rs 5-10 a bunch, is now commanding between Rs 30 and Rs 50.Kamlakar Wajge, a farmer from Narayangaon who is also a commission agent, earned Rs 2 lakh from the coriander harvest. Vegetable production shortage is unusual during the winter. But this year, the scenario is different. Many farmers could not grow several vegetables because of a water shortage. Now, there is a gap in demand and supply. This has resulted in an unprecedented price escalation for coriander in the market.Satish Dombale, from Otur, who made Rs1lakh in a week, added, I had cultivated coriander on 20 gunthas of land. I faced losses with all the other vegetables I had grown last year. But coriander has saved me. I can now use this capital to grow more vegetables in the coming months.According to the Narayangaon APMC data, in the past 10 days, it has received around 1.5 lakh coriander bunches every day from Junnar, Shirur, Ambegaon and Khed tehsils. Usually, in the winter months, we get around 2.5 lakh coriander bunches daily, said Sanjay Kale, the chairman of the Narayangaon market, putting a figure on the volume of shortage.At the Pune APMC market, the officials reported getting just 1 lakh coriander bunches every day against the usual supply of 2.5-3 lakh bunches. In January, a bunch of coriander usually sells for Rs 3-5. But over the past fortnight, a bunch is selling for Rs 25-30, said a senior APMC official.Talking of the possible cause for the low production, Rajaram Deshmukh, former vice-chancellor of the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, said, Growth of vegetables is affected when the temperature drops below 10C. In recent times, the night temperatures have been low. This must have adversely impacted the vegetable harvest."

The eatery offers parotta along with a range of mutton dishes including liver fry, brain fry, boti (intestine) fry and curries.Established as a roadside stall about fifty years ago by P Arumugam, it is now run by his three sons. It is situated near the famous Tallakulam Perumal temple in Madurai where crowds swell in the morning and evening. A Saravanan, one of the sons, said their success lies in the quality of raw materials, including the meat which they have been sourcing from the same mutton stall which has been in business for three generations.While all the other dishes are eaten along with parotta or rice, bone roast can be enjoyed as a single dish. I wait for Wednesdays to just have two plates of bone roast for lunch and never miss this meal if I am in Madurai, said S Kumar, a software engineer. A plate of about 75g of the dish costs Rs70.Thigh bones of the goat are chopped into two-inch pieces, washed, marinated in salt and turmeric and boiled in a pressure cooker till it turns tender. Earlier it used to be boiled in an open fire for many hours. This is usually done at the home kitchen and brought to the shop.The speciality of this dish is its flavour, spiced with only pepper. No chilli is added, said Saravanan. The marrow within the bone and the meat on the bones imbibe the strong flavours, he added.Cook Rajaram, who specialises in the dish, said that the dish is prepared by frying a handful of finely chopped onions along with ginger, garlic, cumin, salt, curry leaves, mint leaves and coriander. It is spiced with cinnamon and fennel seeds. When the onion turns translucent, a handful of boiled bones are added to it, fried and served on a platter, garnished with onion and lemon rings.The shop opens at 11am and is open till 11.30pm, but the delicious bone roast is sold out by evening. The shop closes only on Diwali and Pongal every year.Gfx:Where  Near the Tallakulam Perumal TempleTime  11 AM to 11.30 PM on all daysWhat  Bone roast, brain roast and liver roastPrice  Rs 70 per plate of bone roast"

Experts say that due to low sowing, prices of these commodities are expected to shoot during the summer months by 30-40%.As per the sowing data released by state agriculture department, garlic sowing is 50% less in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18. Onion is 37% less as compared to previous year while coriander is a significant 58% less.Agriculture stakeholders said that the dip in sowing is mainly due to poor monsoon and scarce availability of irrigation waters. All the three crops are grown mainly in Saurashtra region which is reeling under severe water and agri-crisis.Farmers said that with scarcity looming large and no guarantee of a good crop, many have opted to sow fodder which guarantees to sell in times of scarcity.Pratap Sarodiya, an farmer in Bhavnagar said that onion crop he reaped last year had failed to fetch a good price. ""I had put my onions in cold storage hoping to get good price but am getting a paltry Rs 2 per kg which is the cost of cold storage. I chose to sow fodder which at least save cattle during this year of scarcity,"" said Sarodiya.Vashram Bhambhaniya, farmer in Gir-Somnath district, said he had sown coriander last but has taken no crop this winter due to scarcity of water.Ghanshyam Patel, chairman of agriculture produce market committee of Mahuva in Bhavnagar said farmers have stayed away from onion and garlic as these crops failed to fetch them good price last year. Less availability of water is another key reason.""During Diwali, onions fetched Rs 20 kg for farmers which is now getting only Rs 2 per kg. Similar situation prevails in garlic crop. Impact of this low sowing will be felt by people in summer when retail prices would rise due to low production,"" said Patel. Agriculture department officials said barring four crops of jowar, cumin, fennel and fodder, sowing of major 17 crops in the state has been less than 100%. Usually, till first week of January, sowing of almost all crop is around 100%. In January 2018, 13 crops out of 21 had recorded 100% or more sowing."

The government would grant subsidy for a maximum of 200 quintals of onions sold during this period.The initial deadline for applying for the subsidy was January 15. We have now extended it to January 25 as there was demand from the farmers. Moreover, the authorities of different Agriculture Produce Market Committees too had requested for the extension, department officials added.So far, about 70,000 onion farmers in Nashik have applied for the grant.The extension of the deadline will help those farmers who are yet to apply for the grant, said Gautam Bansane, deputy district registrar, Nashik.A section of the farmers have urged the state government to extend the period of sale of onions to avail ex-gratia grant from December 15 to January 30. Farmers have incurred heavy losses due to crash in wholesale onion prices and they could not even recover transport cost. The production cost for onions is around Rs 900 per quintal. Most of the farmers have sold their produce at Rs 100-200 per quintal, said Kuber Jadhav, onion farmer.We want the state government to increase the ex-gratia amount to Rs 500 per quintal and union government should also give funds to the state in the interest of farmers, he added."

Bandra resident Samir Firasta, who spotted Nath during his morning walk, saw that he had completely stopped breathing and was lying listless. He immediately started giving CPR to Nath and asked a bystander to fetch an automated external defibrillator (AED) machine that was installed at the nearby Otters Club . Bandra has around 15 such devices installed by Holy Family under their ICare project to reduce the response time and deaths caused by sudden cardiac arrests. Firasta, who is associated with ICare, has been training people to use the devices.Once the machine arrived, I gave him two shocks. He didnt respond to the first one but started breathing mildly after the second shock, he said, adding that he was transported to Holy Family Hospital in an ambulance. It is learnt that Nath was admitted to the ICU and was out of danger. tnnSudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating abruptly, affecting the flow of blood to brain and other vital organs. Most episodes happen in individuals without any previous heart history. In such situations it is important to know what to do. People were telling me to make him smell footwear or onion but luckily I knew what to do, he said."

Correspondingly, production doubled from 21.42 lakh tonnes to 46 lakh tonnes. Almost 80% of the rise in the onion area took place in the past two years.After that, farmers quickly expanded. In 2017, I produced over 450 quintals from four acres. I sold the produce for Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,200 per quintal. Considering the good rates, I doubled the area to eight acres, said Rajesh Pawar, a farmer from Deola.Many like Pawar switched to onion with the hope of getting robust returns. Their hopes were dashed with the sharp fall in prices last year. The high production resulted in a glut in the market and the average wholesale price of onions grown last summer crashed to Rs 200 per quintal. Now, farmers are left with huge stockpiles of onions.I produced around 1,000 quintals from eight acres but did not get good rates. I sold around 600 quintals at an average rate of Rs 300 per quintal. I had to dump around 200 quintals and the remaining 200 quintals in storage have begun sprouting. I had spent around Rs 4.5 lakh on cultivation but could not recover the cost, said Pawar. Shantaram Gunjal, a farmer, said, I had 300 quintals of summer onions in storage till Diwali but the wholesale prices dipped. I had no choice but to dump the produce in the farm as transporting it would mean additional costs."

I have come to the conclusion that some days are just meant to be. In our mad, rush-hour existence, we are often disappointed when a mission doesnt lead to the goal in mind. After a pleasant half hour loitering around in Prithviraj Market and meeting old friends, I say, So what? Whats a goal, after all?Searching for kababsLet me start at the beginning. I wanted to eat some kababs, and I wanted to try out a small kabab corner that I had noticed in Khan Market a few weeks ago. I went there and discovered that the barbecue was still to be lit. So I started walking towards Prithviraj Market, where my car was parked. I like this part of Khan Market because it is not glitzy like its mega-rich cousin on the other side of the road. This side is still middle class and has two of the best meat shops in New Delhi. I first went past my old favourite  The Meat Shop  run by a very enthusiastic and polite youngS man. I was happy to meet him after years, and happier still to find that my old butcher and fish slicer were still there. I doffed my cap to them, and then went in search of another old favourite, Mirajuddin.But before that, I stopped by at a new Gopala outlet. The Khan Market branch of the popular sweet shop, which now sells a whole lot of other products (such as namkeen and breads), had opened last month. I had heard from a friend that they were selling various kinds of cheese, but the only cheese they had was the pizza variety. I love their rasgullas, but bought some of the kalakand instead (Rs. 560 a kilo; nice, mildly sweet, but could have been just a bit more moist), some lavash (Rs. 50 a packet), crusty garlic butter slices (Rs. 40), jeera ajwain biscuits (Rs. 120), walnut bran biscuits (Rs. 210) and coconut biscuits (Rs. 108). The coconut biscuits were superb, the jeera ajwain biscuits werent bad either and I am told the walnut bran cookies were rather good, too. The bread is for friends who are coming over for dinner, so more about that later.Whats also interesting is that Gopala is selling kachoris these days. It had muttar kachori (Rs. 10 a piece) and pyaaz kachori (Rs. 20). They were not bad, I was told, and had a very hot filling of peas and onions. But, of course, they cannot be compared with the hot kachoris that come out of kadhais in many sweet shops in various parts of Delhi.Kings special dishFrom Gopala, I went to Mirajuddins meat shop, just to tease him a bit. Do you have labbe, I asked him. Now labbe is a small piece near the liver which you very rarely find in meat shops.Mirajuddin looked stunned. No, he didnt have labbe, but he did have a story to tell. A badshah once wanted to feed his guests labbe. So a hundred goats were slaughtered for just one dish of labbe, he said.Thats some story, I said. And that was some trip down memory lane. And so what if the journey didnt lead to the desired kababs? I met some old friends, ate some good biscuits, and heard a nice story."
2019-01-19,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/grave-secrets-from-a-troubled-past/article26032658.ece,Grave secrets from a troubled past,"From 10 feet away, it looked like a grin, the row of teeth stretching from ear to ear. Freshly dug out from many layers of soil, the mud-covered skeleton lay on its spine, awaiting a number.That would be 283, says W.R.A.S. Rajapaksa. He is standing on an elevation inside the site, located at a busy junction in Mannar, an island town in Sri Lankas Tamil-majority Northern Province. In his blue smock, the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer at Mannar District General Hospital looks like a surgeon, except that this operation is taking place under the sun, inside a messy soil pit. So he is also wearing a cap and rubber boots.On a Monday morning earlier this month, at least four skeletons were clearly visible at the site, while parts of another were protruding from the soil. Where they lay  some piled one on top of the other and a couple to the side  it was at least two metres below ground level, says Rajapaksa, the chief investigator of the latest mass grave to be found in Sri Lanka.As of Friday (January 18), 300 skeletons, including those of 23 children below the age of 12, have been identified. Members of his team that comprised fellow judicial medical officers, forensic archaeologists and analysts had resumed excavating the skeletons after a break for Christmas and the New Year. Wetting their brushes in a cup of water, they gently pried aside the soil deposits over the bones, making them visible, little by little, to the world they had left behind.Scene of crimeWe consider this a scene of crime until proven otherwise, says Rajapaksa on what happens to be the 125th day of the excavation, being undertaken following a directive from the Mannar magistrate court. The bodies had been found dumped, instead of being laid to rest beside each other, as would be the case in a cemetery.In March 2018, construction workers stumbled upon human remains while preparing to build a new outlet for the state-run cooperative Sathosa (in place of its old building that had been demolished). Little did they know that they would be uncovering one of Sri Lankas largest mass graves almost a decade after the civil war ended in 2009.Says Rajapaksa, Of the 283 skeletons identified here so far, we have excavated 277 and stored them at the court premises.Samples will be sent to a laboratory in the U.S., in Miami, Florida, possibly next week, for carbon dating analysis. The process, which is often used in archaeology and forensic study, would ascertain the amount of Carbon-14 in bone and teeth samples. This could help establish the approximate period in which the person lived, before it possibly leads investigators to the likely year of their death or to those behind it.At 9.45 in the morning, the shops in the area are open and teeming with customers. With the post office, market and the bus terminus all in the same vicinity, a number of vehicles criss-cross the grand bazaar area, or periyakadai sandi as the locals call it. Motorists on their way to work slow down and turn their heads 90 degrees to catch a glimpse of the grave site that has drawn media attention to their otherwise neglected town.Pedestrians stop and watch for a few seconds. Perhaps deterred by the uniformed policemen and Special Task Force personnel stationed under a neem tree adjoining the site, some move a safe distance away before pulling out their smart phones for a picture of the ongoing exhumation.Mannar district, along Sri Lankas north-western coast, is part mainland and part small island, connected by a causeway. The mass grave has surfaced at the districts main town on Mannar island, a thin patch of land jutting into the Palk Strait like a little fin. On the western tip of this little island is Talaimannar, the closest point to Dhanushkodi in India, in Tamil Nadus Rameswaram district. Some 30 km apart and with a narrow stretch of the Indian Ocean running between them, Talaimannar and Rameswaram were once connected by a popular ferry service that, since the 1980s, has been defunct. In the nearly three decades of Sri Lankas civil war, waged by the state armed forces against the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), both towns bore witness to mass displacement, rough boat rides, and prolonged separation but also a precious solidarity among the common people.Business as usualSays Meeramohideen Salman, a vegetable vendor who has a small shop right opposite the mass grave site, It has not been a great season. I have had to slash prices to make sure I sell enough. On a good day, I make about LKR 3,500 a day [about Rs. 1,360], and it is barely enough to feed my family.The lull in business had little to do with the excavation nearby. Months of erratic weather  a severe drought followed by flash floods  had affected both the harvest and prices, adds Salman. He has been running the stall here for 12 years, he says, from the time he returned from Kalpitiya in Puttalam, some 240 km south, where many Muslims like him had fled after the LTTE ordered their expulsion from the north in October 1990.He says, Had the cooperative store come up across the road as planned, they would have sold vegetables like onions for at least five rupees lesser. That would have hit me harder.Even at the other shops adjoining the site, managers spoke only of practical hindrances. The trucks bringing their supplies from Colombo now stop at the main road, since the excavation site is cordoned off, along with the lane to these shops. The load is physically carried to the stores by workers, unlike earlier, when the trucks could drive into the lane. For the row of shops here, the implications of having a mass grave unearthed in their midst seemed, at best, logistical.Cycle of distressHowever, for some residents a little further away from the site, the excavation and the sighting of skeletal remains has meant another cycle of distress. Especially if they happen to be like the thousands of mothers looking for a loved one who forcibly disappeared during those tumultuous war years.A war that spanned 30 years, a savage state unleashing mass violence, armed militant groups offering resistance  at times with their own brand of brutality  have meant a massive human cost. The casualties were more than a lakh, as in some estimates. With the unresolved mysteries of the deaths and disappearances of Tamil rebels, activists, journalists, and scores of civilians haunting them for years, the survivors in the north struggle to recover from the everyday imprint of trauma. Even if they choose to look ahead rather than behind, healing is not easy as they strive to make ends meet in a battered economy with no promising jobs and few sympathetic political leaders who chose action over rhetoric.Amarasingam Ranjinis son, who was in the LTTE, went missing in the summer of 1999. He was born when she was still in her teens following her early marriage. They [army] took him for questioning, and he has not come back in these 20 years, she says. While her other son and daughter now live in India, Ranjini, 60, stays in her hometown all alone.She still hopes to see her son one day. I do believe he is alive somewhere and I will continue looking for him. But when I saw this mass grave site and heard about the hundreds of bodies being unearthed, I wondered if one of them could be my son. The thought did cross my mind, she says, breaking down, torn between denial and resignation.It was this double-edged fear that the Sri Lankan-born writer Michael Ondaatje described in his novel Anils Ghost . There was always the fear, double-edged, that it was their son in the pit, or that it was not their son  which meant there would be further searching, he wrote, of a fictional grave site with submerged bones.Mothers of those who disappeared in the run-up to the final phase of the war in 2009  many after being reportedly taken by state agencies for questioning  are far from accepting that their child could be dead. Those looking for relatives who went missing in the 1990s allow for that option, but have no way to reconcile with it in the absence of evidence, says Jena Jayakanthi, a Mannar-based activist working with the families of the disappeared. If you havent seen your childs body, how do you begin to believe that he is dead? she asks.The Sri Lankan Army has repeatedly denied having played a role, but has done little else to explain what happened to those its personnel picked up for questioning, or the others who were seen surrendering to its officers.Manoharan Vetrimalar, who is looking for her disappeared son and son-in-law, raises her grandchildren in Mannar while her daughter works in Saudi Arabia as a house help to support the family. She says, The grama sevaka (village officer) told me to obtain a death certificate for my missing relatives, so that I can receive some financial assistance for their loss. My daughter said nothing doing, we have not seen the body and we cannot accept that. But the families, she adds, are fatigued after years of petitioning different state commissions and repeating their stories. And then when a mass grave like this is found, it is very disturbing.Getting to the bottom of itApart from the troubling reality of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances coexisting with unexpectedly found human remains in the heart of town, the mass grave has also set off considerable speculation within and outside Mannar. Stories travel, supplemented by recollections of senior citizens some of whom remember a bank building at the site before the now-demolished cooperative store was built  and acquiring new details and narratives.Home to nearly 1 lakh people, mostly Tamils (Catholics, Hindus) and Tamil-speaking Muslims, Mannar is the most religiously diverse district in the north. During the war, the LTTE was in control of mainland Mannar, part of the Vanni region sandwiched between the Sinhala-majority south of Sri Lanka and the northern Jaffna peninsula. On the other hand, Mannar island itself was, for the most part, under the jurisdiction of the Sri Lankan Army and Navy, recalls Ranjini, quickly pulling out her 1999 Army IC or the identity card distributed by the Army, that was used to keep track of those moving between Mannar island and the mainland.Says Vetrimalar, Our district has seen a lot. I have very vivid images of shells piercing through walls, people falling dead, and of the many who were badly injured. Now, 10 years after the war ended, we are desperately looking for our missing relatives but no answers have been forthcoming. Shouldnt we know what really happened to them?The Sri Lankan government set up the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) in 2016 to investigate the scores of cases of missing persons, reported from both the former war zones in the north-east, and during the states ferocious crackdown on radical Sinhala youth in the south in the late 1980s. Amnesty International estimates a total of at least 60,000 disappearances in the country.The exact number of missing persons from Mannar is not clear. The OMP has so far not put out lists or numbers, perhaps because its own task includes comparing and verifying figures mentioned in previous lists compiled by other commissions.Says OMP chairman Saliya Pieris, The OMP has been acting as an observer in this case since June 2, 2018 as it is a mass grave site that may relate to cases of disappearances and missing persons that fall under our mandate. The office stepped in last year to financially support the excavation efforts and will also help transport the samples to a testing laboratory in Florida.Some among the families of the disappeared are sceptical of the OMPs ability to provide them the answers they have been chasing for years. Most of them have already testified before multiple government-appointed panels earlier, to no avail.Says Jeyakanthi, This is a state institution. How can a party accused of committing a crime probe it fairly and deliver justice to the victims?It was in March 2018, just around the time of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session in Geneva, that Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the commissioners to the OMP. The OMP has held at least seven public sittings in different districts in the war-affected north, east and the south, where disappearances have been reported.Says parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan at his party office a few hundred metres from the site, So far the OMP has at least been transparent about what they can and cant do. We need a thorough and complete investigation into this mass grave. People want a resolution.Reacting to the discovery of mass graves in Mannar, the international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch says, Sri Lankan authorities should ensure that the Office of Missing Persons is able to operate properly, and should set up an impartial transitional justice process that was pledged at the Human Rights Council.The last time mass graves were alleged in Mannar was in late 2013, near the famed Thiruketheeswaram Shiva temple, and later in 2016, in a well not far from this temple. The investigation into the 2013 sighting by the residents of the area is yet to be completed, with some officials reportedly declaring the grave to be a part of a cemetery. For locals, though, questions linger. In the 2016 case, investigators told the magistrate court that there were no human remains.The inquiry into the Matale mass grave found in 2012 in the islands Central Province has also stalled, despite the left-wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramunas (JVP) demands for a full investigation of the site where, some believe, its activists and sympathisers could have been interred during the state repression of the JVP in 1971 and again in 1987-89. Yet another mass grave in Kaluwanchikudy was found in the eastern Batticaloa district in 2014, but the excavation did not see much progress.In the recently-discovered site in Mannar, the team is working largely on a voluntary basis. Says Rajapaksa, who has led teams at two other mass graves in the past, There are no standard operating procedures in place in Sri Lanka to deal with mass graves.He says, We havent finished excavating yet. We will continue until we get to what we call a bone-free margin, to rule out any more bones, suggesting that the number of skeletons could increase further. Giving no room for speculation on who the dead may be and when they were killed, he adds, We cannot resort to any pre-judgment without evidence. These are bodies that have been heaped up. And no one knows who did this. No one, except those who did it. We have to find out. His observation echoes those of many mothers who desire to unearth the truth buried with the bodies. Until then, they will remain bare bones, carefully wrapped and safely stored, bearing only a number.If you havent seen your childs body, how do you begin to believe that he is dead?Jena Jayakanthi,Activist, Mannar"
2019-01-19,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/travel/bali-the-island-of-god/cid/1682194,An itinerary for your trip to Bali,"Thats the thing about Bali. It has something for everyone. Its good for a bachelors group, a honeymoon, a solo trip, or a vacay with the family. (Shutterstock)If there is one place on earth that has taught me to love, find myself, grow stronger and, of course, have a ball, it is Bali. My first brush with this Indonesian island was in 2010, when in the movie Eat Pray Love I watched a certain Elizabeth Gilbert played by Julia Roberts rediscover herself and find love there. Watching that movie, I, in turn, fell in love with this corner of the world.My first visit to Bali was in September 2014 and it has been followed up by two subsequent trips  a solo vacation in February 2018 and a work trip in September the same year.Over my three visits, I have discovered different sides of the island. The first one was all about exploring the place with my partner. The second time I landed up in Bali alone to look for peace and happiness. On the third trip, which was organised by VITO India, I went back to Bali happy and confident on a travel assignment. And all the trips were equally satisfying.Thats the thing about Bali. It has something for everyone. Its good for a bachelors group, a honeymoon, a solo trip, or a vacay with the family. Whatever be your situation, the diversity and beauty of Bali is bound to mesmerise you.Having travelled to Bali on my birthday in February, it seemed like deja vu when I boarded Thai Airways again in end-September and landed at Ngurah Rai International Airport, the only one on the island.This time, my agenda was to explore a side of Bali that I hadnt seen before and to do as many things as possible in the two days that I had. Heres a list of things you can do to make the most of a short trip to the Island of the Gods.Bali's golden hour when the sky turned into a canvas of red, golden, orange and pink (Pramita Ghosh)SAVOUR THE SUNSETMy fave part of the day was the golden hour when the sky turned into a canvas of red, golden, orange and pink as the sun seemed to go down into the water. And Beraban village of Tanah Lot is one of the best places to do that. Theres a Hindu temple on a rock formation on the shore here that makes the view quite spectacular. Get there by 5pm and you can even walk to the base of the temple if you feel up to it.A white coral from the beaches in Kuta (Pramita Ghosh)BUM ON THE BEACHTake a stroll on some of the beaches in Kuta and go coral and shell hunting for your aquarium. The one in the picture here is a white coral. Being a water baby, I simply sat by the beach, meditated and listened to the waves breaking on the shore. The whole experience was so therapeutic and calming! It was one of the best parts of a much-needed getaway from a busy, loud and noisy city.The grilled corn cob (in picture) is a popular street snack (Pramita Ghosh)SNACK STREET-STYLEThe grilled corn cob is a popular street snack, especially around tourist spots. You get it in butter, sweet, spicy and salty flavours. We loved the buttery and spicy ones, which are refreshingly different from those we have in Calcutta. If you find the spicy one too hot, soothe your palate with the local coconut ice cream that is served with coconut pulp, or malai, inside a coconut shell. Topping options include jam, sprinkles and Oreo cookies.Bitang beer, which is one of the cheapest tipples you can find. Pick it up at supermarkets for about IDR 15,000 (about Rs 74) (Pramita Ghosh)CHUG ITYou cant visit Bali and not swig Bitang beer, which is one of the cheapest tipples you can find. Pick it up at supermarkets for about IDR 15,000 (about Rs 74) or in an upscale pub for double that. The taste is almost similar to American pale lager and makes for a lovely sip on a hot day! Bitang is also by far one of the most popular T-shirt prints and youll find lots of tourists wearing their love for it on their chest.The mind-blowing Ulundanu Temple on the edge of the Bratan Lake in Bedugul is temple that you must visit (Pramita Ghosh)SAY YOUR PRAYERSContrary to the popular idea of Bali being a sea-sun-sand destination, there are numerous temples that merit a visit. The mind-blowing Ulundanu Temple on the edge of the Bratan Lake in Bedugul is one of them. Its a long drive from Kuta and I had dozed off on the way. So, it took me a while to wake up to the fact that I was in Bali. Once out of the car, the nippy air and gusts of wind gave me goosebumps. All that my eyes could see was a beautiful temple enveloped in mist with mountains peeking from the background.The temple in Candi Kuning village almost around 80km north of Denpasar, Ulundanu, is believed to have been built in the 17th century and dedicated to the Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva triumvirate as well as Devi Danu. There are plenty of spots around where you can go into click mode. One can also take a boat out onto the waters, but sudden rain ruled that out for me. Carry a shawl and an umbrella.If beach clubs are what you are after, you will be spoilt for choice at Seminyak, which has famous Ku De Ta, Potato Head and the beautiful La Plancha that is a very popular with Instagrammers, thanks to its colourful tents on the beach. (Pramita Ghosh)GO PARTYIf you are a party animal, then Bali wont disappoint you. Kuta, Legian and Seminyak are the liveliest areas with the whole gamut of party places from easy-on-the-pocket watering holes to swank nightclubs like Sky Garden. If you want to enjoy all of it in one night, head for Legian which has everything from karaoke bars and beer clubs to night markets. And you cannot miss the girls on stilts (right) who welcome tourists to the bars and pubs there. If beach clubs are what you are after, you will be spoilt for choice at Seminyak, which has famous Ku De Ta, Potato Head and the beautiful La Plancha that is a very popular with Instagrammers, thanks to its colourful tents on the beach. Its a perfect sunset spot too. Want to be happening? Head straight to Rock Bar in Badung where even a certain Alia Bhatt was spotted chilling with her friends.The bustling tourist areas like Legian are dotted with affordable shopping options selling the de rigeur cane and straw handbags (Pramita Ghosh)SHOP TILL YOU DROPThe Indonesian rupiah is one of the currencies against which the Indian rupee has a favourable exchange rate (Re 1 is about 200 IDR). Its just the thing you need to go on a buying binge. And when youre on a travel assignment, you cannot but shop for your family and friends. The bustling tourist areas like Legian are dotted with affordable shopping options selling the de rigeur cane and straw handbags. For something more exclusive, stroll into boutiques in Seminyak which are loaded with very swish outfits that are more pricey, but well worth the money.Indulge in nasi ayam (chicken and rice) and, particularly, nasi campur (Pramita Ghosh)EAT LOCALIndulge in nasi ayam (chicken and rice) and, particularly, nasi campur. The second has rice, satay, betutu (chicken or duck stuffed with spices), prawn wafers, and mixed veggies served with spicy sambal matah. A salad of chopped raw onion and chillies and boiled eggs are often part of this dish. Its an entire meal in itself and considered Balis substitute for nasi goreng. A self-confessed bheto Bangali, I feasted on this rice delicacy almost every day!Take a leap of faith and go parasailing or opt for kayaking in the crystal clear sea for very reasonable rates (Pramita Ghosh)HIT THE WATERYou cannot be on a beach vacay and not indulge in watersport. Although Kuta offers a lot of options, you can drive down to the Pandawa beach, a new tourist spot located in the Kutuh district of south Kuta. Hidden between high cliffs and trees, this secret beach is named after the five Pandavas, so you will spot huge statues of Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadewa when you enter the beach area. Take a leap of faith and go parasailing or opt for kayaking in the crystal clear sea for very reasonable rates.Getting on a swing hanging from the tops of palm trees with lo-o-ong ropes (Pramita Ghosh)SUSPEND FEARIf youve been fascinated with Instagram videos of people swinging high up in the sky with a sea of greenery below them, then its time to strike the Bali Swing off your bucket list. Getting on a swing hanging from the tops of palm trees with lo-o-ong ropes is one of the most touristy things you can do. Or snap yourself and your bae in a nest swing for that perfect IG post! Prices for a go on the swing vary from place to place, but IDR 100,000 (about Rs 500) will get you almost unlimited number of swings.Where to stay?Bali Dynasty Resort (Pramita Ghosh)Bali Dynasty ResortWhere: On the beach in Jalan Kartika, South KutaHow to reach: Its a 10-minute drive from Ngurah Rai International AirportFacilities: It has six restaurants, five bars, three swimming pools, the Ashoka Spa, a gym, a beach club and Gracie Kellys Irish Pub.

Especially if they happen to be like the thousands of mothers looking for a loved one who forcibly disappeared during those tumultuous war years.A war that spanned 30 years, a savage state unleashing mass violence, armed militant groups offering resistance  at times with their own brand of brutality  have meant a massive human cost. The casualties were more than a lakh, as in some estimates. With the unresolved mysteries of the deaths and disappearances of Tamil rebels, activists, journalists, and scores of civilians haunting them for years, the survivors in the north struggle to recover from the everyday imprint of trauma. Even if they choose to look ahead rather than behind, healing is not easy as they strive to make ends meet in a battered economy with no promising jobs and few sympathetic political leaders who chose action over rhetoric.Amarasingam Ranjinis son, who was in the LTTE, went missing in the summer of 1999. He was born when she was still in her teens following her early marriage. They [army] took him for questioning, and he has not come back in these 20 years, she says. While her other son and daughter now live in India, Ranjini, 60, stays in her hometown all alone.She still hopes to see her son one day. I do believe he is alive somewhere and I will continue looking for him. But when I saw this mass grave site and heard about the hundreds of bodies being unearthed, I wondered if one of them could be my son. The thought did cross my mind, she says, breaking down, torn between denial and resignation.It was this double-edged fear that the Sri Lankan-born writer Michael Ondaatje described in his novel Anils Ghost . There was always the fear, double-edged, that it was their son in the pit, or that it was not their son  which meant there would be further searching, he wrote, of a fictional grave site with submerged bones.Mothers of those who disappeared in the run-up to the final phase of the war in 2009  many after being reportedly taken by state agencies for questioning  are far from accepting that their child could be dead. Those looking for relatives who went missing in the 1990s allow for that option, but have no way to reconcile with it in the absence of evidence, says Jena Jayakanthi, a Mannar-based activist working with the families of the disappeared. If you havent seen your childs body, how do you begin to believe that he is dead? she asks.The Sri Lankan Army has repeatedly denied having played a role, but has done little else to explain what happened to those its personnel picked up for questioning, or the others who were seen surrendering to its officers.Manoharan Vetrimalar, who is looking for her disappeared son and son-in-law, raises her grandchildren in Mannar while her daughter works in Saudi Arabia as a house help to support the family. She says, The grama sevaka (village officer) told me to obtain a death certificate for my missing relatives, so that I can receive some financial assistance for their loss. My daughter said nothing doing, we have not seen the body and we cannot accept that. But the families, she adds, are fatigued after years of petitioning different state commissions and repeating their stories. And then when a mass grave like this is found, it is very disturbing.Getting to the bottom of itApart from the troubling reality of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances coexisting with unexpectedly found human remains in the heart of town, the mass grave has also set off considerable speculation within and outside Mannar. Stories travel, supplemented by recollections of senior citizens some of whom remember a bank building at the site before the now-demolished cooperative store was built  and acquiring new details and narratives.Home to nearly 1 lakh people, mostly Tamils (Catholics, Hindus) and Tamil-speaking Muslims, Mannar is the most religiously diverse district in the north. During the war, the LTTE was in control of mainland Mannar, part of the Vanni region sandwiched between the Sinhala-majority south of Sri Lanka and the northern Jaffna peninsula. On the other hand, Mannar island itself was, for the most part, under the jurisdiction of the Sri Lankan Army and Navy, recalls Ranjini, quickly pulling out her 1999 Army IC or the identity card distributed by the Army, that was used to keep track of those moving between Mannar island and the mainland.Says Vetrimalar, Our district has seen a lot. I have very vivid images of shells piercing through walls, people falling dead, and of the many who were badly injured. Now, 10 years after the war ended, we are desperately looking for our missing relatives but no answers have been forthcoming. Shouldnt we know what really happened to them?The Sri Lankan government set up the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) in 2016 to investigate the scores of cases of missing persons, reported from both the former war zones in the north-east, and during the states ferocious crackdown on radical Sinhala youth in the south in the late 1980s. Amnesty International estimates a total of at least 60,000 disappearances in the country.The exact number of missing persons from Mannar is not clear. The OMP has so far not put out lists or numbers, perhaps because its own task includes comparing and verifying figures mentioned in previous lists compiled by other commissions.Says OMP chairman Saliya Pieris, The OMP has been acting as an observer in this case since June 2, 2018 as it is a mass grave site that may relate to cases of disappearances and missing persons that fall under our mandate. The office stepped in last year to financially support the excavation efforts and will also help transport the samples to a testing laboratory in Florida.Some among the families of the disappeared are sceptical of the OMPs ability to provide them the answers they have been chasing for years. Most of them have already testified before multiple government-appointed panels earlier, to no avail.Says Jeyakanthi, This is a state institution. How can a party accused of committing a crime probe it fairly and deliver justice to the victims?It was in March 2018, just around the time of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session in Geneva, that Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the commissioners to the OMP. The OMP has held at least seven public sittings in different districts in the war-affected north, east and the south, where disappearances have been reported.Says parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan at his party office a few hundred metres from the site, So far the OMP has at least been transparent about what they can and cant do. We need a thorough and complete investigation into this mass grave. People want a resolution.Reacting to the discovery of mass graves in Mannar, the international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch says, Sri Lankan authorities should ensure that the Office of Missing Persons is able to operate properly, and should set up an impartial transitional justice process that was pledged at the Human Rights Council.The last time mass graves were alleged in Mannar was in late 2013, near the famed Thiruketheeswaram Shiva temple, and later in 2016, in a well not far from this temple. The investigation into the 2013 sighting by the residents of the area is yet to be completed, with some officials reportedly declaring the grave to be a part of a cemetery. For locals, though, questions linger. In the 2016 case, investigators told the magistrate court that there were no human remains.The inquiry into the Matale mass grave found in 2012 in the islands Central Province has also stalled, despite the left-wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramunas (JVP) demands for a full investigation of the site where, some believe, its activists and sympathisers could have been interred during the state repression of the JVP in 1971 and again in 1987-89. Yet another mass grave in Kaluwanchikudy was found in the eastern Batticaloa district in 2014, but the excavation did not see much progress.In the recently-discovered site in Mannar, the team is working largely on a voluntary basis. Says Rajapaksa, who has led teams at two other mass graves in the past, There are no standard operating procedures in place in Sri Lanka to deal with mass graves.He says, We havent finished excavating yet. We will continue until we get to what we call a bone-free margin, to rule out any more bones, suggesting that the number of skeletons could increase further. Giving no room for speculation on who the dead may be and when they were killed, he adds, We cannot resort to any pre-judgment without evidence. These are bodies that have been heaped up. And no one knows who did this. No one, except those who did it. We have to find out. His observation echoes those of many mothers who desire to unearth the truth buried with the bodies. Until then, they will remain bare bones, carefully wrapped and safely stored, bearing only a number.If you havent seen your childs body, how do you begin to believe that he is dead?Jena Jayakanthi,Activist, Mannar"
2019-01-19,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/of-lavash-and-labbe/article26033031.ece,Of lavash and labbe,"Allow me to get philosophical for a moment. I have come to the conclusion that some days are just meant to be. In our mad, rush-hour existence, we are often disappointed when a mission doesnt lead to the goal in mind. After a pleasant half hour loitering around in Prithviraj Market and meeting old friends, I say, So what? Whats a goal, after all?Searching for kababsLet me start at the beginning. I wanted to eat some kababs, and I wanted to try out a small kabab corner that I had noticed in Khan Market a few weeks ago. I went there and discovered that the barbecue was still to be lit. So I started walking towards Prithviraj Market, where my car was parked. I like this part of Khan Market because it is not glitzy like its mega-rich cousin on the other side of the road. This side is still middle class and has two of the best meat shops in New Delhi. I first went past my old favourite  The Meat Shop  run by a very enthusiastic and polite youngS man. I was happy to meet him after years, and happier still to find that my old butcher and fish slicer were still there. I doffed my cap to them, and then went in search of another old favourite, Mirajuddin.But before that, I stopped by at a new Gopala outlet. The Khan Market branch of the popular sweet shop, which now sells a whole lot of other products (such as namkeen and breads), had opened last month. I had heard from a friend that they were selling various kinds of cheese, but the only cheese they had was the pizza variety. I love their rasgullas, but bought some of the kalakand instead (Rs. 560 a kilo; nice, mildly sweet, but could have been just a bit more moist), some lavash (Rs. 50 a packet), crusty garlic butter slices (Rs. 40), jeera ajwain biscuits (Rs. 120), walnut bran biscuits (Rs. 210) and coconut biscuits (Rs. 108). The coconut biscuits were superb, the jeera ajwain biscuits werent bad either and I am told the walnut bran cookies were rather good, too. The bread is for friends who are coming over for dinner, so more about that later.Whats also interesting is that Gopala is selling kachoris these days. It had muttar kachori (Rs. 10 a piece) and pyaaz kachori (Rs. 20). They were not bad, I was told, and had a very hot filling of peas and onions. But, of course, they cannot be compared with the hot kachoris that come out of kadhais in many sweet shops in various parts of Delhi.Kings special dishFrom Gopala, I went to Mirajuddins meat shop, just to tease him a bit. Do you have labbe, I asked him. Now labbe is a small piece near the liver which you very rarely find in meat shops.Mirajuddin looked stunned. No, he didnt have labbe, but he did have a story to tell. A badshah once wanted to feed his guests labbe. So a hundred goats were slaughtered for just one dish of labbe, he said.Thats some story, I said. And that was some trip down memory lane. And so what if the journey didnt lead to the desired kababs? I met some old friends, ate some good biscuits, and heard a nice story."

Creation of an exclusive budget will lead to more allocation of funds for agriculture, make crop insurance payouts, fixing of minimum support prices and loan waivers easier. With agriculture just a part of the general budget, the allocation it receives is minimal compared to industries, defence, railways and other sectors, association president S Palanisamy said.Fixing a minimum support price for staple crops like tomato and small onion, spices like turmeric and pepper, and grains was critical for farmers survival, the petition said. Only if you have an exclusive budget will you calculate the cost of calculation of a specific crop. During crop damage, you have to take that cost, add a little more money and pay it out to the farmer. Or at least the cost of cultivation has to be given to the farmer, district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivaisaigal Sangam P Kandasamy said. Minimum support price is critical to support farmers when onion prices crash, like it did last year. Also, once fund is allocated for it, the government will find it easier to distribute it.Agriculture is also an industry, which also requires support, the petition said. The number of farmers in the country is steadily decreasing and more families are moving to urban areas. Unless you recognize agriculture as an industry, giving it the loans, loan waivers and support prices required, more and more farmers will keep quitting and one day, we will have a food shortage, Palanisamy added."

However, significant inter-state differences persist with the highest consumer inflation in Kerala at 6% and the lowest in Odisha at 2.2%, the CRISIL report said.Apart from Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the inflation was below 4.5% in all other states in the country.Commenting on the study, Krishnakumar K K, senior fellow, Centre for Socio-economic and Environmental Studies (CSES), said that it was the agrarian crisis that had brought down inflation and even caused deflation in the rest of the country. The deflation in the agriculture sector has pulled the inflation rate down right from north Indian states till up to Tamil Nadu. If you review the last five years, you could see that it was farmers who had suffered the most as prices of their products experienced severe fluctuations while heading to a crash, he said.At the height of the crisis, the farmers in Maharashtra were forced to sell onion for as cheap as 25 paisa per kg a couple of months ago. They were happy even when they had to sell the produce for Rs 2-3 per kg, Krishnakumar said.On the other hand, prices rarely experienced a significant decline in Kerala which is a consumer state. Onion prices rarely went below Rs 20 per kg in Kerala. In addition, the increase in transportation costs and the profit-making middlemen hindered the drop in inflation rates, he noted. Even though Kerala had recorded the highest rate, the 6% rate is quite normal, he added."

This is for the first time that such a shift has been witnessed, he added.Crop production is up 1.5% year on year and about 8% higher than the previous five years average. Singh said horticulture production contributes 29% of the countrys GDP. This despite horticulture occupying only 14% of the total area under agriculture at 140 million hectares. Potato, tomato, onion, brinjal, mango and banana are other major horticulture crops the country is producing, he added.A senior researcher from ICAR said with increasing production, India is set to expand its footprint in horticulture crop exports on the global trade map. Potato, onion, mango and banana are in high demand in other countries. For the first time, we recently exported bananas from Tamil Nadu, he added.Researchers attribute the rise in production to higher returns farmers are getting per unit area of cultivation. While paddy gives a maximum yield of only 30 quintals per hectare for a cultivator, the same for banana is 400q/ha and grape is 100q/ ha. Consumption of horticulture crops which are rich in vitamins and nutrients, has also gone up. Farmers are investing in flowers used for decorative purposes as well, he added."

High production depresses prices and farmers are left in the lurch.Production of high-focus TOP (tomato, onion and potato) is estimated to be higher than the output of these crops in 2017-18 with potato at 52.58 MT recording 6% growth, followed by tomato (2% higher) and onion (1.5% higher).Records show that horticulture production has been consistently rising since 2012-13. Production is up. Producer is down. Thats the story of Indian agriculture, tweeted Yogendra Yadav , national president of Swaraj India who has been raising farm related issues.The remarks summed up what other observers too feel about growing production of not only horticultural produce but also of foodgrains. Record production of horticulture crops is the result of favourable weather and expectations of higher income based on past experience. But record production is not translating into higher returns, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said.Panwar, a farm expert and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, cited two major reasons for it. First, the central governments policy of containing inflation in food items and second, over-dominance of middlemen in supply chain of fruits and vegetables, specifically corporates, in some segments, he told TOI.Initial efforts of government such as price stabilisation funds and boost of food processing industry could not be rolled out because of budgetary constraints and lack of focused approach, he added.Actual production figures of horticultural crops in 2017-18 show that fruits recorded slightly higher growth than vegetables. Production of fruits in 2017-18 was estimated at 97.35 MT which was 4.8% higher than the previous year. Vegetables output at 187.5 MT in 2017-18, on the other hand, was 3.5% higher than 2016-17."

Well, well, they are those made of egg, theres also Shahi Mutton Halwa, and Chicken Halwa, to name a few.It is very difficult to convert mutton into a sweet dish, and cook it without onion and garlic. It took me almost six hours to prepare it, as it is a slow cooking procedure, said Hritik Rawar, student of first year hotel management at the college. Dev Kartik, another first year student, said: Egg bhurji and egg toast are passe in breakfast. When it comes to sweets, one can have egg halwa with mix fruit. Consuming a lot of time, rajma halwa was prepared by Aditi, another first year student. She said: Instead of sugar, I have used stevia leaves and rajma. This halwa is rich in protein content, but it took me almost three hours to cook.Halwas of fruits like mango, pomegranate, dragon fruit, coconut, papaya, cheeku, guava, apple, caramel, banana, plum, raw mango, blueberry, strawberry, and water chest were made by students with the puree of fresh fruits. Same goes for vegetables like potatoes topped with sweet French fries, spinach, cauliflower, and raddish. Bitter gourd  a vegetable that has less demand in the market  was also used to make halwa.Halwas for kidsKeeping nutritional values alive and the varying mood of kids in mind, students have also made halwas for children from cherry, gems, toffee pudding, and custard vanilla halwa.Payal Bassi, a first year student, used multi-vitamin bread, jam, nuts, and desi ghee to make halwa. She said: I have used this because my nephew loves jam, but he gets bored of carrying bread and jam to school on a regular basis. Thus, I chose this ingredient so that they can remain healthy by eating this halwa.Anirban Gupta, dean, Hotel Management and Aviation & Tourism at the college, said: In todays generation, everyone is after fast food. It is especially difficult for parents to feed them nutritious food like spinach, gooseberry, broccoli, woodapple (bel), bitter gourd, and pumpkin. We have made them in the form of halwa with a pizza base.Exotic halwasOther exotic halwas include dry fruits like pista, almonds, rawa kesari, mix fruit, khuskhus, walnut, khajoor, sesame, kaju, and kiwi, which were inspired by the Mughal period, as these ingredients are known for valour and strength.For health-conscious people, there were halwas made of oats and cornflakes, and mix root halwa (made of red and black carrot, and beetroot). Sweets with high sugar like chamcham, mix barfi, gulab jamun, milk cake, rabri, panjiri, balushahi, white rasgulla, and cottage cheese were also used with a donut base, so that they can relish both the sweet and the halwa.To make it to the international market, students have come up with innovative ideas like use of orange brownie, cookies, red velvet, cheese cake, tiramisu, Kit Kat, Oreo, fudge cake, and chocolate. Simran, a second year student, said: I have a bakery, but I am unable to serve an Indian sweet dish like halwa to people. So, to make it to the international market, I have tried an orange brownie.Students have also attempted acid-based ingredients like pineapple for making halwa. As milk gets curdled due to high acid content, they found processing could be done by tossing it into a sugar cane syrup or stevia leaves. The same process goes for lemon and orange.With their hard work to push a typical Indian dish into the international market, students have planned to sell it in the open market. They said hotel chefs could also approach them for recipes. Interestingly, these halwas will be served in the campus at reasonable prices through canning.WAH! KYA HALWA!* Some of the varieties included Exotic Halwa, Rasgulla Halwaizza, Cornflax Halwaizza, Pan Gulkand Halwaizza, Tiramisu Halwaizza, Mughal Gosht Halwaizza, Orange Brownie Halwaizza, Sarso Ka Saag Halwaizza, Murg Halwaizza, and Karachi Halwaizza.* The guests at the event were Kavita Bahuguna, famous food and hotel reviewer-writer, chef Sudhanshu, general manager from Maharaja Grand, celebrity chef Neelu Kaura, chef Shibiraj Saha, executive chef from Park Plaza, and chef Paramjeet Singh, executive chef from Keys Hotel.* The students showcased a lot of creative and innovative ideas for the event, where Hritik Rawat from BHMCT first year bagged the First Prize for Gosht Halwaizza, followed by Aditi from BTTM first year who bagged the second prize for Rajma Halwaizza, and the third prize was bagged by Gurkaran from BHMCT second year for Pan Gulkand Halwaizza."

Yet I gathered the courage to see Thackeray because I was curious. I never thought I would say this, but I found Thackeray to be a rather well-made propaganda film. I certainly disagree with its politics, but I shuddered thinking to myself and discussing with a friend seated next to me the consequences of a well-made propaganda film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui delivered a most convincing performance as the eponymous central character. While in the same column some months ago, I had critiqued his portrayal of Manto, his performance as Bal Thackeray made me sit up and take notice. Here was a good actor delivering a consummate performance.I was at a loss. Should I applaud him for his performance or critique what he was choosing to portray on screen? Manto and Thackeray are worlds apart. The actor does his job. He moves on to his next role, but can a role be performed without convincing yourself about the character you are essaying on screen? Isnt acting fiction though? I had several questions but no easy answers.The combination of Siddiquis performance and the films almost compelling storytelling readily pulls you into the narrative. It also occurred to me then that cinema as a mass medium can be used to transform fiction into fact. We often argue that there are numerous ways of writing and recording history beyond academic history books. Cinema has often reached where no book has been able to tread. Think about Ingmar Bergmans exposition of time and Michelangelo Antonionis evocation of space. Through repeated viewing, images often attain a new power, a new historical truth. They can transform our understanding of events. Several war films fit into this bracket. Cinema can create or endorse new histories and this to me was the alarming aspect of the film.This year several propaganda films were made in Bollywood: The Accidental Prime Minister , Uri: The Surgical Strike , Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi . While the timing of their release is anybodys guess, these films clearly serve a nationalist agenda benefiting a certain political ideology.One also cannot dismiss the commercial aspect of such decision-making when there is enormous public interest in seeing the lives of well-known and much debated political personalities on screen and other events from the recent past such as the Uri surgical strike, which drew much attention.For most filmgoers, it is their date with history, their chance to witness an event up-close to form an opinion based on the films rendition. Films then become the new truth. To tackle this phenomenon we need a more discerning viewership.The writer teaches literary and cultural studies at FLAME University, Pune"

Of the 237 FPCs associated with the MAHAFPC  the apex body of FPCs in Maharashtra  only 40 per cent are active in agri-business initiatives.AdvertisingRegistered under the Companies Act, FPCs are village-level enterprises formed by farmers and are projected as a better alternative to cooperative bodies. The FPCs allow farmers the bargaining power to seek better prices for their produce.In Maharashtra, FPCs are mostly involved in the trading of soya bean, maize and onion.Records with the MAHAFPC show that the year 2016-17 was perhaps the best in terms of turnover.AdvertisingEmpowered by the state government to take part in the procurement under price support fund (PSF), 149 FPCs had taken part in the process and had reported a turnover of Rs 167 crore. The MAHAFPC had asked for inclusion in the subsequent years price support scheme (PSS). However, the state government did not agree.In 2017-18, FPCs reported a turnover of Rs 9 crore after taking part in market linkages for soya bean and maize. As many as 21 FPCs had handled 2,746 tonne of soya bean and 1,949 tonne of maize that year, said Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MAHAFPC.This year, 25 FPCs handled the onion procurement operations of the central government and the total turnover of the operations was slated to be Rs 7.5 crore. Apart from this, 12 FPCs are engaged in interstate trade of onion and have a turnover of Rs 1.47 crore. Also, 12 FPCs are linked to soy bean processors for supply of raw seed and sold 468.27 MT of soybean worth Rs 1.55 crore, added Thorat. As many as 100 FPCs are engaged in seed production and providing agriculture inputs, among other activities.As figures show, the FPCs are still finding their way in the world of commodity trade but the tax holiday has certainly come at an opportune moment. It was a great relief to the farmers institutions. Also, this decision paves the way towards incentivising FPCs, said Thorat.He added that he was hopeful that this years Budget will pay attention to the convergence of FPCs in value chain activities."

Farmers from the parched areas of Marathwada , sugar belt of western Maharashtra and onion growers from Nashik felt the government dole was meagre and would not even feed their families for a few days.The Centre launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM KISAN), offering direct income support of Rs 6,000 a year for farmers having cultivable land of up to two hectares. Interim finance minister Piyush Goyal said the scheme will benefit 12 crore farmers in the country.The scheme announcing benefit of Rs 500/ month for farmers is like making a mockery of their woes. This is a drought year and farmers were hoping for relief from the budget, which has failed them, said Ajit Navale, state general secretary, All-India Kisan Sabha."

Over the last two years, wholesale price of each and every agricultural commodity has been below the government declared Minimum Support Price. As a result, farmers have landed deeper in debt. What will this pittance of an amount do, he asked.He pointed out that the scheme has been announced months before the Lok Sabha election, and may be corrected by the government that comes to power next. This is clearly a move to placate farmers who are angry with the governmentbut it will not have much effect, he said.AdvertisingIn Maharashtra, 45.2 per cent of land holdings of farmers are up to 2 hectares, but the majority of such holdings are in the relatively prosperous region of western Maharashtra. Farmers in drought-prone regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada have larger land holdings, and they will not get any benefits from the scheme.Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takli village in Niphad taluka of Nashik, said it would have been better if the government had not announced the scheme. Over the last one year, onion prices have touched rock bottom. We have not been able to repay our bank loans and we had hoped for a scheme to mitigate the crisis, but there was nothing in the Budget, he said.Gorade said because of the low prices of their produce, most farmers in Nashik region were likely to default on their loans this year. There was no mention of the implementation of the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Committee in the Budget, he said.The Swaminathan Committee has recommended that farmers should realise 1.5 times of their production cost.Deepak Bhise, a farmer from the village of Yedgaon in Punes Junnar taluka, also criticised the move. By raising the price of fertilisers and other agricultural inputs, the government has already increased the expenditure borne by farmer. This move is not even worth peanuts for us, he said."

In horticulture, farmers have option to sell produce every 2 months and get remuneration.In Indore district, acreage under horticulture crop has risen to about 20 per cent of the total cultivable land.Horticulture crops are mostly 45-50 days crops and about 4 to 5 crops can be cultivated in a year unlike agriculture crops that are long duration with two main season kharif and rabi.Experts said in coming years cultivation of horticulture crop is seen expanding further with advancement in improvement in logistics facility and growing market locally and nearby.Kailash Agrawal, an agriculture expert said, The weather and soil of the region is well suited for horticulture and at the same time lot of units are coming, who are directly purchasing crops on advance demand from farmers for bulk supply and consumption in processing units."

The rates will continue to be low for another three to four weeks, said Panaji vegetable vendor, Jafar Mokashi.Another seller Rafiq Saigal said that the stock mainly arrives from Belagavi to Goa. The rates have decreased in Belagavi, going at Rs 15 per kg, due to which we have also reduced the wholesale prices here, he said.Besides onions, the sale of other essentials like tomato, coriander and potatoes also brought forth enthusiastic customers.With prices of most commodities being at an all-time high, it had become problematic for the average middle-class family to manage finances. The declining prices of vegetables has come as a welcome relief for us, said a housewife from Porvorim.Another buyer, Yesha Madan, from Panaji said that while the low prices are a good trend, efforts must be made by the horticulture department to ensure that vegetable rates remain pocket-friendly throughout the year.There must be more focus on organic vegetables, otherwise theres no point in buying vegetables that are cheap, she said."

The Sena chief also criticised the letter from the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), which conveyed good wishes to the activist, as condemnable and laughable.Hazare said, The Modi government is nearing completion of its full tenure, but it has not shown any inclination towards appointing a Lokpal. It is merely giving false promises to the people, said Hazare.Hundreds of villagers visit the Yadav Baba temple at the main square of the village every day to express their solidarity with Hazare.The veteran activist slammed the governments latest move of allocating Rs 6,000 per year to small farmers in the recently presented interim budget, saying it was trying to woo the community ahead of this years general elections. We have been demanding that the government start a monthly pension of Rs 5,000 for farmers who are aged over 60 and do not have a source of livelihood. The Rs 6,000 allocation is paltry as farmers will get only Rs 500 per month. How can they benefit from this amount? In fact, it is a bribe to the distressed farmers to get their votes in the upcoming elections, he said.Hazare said the NDA government has neither introduced progressive policies nor has taken positive decisions to resolve farmers issues. But at the same time, the government has exempted lakhs of crores of tax and loans of businessmen, he added.Such moves clearly show that the Modi government is more worried about businessmen than farmers. Even after 72 years of Independence, farmers are committing suicides, he said, alleging that the government was lying by claiming that it has given good prices for farm produce. If that is so, then why are farmers throwing their produce like onions, potatoes, tomatoes and milk on the roads? he asked.Hazare said the NDA government has not considered the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission. He also took a dig at other political leaders saying that they are now trying to project themselves as clean in a bid to gain political mileage in the elections.Earlier in the day, Hazare told the media that he was losing faith in chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as he had not fulfilled the promises he had made while convincing him (Hazare) to withdraw his fast on March 29 last year at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi. The CM has not fulfilled any of his promises relating to mitigating the problems of farmers and the appointment of Lokpal/Lokayukta, he said.On Sunday evening, state minister for water resources Girish Mahajan, who has been acting as an emissary between the government and Hazare, visited Ralegan Siddhi and had a closed-door meeting with Hazare for almost half an hour.Speaking to TOI, Mahajan said, I apprised Anna about various welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat health scheme and the subsidy on drip irrigation. I also explained that the state government has implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and has bought farmers produce with 1.5 MSP in the last few years. As far as appointment of a Lokayukta is concerned, I told him how it has got delayed due to various administrative issues and how the government will implement it at the earliest.Hazares personal secretary Datta Awari told TOI, The minister assured Anna that the state government will accept all his demands including implementation of the Swaminathan commissions recommendations. He also spoke to the chief minister over the phone for five minutes and discussed the same issues. As far as the central government issues are concerned, the minister promised that the PMO will soon communicate to the activist by Monday.Leader of the opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and former state agriculture minister Balasaheb Thorat met the activist and urged him to end the hunger strike considering his age and health issues. They also assured that they would put pressure on the government to consider Hazares demands, Awari said.Hazares office has, meanwhile, issued a statement calling upon his followers to intensify their agitation across the country."

That's when all members of a family get together iStockHappy New Year:  (xn nin kui l)No, we aren't wishing you a month late. Just wishing you on behalf of our neighbours. The Chinese New Year starts on February 5, 2019 and this, the Year of the Pig, will last until January 24, 2020. (In Chinese culture, pigs are a symbol of wealth.)Like every other festival it is time to celebrate it...with food.For the Chinese the most important meal of the year is the New Year's Eve reunion dinner. That's when all members of a family get together. No matter where you are, you must return to your hometown. If you can't make it, there will be a place at the table for you and a spare set of utensils will be placed to mark your presence.The Chinese New Year also marks the advent of spring. Legend has it that at the beginning of spring, the monster Nian would come and terrorise the villages. The people would hide in their homes, prepare a feast with offerings to the ancestors and gods, and hope for the best. And hence feasting has become a vital aspect of celebrating the Chinese New Year.Most of South East Asia and even Western countries with large Chinese populations are setting the table for the New Year meal. Theres a seat at the table saved for you too. To ring in the Chinese New Year, several Chinese restaurants across the country are offering special menus around February 5.But what is it that you should be eating?Peking Duck Bao at Pan Asian at ITC Sonar, Calcutta ITC SonarDuckAmongst most people who enjoy Chinese cuisine, Peking Duck with its crisp skin and savoury meat is a favourite. It is also auspicious to have it as you celebrate Chinese New Year as it symbolises fidelity. The Pan Asian at ITC Sonar in Calcutta offers its version of the Peking Duck Bao. ""The duck is marinated for an hour with a stuffing of onion, ginger, leek, hoisin sauce, salt and pepper, after which its skin is removed. The duck is then washed and soaked in honey for eight to 10 hours before being cooked in the oven for 40-45 minutes. Once ready, thin slices of meat are stuffed inside a bao and a dash of hoisin sauce, leek and cucumber are added to enhance the taste,"" says ITC Sonar's executive chef Vijay Malhotra. The restaurant is offering a special a la carte menu all through February.In northern China, families traditionally spend New Year's Eve together preparing the dumplings to be eaten at midnight iStockDumplingsDumplings are a must. This dish is associated with wealth and it is said that the more dumplings you eat during the festivities, the more money will come in the year ahead. In northern China, families traditionally spend New Year's Eve together preparing the dumplings to be eaten at midnight. In Chinese, dumplings sound like jio zi. Jio means exchange and zi means midnight. In other words, by eating dumplings you are sending away the old and welcoming the new.The roof-top restaurant Baoshuan at The Oberoi, New Delhi, is mentored by Michelin star chef Andrew Wong and has a repertoire of handcrafted dim sums. The restaurant is offering a six-course set dinner menu to celebrate the Chinese New Year between February 5 and 8.FishIf you are out to celebrate Chinese New Year, fish is a must. It symbolises surplus and wealth. In Chinese, the word fish has the same pronunciation as the word for surplus or extra. So the typical Chinese blessing Nin nin yuy, wishes you to have a surplus of food and money every year. Or it could mean have more fish. Chef Fu Hai at The Hong Kong Club at Andaz, Delhi, has curated a special tasting menu to celebrate Chinese New Year with a wide variety of seafood including crispy Red Snapper and Lobster. It's on offer from February 4 to 10.In Southern China spring rolls are eaten to celebrate the coming of spring Wikimedia CommonsSpring RollsEver wondered where spring rolls got their name from? In Southern China they are eaten to celebrate the coming of spring. Since the Chinese New Year is a spring festival it's only logical that you order a plate or two of one of the most popular Chinese dishes in India --the spring roll.Shredded chicken at Shanghai Club ITC Grand Central, MumbaiChickenIn Chinese culture chicken represents reunion and rebirth. While traditionally the whole chicken is cooked complete with head and claws, you can try the various chicken delicacies on offer, such as the shredded chicken by Chef Jia at the Shanghai Club at ITC Grand Central in Mumbai. The restaurant is celebrating Chinese New Year for six months by showcasing cuisines from one particular region of China every month for a week, starting with Sichuan cuisine.NoodlesWhile no Chinese meal is complete without noodles, what you have it with has symbolic meaning. So eggs are for a big and healthy family while shrimp is for fortune and wealth. Tofu brings happiness and fortune to the entire family while adding pork offers peace. Peaches are for longevity though I just can't think of a noodles and peaches combination.The Zodiac cocktail -- Acorn The Hong Kong Club at Andaz, New DelhiOf course, no meal is complete without an accompanying cocktail. Do try mixing yourself this cocktail inspired by Pigsy, an important character in the epic Chinese novel, Journey to the West. Plagued by greed, Pigsy is ultimately rewarded for his endeavours with unlimited leftovers. The Hong Kong Club at Andaz, New Delhi pays homage to the pig by including bitter ginseng to stimulate the appetite, infused with acorns and apples, some of the Pig's favourite foods.Name: ACORNIngredients: Ginseng Liqueur, Acorn Scotch, Red Vermouth, Barrel Aged"

While there is an element of personal satisfaction, there is also the pain of witnessing professional shortcomings. In my column, Discussing an editorial (Dec. 3, 2018), I had expressed my reservations about the editorial Number theory (Nov. 30), which I felt had granted the benefit of doubt on the contentious GDP back series data to the government without subjecting the numbers to close scrutiny.The practice of data tortureWhen two members of the National Statistical Commission resigned recently after disagreement with the government on certain issues, including the release of a labour report by the National Sample Survey Office for 2017-18, readers pointed out that the issue of data torture had been addressed in this column. One reader even sent a short sequence from the British sitcom, Yes Minister, to show how data are deliberately suppressed by the government. In the sequence, the Prime Minister (PM) asks his officer: Suppose the report is cautious?Sir Humphrey: Well, in that case we dont publish it.PM: You mean we suppress it?Sir Humphrey: No, we simply dont publish it.PM: Whats the difference?Sir Humphrey: Oh, big difference! Suppression is the instrument of totalitarian dictatorships. We dont do that in a free country.The role of journalism is to cut through the rhetorical clutter and help the reader understand the truth. Reports and opinion pieces are together expected to help us understand reality. Reporting is the bedrock of journalism, while opinion pieces provide a certain gravitas to the profession. Opinion pieces immediately resonate with readers, who either agree or disagree with the piece. The opinion pieces that remain in a readers memory are those that are also validated by solid reporting. If the findings of a reporter contradict the opinion writer, as a journalist I tend to trust the reporter rather than the expert.German sociologist Max Weber contextualised the role of journalism in relation to academic scholarship. He wrote: Not everyone realizes that to write a really good piece of journalism is at least as demanding intellectually as the achievement of any scholar. This is particularly true when we recollect that it has to be written on the spot, to order, and that it must create an immediate effect, even though it is produced under completely different conditions from that of scholarly research. It is generally overlooked that a journalists actual responsibility is far greater than the scholars. While many recognise the act of verification as the central function of journalism, very few recognise journalisms role of bearing witness to events. It remains the voice of the people.Reports and opinionsAll the rhetoric to justify demonetisation and the multiple revisions of official numbers to generate a positive narrative for the government failed to work because field reports did not validate the claims of the centres of power. Lets look at an important reporting section, Ground Zero. Two months before demonetisation, on September 17, 2016, The Hindu carried a field report, The bane of a bumper crop, which documented how the farmers in Maharashtras onion belt were getting an unprecedented low price for their produce. A week after demonetisation, a long report, The warp and woof of demonetisation, documented the crisis in the garment industry in Tiruppur. In 2017, there was another report, Maximum support, maximum price, which attempted to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.The gap between reportage and opinion writers is worrying. In Liberty and the News , Walter Lippmann wrote: It does not matter that the news is not susceptible of mathematical statement. In fact, just because news is complex and slippery, good reporting requires the exercise of the highest scientific virtues. If claims of policy success are not backed by field reports, people suspect the claims. No amount of data suppression can help build trust with the governments pronouncement.readerseditor@thehindu.co.in"

In my column, Discussing an editorial (Dec. 3, 2018), I had expressed my reservations about the editorial Number theory (Nov. 30), which I felt had granted the benefit of doubt on the contentious GDP back series data to the government without subjecting the numbers to close scrutiny.The practice of data tortureWhen two members of the National Statistical Commission resigned recently after disagreement with the government on certain issues, including the release of a labour report by the National Sample Survey Office for 2017-18, readers pointed out that the issue of data torture had been addressed in this column. One reader even sent a short sequence from the British sitcom, Yes Minister, to show how data are deliberately suppressed by the government. In the sequence, the Prime Minister (PM) asks his officer: Suppose the report is cautious?Sir Humphrey: Well, in that case we dont publish it.PM: You mean we suppress it?Sir Humphrey: No, we simply dont publish it.PM: Whats the difference?Sir Humphrey: Oh, big difference! Suppression is the instrument of totalitarian dictatorships. We dont do that in a free country.The role of journalism is to cut through the rhetorical clutter and help the reader understand the truth. Reports and opinion pieces are together expected to help us understand reality. Reporting is the bedrock of journalism, while opinion pieces provide a certain gravitas to the profession. Opinion pieces immediately resonate with readers, who either agree or disagree with the piece. The opinion pieces that remain in a readers memory are those that are also validated by solid reporting. If the findings of a reporter contradict the opinion writer, as a journalist I tend to trust the reporter rather than the expert.German sociologist Max Weber contextualised the role of journalism in relation to academic scholarship. He wrote: Not everyone realizes that to write a really good piece of journalism is at least as demanding intellectually as the achievement of any scholar. This is particularly true when we recollect that it has to be written on the spot, to order, and that it must create an immediate effect, even though it is produced under completely different conditions from that of scholarly research. It is generally overlooked that a journalists actual responsibility is far greater than the scholars. While many recognise the act of verification as the central function of journalism, very few recognise journalisms role of bearing witness to events. It remains the voice of the people.Reports and opinionsAll the rhetoric to justify demonetisation and the multiple revisions of official numbers to generate a positive narrative for the government failed to work because field reports did not validate the claims of the centres of power. Lets look at an important reporting section, Ground Zero. Two months before demonetisation, on September 17, 2016, The Hindu carried a field report, The bane of a bumper crop, which documented how the farmers in Maharashtras onion belt were getting an unprecedented low price for their produce. A week after demonetisation, a long report, The warp and woof of demonetisation, documented the crisis in the garment industry in Tiruppur. In 2017, there was another report, Maximum support, maximum price, which attempted to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.The gap between reportage and opinion writers is worrying. In Liberty and the News , Walter Lippmann wrote: It does not matter that the news is not susceptible of mathematical statement. In fact, just because news is complex and slippery, good reporting requires the exercise of the highest scientific virtues. If claims of policy success are not backed by field reports, people suspect the claims. No amount of data suppression can help build trust with the governments pronouncement.readerseditor@thehindu.co.in"

The state may have recorded about 20% dip in export of onions from November last year to January first week this year. Pakistans onions were being exported at a more competitive price than Indias in the past few months because $1 in Pakistan is Rs139.30 in its currency, while it is Rs71 in India. So, importers were getting onions from Pakistan at a cheaper price than India and shifted their preference to the former, said Shah.According to Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), major onion producing states in India are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat , Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Telangana. Maharashtra ranks first in onion production with a share of 28.32%.Exporters said the states onions had a bit of a quality issue and it could have led importers to prefer onions from other countries. Maharashtras onion quality was not up to the mark for two reasons: less water for irrigating in the state led to smaller onions, while the extreme cold weather over the past couple of months caused sprouting in onions, triggering quality issues. Many exporters then resisted exporting onions, said Shah.Shah said the exports from the state were expected to pick up now because Pakistan was not exporting onions for over a fortnight.Amit Katharani, director, Overseas Traders, said, The Pakistan and Sri Lankan currencies have depreciated to the dollar, meaning importers of onions getting a better deal from those two countries than India. Also, the freight charges on consignments from India are higher than Indias exporting counterparts. This freight cost is added to our final cost, which makes exports from India costlier for the importers.Katharani also cited quality issues in the states onions because of the extreme cold and said onion exports this winter dropped by about 25% to 30% in comparison to the same period last year.Another exporter said onion exporters were facing problems related to discontinuity of quality and lack of stable prices. Say, an importer has confirmed a consignment of Rs10,000 to an exporter for a particular month for a certain quality of onions. Then, there is a sudden surge in onion prices in the domestic market, which causes the price of that category of onions to go up to Rs12,000 from the earlier Rs10,000. In such a scenario, the exporter will either give the importer an inferior quality of onions at the price of Rs10,000 confirmed earlier, or himself incur a loss by giving the same quality of onions at a lower price, he said.Manoj Awhad, an onion exporter from Ahmednagar, said he exported 50% less onion this time in comparison to the same period last fiscal. The risk for exporters is increasing in terms of payment issues with importers. Also, the government policies are deterring exports. The government recently increased the incentives given under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) from 5% to 10%, which should have been done earlier to increase exports, he said."

The package will receive Rs 1,500 crore in 2019-20, which will include Rs 550 crore from state plan fund, Rs 100 crore through central sector schemes, Rs 350 crore from LSGDs, Rs 250 crore from KIIFB and Rs 250 crore from Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) and other sources, he said.The aim is to have a development strategy to enhance production of tea, spices like pepper and cardamom, fruits and vegetables, Isaac said. The initiatives will include promotion of value added products, branding of Idukki tea, expansion of the Spices Park, integrated project for cattle farming modelled on Ksheera Sagaram project and a Brahmagiri model meat processing unit.The Idukki package will also take care of issuance of soil health cards to farmers, who will be provided with organic and bio-fertilisers required to restore soils health lost in the recent calamities, before the monsoon season.New organic and bio-fertiliser manufacturing units and establishment of modern facilities to ensure the quality of fertilisers and pesticides will also be proposed.The district will have an afforestation scheme like the one proposed for Wayanad, and another major thrust would be in tourism sector, establishing tourism clusters and circuits, and development of other destinations, Isaac said.Increase in wagesMaking additional budget proposals in his concluding remarks on budget discussions, Isaac announced an increase in wages for workers under various schemes. The wages of pre-primary teachers and ayahs, anganwadi workers, Asha workers and coordinators of various other schemes will be hiked. The lump sum grant given to SC/ST students has also been hiked by 25%.Isaac announced an allocation of Rs 50 crore to Supplyco for effective market intervention in addition to Rs 150 crore already earmarked in the budget.The budget has also allocated 1,035.58 crore as ration subsidy, Rs 525 crore for paddy procurement and Rs 100 crore for Consumerfed, for market interventions.The finance minister also said that the state would launch a scheme for the Civil Supplies Corporation and the Consumerfed for direct purchase of onion, tomato and other produces from north Indian farmers, which could rescue those farmers who are on the brink of suicide due to price fall."

The government has released Rs 5,450 crore towards the farm loan waiver scheme, he added.To counter Prime Minister Narendra Modis recent promise to give Rs 6,000 per acre a year to 12 crore farmers, Kumaraswamy announced a new scheme called Raitha Siri to offer farmers financial assistance of Rs10,000 per hectare to encourage farmers to grow millets. The government plans to increase the area under millet cultivation to 10,000 hectares.Keeping in view diminishing paddy yield and cultivation area in recent years, especially in coastal and Malnad districts, he announced the Karavali Package, financial assistance of Rs 7,500 per hectare to motivate farmers to cultivate paddy.Another new scheme, Raitha Kanaja, will provide minimum support price to 12 notified farm produce. A permanent collection centre is planned to be opened through the year in all Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees through a revolving fundThe government will also offer remunerative support price to six important minor millets, besides providing marketing facility and platform (Hopcoms, Nandini and other outlets) to sell their produce directly.With agriculture at the mercy of the monsoon, Kumaraswamy announced the implementation of the Israeli Model of Micro Irrigation System (IMMIS) with a corpus of Rs 145 crore and Zero-Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) with a corpus of Rs 40 crore. While both were envisaged last year, theyre being implemented this fiscal to grow crops profitably by using less water and promoting natural farming methods.To prevent distress sale of onion, potato and tomato when prices crash, the government will announce a base price and provide incentives under Price Deficiency Payment Scheme if produce is sold below it.The government has also decided to set up a Debt Relief Commission on the Kerala model to receive complaints from farmers about private monet lenders and redress their grievances. Itll shortly bring in the Gruhalakshmi Crop Loan Scheme for small and marginal farmers who will get a crop loan on their ornaments at an interest rate of 3%.Karnataka has the most dry land after Rajasthan. Our state has been affected by drought for 14 of 18 years since 2001. Farmers have become desperate due to repeated losses. While Malnad and coastal areas, including Kodagu, have suffered due to heavy rain, 156 taluks have suffered from drought.A glaring omission was the Raitha Belaku scheme announced by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government. Under it, farmers in drought-affected areas will get Rs 5,000 per month per hectare if the monsoons fails. The scheme has been scrapped in favour of the loan waiver scheme. It also means that Rs. 3,500 crore earmarked for the project last year will not be released, said a senior Congress leader.* Milk producers will get incentive of Rs 6 per litre* Rs 15,000 crore for interest subvention on farm credit* Rs 5,500 crore for crop insurance* 50% subsidy for agri startup entrepreneurs* Two world-class permanent farm demonstration centres at VC Farm, Mandya and Sindhanur, Raichur* Special package of Rs 150 crore to improve condition of pomegranate and grape growers* Mango processing units in Ramanagara and Dharwad districts under PPP model* Tomato processing units in Kolar district under PPP model* Mobile veterinary clinics in 15 districts* Fishing jetty for development of fishing at Malpe harbour in Udupi district* Smart weighing machines in all 162 APMCs"

I went there some months ago and had good Maharashtrian food at a place called Marathi Katta. This time, I wanted to try out an eatery called The Canteen. But it turned out that it had downed its shutters, so we went looking for other eateries, and came across Sri Annapurna, which serves Andhra cuisine.This is the place you should visit if you like your food hot. We saw the menu card and decided to get our lunch packed. I asked for a plate of tamarind rice (Rs. 90), two of upma (Rs. 60 a plate), one plate of chicken fry (Rs. 190) and another of chicken curry (Rs. 170 for half a plate). While the food was being readied, we shared a masala dosa (Rs. 80). The potato sabzi in the dosa was light but delicious, and the dosa itself was soft at the centre and crispy at the edges. Excellent.The young man at the counter urged us to wait for the chicken biryani, which had just been placed on the stove. But that was going to take another 30 or 40 minutes, so we reluctantly left without trying out the Andhra dum biryani (Rs. 150).We carried the lunch back home  and I must say I enjoyed the meal. The tamarind rice was nice and tart, and the chicken fry was hot and spicy. I enjoyed the thick gravy of the chicken curry, flavoured with onions and tamarind. I liked the upma, too, which was neither too oily, nor too dry. It had bits of peanuts in it, which added to the taste.I was right: Where there are students, you are bound to find food.

2019-02-10,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/scaling-fish-and-other-grand-lessons-from-a-grandparent/cid/1684097,Scaling fish and other grand lessons from a grandparent,"A slim ray of the Fall afternoon sun cut diagonally through the stainless steel platter. Five healthy tilapias lay on it, dressed in turmeric and salt. She had spent the last half hour by the kitchen window scaling the fish and cutting them into Bengali style steaks for the maachher jhol or fish curry.Thats not how you do it, Ma, shrieked her 14-year-old daughter. With a gentle shove, the otherwise chore-averse teenager took the knife from her mothers hand and holding it tangentially along the shimmering length of the fish, kept scaling away with natural dexterity. Learnt it from the master: you know who, she said as her eyes beamed with pride. Dadu, of course!She did remember. Her daughter was just about seven. Going to the Chinese fish market was a regular Sunday afternoon activity. Post-lunch tea in hand, they would set out  her father with his two grandchildren on the rear seat of a second-hand Toyota Corolla and she, the chauffeur.He talked about his friend, Jibainya, and his cataclysmic pranks: rowing the boat in the Padma river with him and a huge jackfruit on board. All Dadu had wanted was to taste the fruit, an expensive wish for a schoolteachers child. Jibainya, the village chiefs prodigal son, acquired a whole jackfruit to fulfil his friends wish. Eat it, or else Ill sink the boat, came Jibainyas sermon in the middle of the Padma. Dadu laughed and shivered. Along the way, the Toyota Corolla sometimes stopped at a shoeshine, where her father and the children merrily gave themselves the gift of a brown/black polish, and quibbled about not having the luxury of a rickshaw in America! After all, no Toyota could beat the fun of riding a rickshaw that could stop anywhere and everywhere.Her father was very particular about his fish: the roe had to be separated and deep fried, the heads cooked in Bengali style murighonto with onions, potatoes, and fine gobindobhog rice brought back from Calcutta every year. All through the fish-cutting and dressing ceremony came cups of tea from the kitchen, the first long dip of the teabag reserved for her father, followed by a series of quick dips of the recycled teabag for two dolls house-sized cups. Fried fish roe, anyone? Dadu would call out to the children, and the two would come running out of their pigeonholes.Every summer theyd go on long drives, sometimes to the Upper Peninsula, where the Great Lakes meet, and sometimes down south, in their seven-seater van. Dora the Explorer and Scooby Doo backpacks were filled with colourful towels, board games, and the hot and spicy Kurkure snacks pirated from India. Baba, why do you load your suitcases with junk food, she would complain, and the brother-sister duo would quickly exchange silent, this too shall pass glances with their Dadu.On these trips, her father was in charge of two big flasks  one filled with black tea, the other with milk tea. Every hour they would stop for a ceremonial tea break. The children got their share of milk tea in Chhota Bheem cups, served with Parle-G biscuits that came in yellow and red striped packages from the Indian store.Dadu had taught Momo the surya pranam mantra. At first, those hard ss in Sanskrit just wouldnt sit on the third graders American tongue. Then one afternoon as the twilight was hiding behind the trees, the little girl spotted butterflies. She started chasing them, dandelions laughing at her feet, her skirt dancing in the wind, and arms trying to catch the sky. Thats when she heard Dadus voice carried by the wind Om Japakusum Sankashang Kashyapeyang Mahadyutim It was not the time for the surya pranam mantra, or perhaps it was. For at that very moment the hard s magically came to her! At the end of one summer, it was time for Dadu and Didaan to return. Momo entered middle school that Fall, but Dadu never came back from that trip to India. The scrapbook he had started for Ujaan lay incomplete.It is the day of 14 lamps today, a day of remembrance. She has spent the entire day cooking an all-fish meal. Later, when the crisp Fall afternoon will roll into the evening, she will prepare 14 cotton wicks with the children, fill the painted clay lamps with oil and place them out in the porch facing the stars. The children will know their Dadu by the brightest star shining in the distant firmament. At night, Momo will light the lamps in a path to the sky, and together brother and sister will fall asleep dreaming of Dadu riding his favourite rickshaw on the Milky Way."

This is what is going on. Water droplets freeze due to cold and political diarrhoea freezes minds and brains of the people who are in power, the Shiv Sena said in its mouthpiece Saamna In an editorial, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray sarcastically said: What else can he (CM) do who makes such statements as, Pull him down, defeat this fellow. Everybody wants power but to remain 24 hours in that state of mind and speak illogically is not good, as if you have taken birth only to contest polls.Doling out even more sarcasm, the edit said: Thanks to EVMs and the self-confidence of the BJP, it can even win all 48 seats in Maharashtra and 548 LS seats in the country. At this rate, the BJP can help the lotus bloom in London and America, but first it should say why it cannot build the Ram temple in Ayodhya?It said farmers were in a crisis situation, onion producers were unable to get a reasonable price, and unemployed youths were agitating for jobs. Instead of talking on these issues these people are talking about defeating others, the editorial said."

The accused, identified as Brijesh Kumar, was trying to flee the city, when he was arrested from near Jalandhar Bypass.Brijesh, 28, originally hailed from Uttar Pradesh, but had been living in the city at a rented accommodation near the market for the past several years.Police said Brijesh used an iron rod to kill Satpal, 55, by attacking him with an iron road. The police have recovered the weapon used in the crime. Satpal worked as a labourer at the vegetable market.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-1) Gurpreet Singh Sikand said Satpal and Brijesh had known each other for the past two years. Satpal did not have a home and slept in the open. At times, he would take shelter at Brijeshs one-room accommodation. Brijesh was annoyed with Satpal as he would often come to his house and force Brijesh to buy him liquor.Sikand said, Brijesh earned Rs 6,000 per month. As his wife and daughter lived in Uttar Pradesh, he had to send money to them. According to Brijesh, Satpal used to force him to get liqour and non-vegetarian food every day. He spent almost half of his salary to entertain Satpals wishes.Assistant commissioner of police (North) Lakhveer Singh Tiwana said, Around six months back, Satpal and Brijesh had a fight over the same issue. That time, Brijesh had hit Satpal with sticks, leaving Satpal with a fractured leg. Following the incident, Satpal did not go to Brijeshs place for two-three months. However, but off late, he had started visiting Brijeshs house again.The ACP said, Late on Sunday night, Satpal went to Brijeshs house and demanded liquor and food. Satpal said he will cook non-veg item and asked Brijesh to get onions from the market. Afterwards, they had a heated argument and Brijesh hit Satpal with a heavy iron rod multiple times.The official said Brijesh was planning to leave for Uttar Pradesh, when he was nabbed at Jalandhar Bypass."

The Akshaya Patra, an initiative of International Society for Krishna Consciousness Iskcon ), has been serving food in schools and jails in India, and also some public places abroad.In an email interaction with TOI, Madhu Pandit Dasa Akshaya Patra Foundation , said his mission is to reach 5 million children every school day by 2025. Excerpts:A: Srila Prabhupada, the founder acharya of Iskcon, once witnessed the disturbing sight of children fighting with dogs for scraps of food. Deeply touched, he asked his followers to work towards a world where no one, especially children, would go hungry. With this, we started our school lunch programme in 2000. Over time, like-minded people came on board and their unwavering support helped us scale up from 1,500 to over 1.7 million beneficiaries. Our mission is to reach 5 million children every school day by 2025. We are driven by our belief that feeding children is not charity, but a social obligation, for these children are tomorrows flag-bearers.A: India being a huge country, each social issue needs to be addressed on a large scale to make a positive impact. Then there are factors that arent in our control. In schools, for instance, standards of hygiene of the place where food is stored after we deliver it, and until it is served, can be improved. Similarly, due importance should be given to the quality of water children drink when they have their meals. These are bigger challenges...A: We use our centralised kitchens, equipped to prepare 50,000-100,000 meals over a few hours, for social welfare as well. In Rajasthan, for instance, we have been using our kitchens to implement the state governments Akshaya Kalewa programme and serve food at a subsidised rate to the needy. In Vrindavan, we feed hundreds of widowed mothers. In times of adversity, we have used our kitchens for disaster relief work.A: Serving children safe, nutritious, hygienic and tasty food has and will always be our priority. Our meals are designed to meet the nutritional requirements recommended in mid-day meal (MDM) guidelines by the ministry of human resource development  450 kcal and 12g protein for children studying in classes 1-5 and 700 kcal and 20g protein for children in classes 6-8. To ensure a tasty meal experience that is not monotonous we have a menu cycle that repeats once a month. One may say that onion and garlic enhance bioaccessibility of micronutrients. However, expert nutritionists, on the basis of several research papers, aver that bioaccessibility of micronutrients is enhanced also by items like turmeric, lime, cumin seeds, drumstick, curry leaves, tamarind, jaggery, tomato, green leafy vegetables and seasonal vegetables. We ensure all of these are used daily in Akshaya Patra menu."

Owing to closure of the highway, Valley is facing a shortage of fresh vegetables.Only onions, potatoes, carrots and turnips are available in the markets while other vegetables have gone out of stock.

Most of the mutton shops in Kashmir are closed as the shopkeepers don't have livestock available with them.

This after former Union Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar met MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Mumbai on Wednesday.The latest development comes amid differences of opinion between the Congress and the NCP over including Raj Thackeray in the Opposition alliance for the upcoming Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, reported NDTV.The meeting between Pawar and the MNS chief, who have in the past engaged in verbal sparring, took place in Dadar. It lasted for about one-and-a-half hours.Maharashtra has 48 Lok Sabha seats, the second highest after Uttar Pradesh. As per sources, MNS expects to be given at least two seats for the Parliament election. If this demand is met, Thackeray is said to be keen on joining the Opposition front.Sources in the NCP said the issue of taking along the MNS, perceived as being anti-North Indian, was being considered at the level of the central leadership of the Congress.Ajit Pawar and two other senior leaders of the party- Praful Patel and Jayant Patil- said that Parliamentary board of the NCP also pressed for its chief Sharad Pawar to throw the hat in the election ring again from Madha Lok Sabha seat.Party leader Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, who currently represents the seat, said he himself urged Pawar to contest from the seat.The leaders, however, said it is the NCP who would take a final call in this regard.The MNS chief has been vocal against the policies of BJP governments in Centre and state.Last year, he asked the state farmers to throw onions at ministers of the Devendra Fadnavis government, if these ministers didn't listen to them.Then, he took a jibe at the NDA government at the Centre after the Congress formed governments in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, saying that the country needed ""Ram Rajya"" and not a Ram temple.He even remarked that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, often mocked as ""pappu"", has now become ""param pujya"" (highly revered).Thackeray, also, criticised the Maharashtra government last year over the sensational killing of tigress Avni. He was unhappy with the plastic ban in the state too.Thackeray had accused that the state authorities killed the tigress to save industrialist Anil Ambani's proposed project in Yavatmal district. However, the charge was denied by Ambani's company as well as a district official.MNS' inclusion in Maharashtra Opposition alliance is not welcomed by the Congress, which is pushing for an inclusive agenda nationally.Ajit, however, said the issue would be discussed with the Congress as well before the nitty-gritty of the alliance is worked out.""I had met (MNS chief) Raj Thackeray yesterday. I apprised party leaders about it today. We will now discuss the issue with Congress. The general mood within our party is positive towards taking forward discussion with the MNS,"" Pawar told reporters.Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil said the final list of the candidates is likely to be announced in the next five to six days.The Congress and the NCP are talking to alliance partners and would finalise things in two-three days, he added.Patel exuded confidence that the grand alliance will be able to secure 35 seats in Maharashtra.Thackeray is known for his anti-migrant rhetoric and for following the ""Marathi Manoos"" agenda. Last December, while addressing a rally of north Indians in Mumbai, he had said that the migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar should question the leaders in their home states for the inability to push development.Ajit Pawar, though, is said to be pitching for Thackeray's inclusion in the Opposition front to consolidate the anti-BJP vote.He had noted that the MNS had secured almost one-and-half lakh votes in the past elections in some of the constituencies in Maharashtra.There have been reports that Sharad Pawar is also pushing for an understanding with Thackeray's party.The NCP chief has shared the stage with Thackeray on several occasions recently.Last October, they had a long conversation during a flight to Mumbai, thereby setting off alliance speculations.On January, Thackeray invited top political leaders, including Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for his son Amit's wedding.Sharad and Ajit Pawar too attended the event.

This after former Union Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar met MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Mumbai on Wednesday.The latest development comes amid differences of opinion between the Congress and the NCP over including Raj Thackeray in the Opposition alliance for the upcoming Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, reported NDTV.The meeting between Pawar and the MNS chief, who have in the past engaged in verbal sparring, took place in Dadar. It lasted for about one-and-a-half hours.Maharashtra has 48 Lok Sabha seats, the second highest after Uttar Pradesh. As per sources, MNS expects to be given at least two seats for the Parliament election. If this demand is met, Thackeray is said to be keen on joining the Opposition front.Sources in the NCP said the issue of taking along the MNS, perceived as being anti-North Indian, was being considered at the level of the central leadership of the Congress.Ajit Pawar and two other senior leaders of the party- Praful Patel and Jayant Patil- said that Parliamentary board of the NCP also pressed for its chief Sharad Pawar to throw the hat in the election ring again from Madha Lok Sabha seat.Party leader Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, who currently represents the seat, said he himself urged Pawar to contest from the seat.The leaders, however, said it is the NCP who would take a final call in this regard.The MNS chief has been vocal against the policies of BJP governments in Centre and state.Last year, he asked the state farmers to throw onions at ministers of the Devendra Fadnavis government, if these ministers didn't listen to them.Then, he took a jibe at the NDA government at the Centre after the Congress formed governments in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, saying that the country needed ""Ram Rajya"" and not a Ram temple.He even remarked that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, often mocked as ""pappu"", has now become ""param pujya"" (highly revered).Thackeray, also, criticised the Maharashtra government last year over the sensational killing of tigress Avni. He was unhappy with the plastic ban in the state too.Thackeray had accused that the state authorities killed the tigress to save industrialist Anil Ambani's proposed project in Yavatmal district. However, the charge was denied by Ambani's company as well as a district official.MNS' inclusion in Maharashtra Opposition alliance is not welcomed by the Congress, which is pushing for an inclusive agenda nationally.Ajit, however, said the issue would be discussed with the Congress as well before the nitty-gritty of the alliance is worked out.""I had met (MNS chief) Raj Thackeray yesterday. I apprised party leaders about it today. We will now discuss the issue with Congress. The general mood within our party is positive towards taking forward discussion with the MNS,"" Pawar told reporters.Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil said the final list of the candidates is likely to be announced in the next five to six days.The Congress and the NCP are talking to alliance partners and would finalise things in two-three days, he added.Patel exuded confidence that the grand alliance will be able to secure 35 seats in Maharashtra.Thackeray is known for his anti-migrant rhetoric and for following the ""Marathi Manoos"" agenda. Last December, while addressing a rally of north Indians in Mumbai, he had said that the migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar should question the leaders in their home states for the inability to push development.Ajit Pawar, though, is said to be pitching for Thackeray's inclusion in the Opposition front to consolidate the anti-BJP vote.He had noted that the MNS had secured almost one-and-half lakh votes in the past elections in some of the constituencies in Maharashtra.There have been reports that Sharad Pawar is also pushing for an understanding with Thackeray's party.The NCP chief has shared the stage with Thackeray on several occasions recently.Last October, they had a long conversation during a flight to Mumbai, thereby setting off alliance speculations.On January, Thackeray invited top political leaders, including Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for his son Amit's wedding.Sharad and Ajit Pawar too attended the event. Although BJP veteran LK Advani, along with Union cabinet ministers were invited, PM Modi was left out.It was also reported that Ahmed Patel, who attended the wedding, had a one-on-one meeting with Thackeray at that time.(With Inputs from PTI and Agencies)"
2019-02-15,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/7-floors-of-organic-yield/cid/1684609,7 floors of organic yield,"The West Bengal State Agricultural Marketing Board has tied up with the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) to start an organic market between the Harley Davidson showroom and Eco Park. The name of the market will called Joibo Haat meaning organic market in Bengali.Minister of the agricultural marketing department, Tapan Dasgupta, laid the foundation stone on January 17 in presence of ministers Sujit Bose and Purnendu Basu.The plot, that has been leased from NKDA, measures around 14.77 cottahs, the building will be a G+6 one and the project should take two years to complete. The estimated cost is Rs 11.40 crore and funds are being raised from the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.People are falling sick these days due to chemicals in fertilisers. Going organic is a much safer option, Dasgupta told The Telegraph Salt Lake. Also, we wanted to give a platform to those involved in organic farming.According to an official of the state agricultural marketing board, they have already called for a tender to build the market. We expect construction to start within the next few weeks, said the official.Organic supermarketThe market will have separate floors for a variety of organically grown fruits, vegetables, rice, pulses, flowers and even honey. The idea is to create an organic hub in New Town. According to the officer, the organic produce will not only taste better but will also be healthier.We want to give a super market-like experience to shoppers who come here. Everything stocked will be organically produced with zero use of chemical fertilisers or pesticides. All racks will be properly labelled, the official said.Organic produce growers and self help groups from all over the state will be welcome to showcase and sell their produce too.The farmers markets organised in Calcutta get good response from both buyers and sellers so we believe there is a ready market for organic products. Organic farming is being undertaken in large scale in North and South 24-Parganas and weve observed that people of New Town are ready to pay higher prices for quality products. So setting shop in New Town would guarantee more buyers, the officer said.The ground, first and second floors will house the organic market. The third floor will house an organic food court. The fourth floor will have training centre for skill development. The fifth floor will house an advanced laboratory and office. The sixth floor will have a guesthouse.Gourds hanging from the overhead structures. The Telegraph pictureTower planters on the terrace of Karigori Bhavan, maintained by Owl Spirit. The Telegraph pictureCrates of vegetables waiting to be taken home from the Hari Mitti farm behind Sector V. The Telegraph pictureThe laboratory will not only conduct research on organic farming but also verify whether a vegetable is organic or not.This will be the first laboratory in the state to conduct such tests. Currently, to conduct such tests samples are sent to other states. This adds to expenses.The laboratory will also work to develop organic fertilisers and the facility will have regular workshops to encourage farmers from the villages to shift to organic methods.Sikkim has managed to become Indias first fully organic state by implementing organic practices of farming on around 75,000 hectares of agricultural land. It had taken Sikkim around 12 years to achieve this feat and Bengal is now taking baby steps towards organic methods.Farm on your rooftopDebashis Sen, the chairman of NKDA, said such a market in New Town would give plenty of opportunities for residents to buy fresh produce and also motivate them to have roof-top gardens where vegetables can be grown.We are already in talks with agencies to develop rooftop farms on individual plots and buildings. Farming and gardening on the roof of a building will enhance the look of the terrace and provide quality food to residents. It will also keep the building cooler in summer, said Sen.NKDA runs a farm on the terrace of CB Market near Novotel and Sen says hydroponics and other alternative methods for container gardening are being used there extensively. This farm was started by Owl Spirit, a company formed by the NGO Uthnau, in 2017. They grew gourds, spinach, beans, cucumbers, carrots, brinjals etc in baskets up there.At present, they are working on tower planters at Karigori Bhavan opposite Uniworld City. These are containers stacked one above the other and they are growing brinjals, chillies, gourds and spinach on trial basis there.We have been approached by the NKDA to help residents grow organic food in their balconies and terrace, says director of Owl Spirit, Kunal Deb. Chemical use in commercial crops has spread to such an extent that even if you have money today you cant buy healthy food. Its best if you can grow your own food then.Hari Mitti is another agency that has been approached. This Sector V-based company prepares crates of fruit, vegetable and herbs to sell to residents. The nascent stages of plants are the most delicate. We shall look after the plant at this stage and hand them over when they are older and hardy. We also provide lifelong maintenance of the plants, says Suhrid Chandra, the founder.That there is a demand for organic farming is clear from the fact that Hari Mitti has started managing 82 rooftops over the past two years. If a family takes in 30-35 crates, it won't need to buy any vegetables from the market besides potatoes and onions.Both the agencies try to avoid using soil. Instead they use coco peat, vermin compost, hydroponics etc. These options are lighter than soil and also, if we use soil, no matter where we source it from, it will be contaminated with chemicals, says Chandra.But the agencies are wary of practical problems. In 2014, Owl Spirit had started an urban farm on the terrace of Siddha Town in Rajarhat. They had to discontinue after nine months after residents refused to pay for its maintenance. Residents can also complain about insects, those living on the top floor may complain of disturbance, says Deb. So we have requested minister Firhad Hakim to allow us to carry out urban farming atop government buildings.Residents are keen to give organic farming a shot. I shall be retiring in six months and thereafter would love to indulge in gardening. When I moved to New Town I had about 25 pots but most of them didnt survive. With help from these experts I would love to grow lemons, chillies and other fruits and vegetables, says Chaita Mukherjee, a resident of Sree apartments.Inputs from Sudeshna Banerjee"

One such tradition in Goa is called the laat and it meets autumnal irrigation needs for chillies, coriander and onions, among others.Today, this tradition of making judicious use of water continues, but only in rural pockets of Tiswadi , Bardez, Pernem and Bicholim where the system continues to be maintained in an intelligent and sustainable manner.During the monsoon, when the land is amply fed with moisture, pits more than 3m in diameter are dug near fresh water bodies. These are locally referred to as honde. Then to pull the water out, a lever system is fashioned out of the trunk of an arecanut tree where one end is weighed down with a heavy stone. To the other end a bamboo stick with a bamboo basket is attached. When the stone weighs down, the bamboo basket rises filled the water collected from the honde. With time, the bamboo basket or kolame, as it is called, has come to be replaced with a tin box.The water that is lifted out is poured in irrigation channels dug in the earth. Operated by women, the lever system increases the ease of drawing water.Rural women refer to the water harvesting and irrigation system in their folksongs.Laat ge laatala Pani javuni patala Pani javuni patala Kay shevatichya betalaIn this song, the laat system finds reference as the women sing about irrigating and harvesting shevantim (chrysanthemums).Prafulla Zalmi, 64, from Bagwada in Pilgao, Bicholim says, We still make use of laat for irrigating our vegetables, chillies and onions. Wherever we find foliage growing, we dig a shallow and narrow well. Traditionally, we always dig honde whereby flowing water accumulates and seeps into the earth.Anupama Gawade, 67, from Mandrem , says, We manually operate the laat to irrigate our seasonal crops."

Considering the rise in arrival of onions, prices are expected to be at the same rate for a month or two.The government had announced onion grant of Rs 200 per quintal for farmers who sold their produce between November 1 and December 15 last year and extended the period up to December 31. But farmers were not satisfied with the extension. Finally, the government extended the time limit further so that those who sold their onions till January 31 would get the grant.The quantity of onions eligible for thr grant has been fixed at 200 quintals per farmer The average wholesale prices of kharif onions are currently around Rs 400 per quintal. The prices crashed in November and are still at low levels, said Kuber Jadhav, a farmer.Hence, we want the government to give benefits of the grant to those who sell their produce till March end or until the prices go above Rs 1,000 per quintal, he added.The cost of production for onions is around Rs 900 per quintal. At the current prices, farmers are incurring losses of Rs 500 per quintal, said Nivrutti Nyaharkar, another farmer.The onion grant of Rs 200 is paltry considering the losses the farmers are incurring. We want the government to increase the grant amount to Rs 400 per quintal at least, he said."

We took the decision to take the long march again only after there was no solution in sight even after three meetings, he said.Recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers headed by Dr MS Swaminathan needs to be implemented.

2019-02-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/metoo-in-delhi-today-over-5000-survivors-of-sexual-assault-5595613/,"In Delhi today: Over 5,000 survivors of sexual assault","The bus rumbles along to its final destination for the day. After traversing much of Madhya Pradesh over the last few days, it has just entered the eastern tip of Gujarat. As the vehicle halts for the night at a tribal settlement in the foothills of Devgadh Baria taluka in Dahod district, its passengers troop out to the unlit open ground. Most of them are survivors of sexual violence, and in case of minor survivors, their parents, all from rural Dalit and Adivasi communities.AdvertisingAround the soft glow of the hearth-flame, the local women host them for their last meal of the day: makai ki roti, dal, and onions. Tonights stay is in a room in a dharamshala where three dozen thin mattresses are rolled out on every inch of the floor.It has been a long day for the 34-year-old. She had spent the day, like many before this one, recounting her story of having been violated by multiple men and the stigma that followed. Despite having barely recovered from typhoid, she left her village in Madhya Pradesh to join this cross-country journey that started off from Mumbai on December 20, 2018. Shouting slogans while marching through the day, by night her sore throat can barely let out a squeak. But after everything that she has been through, she says, she is glad to have found her voice now: Pehle kuch bola hi nahi jaata tha. Par galat hum nahi hai, galat woh log hai, galat woh samaj hai. Soch ko mitane ke liye yaatra nikali hai (Initially I could never speak about it. But we are not in the wrong, the perpetrators are wrong, society is wrong. We are on this journey to change mindsets.)Some spark a movement at the click of a keypad. Others trudge 10,000 km across the country for their stories to be heard. Of being gang raped. Of being trafficked and auctioned off. Of generations of minor girls being forced into caste-based prostitution. Of being violated by upper-caste men and then violently threatened into silence. Of being branded witches and paraded naked. And after having survived everything, of being shamed for their ordeal.AdvertisingHundreds of survivors of sexual violence have come together to be part of a 65-day Garima Yatra (dignity march) to break the silence and end the stigma. Almost all of them are from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities from villages and small towns whose stories could not be heard in Indias #MeToo movement. The march, partly on foot and partly in vehicles, has been organised by the Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan, a coalition of civil society organisations working against caste-based discrimination and gender violence.At every stop enroute, they are joined by hundreds of locals some of whom, inspired by the stories, speak of their own trials. The journey will culminate in Delhi on February 22, 2019, after having covered 200 districts in 24 states. Around 5,000 survivors and families, who were all part of the journey at one point or the other, are expected to converge in Ramlila Maidan on the final day.***Early next morning, sipping tea to soothe her throat, the 34-year-old from Madhya Pradesh says the journey is about shifting the shame from the survivor to the perpetrator. A shame she has relived many times since four years ago, when she was abducted from her husbands tribal village in MP by two men who raped her for several days. She was later sold off to a Thakur man who violated her for the next six months. When she finally managed to escape and go to the police station, they first refused to lodge a complaint and days later, when they finally did, subjected her to the banned two-finger test.The delay in medical examination didnt help my case. When the magistrate said there is no proof, I told him that I could strip naked to show him the many scars they had inflicted all over me, she recalls adding that her return home was no solace as her husband and in-laws accused her of eloping and battered her until she bled. Not welcome in her parental home either, she recounts, With nowhere to go, for eight days, I took shelter at the railway station. A social worker found me there and helped me find a place to live.She is today fighting multiple cases, all on her own  against her perpetrators and against her husband for custody of her 10-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter. She recalls that the first time she spoke of her experience during the yatra, she broke down as did the many women in the audience. But every passing day, talking of her grief and listening to that of many like her, has bolstered her spirits and her resolve.Kranti, a volunteer with the Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan, states that the support of community groups and womens self-help groups at the ground level has ensured massive turnout in every village and town, and also taken care of the meals and overnight stay. Those on this journey have all had a hard time with police and the courts. It has been even harder for them to take this step and speak up despite pressure from their own families and the community, said Kranti.Data from the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) shows that of all the cases registered under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act in conjunction with sections of the Indian Penal Code, the majority pertain to crimes against Dalit and Adivasi women. The maximum cases are reported under the crime head of Assault on (SC/ST) Women to Outrage Her Modesty and Rape.According to the last NCRB data (2016), a quarter of the rape cases of SC/ST women were pending investigation by the police at the end of the year  though the law mandates that the investigating officer must submit his report within 30 days to the Superintendent of Police. Of the 8,259 cases pertaining to rape of Dalit women for trial before the court during the year, the pendency by year-end was a high 87 per cent and conviction a mere 3.7 per cent. Similarly, for Adivasi women, of the total 3,563 cases that came up for trial, the pendency stood at 86.8 per cent and conviction a mere 2.8 per cent of the cases that came up for trial.These numbers do not account for the many who are dissuaded from filing FIR for fear of social ostracism and threat to personal safety.***Among the many who are part of this journey is Bhanwari Devi from Rajasthan, whose struggles led to the landmark Vishaka judgement for prevention of sexual harassment at workplace. Even 25 years after her gang rape, her upper-caste perpetrators are at large and this march, she believes, would amount to a lot. The battle that I took up in my small way has today taken the form of a big movement with a name (#MeToo). But the voices of women from villages, who like me never got justice, have not been part of this so far. When we take to the streets in such larger numbers, the government will have to take notice, said Bhanwari Devi.There have been some ripples already. Abhiyan convenor Ashif Shaikh points out that after meeting survivors, the new chief ministers of MP and Chattisgarh, Kamal Nath and Bhupesh Baghel, have already promised to roll out some of their demands such as setting up a special police task force to combat sexual violence, fast-track courts, and banning the two-finger test.The journey, meant to reassert the dignity of survivors, has also highlighted the many manifestations of caste and sexual violence. For instance, a day before reaching Gujarat, in Ratlam, MP, the local survivors who came to attend the Garima Yatra were mostly from the denotified Bachchada tribe, where minor girls have been traditionally often forced to solicit along the highways.One of them, who had a child a few years ago while she was still a minor, for the first time shared the stage with the Superintendent of Police as an equal, as she spoke of how the community needs reservation in education and jobs so as to put an end to their traditional life of forced prostitution.In MPs Jhabua district that borders Gujarat, several rape survivors from the Bhil community working as agricultural labourers came forward to speak of the frequent sexual assaults by men from powerful castes. In Gujarats Dahod district, the local women who joined the march were mainly those who were subject to daayan pratha (branding widows as witches to deny them property rights) and haraji (public auction of daughters to the highest bidder).The dual oppression of caste and gender is evident from the National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data, which shows that the percentage of women (age 15-49) who have experienced physical violence since age 15 is 35.7% for SC women and 31% for ST women as against 22% for other women.Every day of the journey involves addressing the local audiences and taking them along in the marches within their villages or towns under the rallying cry: Garima yatra karein pukar. Balatkariyon par hai dhikaar. But before that, each morning begins with the travellers seated in a circle sharing their stories and drawing courage from each other. At one such meet at the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, the parents of a 10-year-old rape survivor from Uttar Pradesh speak up.The father, a construction worker, says, This man used to stalk her and had assaulted her four times before the incident happened. But our many police complaints were never taken seriously. The mother, who is determined that her daughter finish her education even if that means that she has to carry chilli powder and scissors in her school-bag daily, adds, We never got any respect from the police or the court when we approached them. Our own people rejected us instead of rejecting the man who committed the crime against my daughter. This march has helped us regain our lost respect and hope.Another mother of a minor rape survivor, who has resolved to finish the journey despite a limp caused by polio, talks of how she didnt like it when a top police officer who shared a stage with some survivors blamed the society for all the ills, not once accepting how law enforcement continues to fail survivors. Woh kehete hai bacchi ko maa sanskaar dena chahiye. Baap kyun nahi? Aur ladki ko hi kyun, ladke ko kyun nahi kuch sanskar dena hain (He said the mother has to teach her daughter values. Why not the father? And why just the daughter? Why not the boys?) she asks.The 34-year-old from MP tells the group how a school principal, who hosted them for a public meeting, was wrong to object to them using the word balaatkar (rape) instead of being pained by what they had been through. A 25-year-old from Betul chips in, They all seem to think that it is rape happens to girls who dont dress modestly. I was wearing a sari but that didnt protect me from rape. She is one of many tribal women from her village who were trafficked and sold (in her case, for a sum of Rs 25,000) for forced marriages to upper caste men in whose community women are fewer owing to female foeticide.After the journey ends, both the women plan to shift to Dewas in MP and work towards realising their individual dreams. The 34-year-old wants to start stitching and also design clothes so that she can some day open a boutique. The younger woman plans to join a beauty parlour course. Neither has ever set foot inside a school, so also on their list is learning to read and write.AdvertisingAt the end of every day, as the bus winds its way to a shelter for the night, no matter how long or tiring the day has been, the bus reverberates with songs and thumping of dholaks. And the last song is mostly about sisterhood: Chalo sakhi aaj hum sanghatan banayenge."

We took the decision to take the long march again only after there was no solution in sight even after three meetings, he said.Recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers headed by Dr MS Swaminathan needs to be implemented. Remunerative price is another big issue. Though government announces MSP, farmers dont get the rate on several occasion. The onion issue in Maharashstra is well known.

Naths statement came in response a query raised by Congress MLA from Indore 1, Sanjay Shukla, who sought details on industries set up in MP from 2004-18, how many jobs were created and how many industries shut down.The CMs reply went thus: In the region covered by MPIDC Ltd, Bhopal, 290 big industries were opened in which 1,15,671 individuals were given employment. Of these industries, nine are closed as of now. He stated that to promote industries, MPIDC-Bhopal allotted 2642.17 hectare government land to 441 major groups. None of the industries were allotted private land hence there is no question of acquiring farmland, it said.According to industry department reports, the erstwhile Shivraj Singh Chouhan government held five investor summits between 2007 and 2016, but it failed to bring much-needed investment. As per one estimate, of the 2,357 MoUs signed, only 92 projects have been commissioned and 1,728 in the early stages of implementation; 537 were cancelled.In GIS 2016, the government claimed there was intent or interest to the tune of Rs. 5,62,887 crore from 2,630 companies, but its yet to be seen on the ground. As per the data tabled in assembly, over 2.46 jobs were generated in the state between 2004 and 2017, of which over 2.27 lakh jobs came from the private sector.Repeated efforts were made to contact the CM on phone for his comments, but to no avail. BJP took the statement as proof that Congress had spread false propaganda ahead of assembly election. We have been claiming that there was response from the industries during investor summits, but Congress made it a political issue, alleging failure of investor summit and lack of jobs. Now, the chief minster has himself made it clear how many industries have been set up and jobs given. Congress must apologize for the big farce it played during elections, said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.Replying to another question raised by Congress MLA Harsh Vijay Gehlot on examinations conducted by Vyapam, the CM stated that there is no proposal to close it down. Vyapam has financial rights.The PEB (Vyapam) is also authorized to decide exam fee, hence, it is not justified that unemployed were cheated by Vyapam. At present, there is no proposal with GAD to close the Vyapam, went Naths statement. Earlier, Congress leaders had said the government would shut Vyapam and form a new body for examination and recruitment.Congress seemed to take a U-turn on its allegations of irregularities in onion procurement. In reply to Congress MLA Manoj Chawlas query, GAD minister Govind Singh said that 110.40 lakh quintal onion was purchased in 2016 and 87.35 lakh quintal in 2017. IN 2017, MARFED destroyed 2.43 lakh quintal onion while state civil supplies destroyed 3.82 lakh quintal onions. But there was no corruption found in purchase of onions and, hence, as asked there is no question of taking action against those involved in the purchasing process, read his statement.Congress said that the information is being provided by senior officers who were appointed in the BJP regime. We are examining the facts given by the department heads in the assembly. We will review and present facts with new information and decisions on the same by Congress government, said Congress state spokesperson J P Dhanopia."

The sender hands over the cash to the driver, who accepts the sealed parcel without checking its contents. The driver informs the receiver about the approximate time he will reach the destination depot. As the bus nears the destination, the driver telephones the receiver and asks him to collect the parcel, said a source from MSRTC. The exchange is done before the driver reports to the depot.Parcels travel regularly from Mumbai to Konkan , including Ratnagiri, Nashik , Pune, Kolhapur, and vice versa, said the source.Another staffer at the Nalasopara ST depot said right from spices to dry fish to sacks of grain, onions, potatoes are parcelled illegally on ST buses. The parcels are placed in the luggage compartments or near the conductors seat. The cash is shared equally by the driver and the conductor."

But one of the most popular dishes among Sindhis is surely Dal Pakwaan, a preparation where yellow dal is savoured along with a deep-fried crispy flatbread, along with some delicious chutneys and chopped onions. Dal Pakwaan is preferred mostly as a breakfast dish, especially in the weekends. The lentil used is Bengal gram, and the spices are kept at a minimum to cook the dish.To make pakwaan, wheat flour kneaded into a firm dough with oil and a dash of ajwain. This is then used to roll out thin flatbreads. Small perforations are made on this bread so that it does not puff up like a puri while deep frying in oil. Care has to be taken that the pakwaan is fried till it is golden brown. Soaked chana dal is cooked with a seasoning of cumin seed, a little asafoetida, ginger paste and chilli powder. Finally, the dal is served garnished with chopped onions and coriander leaves.A dash of amchur and garam masala powder can also be added for taste. Usually, two kinds of chutneys are served with the combo dish, a sweet tamarind chutney and a green coriander chutney. In fact, the chutneys are added to the dal before eating, and crisp pakwaan pieces are dunked into it to enjoy a satisfying Sindhi breakfast.A few weeks back in this column I had talked about the area around Prenderghast Road in Secunderabad. Known as Sindhi Colony due to a sizeable Sindhi population, the area serves some of the best vegetarian street food in the city in the evening. However, if you land up here on a Sunday morning, you will notice a small kiosk named Ganga Sagar Dal Pakwan in front of Amar Apartments.This street food kiosk only offers dal pakwaan, and has been set up a couple of years ago by Mohan Tolani, a Sindhi residing in Hyderabad for the past 15 years. The dal and the pakwaan are all made at his home, in fact, the pakwaan is made the previous evening and the excess oil is drained out. The crisp pakwaan is served with the chana dal added over it. Apart from some coriander and tamarind chutney, Mohan further adds a chilli chutney on top keeping the local palate in mind.Chopped onions and some amchur powder completes the dish. A plate with two pieces of pakwaan along with dal and chutneys costs `60.Mohan says that it gives him immense pleasure to be able to offer this dish to the Hyderabadi customers. He says that some of his customers travel from as far as Manikonda for their Sunday breakfast. If you wish to try this regional delicacy land up here on any Sunday between 9 and 11 in the morning.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

This will be the first of three instalments, totaling Rs 6,000 annually.More than 1 crore farmers (with land holdings of up to two acres) from the state will be eligible to receive the amount. The first phase includes 14.26 lakh farmers, said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Based on land holding data, the bank accounts of 52 lakh of the total eligible farmers have been uploaded to the central database, the highest in the country, he said, adding that the state will try to bring out a similar scheme for farmers who are not eligible for the Centres scheme due to larger land holdings.Several farmers in drought-prone Vidarbha and Marathwada have greater land holdings, but due to agriculture being mostly rain-fed, they are making losses and need to be supported, said an official from the agriculture department.While the Centres move is being seen by policymakers as the first of steps towards income support in India in the era of liberalization, critics have called the PM and CMs announcements poll sops.Union minister Smriti Irani called the move a historic step on Twitter. It will benefit large number of jute & cotton farmers who play a crucial role in the textiles sector, she wrote. An official said farmers in the country, especially Maharashtra, who are facing drought and poor prices will be happy.Not everyone is, though. What farmers really want is remunerative pricing for their produce, which the government has not ensured. That is why there is so much rural distress, requiring the Centre to announce such schemes around the elections, said Ajit Navale of the farmers organization All India Kisan Sabha.Ramesh Patil, a farmer from Nashik, said that this year alone he has made a loss of Rs 48,000 due to a crash in the purchase price of onions in the wholesale market. How will Rs 6,000 per year help me? There is no infrastructure for us to process our onions and so we sell them at any cost to avoid them rotting away, said Patil."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Aurangabad: A look at the performance of the eight representatives elected to the Lok Sabha from Marathwada in the House shows that Congress MP from Hingoli Rajeev Satav and BJP MP from Latur Sunil Gaikwad have fared relatively well, according to the PRS Legislative Research, a non-profit organisation based in New Delhi.The organisations collates information about the attendance of elected representatives, their participation in debates, questions asked and private member bills introduced. According to their information, BJP MP from Jalna Raosaheb Danve and Congress MP from Nanded Ashok Chavan, both of whom shoulder the responsibility of the state units of their respective parties, have performed below the national average on the parameters.While expectations were high from Pritam Munde, daughter of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, she has average performance on a majority of indicators. Shiv Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire from Aurangabad, who is enjoying a fourth term, had somewhat satisfactory performance, whereas debutants Ravindra Gaikwad and Sanjay Jadhav, both from Shiv Sena, failed to leave any major imprint.Satav, a debutant Congress MP from Maharashtra, raised as many as 1,115 questions in the Lok Sabha and kept his radar on a range of issues from different sectors including agriculture, education, energy, health, national security, empowerment of orphan girls, widows and Divyangs. The 44-year-old presented private member bills, which was way above the national average of 2.3.Sunil Gaikwad has reported 100% attendance in as many as six sessions of the 16th Lok Sabha. The 48-year-old BJP leader is among those credited with bringing the rail coach factory to Latur.Veteran Shiv Sena leader, Chandrakant Khaire, has below average attendance and lesser participation in debates but remained vocal in asking questions and introducing Private Members Bill. He was a member of two Parliamentary panels and had raised the demand for starting metro rail service and passport issuance facility in Aurangabad.Former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan scored below average on all parameters, except raising questions in Lok Sabha. While state-level commitments to the party appeared to have reflected in terms of below average attendance in Lok Sabha, he compensated by raising several questions, including around 50 starred questions that need oral answers by the ministers concerned. Attendance of Chavan was particularly poor during the winter session of 2016 (19%), Budget session of 2017 (24%) and winter session of 2018 (31%).Contesting from the Beed Lok Sabha seat after the death of her father Gopinath Munde, Pritam Munde had recorded a landslide win of nearly seven lakh votes, which was the highest-ever in the history of general elections. During her term, she has asked more questions than the national average.Her speech on the bad condition of sugar factories in Lok Sabha earlier this year had raised many eyebrows as she was found to be critical of her own government. Similar to some of the other MPs, Pritam had raised key issues related to the agriculture, education and health among other field during her presence in the Lok Sabha.Ravindra Gaikwad, a first-time MP, came into limelight when he hit an Air India staffer with a slipper at the IGI airport in Delhi and then openly boasted about it in March 2017. The Shiv Sena leader had relatively poor attendance in the budget session of 2017 (31%) and same session last year (45%). Gaikwad, who took part in around 35 debates, was found to be vocal on issues faced by onion growers, Banjara community, welfare of farmers and drought in his constituency.Sanjay (Bandu) Jadhav, another first-time MP, lagged behind the national average on all four parameters. A member of the food, consumer affairs and public distribution committee of the Parliament, the 51-year old Shiv Sena leader had poor attendance in the winter session of 2016 (19%), Budget session for 2017 (24%) and winter session of last year (25%). Jadhav took part in Lok Sabha debates on topics related to drought, budgetary allocations for rail projects and compensation for calamity-hit farmers.Raosaheb Danve, who was a union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution before becoming president of state BJP unit, has the worst performance on all indicators among the eight MPs from Marathwada, according to the information on the organisations website.The senior BJP leader, who is an MP for the fourth term, never crossed 75% attendance in any of the 12 sessions of the Lok Sabha. Danve was specific about his constituency while speaking in the House and raised demands related to the education sector and need for improving the rail connectivity."

His recent 118-minute film Ether was screened on Tuesday.I feel that the world is changing very fast, but the film language is less advanced. As technology is advancing, even classics of Antonioni and Bergman have become less presentable to the audience, he said.Explaining how peoples tastes in films had changed, he said, The film language was much advanced back in the day, but if we were to present it to the audience today, they would not appreciate it because it is too sophisticated. While there have been advances in technology, cinema has over time lost some virtues as well.The 80-year-old film-maker drew the attention of the audience to various disciplines, including scripting, casting and developing the content.Of late, I have stopped looking into camera work or visiting the editing room and the music studio, as I completely believe in their creativity, he said.Zanussi started as a physicist, before shifting to philosophy and ending up as a film-maker, inspired by Bergman. First, I fell in love with physics. On understanding that it is difficult to get a Noble in physics, where competition is stiff, I opted to capturing the passage of time through the camera, he said with a smile.Admitting that he and creative minds of his generation have memories of World War II, Zanussi said, None of us can take life for guaranteed and have to justify our living.Renowned film critic M K Raghavendra and Akumal Ramachandra spoke to him about his earlier visit to India and the films he made. Among his significant works is Constant Factor, a film partly shot in India in 1980.Some students of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune were involved in the filming process, and that will always be very memorable, he said.He said that a certain kind of humanism and spiritual intuition drew him to India.On the present day cinema, he said. Quality and quantity of cinema is enormous. But the level of communication is lower than it used to be."
2019-03-01,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/man-with-the-moves/cid/1685999,Man with the moves,"A man from the small African nation of Ivory Coast has made a big impact on his housing complex at Uniworld City in New Town. At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

Picture by Bishwarup DuttaPrices of vegetables have gone through the roof following the unseasonal rain in the last week of February.Large swathes of low-lying cultivatable land in North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Nadia and East Midnapore remained inundated for days following the downpour, which continued in phases for four days, striking a blow to the farmers who were about to reap their produce.A section of farmers said unlike paddy, most vegetable-bearing plants would turn grey and begin to wilt if water accumulated at the base.The period between end-February and early-March is the harvesting season for several vegetables, such as green chilly, ladies finger and potato.Among the worst-hit are ladies fingers, which sold at Rs 100-120 a kg across the city on Monday. Vegetable sellers said ladies fingers would usually sell at Rs 25-30 a kg around this time of the year.Bottle gourds, which would sell at Rs 10-15 a piece during this time, sold for Rs 30 at Lake Market and Gariahat on Monday. The price of pointed gourds shot up from Rs 40 to Rs 100 a kg at some of the markets.Traders and farmers blamed the rise in vegetable prices on the rain between February 25 and 28.According to the weather department, areas in some of the south Bengal districts that grow vegetables received more than 100 mm of rainfall during the period.Calcutta on those days received 159.1mm of rain.The TelegraphI went to Koley Market in Sealdah to buy vegetables. I spent a little over Rs 8,000 on my usual stock, which usually costs around Rs 4,000, said Madan Mohan Ghosh, a retailer at the Gariahat market.Around 60 per cent of the ladies fingers sold in Calcutta is sourced from the Diamond Harbour sub-division in South 24-Parganas.Some of the pockets in the sub-division that grow the vegetable are Mathurapur, Mandirbazar and Kulpi.Ladies fingers, farmers said, are sensitive and need to be reaped twice a day. Else, they loose tenderness.You can understand what happens if water collects at the base of the plants, said Bimal Kumar Das, a farmer in Mathurapur.The end-February rain also resulted in a sudden fall in temperature, which prolonged the wintry spell to the delight of most people but delayed the harvest of pointed gourds, especially in parts of the Bongaon sub-division in North 24-Parganas.The yield of pointed gourds is directly proportional to heat. The warmer, the better, said Kamal Dey, a trader at Koley Market, a wholesale hub. Just when the wholesale markets were expecting a bumper harvest of pointed gourds, the fall in temperature delayed the yield by several weeks. As a result, the price shot up.Farmers and agro-producers said the prices of some vegetables, including green chillies and onions, might increase in the next few weeks. The green chilly plants in Kakdwip (South 24-Parganas), Basirhat (North 24-Parganas) and parts of Hooghly district lost their flowers in the rain.Bengal has had a huge harvest of onions  around 9 lakh metric tonnes  this time and prices would have dropped. But the dampness caused by the rain came in the way of preserving some of the produce.The rain in the last week of February and a sudden change in weather have taken a toll on the prices, said Pradip Majumder, advisor to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on agriculture and agro-produce. Hopefully, things will look up in the next few weeks."

It has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Akshaya Patra Foundation (APF), a subsidiary of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), despite the latters refusal to use the two ingredients.In November last year, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education had directed the foundation to use onion and garlic in food preparations. When the foundation refused to do so, the CEO of Bengaluru (Urban) Zilla Panchayat put the MoU, which had to be signed in April 2018, on hold.In Bengaluru alone, APF provides meals to 1.83 lakh students in 1,212 schools.Akshaya Patra Foundation refused to include onion and garlic. We could not make alternative arrangements to provide food, and had to yield, said an official, adding that the issue is yet to be resolved.In February, reports by the National Institute of Nutrition stated that the menu by APF was in compliance with the nutritional guidelines suggested by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).The Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) said that it is yet to study samples from schools which received food from the foundation to see if the meals met or exceeded the energy and protein norms of the MHRD. But, CFTRI also stated that the contribution of onion and garlic towards macro and micro nutrients is negligible.While CFTRI had earlier stated that onion and garlic enhance the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from foodgrains, in its report submitted in February, it said that ingredients such as drumstick, turmeric, lime and jeera are also known to enhance bioaccessibility of micronutrients.According to MHRD norms, food supplied to lower primary students should have 450 kcal energy and 12 grams of protein, while food supplied to upper primary classes should have 700 kcal and 20 grams protein.M. R. Maruthi, Joint Director of the Midday Meal Scheme in Karnataka, said that while the MoU had been signed, the Chief Secretary and the Principal Secretary of the department are yet to take a call on inclusion of onion and garlic.The move has not gone down well among public health experts and activists who have urged the State government to end the contract with APF.Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher, said the larger issue is that children were not eating adequate quantities of the midday meals as it was not tasty. Not including onion and garlic in the midday meals is a cultural imposition, she said. She added that the State Food Commission had received complaints that students were not eating the meals as they were not familiar with food that did not use onion and garlic.Not including onion and garlic in the midday meals is a cultural impositionSylvia Karpagam,public health doctor and researcherThe Foundation refused to include onion and garlic.

Wholesale traders said the prices of vegetables normally go up during mid-March. But, this time around, the spike in demand for some vegetables has driven up prices earlier.Cold storage facilitiesBuilding more cold storage facilities would help control such spikes, said traders.Beans are among the vegetables whose prices have soared at the wholesale market. One kg of beans was sold for a between Rs. 85- Rs. 90 on Monday, which is more than double the price in February. On Sunday, it was sold for Rs. 100 a kg, traders said.S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Licensed Merchants Welfare Association, said there is a slight variation in price daily according to arrivals and demand. The cost of vegetables like chayote and carrots has also doubled now because of low yield. The prices would stabilise only after July, he added.Spike in demandMoreover, the demand for seasonal vegetables like lemons and cucumber had also pushed up prices. Only a few vegetables like potato, drumsticks and onions are available at relatively affordable prices.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the price of vegetables was up 10% compared to February. Lack of adequate rainfall and the resultant poor yield had meant fewer lorry-loads arriving at the market. It was only getting an average of 300-350 lorry-loads daily compared to the normal of 400-420 loads daily. Several merchants were eyeing markets further north like Ranchi and Ahmedabad to source vegetables such as beans and broad beans at a lower rate. There was a need for more cold storage facilities to store vegetables, many said. While potatoes could be stored for up to six months, cabbage and beans could only be stored up to 10 days to stabilise prices, one merchant said. The facility maintained by the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited in Koyambedu did not have sufficient capacity, traders said.The market was only getting an average of 300-350 lorry-loads daily compared to the normal of 400-420 loads dailyP.

2019-03-20,https://www.news18.com/news/india/from-farms-to-slums-women-in-india-on-sharp-end-of-jobs-crisis-2072387.html,"From Farms to Slums, Women in India on Sharp End of Jobs Crisis","Chincholi (Karnataka): A few years ago, in this sweltering corner of western India, the horizon was dotted with hunched, barefoot women swinging sickles all day to cut wheat for the spring harvest.Now, a giant green harvester clears an entire half-acre field within minutes, allowing farmers to save money and quickly sell the wheat, typically used to make rotis.Chhaya Kharade, 36, and other women doing lighter farm work were gradually replaced by the machines that now crisscross wheat, sugar cane and onion fields surrounding Chincholi, a village 190 km (120 miles) east of financial hub, Mumbai.""I should be busy now, as the wheat harvesting is going on. But there is hardly any work for me. Almost all farmers are using machines,"" Kharade said in her spartan two-room house.Women, especially those working in precarious informal sectors, are at the sharp end of what economists and opposition politicians describe as a jobs crisis in India. According to the private Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), 90 percent of around 10 million jobs lost last year were held by women.Several unemployed women interviewed by Reuters said they had soured on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who swept to power in 2014 vowing to turn India into an economic powerhouse but has struggled to create jobs.While Modi remains the favourite in general elections that kick off next month, insufficient employment - despite India's roughly 7 percent economic growth rate - is a major voter worry.""Modi government has not done anything to create employment in this region. We would like to vote for a party that will set up factories and create jobs,"" said Mumtaj Mulani, a 40-year-old woman who was plucking weeds from a pearl millet field in the area. She said she usually struggles to find work due to the spread of machines.The dwindling female labour participation rate could have far-reaching implications for economic development and the progress of women's rights in the often deeply conservative country.""When nearly fifty percent of the labour force is unable to live up to its potential, India is foregoing significant growth, investment, and productivity gains,"" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment.""The social costs, while less tangible, are nevertheless acute,"" Vaishnav added, noting research suggests women's economic empowerment reduces inequality and ensures women have a greater voice in society.Measuring the problem is tricky, and Modi's government has delayed the release of controversial jobs data.But the official report, leaked to local newspaper Business Standard in February, shows the female labour participation rate was merely 23.3 percent in 2017-2018, down about 8 percentage points from 2011-2012.Private estimates are gloomier. CMIE puts the figure at just 10.7 percent between May and August 2018.DOUBLE WHAMMY: NOTE BAN AND GSTTo be sure, the loss of jobs to machines is a global issue, but women have a more limited range of alternative work than their male counterparts. And in family-focused India, women across economic lines often quit work after getting married or having children.Also, as some families' earnings rise, more women can afford to become caregivers.Still, when compared to nations with similar income levels, India's female labour participation rate is ""a distinct outlier,"" according to Vaishnav.Economists say Modi's two signature economic policies - a ban on high-value banknotes in 2016 and the implementation of a national sales tax rate (GST) in 2017 - have hurt women more than men because they are more likely to be employed in vulnerable, informal workplaces.Demonetisation thrust the informal, cash-based economy into turmoil. A year later, many small businesses went under, unable to deal with GST's complexities or rate increases.""If there are fewer jobs available, who will move out? The women will move out, because they get lower wages. The men will go compete for the few jobs,"" said CMIE's CEO Mahesh Vyas.In Dharavi, a Mumbai slum that is one of Asia's largest, 33 year-old Farzana Begum has struggled to provide for her five children since the workshop she stitched buttons for shut shop in the wake of GST.""I have stopped all extra spending on clothes and good food,"" said Begum. ""If you ask anyone in Dharavi, everyone has seen a fall in income, lost their jobs or seen factories close after GST.""Her dismay was echoed on the other side of the country, in a village near the eastern city of Kolkata, where Nuren Nesa's earnings from embroidering saris fell from 700 rupees a week to 300 after demonetisation. Following GST, work ground to a halt and her embroidery machine is gathering dust.""Modi's note ban and GST measures have destroyed our source of income,"" said Nesa, 41, who withdrew her son from university because tuition fees grew out of reach.""I will vote for the leader who will help us out with proper work and income,"" she added.As the battle for women's votes heats up, Modi has pointed to programmes to provide toilets and subsidised cooking gas cylinders as evidence his administration cares for women. This month, the main opposition party, Congress, vowed to reserve a third of federal government jobs for women if elected.HARD WORK TO HIRE WOMEN?Some business owners say they receive few applications from women.""We do not find too many women in the segment we service, even though we would like to hire more women because they are more sincere, there is less attrition and they can multi-task,"" said Vineet Pandey, who owns Mumbai-based housekeeping firms Kaarya Facilities & Services and Hecqo.com.Women in India sometimes do not take jobs far from home due to fears for their safety.Call centres or factories run by multinationals often attract women workers by providing transport after late shifts, but working at many other jobs entails commutes on packed trains and buses through teeming and cities.One businessman who employees roughly 1,000 men at his chemical factory in southern India, says hiring women would mean providing separate bathrooms and transport at night.He argues bypassing men would also stoke tensions, where economic transformations and an influx of technology are testing the social fabric.""In the rural areas, it is a more patriarchal society, if we give jobs to women and not men, there will be complaints from men,"" said the businessman, who asked to remain anonymous.""It is to maintain harmony.""In any case, it is a moot point for now. His plant, struggling with high costs of power and transport, is not hiring."

We have not created new employment. We have in fact eaten into the employment base we already had. So, today the real challenge is how do we create new jobs,"" he said.Pitroda said employment has been affected by factors such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).""If you don't focus on employment there will be a major crisis,"" the technocrat-turned-politician warned.On whether the Congress has been able to take up the issue of employment in its campaign and narrative, Pitroda said: ""You will see it in the manifesto."" He expressed confidence that Congress will finish the process of stitching up alliances in various states and its tie-ups will become clear soon.Asked if Congress president Rahul Gandhi was matching up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of being the prime challenger, Pitroda said he doesn't see the contest as a challenge between two individuals.""I think it is a challenge between the idea of India. It is about what kind of a nation you want to build going forward, what are the real challenges you have on employment, inclusion and all that, he said Pitroda also said it was a fight of ideologies and a fight between politics of hate and politics of love.He asserted that ""agrarian distress"" is also a major issue.""I was told that there is a problem of excess supply of onions and potatoes, and the prices are way down and that hurts farmers,"" he said.Pitroda, who is credited with being the architect of the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi, also alleged that science and technology had been on the ""back burner in a big way"" under the Modi government.Asked how the Congress will bring the narrative back to real issues such as employment and alleged agrarian distress post the Balakot air strikes, he said the party will raise key issues on the ground among people.Pitroda is part of the 19-member Manifesto Committee set up by the Congress to come out with the party's manifesto for the general elections.Pitroda has worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule."

Jagan Mohan Reddy at a public meeting at Tadipatri in Anantapur district on Monday.He said fee reimbursement would be revived and those women sending their children to schools will get Rs. 15,000 in their bank accounts. Beyond schooling, if the students pursue their studies their fee would be taken care of, he added.Criticising Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for politicising everything, he advised Mr. Naidu not to resort to diversionary tactics by targeting Telangana Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao and his party.Mr. Naidu is unable to ask votes based on the development he had done in the State, hence propping up Vivekanandas murder or KCRs alleged Rs. 1,000 crore donation to me, Mr. Jagan said. Mr. Jagan also accused Mr. Pawan Kalyan of surreptitiously helping the TDP and also alleged that Mr. Naidu was propping up candidates in all constituencies with helicopter symbol to confuse voters.A large number of TDP leaders including a former MLA from Tadipatri joined the YSRCP in the presence of Mr. Jagan. Addressing an election meeting at Adoni in Kurnool district, Mr. Jagan alleged that police officers were under tremendous pressure from the government.He said that a week off would be given to police officers and home guards salaries would be increased if the YSRCP is voted to power.The YSRCP supremo said onion farmers farmers have been getting a pittance. The YSRCP on coming to power would ensure that they get a fair deal. Services of employees who are currently employed on contract basis in the government would be regularised depending on their experience and educational qualifications.Interim reliefHe said that 27% interim relief would be given to the employees.Small business owners would get identity cards and Rs. 10,000 as loans whenever needed at zero interest, promised the YSRCP chief.Continuing his attack on Mr. Naidu, he said that the CM had promised the Gundrevula Reservoir  which would give water to about 650 villages  on August 15, 2014. However, the TDP had only laid the foundation stones in 2019, as an election gimmick.Addressing a public meeting at NTR bus stand junction at Madanapalle in Chittoor district, Mr. Jagan said that Mr. Naidu was trying to dupe people by announcing Rs. 3,000 social pension promise.Tomato marketHe alleged that Mr Naidu had encouraged commission system at Indias largest tomato market in Madanapalle, and made profits by selling the produce at his private firms.

Its market is open through the year, stocked with manjal or turmeric from Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States.The vast complex is 9 km from Erode, the city thats famously called manjal maanagaram or turmeric capital.The daily auction of turmeric at a market hall in Nasiyanur, Erode district. Photo: M. PeriasamyTodays session is well attended  nearly 452 stands are up in the covered market hall, and customers slowly read the yellow cards that carry the details of the farms. The typical nutty fragrance of turmeric permeates the air, as potential buyers break the roots to test for colour and freshness. Nearly everyone I meet has fingertips tinged yellow.And triumphantly, the office window displays the Geographical Indication (GI) tag that Erode turmeric won early this month. The GI tag is a stamp of approval for our turmeric, and a potential means for farmers and traders to add value to the local variety, says M. Sathyamurthy, the association secretary. It gives us an exclusive identity in a crowded market, and also stops people from passing off inferior strains as Erode manjal, he says.High in curcuminAccording to the documents that were first submitted in 2011, the GI tag may be applied to any turmeric thats grown in the entire Erode district, as well as to the crop grown in Annur and Thondamuthur taluks of Coimbatore district and Kangeyam taluk of Tirupur district.A farmer in the middle of a rich turmeric crop at a farm in Erode. Photo: M. GovarthanIndia is the worlds largest producer of turmeric (Curcuma longa), a perennial herbaceous plant of the ginger family. The plants underground stems or rhizomes have been used as spice, dye, medicine and religious maker since antiquity. Tamil Nadu is the third largest grower of turmeric in the country (behind Telangana and Maharashtra), with 132.4 tonnes produced in 2015-16.The spices colour comes mainly from curcumin, a bright yellow phenolic compound that has been in the news for its ostensible potential to fight cancer. As a result, the demand for turmeric with high curcumin content has risen, with pharmaceutical companies willing to pay up to 20,000 per quintal for such varieties (up from 7,000 earlier), says Sathyamurthy.Original mattersIndia grows nearly 50 types of turmeric, so what makes Erodes variety so unique? Our manjal is smaller and more slender, says Sathyamurthy. Plus, it has a high curcumin content of around 3.9%. The loamy red and black soil of the area is believed to be the reason behind the distinctive brilliant yellow colour, as well as its characteristic sweet taste and aroma, making it the preferred choice of commercial curry powder manufacturers in India and abroad.Once harvested, the turmeric fingers are separated from the rhizome and boiled for 15-20 minutes either in water or in specialised steamers until they get the right texture. The boiling influences the colour and aroma of the final product. The fingers are then dried in the sun for at least a fortnight before being polished mechanically to remove impurities and then brought to the market. Farmers say the Erode turmeric is pest resistant for up to 100 days after boiling.At a processing yard nearby, I find four women using metal sifters to clean sacks of turmeric fingers in time for a spice powder order. They pick out pebbles and grit, then sort the fingers according to size. These will be sent to mills for powdering.The daily auction. Photo: M. PeriasamyWhen I visit, the harvest season is almost over. The market is flooded with turmeric from Dharmapuri district, a variety known for its high curcumin. But the farmers look disappointed because their stocks dont fetch a good price.Turmeric is a labour and water intensive crop, so farmers grow it along with onions, tapioca and coconut or sugarcane. A farmer needs to earn at least 9,000-10,000 per quintal to make ends meet, says V.K. Rajamanickam, a trader and former association secretary. But prices fell to 3,000-6,000 this year because stocks were damaged by pests.The low prices wont deter the farmers. Agriculturist S. Thangaraj has set aside three of his 12 acres to turmeric, and he says the spice will always be popular in Erode despite the crop seeing hard times in recent years. And despite the threat of pests, farmers like Thangaraj swear by the native Erode plant. It lasts for at least five years, whereas hybrids die in three years, he says. As with everything, the original is always superior to the duplicate.nahla.nainar@thehindu.co.in"

2019-04-03,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/apr/03/make-vathal-while-the-sun-shines-1959466.html,Make ‘vathal’ while the sun shines in Chennai,"Vaishali Vijaykumar ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Vathal, vadam, and appalam preparation is an annual ritual in every south Indian household. Its that time of the year when the dough for the fryums is prepared and spread on white cotton cloth, dried under direct sunlight on the terrace until they become crispy. A stone or two are placed on the corners of the cloth. Women have an added duty to chase the crows away from disturbing the arrangement.I used to live in Tiruchi 20 years back. All the ladies used to assemble after the family leaves for work. We used to make a fine powder of urad dal in a thirugai because in those days we did not have grinder or mixer. Alongside, creepers of pirandai would be gently shown in the fire. After which, the juice would be squeezed out and added in the making process. The creeper acts as a preservative and has health benefits. After adding salt and hing, the whole mix would be made in to a dough with sprinkles of water. Small balls would be made into a circular shape with rolling pins. However, its a time-consuming process. Consistency and the right amount of sunlight matters. It cannot be left to dry for too long. This is the reason we hardly see people making appalam these days, said T Santha, a resident of Mylapore.Valarmathy Velu, a resident of Korattur, has been making fryums for 10 years. She makes all kinds of vathal and vadams  onion, sundaka, sago, ladies finger, cluster bean, eggplant, turkey berry and more. Earlier we used to live in joint families where every person used to participate in the making process. We had large courtyards where the fryums were left to dry. White cloth filled with fryums could be found across streets in the neighborhood. Kids used to enjoy these activities during vacations. Nowadays, everybody wants to buy from outside. What was once traditionally done in the village is sold in the name of organic in commercial stores and sold at twice the price. Its easy for us to differentiate the quality. Those days, grandmothers prepared fryums in large quantities and distributed it among family members. I do the same for my daughter, she said.Earlier, vadam and vathal were not only served as crunchy accompaniment for meals but also as snacks to serve guests. Considering seasonal vegetables were limited, women of the house made vathal from all vegetables and stocked them up for the longer monsoon days. Vathal and pickle played an integral part in the diet patterns of many households. Theyd never get spoiled.The ingredients are simple  buttermilk, salt, chilli, cumin seeds and hing. Leftover boiled or soaked rice is ground into a fine paste. After fermentation with buttermilk, it is seasoned with spices. Another way of preparing is to stir raw rice flour along with hot water without lumps. This also gives a fine and thick paste. Either way, the consistency depends on the desired shape. The dough has to be thick for spiral and ribbon-shaped vathal. It has to be watery for regular vathal. The final mix or dough is left to dry.Vathal is that which is made out of dried vegetables and added to sambar or vathal kuzhambu. Vadam, on the other hand, is made from a paste out of rice or sago, said Vyjayanthi, a resident of Aminjikarai, who has prepared a set of colour vathal, chilli vathal and ladys finger. Although the rise of supermarket products has taken over our consumption, traditional vathal and vadams continue to stay relevant and find the likes of this generation."

At the Jubilee Hills outlet, theres a full-fledged buffet where dozens of excited diners skip sitting down after entering, instead heading straight for the buffet to prep their stomachs for the delights to come. Whats remarkable is the age bracket of the diners; theyre all between mid-twenties and early-forties.Rates Jubilee Hills outlet: Telangana special buffet: Veg 599 plus taxes, non-veg 799 plus taxesHitec City, Ameerpet & Lakdikapul outlets: Telangana special thali: Veg, non-veg and seafood starting at 249 plus taxesTurning to the zestiness of the diners around us, Jyothi explains, These are the people who love home food, whatever lifestyle they lead. These food items remind them of home.First, as any hospitable thali event would kick off, have some buttermilk and some fresh lime water before moving onto the hot soups. Jyothi has been avidly recommending the mamsam bokkala shorva, a light and intensely fragrant concoction derived from the goodness of mutton.Pesaru gaare with creamy white and unsalted venna | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniWorking with the Rayalaseema Ruchulu in-house chefs, Jyothi keeps a sharp eye on the balance of salt, karam podi, jeera and more. She also says, Im very particular about how the vegetables are cut. If you want to keep it authentic, green chillies and onions have to cut the way people are used to at home.This food festival has equal shares of consideration towards vegetarians, non-vegetarians and pescetarians. The starters are not oily at all as one would expect but some items do offer some buttery goodness. Dont miss out on kodi miriyala vepudu and the kodi rekkalla vepudu; the cuts are succulent with mindful doses of masala. The pesaru gaare with creamy white and unsalted venna are also a treat, and Jyothi encourages all to try the diet-friendly homemade butter.The rice  the binding dish across the board  is what makes or breaks a thali and here, you can choose between bagara annam, steamed rice or mamidikaya pulihora. Mix these with the podis on offer with a generous splash of golden ghee and your meal is almost set. What completes it, apart from the dozen of katoris of curries and pappus, are the tomato and beerakaya chutneys.Chef Jyothi V at Rayalaseema Ruchulu in Jubilee Hills | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniTo round off the experience, head straight for the dessert. I dont think Jyothi will let diners leave without indulging in the gummadikaya halwa and bellapannam. The halwas texture is slightly crunchy and isnt sickeningly sweet.Whats her own culinary journey been like? The vetted home chef chuckles as she says, 15 years ago, I didnt know how to make a perfectly round and flat roti. Now she has penned a few Telugu books including Andhra Special Vegetarian Vantalu about a corner in the culinary world thats being propelled by women home chefs. I love that there is more appreciation and the position of women as home-makers is gearing towards becoming home-chefs. Its important because before it was frowned upon if we worked. Now its become a space for business.Pakka Telangana Ruchulu will be running at Rayalaseema Ruchulu outlets until April 20."

It goes without saying that these harsh summer months call for a cooling diet, and while an array of foods like watermelon, mango, pineapple, cucumber and veggies from the gourd family, are great on the summer menu, it is important to expand our diet to some other foods of worth in this season  spices.Spices are typically synonymous with all things hot and fiery, which is why they may appear to be misfits on the summer menu. However, the fact is that many spices have been used traditionally in India to keep cool and prevent sunstrokes in the warmer months. The prominent among these are basil, amchur, mint, aniseed and kokum.Basil with tomatoes is a great combination not just for taste but also for its cooling power. Shred some basil leaves onto a tomato salad, a great preparation on the summer lunch menu. Tomato and basil can also be blended together to make a puree, which you can use as a sandwich spread, or on a roti that can be stuffed with a filling of your choice and rolled over. Another simple way of using this sauce is to add it to cooked brown rice, making it extremely flavourful.Amchur, which is powdered raw mango, has unique antioxidants, such as lupeol, which is not found in any other fruit or vegetable. In addition to its cooling effects, it offers tremendous health benefits, including protecting the liver cells against pollutants such as cadmium. Add this spice to salads, soups and chutneys.Mint is yet another cooling spice. Mint chutney is a popular preparation, but you can also boil some of its leaves for a favourful cup of mint tea. Iced tea with mint leaves is a popular summer favourite.Kokum, a tiny fruit found in south India, has the medicinal property of preventing sunstroke and dehydration. Needless to say, kokum is much-loved by the inhabitants of these hot, humid regions. Beverages made with dried kokum fruit are cooling and delicious.Aniseed is similar to fennel seeds and often gets confused for it, but it is more delicate and does not have an aftertaste. Add this spice to your dessert or to just about anything and stay hydrated in the summer.Besides the above spices, we know that onions help prevent heat strokes. Folklore suggests that simply carrying an onion in your pocket can protect you against the harmful effects of the heat. Onions contain compounds which when eaten can prevent many heat-related problems.Neelanjana SinghNutrition Therapist & Wellness Consultant"

But the agrarian discontent and the dissatisfaction among tribals is still simmering. These are among the two central poll issues for the region that voted completely saffron in 2014 polls.The BJP has five sitting MPs here, while one constituency, Nashik, is with the Shiv Sena. Beyond agrarian distress and drought that has affected all five districts here, caste calculations in individual seats, Maratha vs OBC vs Scheduled Tribes polarisation will also have an impact on the results. Aware of the potential losses from the region, the BJP has turned down candidature for two of its sitting MPs from the region, three-term MP from Dindori Harishchandra Chavan and two-term MP from Jalgaon AT Patil. But this has, in turn, led to internal factionalism in the BJP. The Congress-NCP has an opportunity to improve their tally here, but it remains to be seen whether these parties can actually make use of an opportunity. While the Congress could win back the tribal Nandurbar belt, party bastion where it had lost no election until 2014; the NCP could potentially win Dindori or even Nashik due to local demographics and internal rivalries.AGRARIAN DISTRESS AND DROUGHTDespite the loan waiver announced by the Fadnavis government after the farmers strike in 2017, a majority of farmers are dissatisfied with the ruling government. The goodwill of the loan waiver granted to as many as 30lakh-plus farmers is not seen on ground zero.And even those who got the benefit now stand at the threshold of debt, thanks to drought. The drought this year has aggravated the disquiet, with farmers failing to recover, in many cases, even the production cost of crops. This year, I couldnt even recover the production cost of planting tomatoes over my two acres. I dont have the money to sow in June, said Kailash Kandbahale, a farmer from Nashik district.Despite this, Kandbahale may vote for the Shiv Senas Nashik candidate Hemant Godse and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. No government is good for farmers. The previous government was full of thieves and this one is made up of bandits. But Modi is good for the countrys security. This is a urban constituency, which will anyway vote for the Sena, then why should I waste my vote, Kandbahale asked.He said that there was no Modi wave like in 2014, but the PM continued to have a favourable image and was a deciding factor in urban areas. His extended family in Dinodri, a largely rural constituency, however, will be backing Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidate Dhanraj Mahale.Political observers said that agrarian crisis continues to be one of the strongest poll issues that will go against the ruling government in rural areas. From Jalgaons cotton and banana cultivators to Nashiks onion, grape and vegetable farmers, there is no cultivator who is unaffected by the volatile market conditions and current drought. There is a clear urban-rural divide vis-a-vis class as well as caste, when it comes to BJP support and opposition. The middle class, also from upper castes based in cities, prefer Modi and the BJP. In rural areas, there is anger against the Modi government and this is most apparent among lower castes and farmers, said a senior editor with a local, vernacular newspaper.In Nashik, for instance, there are nearly 8 lakh urban voters, of which a majority may be tilted in favour of the Sena-BJP, while around 6 lakh voters are from the rural areas of the constituency. In Dindori, a largely rural constituency, the agrarian distress, would have a greater impact.THE TRIBAL BELTThe north Maharashtras tribal belt, across the reserved constituencies of Dindori, Nandurbar and parts of Nashik, is unhappy with the government over the processing of their Forest Rights Act claims. Last year, 30,000 tribal cultivators had marched from Mumbai to Nashik seeking justice and speedier disbursal of claims that will give them ownership rights over their land.Barring Surgana, where CPI (M) MLA JP Gavit followed up on the 12,000 claims, the government has totally failed to meet the promises made to the tribals. This is a serious issue, as is the ongoing agrarian unrest, said Ashok Dhawale, CPI (M) leader and head of the All India Kisan Sabha that played a central role in both the protests.Gavit, the MLA from Akkalkuwa is also the CPI (M) candidate in the Dindori seat, turning the poll table into a three-cornered fight. Gavit, the man who led the marching 30,000 farmers, is a popular tribal leader. But this advantage to the Opposition may be lost with Gavit contesting the Dindori seat. We had sought this seat from the NCP and they should have given it to us. They are after all the bigger party. We are contesting this seat to win, but there is a chance of the opposition votes being split between the NCP and us, said Dhawale.The other subtle narrative in the tribal areas against the ruling government is the latters extension of economic and social benefits of tribal development department to the Dhangar community (shepherd). The Dhangars have been agitating for reservation in the Scheduled Tribe category for long. As the government could not deliver on this, fearing a backlash from the community, a cabinet decision was taken just ahead of the code of conduct to make all tribal linked schemes available to the Dhangars.Congress MLA and candidate for Nandurbar, KC Padvis campaign takes up this issue and this could go against BJP candidate Heena Gavit. While Gavit is not very popular, BJP leaders say in Nandurbar city, support for Modi will lift her chances of winning the seat.CASTE POLARISATIONCaste calculations in each constituency will have an impact on the results as will the overall polarization between the Marathas versus the Other Backward Castes (OBC).The states 16% reservation to the Maratha community has not gone down well with the OBCs, who form a significant chunk of voters in North Maharashtra. In Nashik a direct caste-based poll battle is likely with NCPs Sameer Bhujbal, a Mali (OBC) being pitted against Senas Hemant Godse (Maratha). In Dhule, BJP union minister Subhash Bhamre, an OBC, will be pitted against Congress candidate and MLA Kunal Patil (Maratha).In the case of Dhule, minority votes will also make an impact as Malegaon that has significant Muslim votes, falls in this constituency. These votes will go to the Congress, but may even lead to counter polarization, as it has for so many years in favour of the BJP.Even in a reserved seat like Nandurbar, for instance, the Maratha vs OBC factor will get played out with Marathas in this case voting against Gavit and in favour of the Congress, while OBCs may vote in favour of the BJP.The advantage in the polls will go to the party where the alliances are working together and the party organisation is activated. The BJP seems to score better than the remaining three parties when it comes to keeping its election machinery well oiled. The decision over Jalgaon candidate, who was changed at the last minute is an indication that the BJP is not leaving much to chance. After minister Girish Mahajans close aide district Jalgaon chief Uday Waghs wife and MLC Smita Wagh was given a ticket, the party witnessed opposition from ground level cadre. A survey showed that Wagh was not popular and may not succeed against Deokar, which led to the change in the candidate.The BJP is responsive and this may save us from the loss of one seat. The change was also done to dilute the rebellion by the sitting MP AT Patil, said a senior BJP leader.The Congress, for a change, taking a leaf from the opponent also succeeded in stemming a rebellion from its nine-term MP Manikrao Gavit in Nandurbar. Gavit was upset as his son Bharat was not given the ticket and Bharat Gavit had threatened to contest polls as an independent. Central Congress leaders met Gavit and placated him after a half an hour meeting.First Published: Apr 04, 2019 23:56 IST"

With growing number of heavy motor vehicles using the stretch to deliver vegetables, commuters and vendors are caught in a daily tussle.S. Deepalakshmi, a tomato vendor at Thayir Market, says that lorries delivering vegetables, especially those carrying tonnes of onion and garlic, arrive at the street all through the day. It is common to see at least 100 lorries delivering goods, from around 4 a.m. It is chaotic, she says.D. Veeralakshmi, a regular customer, recounts the time when the stretch was less crowded. She says that with the two-wheeler boom, East Marret Street remains permanently choked with hundreds of scooters and bikes. The lodges on the street do not have a dedicated parking space. Many employees and visitors also park their bikes here. No form of traffic control helps here, she says.The bus stop outside the Thayir Market also contributes to the stagnation of traffic on the street, commuters add. L. Jayaraj, a fish seller, says that the buses and trucks add to excessive pollution. He says that unless parking is streamlined, there will be little or no space to do business.K. Ammaiyappan, a functionary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and a vegetable vendor, however, says that the traffic is intrinsic to the street. The heavy inflow of these lorries means that trade continues to occur on a daily basis. Both these markets are central to Madurais history. It would be nice if they could clear the garbage here regularly instead of focusing on traffic, he says. He adds that the areas problems will be solved if two-wheeler parking is earmarked to avoid haphazard parking.A Madurai Corporation engineer says that earlier there were plans to shift both the markets out of the street. This could not be accomplished due to objection from the public."

In Delhi, its celebrated in a way that takes people back home, and a reminder that our city is a mish-mash of cultures. Since it signifies the beginning of the Telugu year, it is considered auspicious and people start new ventures on this day, says Santhi Kodeboyina, a Delhi-based IT professional and entrepreneur, who began her systems-integration company on the day in 2004.People wake up at dawn, bathe, make a rangoli at the entrance of their homes and decorate with flowers. Then theres the food. Its an important part of the festival, with Ugadi pachadi being a must in every household, says Kodeboyina.The pachadi is made of raw mango pieces, tender neem leaves/flowers, tamarind, jaggery, coconut, green chillies, and salt. It has basic flavours: sweet, sour, bitter, spice, pungent, and salt, the dish represents the diverse emotions we go through in life: joy, sorrow, fear, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear, she says.Pachadi, lemon rice and sakkarai pongal are the key offerings to the Gods, with pachadi given as prasad after the pooja. There may be non-vegetarian fare for lunch.Kodeboyina recollects how Ugadi was celebrated in her village Ramayapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Homes are thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed, we buy new clothes for, and new films released on Ugadi. She misses the sense of gaiety that was all-pervasive there, but says, We still try to recreate the magic. Heres what you can do on the day, whether you celebrate the festival or want a taste of it.Karnataka Food Centre in R.K. Puram will serve a special Ugadi thali. The food will be served on a banana leaf in a thali, says Usman Abdul Sharief, the manager.

The star of the thali is holige (puran poli), which is eaten with ghee and coconut milk. It is a sweet made of chana dal, coconut and jaggery, he says. Holige represents the local produce of this season: the end of winter and beginning of summer, adding that the coconut is for taste.(Rs. 300 lunch, 11 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.; dinner, 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.)Dakshin at Sheraton New Delhi is offering a variety of dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, in its lunch thali. Besides special starters, there are three preparations with raw mango as the main ingredient: mamadikai mudda pappu (includes lentil tempered with mustard and cumin), mamidikai annam (raw-mango-flavoured rice) and Ugadi pachadi. Raw mango is part of the seasons harvest and hence it finds a prime place in the preparations, explains Velu Murugan, the chef leading the preparations. Other items include vankai alasandala karam (brinjal and butter-eyed beans in onion tomato gravy), pala koora masala (seasonal greens), chikkudukai tomato korma (flat beans) and, aloo gadda (double beans korma) among others, all made from seasonal agricultural produce. Theres also chinta chiguru mamsam (mutton curry flavoured with tamarind leaf), natu kodi pulusu (Andhra-style country chicken), and royyala vepudu (prawns).

As the incident had happened in the jurisdiction of the Pydhonie police the case was transferred here and the investigation is underway. No arrest has been made in the case so far, said an officer from Pydhonie police station.First Published: Apr 08, 2019 14:03 IST"

From being an aspiring architect and nailing her gardening passion with her entrepreneurial skills to penning down her planting knowledge through her blogs, Goradia shares her unique agendas where she believes sustainability is life and how adoption is better than ownership.Earning her passion towards greens from Oliver Jamie, Goradia began her tryst with gardening eight years ago and since then nature has been her key to healing. When I was a kid, I observed how my grandmom would take care of her plants. Each attempt to help or give advice had her telling me to do what I want when I grow my own garden! Today, I understand why she said that, recalled Goradia, adding that nature has always been a healer.Over the years, she was able to amass immense knowledge about gardening. Her first piece of advice would always be to leave plants alone as they know how to grow naturally, and often help each other multiply. Her garden comprises strawberries, yellow cherry tomatoes, Italian and Thai basil, sage and brinjals.The list doesnt end here since she has also adopted land for okras, sweet potatoes, onions, broad beans, Malabar spinach, snake gourd, amaranth, radishes, papayas and pumpkins. Mangoes will make an appearance too, she adds.Gardening helped Goradia discover other passions as well, which has been a life-changing experience for her. I started writing about it, experimented with the greens and have had the honour to present a lecture on it.It has been a happy and blissful journey that has healed and empowered me, she said.Before signing off, she adds that one must try growing their own food. Adopt a piece of land with no intention of owning it. Contribute to it by giving it your time and then leave it up to nature, it will definitely proffer you more, she mentioned.Mangoes will make an appearance tooLavannya Goradias garden comprises strawberries, yellow cherry tomatoes, Italian and Thai basil, sage and brinjals.

2019-04-10,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inadequate-facilities-ail-vegetable-market/article26788186.ece,Inadequate facilities ail vegetable market,"At dawn, every day, the central vegetable market at Mattuthavani receives as many people as the flies that flock its lanes. For those like B. Panchavarnam, who sells onions, busy mornings usually end by about 10 a.m.. On days when there is a crowd, she says that of the hundreds that arrive, about one or two ask for a sip of water.We usually do not have a positive answer when they ask for water. Madurai Corporation refuses to fill up the two drums that were set up when we shifted here. We offer them water from our own canisters, she says.The vegetable market, which has over 300 shops with 8x8 feet space, continues to have many infrastructural inadequacies. In contrast to the newly established smart fruit market located adjacent to it, Panchavarnam says that many changes are yet to become a reality here.S. Uma, another shopkeeper, says that apart from water, the toilets in the market too are poorly maintained. Each visit to the toilet comes at a cost of Rs. 5 and Ms. Uma says that she cannot spend that amount daily. A special woman-friendly toilet with a sanitary napkin vending machine and an incinerator was constructed at the bus stand in 2018. However, the day after it was inaugurated, Ms. Uma says it remains locked.The toilets with peeling pale yellow walls are plastered with messages of a Swachh Bharat ( clean India), but people hardly maintain them. There is no water in the toilets for women.A. Thangarasu, another vegetable seller, says that it is the same with toilets for men. This is why it is common to find many men urinating in public. We do not have proper public toilets. Customers also complain, he says.Ms. Panchavarnam says that conservancy workers come twice a day to clean the market but do not make use of compost bins that are located inside. Those lie in dormancy, she says.Apart from lack of the above facilities, Mr. Thangarasu says that the Mattuthavani vegetable mrket is in dire need of an ATM. Many customers come to the market and do not have enough cash.They must travel all the way to the bus stand or K.K. Nagar to withdraw cash. In a trade centre like this market, why cant we have an ATM, he asks.An official in the Engineering section of Madurai Corporation says that toilet construction is a work-in-progress. He says that toilets cannot be maintained if they are free. He adds that the department has worked out a proposal for provision of drinking water at the market."

The BJP, in its manifesto, has promised to extend it to all farmers if it returns to power.I received Rs. 2,000 in my account in 10 days after submitting my application. It works to Rs. 500 a month, with which I can pay the wages of two farm labourers for a day. Beyond that, the scheme may not bring about a big change in our lives, says 60-year-old R.Manickam, a small farmer of P.K. Agaram in Tiruchi district.However, Mr. Manickam, who is anxious to save his 45-day-old crop of small onions wilting under the scorching sun on his three-acre field, feels any attempt to support farmers should be appreciated. But the general feeling is that the money could at least be given every month, he says, adding that many of his fellow villagers have not got the money even though they had applied.This seems to be a typical situation in many villages. There are hardly 10 to 15 beneficiaries in each village in the delta, where temples, mutts and trusts hold large tracts of lands, which are cultivated by tenant farmers. These tenant farmers do not stand to benefit from the scheme, says Cauvery Dhanapalan, general secretary, Cauvery Farmers Protection Association. Though the scheme is well-intentioned, not many are able to benefit from it, says V.Rajaram, president, Cauvery Irrigation Farmers Welfare Association, citing problems in land records.Mistakes in recordsThe land records have not been properly updated. Besides, there are several mistakes and inaccuracies. In many cases, farmers of the same family have joint pattas. Some farmers have not carried out name transfers too. The government should first update the land records thoroughly, Mr. Rajaram says.Village Administrative Officers have not been able to complete the process of uploading the data of eligible farmers, and only 30 to 40% of the eligible farmers have got the first instalment, says V. Neelakantan, district secretary of Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, Perambalur.Farmers representatives point out that it was initially estimated that over 70 lakh farmers in Tamil Nadu would benefit from the scheme. According to sources, about 21.50 lakh applicants have been found eligible so far, but the process of verification of applications is yet to be completed due to the elections. About Rs. 392 crore was disbursed as first instalment and the process of disbursing the second instalment has just begun. As V. Jeevakumar, vice-president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam, Thanjavur, puts it: Any assistance, even if meagre, will be welcomed by farmers, given their present situation. But there are doubts whether the scheme will be sustained and properly implemented. If only the government had implemented it four years ago, it could have been a big success."

Thats what my therapist keeps telling me whenever I ask him for five more minutes at the end of a session anyway. But seriously, time IS money; and we all know it. When Im forced to make conversation with a stranger (mostly at the insistence of my editors), I dont say I live in New Okhla Industrial Developmental Area, because, as Kimberly ""Sweet Brown"" Wilkins so memorably said, aint nobody got time for that. I say I live in NOIDA. Its shorter, sweeter, and infinitely more efficient in a world that equates chronology with currency, despite both being largely made-up systems.Time is money. And no one is more acutely aware of this than politicians, since the length of their terms determines how much money theyll be able to make, er, I mean, how much change they will be able to affect. The babus who created NOIDA (under the aegis of the UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976) knew they had to come up with a snappy acronym to attract potential investors, home-owners, and businesses, who were definitely not going to come to a place with a name that takes longer to say than it takes for a bitcoin millionaire to lose his fortune. And so there was NOIDA.Time is money. And money is power. Prime Minister Narendra Modis BJP government, which came to office by wielding an unprecedented mandate in 2014, knew it had five years (unless the damned onion crop failed again) to substantially improve the lives of Indian citizens if it wants to return to the Centre in 2019, and that it had to introduce some truly memorable initiatives and schemes to keep the voters in their ballot. But nobody has the time to remember complicated, impersonal scheme names.It doesn't matter what the plans actually comprise of, but their names need to be short enough to easily recall, and also have a certain intimacy so that people feel personally invested in them. You dont remember someone by the strands of their DNA, you remember them by their names. The Modi Government knows this, and so there was:HRIDAY (National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana)UDAY (UJWAL Discom Assurance Yojana)AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation)UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All)MUDRA (Micro Unit Development and Refinance Agency)AYUSH Ministry (Ministry for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy)BHIM (Bharat Interface for money) AppTime is money. And as the 2019 electoral battles begin, the Modi government knows that theres going to be an accounting for its term, which begins today and concludes in May, when the results of which national alliance will form a union government will come out. And so there was, acronym awaited."

The police said that he was frustrated due to consecutive crop failures.A couple of days before Bhoyar took the extreme step, another farmer Shreejit Vilasrao Hathe (24) of Wadgaon village hanged himself on the auspicious day of Gudi Padwa. In the last week of March, Dhananjay Nawhate (52) died in Pahapal village of Kelapur tehsil near Pandharkawda by consuming insecticide.Political parties busy in campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls, havent come forward to offer help to these families, said Kishor Tiwari, a farm activist and chairman of state governments task force Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission.Yavatmal has gained a dubious record as the epicentre of farmers suicides over the past three decades after the first recorded suicide in 1986.The tehsildar did (block level government officer) come for an inquiry, two days after the incident. But, nobody has come thereafter, said Dhananjay Nawhates wife Chaya.He left a suicide note where he blamed Prime Minister Modi for the hardships, Nawhates 19-year-old son Gajanan said.His father had Rs 3.5 lakh debt and couldnt repay it.FOLLOW OUR ELECTIONS COVERAGE HERENawhates son has passed class 12, but couldnt pursue further studies due to poverty.A local party has fielded Vaishali Yede, widow of a farmer in Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha constituency. The issue of farmers suicides appeared briefly in her campaign. But it was reduced to mere tokenism, just like Sanjay Sathe the onion grower from Nashik who had sent Rs 1,064 he had received as proceeds of sale by selling 750 kg of onions to the PMO by money order.Vidarbha is home for approximately 3.4 million cotton farmers and 95% of these are struggling with the massive debt.Most of the villages in Vidarbha are badly in need of basic social infrastructures such as all-weather roads, drinking water, electricity, primary health care and basic education.The economic plight of farmers might be illustrated with the fact that a farmer with 15 acres of land, considered a well off farmer in Vidarbha, has an average income of Rs 2,700 per acre per annum.It is a little more than what he would have earned as the legal minimum wage for working all 365 days a year."

Its only in India that illegal can be iconic, and those iconic fruit hawkers along the wall of Amarsons at Breach Candy, and across the road, who I am sure are completely illegal, turn into a blaze of gold and yellow. In Dadar, all shops  clothes shops, sanitary-ware stores, cycle repair shops, lumber shops; marts whether closed, defunct, leased or owned  are overnight lined with warm hay and stocked with cartons and cases of mangoes.Every alternate shop-front on the famous SK Bole Marg that leads to Kabutar Khana is resplendent with the king of fruit displayed in rows and piles from ceiling to pavement in all its Ratnagiri glory. Some of the fruit is still green and ripening, some of the mango is already a golden yellow, while some has peaked, with little red and orange tips. But beware, most often, fanatics, fiends and followers of the golden fruit, in their enthusiasm, nescience and philistinism, end up being conned and buying a fruit that comes from Chennai or Mangaluru instead of a bona fide Ratnagiri / Devgad Alphonso.Here is a quick guide to identifying a legitimate and honourable Ratnagiri Hapus.* Colour: The Alphonso mango often has tinges of red, and shows gradients of yellows and greens. The pure yellow mango has often been ripened unnaturally.* Aroma: The sweet natural aroma of a genuine Alphonso mango will fill a room. In fact, you should be able to smell a real Alphonso from a hundred feet away.* Feel: They should feel soft, with silken skin. Not wrinkled. Often people mistake a wrinkled fruit for a naturally ripe Hapus. That is far from the truth.* Shape: The Alphonso, also called Hafoos, Hapuz or Aapoos, is oval and all mature Alphonso mangoes develop a slight dimple just below the stem, small enough to hold a drop of water or stop it from sliding down.Now that you have identified and purchased your Hapus, what are you going to do with it?While I am a fan of the Paayari, and nothing gives me more pleasure than massaging a small green Paayari mango that has been chilling in the fridge, till the fibres give way to produce a sluice that can be sucked straight from the fruit, the Alphonso is indeed the king. And long vertical slices, skin intact pulled between your incisors, the golden pulp on your tongue, can make me delirious. Only to get completely unhinged when it comes to sucking the whole fleshy seed, till there is no mango left.Aamras still remains a popular way of consuming the mango, and while I love aamras as it is, in some communities, it is made by cooking the mango pulp with ghee, a bit of milk and a dash of cardamom and nutmeg, to be served slightly warm. This is a fantastic aamras too.And then of course there is cooking with ripe mango. We are familiar with dishes, pickles, drinks and salads made from raw mango. But here are a few things that are traditionally made with ripe, sweet mango, in areas along the western coast, where the some of the best mangoes grow.The Goans make a light, tropical ripe-mango curry called Ghotan Sansav. Its aamras cooked with a tempering of hing, red chillies, mustard seeds and curry leaves with fresh coconut and a bit of jaggery. Perfect with steamed rice and a small piece of fried mackerel on the side.Like all things Kerala, the Mambazha Pulissery  a traditional sweet-and-sour ripe-mango-and-prawn curry  is divine. Made especially during Lent, when devout Christians abstain from meat, the curry is made with yoghurt, coconut, small onions, chillies, ginger, mustard seeds, fenugreek, turmeric and coconut oil, with a handful of de-veined and shelled small-sized prawns, and eaten with steamed rice.In Tamil Nadu, a Raw Mango Pachadi is de rigueur for Tamilian New Year. But the same pachadi can be made with sweet, ripe mango. Grind up a paste of rice flour and coconut, tempered with mustard seeds and just a few green chillies. Cook the pulp till it turns smooth and soft; to this add jaggery and stir till jaggery and mango have blended. Cook together, then add coconut and chilli paste. Once the pachadi has thickened, add turmeric and temper with hing and red dry chillies.In Karnataka, mango rasam is made with jaggery, spices, and a taut green mango on the verge of ripening. In Maharashtras Konkan region, Ansa-Fansachi Bhaji is a sweet, sour and spicy dish made with jackfruit, mango and pineapple. I could go on and on. For me, Im waiting for that first box of mangoes to arrive at my house. I shall proceed to place the ripe ones in the fridge and patiently wait for their temperature to drop to a perfect 9 to 10 degrees, then slice them up and devour them.First Published: Apr 12, 2019 20:43 IST"

What caught our eye immediately upon entering the space is the Tea Bar with a suspended designer display rack above the bar counter. Here, you get sensory walk-through rare artefacts from Myanmar, besides the delicate selection of tea.The menu has been worked out giving equal status to design and flavour. You have Sunflower leaves crispy wheat flakes sal, Taunggyi Khowsuey, Spring onion crisps, Steamed buns, and the likes as uniquely conceived and tastefully presented. Ive gone through my career with a lot happening  good and bad  but as long as it doesnt come in the way of my food, I am fine with the consequences of everything else, says Khan, adding, In my professional success lies my personal success, he says.

2019-04-12,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/summer-brings-me-slivers-of-delight-says-kunal-vijayakar/story-7tZ4mfXPMhUScTSUBjTIuL.html,"Summer brings me slivers of delight, says Kunal Vijayakar","I cannot speak for other parts of the city, but Dadar, which is close to where I live, and Breach Candy, which is close to where I want to live, transforms when mangoes come into season. Its only in India that illegal can be iconic, and those iconic fruit hawkers along the wall of Amarsons at Breach Candy, and across the road, who I am sure are completely illegal, turn into a blaze of gold and yellow. In Dadar, all shops  clothes shops, sanitary-ware stores, cycle repair shops, lumber shops; marts whether closed, defunct, leased or owned  are overnight lined with warm hay and stocked with cartons and cases of mangoes.Every alternate shop-front on the famous SK Bole Marg that leads to Kabutar Khana is resplendent with the king of fruit displayed in rows and piles from ceiling to pavement in all its Ratnagiri glory. Some of the fruit is still green and ripening, some of the mango is already a golden yellow, while some has peaked, with little red and orange tips. But beware, most often, fanatics, fiends and followers of the golden fruit, in their enthusiasm, nescience and philistinism, end up being conned and buying a fruit that comes from Chennai or Mangaluru instead of a bona fide Ratnagiri / Devgad Alphonso.Here is a quick guide to identifying a legitimate and honourable Ratnagiri Hapus.* Colour: The Alphonso mango often has tinges of red, and shows gradients of yellows and greens. The pure yellow mango has often been ripened unnaturally.* Aroma: The sweet natural aroma of a genuine Alphonso mango will fill a room. In fact, you should be able to smell a real Alphonso from a hundred feet away.* Feel: They should feel soft, with silken skin. Not wrinkled. Often people mistake a wrinkled fruit for a naturally ripe Hapus. That is far from the truth.* Shape: The Alphonso, also called Hafoos, Hapuz or Aapoos, is oval and all mature Alphonso mangoes develop a slight dimple just below the stem, small enough to hold a drop of water or stop it from sliding down.Now that you have identified and purchased your Hapus, what are you going to do with it?While I am a fan of the Paayari, and nothing gives me more pleasure than massaging a small green Paayari mango that has been chilling in the fridge, till the fibres give way to produce a sluice that can be sucked straight from the fruit, the Alphonso is indeed the king. And long vertical slices, skin intact pulled between your incisors, the golden pulp on your tongue, can make me delirious. Only to get completely unhinged when it comes to sucking the whole fleshy seed, till there is no mango left.Aamras still remains a popular way of consuming the mango, and while I love aamras as it is, in some communities, it is made by cooking the mango pulp with ghee, a bit of milk and a dash of cardamom and nutmeg, to be served slightly warm. This is a fantastic aamras too.And then of course there is cooking with ripe mango. We are familiar with dishes, pickles, drinks and salads made from raw mango. But here are a few things that are traditionally made with ripe, sweet mango, in areas along the western coast, where the some of the best mangoes grow.The Goans make a light, tropical ripe-mango curry called Ghotan Sansav. Its aamras cooked with a tempering of hing, red chillies, mustard seeds and curry leaves with fresh coconut and a bit of jaggery. Perfect with steamed rice and a small piece of fried mackerel on the side.Like all things Kerala, the Mambazha Pulissery  a traditional sweet-and-sour ripe-mango-and-prawn curry  is divine. Made especially during Lent, when devout Christians abstain from meat, the curry is made with yoghurt, coconut, small onions, chillies, ginger, mustard seeds, fenugreek, turmeric and coconut oil, with a handful of de-veined and shelled small-sized prawns, and eaten with steamed rice.In Tamil Nadu, a Raw Mango Pachadi is de rigueur for Tamilian New Year. But the same pachadi can be made with sweet, ripe mango. Grind up a paste of rice flour and coconut, tempered with mustard seeds and just a few green chillies. Cook the pulp till it turns smooth and soft; to this add jaggery and stir till jaggery and mango have blended. Cook together, then add coconut and chilli paste. Once the pachadi has thickened, add turmeric and temper with hing and red dry chillies.In Karnataka, mango rasam is made with jaggery, spices, and a taut green mango on the verge of ripening. In Maharashtras Konkan region, Ansa-Fansachi Bhaji is a sweet, sour and spicy dish made with jackfruit, mango and pineapple. I could go on and on. For me, Im waiting for that first box of mangoes to arrive at my house. I shall proceed to place the ripe ones in the fridge and patiently wait for their temperature to drop to a perfect 9 to 10 degrees, then slice them up and devour them.First Published: Apr 12, 2019 20:43 IST"

At the entrance of the memorial that was inaugurated in 1961, there is a gallery, full of words and photos on the massacre. The lines, Its a tragedy of national importance that cannot be allowed to be forgotten, are a stark reminder of how India freed itself from colonial brutality.For Mukherjee, secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, this is both home and office  his residence is a short flight upstairs.The 64-year-old with green eyes was born here, like his father Uttam Charan. The Mukherjees from the Hooghly district of West Bengal have been the caretakers of the Jallianwala memorial since its inception. Mukherjees grandfather Sashti Charan Mukherjee, a homeopath practising in Allahabad, was deputed by Congress leader Madan Mohan Malaviya to arrange a session in Amritsar in 1910. He never went back. Present at the bagh on the day of the 1919 massacre, Sashti Charan escaped death by hiding under the dais, and later moved a resolution for acquiring the site at the Congress session in Amritsar. This was followed by a nationwide appeal for fundraising by Mahatma Gandhi and a trust was set up with Malaviya as president and Sashti Charan as secretary. The British, it is said, wanted to obliterate the signs of the massacre by setting up a cloth market here but the Indians managed to acquire the land in 1920. Miffed, the authorities arrested Sashti Charan, who had the land deed, but he remained resolute.Ever since, the Mukherjees have been the caretakers of the memorial. Sukumar, the youngest of three brothers, quit his bank job to take on the mantle from his father Uttam Charan when he died in 1988. I was appointed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi, says Mukherjee. Most visitors treat it as a picnic spot, sometimes they dont even care to read its history, he rues.Although the Trust is headed by the Prime Minister, managing the memorial is no cakewalk, says Mukherjee. In 2011, he had goons following him when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered eviction of an illegal occupant from one of the Trust buildings.During militancy in Punjab in the 1980s, a group of youngsters with swords apparently threatened to kill his father, saying they had seen people smoking in the bagh. Papaji was very gutsy, he said, kill me and they left, Mukherjee recalls.Living with a piece of history has its challenges. Kakoli, Sukumars wife who came here as a young bride in the 1980s when militancy had gripped the state, remembers the siege during Operation Bluestar. We couldnt step out for over a week, thankfully papaji (Uttam Charan) had a habit of storing ration. It was due to the barter of onions and tomatoes that she came close to her neighbours during that period, Mukherjee says. My daughters worry about my health and tell me Papa, youve done enough sewa, come stay with us, but I want to see the memorial through its 100th anniversary. Then, I will see, Mukherjee says.First Published: Apr 13, 2019 07:36 IST"

A long-held aspiration of the locals  to get a rail link to Perambalur  has remained unfulfilled for decades.The depleting groundwater table is a major cause for concern for the farming community in Perambalur, Thuraiyur and other parts of the constituency. The absence of industrial growth, the migration of labourers to nearby towns and the lack of progress in setting up a Special Economic Zone and a Textile Park are among the burning issues facing the constituency. Unfulfilled promises have left the electorate fuming.Like in neighbouring constituencies, farming is the core activity in Perambalur constituency, which encompasses six Assembly segments: Manachanallur, Musiri, Thuraiyur (reserved) and Lalgudi in Tiruchi district, Kulithalai in Karur district and Perambalur (reserved) in Perambalur district. Though the Cauvery passes through some areas in the constituency, vast swathes are dependent on wells or tanks for irrigation, say farmers.Lack of robust water management practices and encroachment of waterbodies have had an adverse effect over the years on farming  the mainstay of this constituency, says N. Veerasekaran of Lalgudi.Large-scale cultivation of small onions, cotton, paddy, banana, sugarcane and maize notwithstanding, the constituency lacks agro-processing units, rues R. Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam.Illegal sand mining in the Cauvery has taken a heavy toll on water availability, says A.V. Gopaladesikan, a progressive farmer of Kulithalai.The adverse effect on farming due to drought and other factors has prompted many to shift to nearby Namakkal town to work as unorganised labourers in poultry and bus-body making units, says Mr. Veerasekaran.When the ambitious Special Economic Zone in Perambalur was announced, over 2,000 acres of land was acquired from farmers during the erstwhile DMK regime. But the project has remained a non-starter till date, says Mr. Raja Chidambaram. The absence of industries has caused many to migrate in search of greener pastures, he says. Come elections, the perennial issue of rail link to Perambalur crops up. But till date, the project is yet to materialise, he adds.Another issue that remains unaddressed is the establishment of a permanent bus stand at Kulithalai.Three-cornered contestThe constituency is witnessing a three-cornered battle, with Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi founder T.R. Paarivendhar, contesting on the DMK symbol, locking horns with AIADMK nominee and former Minister N.R. Sivapathy and M. Rajasekaran of the AMMK, who is contesting as an Independent. Mr. Sivapathy and Mr. Rajasekaran are from the Muthuraja community, which has a dominant presence in the constituency, which also has a considerable population of Scheduled Tribes and Udayars, among others.While Mr. Paarivendhar contested unsuccessfully from this seat on a BJP ticket in 2014, Mr. Sivapathy is contesting the Lok Sabha election for the first time. Mr. Paarivendhar, who polled over 2.3 lakh votes last time, is hoping that with the backing of the DMK, he would make it this time.All the three main candidates are promising to foster industrial and infrastructure development in the constituency. Mr. Sivapathy says he will strive to bring a rail link serving the Ariyalur-Perambalur-Thuraiyur sector and revive the Special Economic Zone project.

Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, said prices of all the green vegetables have shot up in the last few days. For instance, beans sells at Rs. 100 a kg in the wholesale market and bitter gourd at Rs. 30 a kg on Saturday. Carrot is sold at Rs. 50 a kg and ginger at Rs. 80 a kg, he added.Most of the vegetables come to Coimbatore from Karnataka all through the year. There is a drop in supply of some of the varieties because of summer and there is no rain in the cultivating areas. These vegetables cannot be stocked for long.The public do not feel the impact of the hike as prices of onions and potatoes are normal. Big onion, which comes from Maharashtra, is sold at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a kg, small onion at Rs. 22 a kg, tomato at Rs. 25 a kg, and potato at Rs. 22 a kg.However, prices of other vegetables are very high.

For, they have been changing since the past few weeks. A case in point: one kg of tomato which used to cost 12 in the third week of March has shot up to 35-40 a kg since April 15.Not just tomatoes, the prices of green or red chillies, cauliflower, capsicum and other vegetables have gone up too. And the prices are likely to increase further. Of all the vegetables sold at Rythu Bazaar, the highest price is of French beans, which is 85 per kg.When asked when were the prices low, a vendor waiting for customers scoffed, Prices were low in winter, the season when we faced losses and even threw away some vegetables as no one bought them,. She pointed at a farmer, Malugari Narasimha Reddy, who doubles up as a vendor at the Rythu Bazaar, suggesting that he has a fair idea on the reasons that lead to price rise.This is the trend every summer. Owing to water scarcity, our crop yield falls and thus the price rise. When we cultivate a crop in winters, lets say green chilli, the yield is only 70% and the remaining 30% goes waste. And in summers, the yield is 30% and the rest 70% goes waste, said Mr. Narasimha Reddy, who was selling chillies grown at his farm in Nawabpet mandal in Vikarabad.The chillies that used to cost around 16 per kg in winters, costs 50-65 per kg in April.Mr. Narasimha Reddy, a seasoned farmer who has been selling his produce at the Rythu Bazaar since the past 19 years, and others said they get low price for their produce for eight months in a year, which increases only for three months in summers.While attending to one of his regular customers, another farmer-cum-vendor Kamalakar Reddy said one kg of tomato costs 40 per kg. But he sells it at 35, 5 less than the price listed on Rythu Bazaar charts.Transport costThe prices got so low in the last winter that we sold tomato at 5 per kg, said Mr. Kamalakar, who sells vegetables grown at Chancharpet in Vikarabad district. He said besides paying 30 per crate to transport it from his village to the Rythu Bazaar, he has to pay 300 per worker if the load is more.Estate officer at Model Rythu Bazaar at Erragadda, P. Ramesh, said going by past experiences where farmers incurred losses by growing some vegetables as many farmers cultivated the same crop, they have avoided repeating the mistake this time. This year, a few have cultivated onion. But we get it from other places too and therefore, their price has not increased, said Mr. Ramesh said."
2019-04-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/such-a-simple-recipe-such-a-magical-result-kunal-vijayakar-on-mayonnaise/story-H99cePZ1DQ63s1kEaQudTN.html,Such a simple recipe; such a magical result: Kunal Vijayakar on mayonnaise,"Ive often extolled the virtues of eggs and the many-sidedness of this smooth and oval object. Talked about how the modest white and yolk, when artistically negotiated, can burgeon into a variety of dramatic forms, textures and tastes. One such gastronomic opera is performed when two seemingly straightforward and unassuming ingredients  vegetable oil and vinegar  have a bit of a skirmish with eggs in a bowl, to result in the most wondrous consequence: a luscious, bright, tangy and sweet emulsion called mayonnaise.Mayonnaise in a jar, off a shelf, was difficult to procure in the 70s, unless you had an uncle smuggling in foodstuff from abroad. So it was no big deal that my grandmother made mayo at home. It was just done. She would separate the yolks from the whites and drop them into a large Tupperware bowl. To that shed add a bit of vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard. Even mustard, in those days, was sold in powder form. The most popular being Colmans Dry Mustard Powder, and a local variant being Atlas Brand. Mustard powder is usually made of finely ground yellow, brown and black mustard seeds and needs to be mixed with cold water and set aside for the mustard to catalyse and erupt with that unmistakable kick. Of course that was then; today you can just inflict a few helpings of mustard straight out of a tube or a bottle.So with three or four egg yolks, vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard in a bowl, my grandmother would instruct me to hold the basin at an angle while she simultaneously did two things. With a hand mixer in her right hand, shed start blending the yolks and condiments, while with her left hand shed start dripping measured vegetable oil from a large cup slowly into the swirling recipe. Lo and behold, as she got to the end of the oil, the vigorous liquid ingredients would start getting stable as if by magic and turn into a calm creamy emulsion of golden yellow.The mayonnaise my grandmum made, and my mum after her, was unlike the white mildly sour mayo that you can buy ready-made in a jar or a bottle. This mayonnaise was bright yellow, translucent, sticky, gooey, and sweet, with a sharp slam of mustard. And with this sauce we made the most memorable chicken mayo sandwiches and rolls. A simple soft bread roll stuffed with boiled or roasted chicken, a crisp cold frond of lettuce tucked in sideways and dressed with this homemade mayonnaise that oozed out from the side of the bread and your mouth when you took a bite.Paradise Restaurant in Colaba used to make these chicken rolls best, but now that Paradise is lamentably lost, the iconic J Hearsch and Co at Hill Road, Bandra, makes unarguably the finest chicken rolls on both sides of the sea link. Theres no lettuce in their chicken rolls, but they are stunning. Soft bread generously filled with both chicken and mayo, moist and fresh. Fresh is important, because unlike the mayo you buy in a bottle, this mayo needs to be made fresh and consumed fresh. If you ask Melvin DSa, who runs the bakery, anything about his mayonnaise, he suddenly goes coy and silent. Then, with a sly smile, he admits that the recipe is a huge secret and their mayo is clandestinely prepared in his kitchen at home and then brought to the bakery, so that not even the staff know how it is made.Well, I dont really want to know how he makes the mayo, as long as he keeps making it the way they do. Just across from Hearsch is a 60-year-old hole in the wall. Its called A-1 Bakery. They too make chicken rolls and their mayo too is from a similar recipe. After youve stood in a sweaty queue, the man behind the counter freshly fills warm bread with chicken and mayo and serves it wrapped in butter paper, on order. A-1 Bakerys mayo packs a substantial punch. It has a sharp mustard taste that cuts the sweetness of the sauce and is a joy to bite into.But if you cant be bothered to make the mayo yourself, and getting Hearsch to divulge the recipe proves hopeless, Ratan Tata Institute (RTI, as it is popularly known) often sell a tub-full. You can make your own sandwiches or dress old-fashioned salads, like a Summer Salad (lettuce, cress, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, radishes, cucumber and mayo) or an old club-style Potato Salad (boiled potato, dill, celery, onion, mustard, pepper and mayonnaise) or a Russian Salad, also known as an Oliver Salad, originally invented by Lucien Olivier in Moscow in the 1860s (potato, carrot, boiled egg, French beans and peas in a mayonnaise dressing). Or just simply boil some eggs and smear them with mayonnaise! By the way, do you know what my favourite law is? Its Cole Slaw!First Published: Apr 19, 2019 16:22 IST"

The Abids Bistro restaurant in it boasts a new revamped look and a menu that attracts buffet lovers, with ample parking space. On weekend evenings, diners are treated to live music at this 65-seater bistro that has a cosy ambience To top it all, if you happen to meet the hotels general manager SA Samee, you may get a lesson in Hyderabads history too. Do you know the first building which came up in Abids? asks Samee, adding enthusiastically. It is the St. Georges School and church; being a Hyderabadi, I too was not aware of this fact!Egg Salad | Photo Credit: K.V.S. GIRIThe new menu at Abids Bistro is a mix of Indian, Chinese and Continental dishes. Being a vegetarian, I relish the paneer tikka and spicy babycorn among starters. Succulent paneer cubes marinated in a spicy chilli paste are hot and delicious. Among the salads, the protein-rich healthy egg salad with its mild flavours is a winner. Non-vegetarians can try the chicken starters.Abids BistroThen we walk over to the chaat counter to indulge in pani puri  who can resist the crisp puris filled with spicy green pani and crunchy onions?. While you wait for your turn to be served ragda samosa, kati roll or paratha at the live counters, you can have an animated conversation, perhaps about the choice of music.Chicken tikka salad | Photo Credit: K.V.S. GIRIFor the main course, we choose phulkas. As we wait for hot phulkas to be served at the table to be accompanied by paneer gravy and dry alu roast, Samee informs that their clientle is a mix of business and leisure travellers. Surrounded by corporate offices, employees prefer to come here to have a relaxed lunch. We see more of a family crowd during dinners, having a get-together or celebrating a special occasion, he says, adding that their high point is the buffet and music. Earlier people had to travel to Jubilee Hills or Madhapur to dine in musical environs. Distance-wise, it is now easer to come here.Mango dessert | Photo Credit: K.V.S. GIRINon-vegetarians have a Hyderabadi treat in store with a choice of kheema pav, haleem or paya shorba. Rice lovers can go for pulao, flavoured rice or mutton/chicken biryani. Samee adds the guests staying in the hotel dine here to enjoy the Hyderabadi delicacies. The menu is on a rotational basis and also changed during weekends to include more specialities. Finish the meal with a pick from eight desserts including sugar-free versions for diabetics and weight-watchers."

But the price of the citrus fruit has skyrocketed in a month on account of the increasing demand for lemons in the city. One kg lemon, which was sold at `30 in March, is now priced at `90 in the Ernakulam retail market.The wholesale price has also increased to `75 per kg, traders said. The price of a single lemon, depending on size, hovers between `4 and `8.The lemons sold at our market mainly arrive from Andhra Pradesh. The supply from Tamil Nadu has fallen these days as the mercury levels are soaring there. They are now supplying to us only after catering to their local market needs, said Ernakulam Market Stall Owners president K K Ashraf.Earlier, nearly 1,000 sacks of lemon used to be brought to the Ernakulam market. Now, owing to the shortage, hardly 500 sacks are brought daily, contributing to the increase in price.Vegetable price upThe price of other vegetables has also increased by 30 per cent in April, say vendors. On market days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday), 12 loads of vegetables, including potato and onion, are brought to the Ernakulam market.The price of big onion is almost steady. In March, the price of one kg of big onion was `12. Now, it has increased only to `16. The price of drumstick is steady at `25 per kg. Other vegetables, however, saw a 30 per cent hike in prices compared to March, said Ashraf. Among the vegetables, the price of beans is leaping towards the `100 per kg mark, which is almost double its price in March.The rise in temperature in farming areas has not had a huge impact on the production of root or tuber crops like potato, beetroot and carrots. However, green vegetables like cowpea, okra, beans and brinjal have been affected. The retail price of beans has already touched `100 per kg mark.Domestic productionAfter the intensive drive carried out by the state government to encourage organic farming, there has been an increase in domestic production of vegetables.In fact, the domestic production has helped in meeting nearly 25 per cent of the states vegetable requirement. However, the post-flood conditions and strong summer waves have adversely affected the production of vegetables in the state, forcing it to depend on vegetables from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka."

Nashik farmer ends life over Rs 75K,"Amid big promises of cash payments and loan waivers in Nashik district, a 44-year-old pomegranate farmer from Malhan village in Sinnar tehsil, Santosh Shelke, committed suicide, as he couldnt pay a loan of 75,000 owing to severe drought and multiple failed crops.The state declared Sinnar drought-hit earlier this year, but the farmers are yet to get the compensation. Nashik goes to polls on April 29.Shelke is survived by his 35-year-old widow, Jayashree, and two sons  Pranav, 18, and Tejesh, 14. According to the family, a large portion of Shelkes loan amount was used to purchase water for consecutive crops, in final attempts to save each crop cycle from the heat.Rahul Kotade, tehsildar of Sinnar, has submitted a primary report to the Nashik district collector to check if the family is eligible for compensation. We have submitted a report with all details such as Shelkes bank statement, financial condition, and farm records. We will now visit the family along with a police inspector to verify some other information.Pranav, who was the last one to see his father on April 14, is still in a state of shock. He had seen his father standing on the edge of the well in their farm, before he jumped to death. My husband was depressed for the past three years. He had stopped talking to everybody. We never thought he would take this extreme step, said Jayashree.On Saturday, the day before Santosh ended his life, he called me four times, which was rare, said Harishchandra Shelke, 51, Shelkes older brother, who lives in Sinnar, a few km away. The sky was cloudy in Malhan and Sinnar. So he was calling constantly to check if it had rained. Only some places in Sinnar saw infrequent rain on Saturday evening.The Shelke family owns about 1.45 hectares of land. They grow pomegranate, interspersed with crop cycles of onion, wheat and corn. With little or no rain during the past three years, multiple crops have dried up on Santoshs land. Harishchandra said, During one crop cycle, Santosh sowed corn, but there was no moisture in the soil, so it didnt grow. Santosh then sowed another cycle in the same soil  but this time both the seeds sprouted. With no symmetry or space for the crop to breathe, Santosh lost two crop cycles in one go, and suffered heavy losses.My older son just took his Class 10 exams. He now wants to go to college. But we have no money to pay his fees, Jayashree said.The family owns two cows, which produce about 30 litres of milk a day. This earns the family a monthly income of 3,000-4,000.According to the sarpanch of Malhan village, Gangadhar Bhalerao, who is also Shelkes neighbour, Santosh was pegging his hopes on the money he was supposed to get from the government, under the Central scheme and another drought relief scheme. He waited for the first installment, but we found out the period during which this first installment was to be transferred got over recently. When the government makes such promises, they need to understand that farmers actually wait for the money.Over the past two years, the farmers of this region participated in a strike in June 2017, and in two protest marches  one of which ended at Azad Maidan in Mumbai in 2018. Among their demands were a complete loan waiver, solution to the water crisis in this region, and ownership of forest land tilled by adivasis.Finance minister Arun Jaitley, in his budget speech, had announced that each farmer would get 6,000 as direct cash benefit under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sanman Nidhi. The first installment was released in February. In Maharashtra, the government started the scheme on February 24, shortlisting 1.2 crore farmers. In the state, 30 lakh beneficiaries have so far received the amount.Harishchandra said, We are not certain, but the loan amount with interest came to 1.45 lakh. As this amount kept increasing, Santosh grew depressed about the humiliation if someone came to his door to recover the loan, or confiscated his land. It was his biggest worry.First Published: Apr 20, 2019 05:18 IST"

Occurrence of chicken pox as a consequence of excess heat in the body is attributed to the wrath of Pochamma.Every household is apportioned equal quantity of meat of the goat (or goats) sacrificed to perform the gav saat, which is nothing but worship of the seven goddesses, including the situr beiyye or the mother of cold. The seven onions and the seven cups made of moduga or palash (Butea monosperma) leaves in which food offerings are kept symbolise the seven goddesses, revealed Raj Gond elder Kova Bheem Rao of Saleguda village in Indervelli which performed the puja on Sunday.Outside villageThe seven leaf cups will be filled with offerings made with sugar or jaggery. The sweet food items are made at the collective cooking exercise within the ambit of the gav saat puja.The food is cooked and eaten outside the village while the onions and the leaf cups are left behind.

Bomb explosions would take place in corners of the country every now and then in Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Kashi (Varanasi), Ayodhya, Jammu,"" Modi said.""What did the then Congress-NCP government do? Held condolence meeting, expressed grief. They went about crying in the world, saying Pakistan did this and that in our country,"" he said.""But what did your chowkidar do? Your chowkidar changed this timid approach of the Congress-NCP government,"" Modi said.In an apparent reference to the 2016 surgical strike and Balakot air strike carried out in February this year, Modi said the security forces barged into the ""factory of terror and cleaned everything without any discrimination"".Modi said every terrorist is aware that ""Modi would trace him even if he is hiding in the netherworld.""Without naming any leader from the opposition, Modi said ""some"" experience electric current the moment I talk about dynasty and national security.He said the opposition was restless given the response the BJP got in the first two phases of the Lok Sabha polls across the country.Addressing the rally in a region known for onion production, Modi said his government is trying to increase onion storage capacity and reduce tax on their transportation.He claimed that the Congress tweaked crop prices to benefit middlemen.""I have fought a battle against these middlemen,"" he added.""Our government working to end the rule of middlemen,"" Modi said.Speaking at a poll rally at Nandurbar later, Modi said accused the opposition parties of spreading rumours that reservations will modified if he returns to power.Modi said he will ensure that the quota quantum is not disturbed.""Till Modi is here, nobody can touch reservations, given to us by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar,"" he said.Modi also assured people in the tribal dominated constituencies in north Maharashtra that his government will ensure they would not face eviction from their land.""As long as Modi is there, reservation for adivasis will not be removed. No one can lay hand on your agricultural land you are cultivating now,"" he said.The adivasis are currently struggling to keep their land with themselves as some provisions of the Forest Rights Act are being challenged.""In Maharashtra alone, 1.25 crore farmers' families are benefiting from Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samman Yojana. If voted to power again, we will remove the upper land holding limit of five acre,"" Modi said.""My government is also going to introduce a pension scheme for farmers in coming years,"" he said.North Maharashtra produces sugarcane which can be used for ethanol production, Modi said.It will create jobs for locals but the Congress-NCP leaders never allowed it to happen, he said.""These leaders used to get kickbacks for importing fuel.If fuel imports are reduced due to ethanol blending, they fear of losing their income,"" Modi said.Recalling that it was in Nandurbar that the Aadhar scheme was launched in 2010, Modi said his government ensured its wider impact.""But and now the Congress has approached the Supreme Court against Aadhar card,"" he said.Funds meant for pregnant women and children were ""looted"" by Congress leaders in Madhya Pradesh and were seized from residences of some of their leaders, he said.""They (Congress) are unrelenting in abusing me as I targeted their corruption,"" Modi said.The prime minister also attacked Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy for his alleged remark that those who don't get a square meal join the army and become jawans.Modi said that according to Kumaraswamy, people who guard our borders are not children of the rich and join the armed forces because they don't have food to eat."

He disclosed new markets would be constructed to shift Malakpet onion market to Patancheru, Gaddi Annaram fruit market to Koheda, Khammam Chilli market to Maddulapalli and a new market yard would come up in Wanaparthy. A special officer should be appointed for each market to prepare project report, mobilise funds, allocation of shops.

Traders procure the produce farm from the farmers and sell it at markets in Erode, Mettupalayam, Coimbatore and in Kerala.Poor monsoon, prevailing intense heat and shortage of water led to drop in the cultivation areas, said S. Manickam, president of theTalavadi Farmers Association. He said that traders purchase vegetables from farmers at cabbage (Rs. 12 to Rs. 14 a kg), tomato (Rs. 28 to Rs. 30 a kg) and beans (Rs. 50 to Rs. 55 a kg). Crops are cultivated in less than 500 acre now, he added.Cabbage is usually purchased for Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 a kg from the farmers. Later, they started cultivating alternative vegetables leading to drop in cabbage cultivation.Gurusamy of Gumatapuram, who owns two acre, said that currently 25,000 cabbage plants were cultivated in his field and there is a good demand for the produce. It is a 90-day crop and the climate is not conducive now.After harvesting the crop now, we will start cultivating cabbage only during rainy season that begins from August, he added.Another farmer said that in the absence of check dams, rain water from the hills enter Chikkahole Dam in Chamrajnagar district of Karnataka.Five to seven small check dams were constructed without storage facilities and water from Neithalapuram easily enters the dam, said V. Ramadurai of Susaipuram. He said that if rain water is stored, farming activities could be done throughout the year which will ensure the livelihood of farmers.The hill has been receiving good rainfall in the past three days and farmers expressed hope for a good harvest season."

The recent isolated rain notwithstanding, the State remains mostly arid.Drought causes crop failure or lower production. The NDWI, a satellite-derived index, is known to be strongly related to the plant water content and is, therefore, a very good indicator of plant water stress.The NDWI for 608 mandals in the State is either precarious or alarming. The NSRC, however, uses the terms watch for precarious and alert for alarming. According to the latest NSRC findings, the NDWI in 119 mandals is alarming and in another 489 is precarious. The crop is not under stress only in 53 mandals.According to the NSRC observations, crop in all the mandals of Anantapur is under stress. While the situation is alarming in 51 mandals, it needs monitoring in 12 mandals. For that matter, the crop in all the four Rayalaseema districts is under stress. In Kurnool, the crop stress is alarming in 22 mandals and needs to be watched in 31 mandals, in Kadapa 12 mandals are under the alarming category and 39 mandals need to be watched, in Chittoor the situation is alarming in 17 mandals and in 49 others it needs to be watched.Four coastal districts have the distinction of not having mandals in which the crop is not under water stress. They are Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and Prakasam. The district with a few mandals where crops are not suffering from water stress are East Godavari (18 out of 60 mandals), West Godavari (20 out of 46), Krishna (10 out of 50), Guntur (3 out of 57) and Nellore (2 out of 45). Paddy has been sown in 6.31 lakh hectares this rabi season and will be harvested in the middle of May.Sowing delayedBecause of the huge rainfall deficit, the sowing of all the other crops has been delayed this year.According to the National Food Security Mission Crop Calendar, except for paddy all other crops are sown and harvested in Andhra Pradesh before March-end.This year, however, the sowing of crops like wheat, bajra, maize, green gram, blackgram, horsegram, groundnut, sunflower, chilli and onion have been delayed, according to sources in the Agriculture Department ."

The furrows in his brow below his once white turban have deepened. He planted onions in his two-acre farm near Sonepat this winter and got what he believed was a bumper crop. That should have made him a happy man, but a bitter wrangle at the local Mandi over prices, which he feels are a conspiracy, has left him deeper in debt.I had a good crop . But when I took my produce to the Mandi I got just Rs 600 a quintal. Thats nothing . I am losing Rs 8,000 per acre at this price. Something is very, very wrong in this setup, said Singh. Poll promises of a subsidy dont interest him as he says money in hand is believing, promises are neither here nor there.As low prices continue to plague millions of farms all over the country, farmers and their leaders say cash transfers are fine, but the main issue is agricultural prices which make farming unremunerative.The farming crisis has deepened. That is why farmer issues have come to focus in this election, says Rakesh Tikait, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader and son of legendary farmers leader and BKU founder Mahendra Singh Tikait.Both parties (BJP and Congress) are promising us doles, more sops. That is good. However, the main crux of our problem lies in pricing. Most Farmers now sell their grain below the Minimum Support Price and most crops have no price support system. Look at vegetable farmers. We sold their harvest below cost through most of this winter. How will we survive?The year-on-year consumer price index for fruits in March this year has shrunk by 5.88 per cent and for vegetables by 1.49 per cent, according to data released by the government recently. Onion prices in wholesale markets had contracted by 31.43 per cent in March year-on-year.The net effect of this price fall has been that middle and large farmers who can afford to do it, have been sowing less, preferring to retain fallow land rather than suffer losses as farm prices remained low this year, said Biswajit Dhar of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University.Data released earlier this February by the government at the end of the winter sowing season and just before the harvest showed the area under crops is down from last years 634 lakh hectares to 617 lakh hectares. While the area under pulses fell 9.82 per cent, rice area was down 5.68 per cent, and wheat, some 1.37 per cent. Analysts said that even more worrying is that coarse cereals, the staple food of the poor, has seen its acreage shrink by 8.33 per cent.The fall in this years Rabi crop acreage follows a disappointing Kharif or monsoon season. Agriculture distress had seen tens of thousands of farmers blocking the streets of Delhi last winter, record farmer suicides over the last few years turning the issue of farm into a burning political issue.Our major issues are just two  apply the Swaminathan Committee report on agriculture prices and come up with a one-time waiver of crop loans, said V M Singh, National Convenor of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee.The MS Swaminathan committee, set up by the previous UPA government, had sought a crop price equal to one-and-a-half times the actual cost of production including the imputed cost of labour, land rent and interest on loans  also called the C2 formula.That has not happened as yet. Instead, a subsidy scheme on the lines of a universal basic income was announced for poor farmers with less than one hectare of land by the BJP-led government. While the Opposition Congress has promised a rival basic income package for the rural poor, who they reckon to account for 20 per cent of Indias population.Tikait, who along with Maharashtras Raju Shetty and Singh, had led the farmers discontent against the government two years ago, said the problem was not only the rate but the fact that most crops are not covered by it at all. Although the government announces MSPs for about two dozen crops, it mostly buys only rice and wheat.That procurement programme too is largely confined to parts of Punjab, Haryana and western UP, limiting the benefit of higher crop prices to only 7 per cent of the countrys farmers.However, large numbers of vegetable and fruit crops as well as commercial crops where price fluctuations have been high, remain uncovered.The farming crisis is a deep-rooted one and without structural changes many crops are at risk of becoming uneconomical affecting the viability of the farming business altogether, said Dhar."

The sheer scale of the impact it had on the export market was nothing short of an earthquake.Nashik farmers had invested widely in vineyards but the returns were plateauing. The blow came with the closing of borders with Pakistan and then, other countries flooded the traditional markets the world over  especially Europe  with their produce. The palpable and universal anger over falling prices of these food items and pulses and lack of a better support price must have been the reason why, when PM Narendra Modi campaigned at Pimpalgaon in the Dindori Lok Sabha constituency on Monday, he spoke about both draksh (grapes) and kanda (onions) and assured that the government has taken right steps and the issues of their prices and sale would be addressed soon.FOLLOW OUR FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HEREThese assurances didnt just underline the importance of farmers issues, along with that of tribal land and water, with regard to the poll discourse, but also brought them to the front and centre of an election campaign in the Nashik-Nandurbar belt that will vote in the fourth phase on April 29.Probably, the threat of farmer agitation  a sense that the electorate can go against them  might have compelled the PM to speak on farm-related issues. However, the Centre and state policies are wrong. Like the previous government, this government also thinks that money coming from treasury can save agriculture. The Congress NYAY and BJPs Kisan Sanman are both examples of this mentality. None of them want to open up markets or strengthen them. That is the real issue, said Shyam Ashtekar, a Nashik based scholar on agricultural economy and a farm activist.Krishna Dongre, an onion grower at Yeola, who stopped wearing shirts after he incurred heavy losses due to sudden slump in the onion market three years back, was not allowed to attend the PMs rally. If they are so scared of my agitation, why dont they do something? he said. Asked how he incurred losses, Dongre said that he had doubled the area under onion cultivation, on his farm, and the slump in the market next year resulted in him suffering heavy losses.This is a typical situation. Volatility in the market price and area instability are interdependent. It makes for a vicious cycle. Timely market information on prices, upgrading information, creating storage facility and extending weather-based crop insurance to farmers is the key to overcoming such issues and we are certainly moving towards that direction, Sadabhau Khot, minister of state for agriculture in Fadnavis government, said.The area under onion cultivation in Maharashtra has been increasing at a rate of around 6.4% over the last 10 years, but, on productivity count, it lags behind several countries in the world. India tops onion production in the world and Maharashtra holds 33% of the domestic production share.However, to keep the urban voters happy, the government intervenes whenever prices go up and bans exports. This is unfair, said Anil Ghanwat, state president of Shetkari Sanghatana, pointing out that overproduction is becoming a problem for farmers as it leads to drop in prices.Grape growers in Nashik have started producing export quality grapes. However, due to excess production, those expecting to sell their produce at a rate of between Rs 35 and Rs 40 per kg got only between Rs 17 and Rs 18. This happened despite the fact that Maharashtra accounts for almost 80% of the countrys grape export, Ghanwat said, blaming the Modi government for continuing the previous governments policies of minimal intervention in this particular sector.Increasing processing industries like wineries is the way out, but the government has no policy on this, he said.In Nandurbar, Modi assured tribals of their right on forest land and said the water from Naar-Paar project on the Tapi would come to the fields in north Maharashtra. Though he was not very clear and only said that, No one would be able to snatch land from tribals, the statement is being interpreted in the light of the long march of tribals last year seeking settlement of forest right claims and the fact that the force behind the march, CPI(M) MLA JP Gavit, is a candidate from Dindori."

Or, do you need to stock up on some flavourful ready-to-eat items since your week will be too busy at work? If you just said yes to any of these questions, then this newly-launched store in Koramangala might have answers. Nothing But Chicken (NBC) serves a variety of cooked, marinated and raw chicken. Claiming that their Halal and ISO 22000-certified chicken products are 100% natural, preservative and artificial colour-free, NBC delivered a few of their products for CE to try them out.First of all, NBC sells food by weight, not portion, and hence, buyers can try multiple options. What struck us was the freshness of the products. We first tried the marinated chicken breast with the Greek yoghurt and pepper. It was marinated with olive oil and all the essential spices, ready to be cooked, grilled or baked. So, we cooked it well in a greased pan on low flame, and it turned out to be one of those delicious chicken breast fillets that we have tasted at continental restaurants. Serve this with mashed potatoes and salads on the side, and it becomes a perfect lunch or dinner.The cheese and onion sausages, when cooked on medium heat, was soft and unlike other packaged sausages available in the market, these were of sizeable portions.If you are health-conscious, try their range of grilled chicken salads. These are ready-to-eat, high-protein salads that have been garnished with olive oil and contain some of the freshest vegetables to dig into. We tasted the Bistro Salad and loved the healthy combination. The chicken was sliced in thin cuts, making it easy to put the dish in a box and carry it along.Next, we heated the Angara Seekh Kebab in a pan for some time and boy, are they filling! With the right amount of spices and proper filling, they were some really great kebabs that we tried after a long time.NBC also sent over a box of raw chicken breasts and minced chicken that were only marinated wth masala, so they had to be cooked properly. It was surprising how smooth the process was, and for working professionals, this saves times immensely, and is healthy and fresh if kept properly refrigerated.For online orders and home delivery, log onto www.nbcindia.in.

In several other districts, there is a well-developed market. In Coimbatore, the traders have been asking for such a market. We asked for smaller area, about 20 acres. The Government can develop the infrastructure or it give the area to us on lease, says M. Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association. I have given this representation to the Governments repeatedly, he says.I received 75 bags of onions on Friday. Nearly 20 % of the onions were damaged. If I keep it with me for more number of days, the damage will worsen. Hence, I sold it for lower price to another trader, he says. In any vegetable consignment that comes to the market, there is at least minimum damage to the produce. Packing, loading, and transport are not well-developed in the country. Some vegetables do not last for more than 24 hours from the time of harvest, he says. In summer, when the temperature soars, and on days when there is heavy rain, the damages to vegetables are more.There is one cold storage facility in the city and four or five in Mettupalayam. The Mettupalayam facilities are used for potatoes. We have been asking for a market place with cold storage facility and a biogas plant. Though all vegetables cannot be stored at the cold storage, at least some varieties can be kept. The vegetables that get spoilt and are thrown away can be used to produce power, he says.The potential for cold storage projects is high in Coimbatore, especially in areas such as Annur and Thondamuthur. Though it might not be viable for small-scale farmers, medium and large-scale farmers can go in for it. Some of the farmer producer organisations that were formed recently are considering cold storage projects, said an official of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). The NABARD has revived its Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure scheme. This can also be used to get funds for cold storage projects."
2019-04-28,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/bitter-harvest-of-achchhe-din-in-maharashtra-s-food-bowl/cid/1689543,Bitter harvest of achchhe din in Maharashtra's food bowl,"Khand Jopale, 45, sold 28 quintals of onion he had brought to the vegetable mandi in Pimpalgaon, about 30km north of Nashik city.The farmer from Singde village under Dindori taluka of Nashik district got Rs 821 per quintal. Jopale had grown onion on one acre land of his own; he has another 100 quintals of onion at home. He is sure to get Rs 1.05 lakh this season from onion and make an earning of Rs 40,000 for the four-month crop.Jopale is happy that the price of onion for the April crop is way better than the price of Rs 300 per quintal his fellow onion growers got in December. Jopale did not grow onion in December, he had instead opted for tomato. The farmer sold 27 quintals of tomato at Re 1 per kg. He dumped about 30 quintals of tomato as transporting the produce 15km to the mandi would have cost him more.This year the onion gave a little bit of profit. But I lost Rs 20,000 on the tomato crop four months ago, he said.Dutta Bairagi, 50, from Dangsoundane village, also in Nashik, sold 60 quintals of onion at Rs 926 per quintal. His onion was of better quality than Jopales. Bairagi earned about Rs 50,000. But in December, he had dumped 15 quintals of onion because transporting and quality checking the produce would have cost him around the same money he stood to get from its sale.The quality of this (April) crop was good. The price is also okay. But if I count the loss of December, I made no profit from onion in the last two crop seasons, Bairagi said.Volatility in production and sale price, lack of minimum support price (MSP) for vegetable crops, absence of a mechanism to procure farm produce, poor sensitisation on cropping pattern and use of technology, import from other countries, and meagre institutional financial support have contributed to the ongoing agrarian distress in Maharashtra.Nearly 50,000 farmers marched from Dindori in Nashik to Mumbai  a distance of around 200km  last year to demand respectable MSP for all crops, waiver of farm loans and conservation and use of rainwater to address the water crisis.Opposition parties have made agrarian distress a major election issue across the country.There must be fair MSP for all the vegetable crops. It must be implemented. There has to be assurance of procurement and institutional support for funding and insurance. The BJP government did nothing, Jopale said.Bairagi agreed with his fellow farmer, but said he would still vote for Modi. Why? Modi is a strong leader. He did surgical strike on Pakistan. I will vote for him for national security, Bairagi said.Bairagi has not heard about subsidy on onion export that aims at helping farmers. The directorate general of foreign trade runs the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS). The Union cabinet doubled the export incentive from 5 per cent  started in July 2018  to 10 per cent so that the domestic price of the commodity rises.An exporter told The Telegraph that the market is overcrowded currently due to export subsidy. Indian exporters are buying from Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Satara onion mandis and transporting to destinations such as Dubai, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.A lot of people have become exporters after the government gave export subsidy. They are sending to Dubai because of availability of high number of vessels to Dubai compared to other destinations. But unregulated export may lead to over export followed by import at higher cost, said the exporter, who did not wish to be identified.Northern Maharashtra grows vegetables, and fruits such as grape and pomegranate. Sachin Sukadeo Gadekar, who grew grapes, said farmers are selling the fruit at around Rs 30 per kg. Grape is a risky crop as its production dwindles in case of heavy rain and hailstorms. Gadekar said farmers are often unaware of the market potential and cropping pattern. Most of the time, they do not diversify and grow one particular crop on huge land anticipating good price. It leads to over-production and low price.There is no agro-processing industry to further process and make durable products, he said. Besides, Gadekar said, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research should set up centres in Nashik district to popularise farming technology.Sunil Malusare, a leader of the farmers agitation, said farmers have no say in the price of their produce. The businessmen, exporters and other buyers have formed a cartel. They decide the sale price. The farmers have to sell at that price. In most developed nations, the government provides the market support apart from technology and finance.The Centre decides MSP for certain cereals, pulses and sugarcane. The formula they use to decide the MSP does not include family labour and rent on land. There is no MSP for vegetables and fruits. Farmers are left at the mercy of businessmen and exporters, Malusare said.Even if sugarcane is covered under MSP, that does not solve the farmers distress entirely.Suresh Shinde from Kurla village under Beed district has grown sugarcane over 26 acres of his own land. He has requested a sugar factory in his area to cut the crop and take it. The factory last month sent people who have cut the crop from 13 acres of land. The crop is still standing on another 13 acres of land.The sugarcane plants have now grown flowers. Once the plant flowers, its weight gets reduced by 30 to 40 per cent. Every day I am suffering loss. Who will compensate me? Shinde asked.While the MSP for sugarcane is Rs 2,750 per tonne, the factory gives Rs 2,000, he said. The crop maturing in 12 months has to be cut in time before it grows flowers. Sugarcane grown on an acre of land gives yield of 40 tonnes if cut at the right time.A farmer can earn Rs 50,000 per acre if the yield is good and cut in time, Shinde said. This year, he may not make any profit. If the plants are not cut in one week, he will have to burn them because they will be of no use for sugar production.Shinde said farmers are the worst sufferers in the Narendra Modi regime. Achchhe din (good days) never came for the farmers, he said.Almost like clockwork every year, drought hits the Marathwada region, comprising districts such as Nanded, Latur, Jalna, Beed, Parbhani and Osmanabad, and Vidharva region covering districts such as Chandrapur, Wardha, Yavatmal and Amaravati. Farmers in Nashik are opposing a central government project of diverting rainwater from Surgana and Peth area in Maharashtra to Ahmedabad.He said Maharashtra has nearly 1.1 crore farmers families. The banks have extended Rs 18,000 crore of crop loan to the farmers in the state. The entire money should be waived because of distress sale and lack of MSP of most crops, the farmers say.The ongoing agitation on these issues of water crisis and farmers distress  led by the All India Kishan Sabha, the farmers wing of the CPM  would continue after the elections, Malusare said.Professor S.S. Mantha, former chairman of All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), said over use of groundwater was the main reason for drought in Vidharva and Marathwada. The state government needs to create ponds and water bodies to save water and charge the groundwater. Besides, the top layer of the soil of farmland needs to be replaced with fertile soil to increase production.Drought is a regular phenomenon because within three to four months after rain, the water is finished. The groundwater level has gone own. The groundwater has to be replenished, he said.In some areas people are into jatropha cultivation which affects the top layer of the soil, he said.Nashik votes on April 29"

In the event of this court sentencing him to undergo imprisonment, some leniency may be shown to him on the period of imprisonment and the prison authorities may be directed to provide milk and rice instead of onion. If milk is not provided to him, he will suffer low blood pressure. The judges directed the prison authorities to consider his dietary request.Earlier, Manoharan turned down an offer of legal assistance and justified his actions, prompting the bench to remark it was sadly mistaken since it had initially felt Manoharan was venting out his anger after having lost legal battles in civil and criminal courts.The case pertains to Manoharan picking up an argument with his neighbour, an army man. His neighbour had won a civil suit against him after which there was bad blood between them. On March 5,2006, Manoharan picked up an argument with his neighbours family, abusing them and resorted to flashing. He had also attempted to misbehave with the armymans daughter.After a trial lasting six years, the magistrate sentenced him for three years imprisonment against which he filed an appeal before the Virudhunagar sessions court, which is still pending. Meanwhile, he filed a petition before Madras high court to quash the proceedings which was rejected by the appeal examiner, citing non-maintainability.Irate over this, Manoharan sent representations in Tamil to the registrar, the President and prime minister, badmouthing the judicial magistrate and court staff and levelled allegations against them after which contempt proceedings were initiated.When the petition first came up before the bench on March 22, Manoharan rejected legal assistance and justified his actions.The judges likened the judiciary to a Hindu undivided joint family, where the Supreme Court is the Karta (eldest member), the high court, the elder brother and the subordinate courts to younger siblings.A clear message should go to all, that the eldest brother will brook no such vituperative insult to their younger siblings, the court said, adding that it would be misplaced sympathy if such persons were treated with kid gloves."
2019-04-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/sri-lanka-families-opposite-sides-easter-terror-attacks-church-bombings-5698989/,Sri Lanka: Two super-rich families end up on opposite sides of Easter attacks,"By Jeffrey Gettleman, Kai Schultz, Mujib Mashal and Russell GoldmanAdvertisingA little before 9 am Easter Sunday, Anders Holch Povlsen, the richest man in Denmark, was having breakfast with his family at the Table One restaurant in the Shangri-La Hotel in Sri Lankas capital, Colombo.The restaurant was decorated with crates of oranges, apples and large, uncut pineapples, and the Povlsens looked out on the ocean rollers crashing into a sea wall not far away.At the same time, Ilham Ibrahim, the son of one of Sri Lankas wealthiest spice traders, was heading down to Table One in an elevator. Wearing a baseball cap and a large backpack, he stepped into the elevator with a friend wearing the same thing. Right before the doors opened, CCTV shows, Ibrahims friend flashed him a long, white smile.AdvertisingThe two families, the Povlsens and the Ibrahims, were about to intersect.One was a billionaire in dollars. The other, a billionaire in rupees. One amassed a fortune through jeans, turtlenecks and all kinds of hip clothing. The other, through white pepper, black pepper and all kinds of spices.They both were well-known and admired, part of wildly successful, close-knit business families from opposite ends of the world and perhaps opposite ends of the ideological spectrum.In an instant, five of their children  Ilham, Inshaf, Alma, Agnes and Alfred  were blown to pieces, one side slaughtered by the other.Two of the Ibrahim sons  Ilham and his older brother, Inshaf  were among the suicide bombers behind the series of devastating attacks around the country. And Sri Lankas Muslims have been painfully perplexed by the question of why two of their most privileged sons would do this.Everybody keeps asking me that question, said Hilmy Ahmed, vice president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka. I dont know if there ever will be an answer.A week after 250 people were killed in the attacks by Islamist extremists, Sri Lanka remains in shock. Fear is printed on so many faces. An unnatural quiet fills areas that should be busy, like Old Moor Street in Colombo where the Ibrahims ran their spice empire from behind an unassuming storefront with a gray gate.A visionary businessmanThe Shangri-La Hotel rises up as a sleek tower along Colombos scenic Galle Face drive, a 32-story rectangle of steel and bluish glass with unobstructed views of the Indian Ocean. The Povlsens stayed here, part of a beach vacation to Sri Lanka during their childrens Easter school break.It was Anders, the intensely private chief executive of a huge family-run fashion company called Bestseller; his wife, Anne; and their four children, ages about 5 to 15.Alma was the oldest. She had shared a few pictures of her trip on Instagram, but it was almost as if she were keeping her posts intentionally vague: glassy waves viewed from an empty beach, a tree canopy against a bright tropical sky, a portrait of her siblings, taken only from behind.There could be a reason behind this. In the late 1990s, a blackmailer trespassed on Anders parents estate and threatened to kill them if he wasnt paid. A few years later, kidnappers abducted a man for ransom in India, mistaking him for Povlsen.Soren Jakobsen, a biographer who wrote about the Povlsens, said the family has had security as their top priority for 20 years. Anders, 46, didnt like anyone taking his picture and avoided social media.The Povlsens live in a secluded, 600-year-old manor house. They also own several castles and 220,000 acres in Scotland, which Anders has committed to re-wilding, as he calls it. He is worth about $8 billion, Forbes says.He never showed his faceMohamed Ibrahim loved to tell the story of his ring.It was the late 1960s, and he was an uneducated teenage boy from Delthota, a small town in Sri Lankas lush center. He sold his favorite ring for bus fare to get to Colombo, by himself. He never looked back.In the bowels of Colombos Muslim quarter, he slaved away as a cook, then as a vendor of onions. Then he got into sesame and pepper. Little by little, he inched up the spice trade.Sri Lankas tropical climate and rich soil produce some of the worlds most desired spices. Until last week, Ibrahim ran one of the islands biggest spice exporters, sending 20 million pounds of pepper to India each year.He bought and sold so much, merchants said, that he could set the price. He also served as president of the Colombo Traders Association, lived in a million-dollar mansion on Colombos outskirts and kept a fleet of six cars, including a BMW.Family members said Ibrahim, even at about 70, was a tireless worker, up at 4 a.m., off to the mosque, then a simple breakfast at home. He spent the rest of the day in his spice factory, rubbing the peppercorns between his fingers, inspecting the quality of his products.His eldest son, Inshaf, about 35, was flashier. He drove a new white Toyota Landcruiser and stood taller than most Sri Lankan men, about 5 feet 11 inches, with a muscular build. Friends said he walked fast, no matter where he was going.Years ago, at D.S. Senanayake, considered one of Colombos most prestigious schools, his nickname was Kudda, or Powder, an affectionate reference to the familys spice business.Inshaf was being groomed to take over, and his father set him up with a copper pipe factory. A picture from 2016 shows Inshaf beaming as he and his father accept an award from a minister  one of several awards bestowed on the Ibrahims from the Sri Lankan government.He was a handsome man, healthy looking, and sported a snug-fitting gray suit and a long wispy beard.Ilham, the second son, about 31, was more withdrawn. Merchants on Old Moor Street barely saw him. It seems his job was to oversee a family pepper farm near Matale, a city a few hours away.Be strongIts not clear how long the Povlsens spent in Colombo: Almas Instagram posts indicate that she was in Sri Lanka at least four days. One image, taken the Thursday before Easter and tagged Sri Lanka, shows three younger children, presumably her siblings, sitting at the edge of a swimming pool framed by tall palm trees. The caption reads: Three little darlings.The night before the Easter attacks, according to a family member who spoke with journalists, Inshaf told his wife he was traveling to Zambia. As he said goodbye, he lingered an extra moment outside the car and said, Be strong.He then checked into the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo. His brother Ilham checked into the Shangri-La. Inshaf used a fake identity card, but Ilham used his real identification, a decision that, after the attacks, would have additional deadly consequences.CCTV footage from the Shangri-La shows Ilham stepping into the elevator and later into the Table One restaurant with another man who has now been identified as Zaharan Hashim, the bombings suspected mastermind. When the authorities figure out how they met, it will unlock a lot about what was about to unfold.It is not clear how Zaharan and Ilham met, but members of the Ibrahim extended family say Ilham was more devout than others in his family and that his young wife, Fatima, covered her entire face with a veil, unusual in Sri Lanka.The mutual attraction makes sense: If Ilham was looking for spiritual guidance, Zaharan may have offered that. And if Zaharan had murderous plans, then the Ibrahim family fortune could help finance them.Mother blows up her childrenOn Easter Sunday, the skies above Colombo were clear. The sun beat down. All of the major hotels  and churches  were crowded.Table One was filling with guests. They sat in long rows in green cushioned chairs, the room lit by bright windows. The food on offer included the likes of English breakfast sausages, fish curry and string hoppers (spongy rice noodles popular in Sri Lanka).Ilham and Zaharan entered the restaurant from different sides. At about 8:50 a.m., they blew themselves up.Thirty-three people were killed at the Shangri-La, including three of Povlsens four children. It is not clear how the blast killed half the family and spared the rest.In a photo taken at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo a few hours later, a man who appears to be Povlsen clutches a mobile phone to his ear, his shirt stained with blood, his left eye nearly swollen shut. When a Sri Lankan journalist asked to speak to him, he shook his head.At the Cinnamon Grand, CCTV footage shows Inshaf, wearing a backpack and ball cap, stepping into the buffet room. But then he stops. He walks forward and then back, forward and then back, several times, his body tight.He was clearly reluctant, the family member said. He was always more connected to people than Ilham.But whatever hesitation he might have been feeling, Inshaf overcame it. He killed himself and 20 others.Within minutes of one another, seven suicide bombers across Sri Lanka detonated backpacks stuffed with powerful explosives, blowing apart people at three hotels and three churches.Because Ilham used his real identification card when he checked into Shangri-La, the police quickly figured out who he was. Within hours, constables swarmed the Ibrahim mansion.They were greeted at the door by a woman who then turned around and dashed up the stairs. It was Fatima, Ilhams wife.At the top of the stairs in front of her three children, Fatima blew herself up, killing three police officers and all the children, ages 5, 4 and 9 months. Police officials said she might have been pregnant, too.AdvertisingIbrahim, the family patriarch, was handcuffed to a police officer and taken away."

Ragi and bajra would get the lowest SOF at Rs 12,000 and Rs 14,000, and Rs 10,000 and 12,000 respectively.In all, 119 crops, including fruits, vegetables, spices, agriculture and floriculture, were brought under SOF for the year 2019- 20.The highest increase of SOF, compared to last year, was noticed in sugarcane plantation, which rose from Rs 44,000- 55,000 to Rs 70,00075,000 this year. Similarly, chilli crop would also get a high scale of Rs 55,000-Rs 66,000 from Rs 48,000-Rs 58,000.In a few districts like Adilabad (brinjal with mulching), Hyderabad (onion), Mahbubnagar (bananaRathon and tissue culture), Medak (ginger and paddy seed production), Nalgonda (coriander, acid lime, custard apple, watermelon and fig, turmeric and capsicum), the SLBC recommended lower SOF on verification.In Hyderabad for urban horticulture , for 720 square foot (sft), loan would be provided between Rs 9000-Rs 30,000 in three cycles. However, there would be no change in SOF for growing 16 medicinal and aromatic plants.Also, the rate of interest would be linked to the base rate and has been left to the discretion of banks. Loans would be granted by way of Kisan credit card/agricultural cash credit. The farmers have to repay the loan in a lump sum on harvesting and marketing the crop. The repayment date has been fixed, linked to harvesting and marketing. Owner and tenant cultivators are ready to adopt modern methods would be eligible for loans."

I am doubtful when I hear about it. But my four-year-old daughters response changes my mind. She grabs the blue-and-orange box (with a cute illustration of Maggi, the little farmer mascot on the cover) from me and examines the light box with images of potted plants and greenery, and sits down to unpack. There are some pamphlets, a pouch with seeds of native greens, and a thick plastic bag that contains a coco peat brick. This is the farming kit introduced by Faiz Yousuff, specially for children aged three plus. He calls his company Little Farmer.Faiz Yousuffs little farmer kit | Photo Credit: M. PeriasamyAs I read the instructions, my daughter pours water (five litres) into the bag with the cocopeat brick and is delighted as the brick grows in volume to fill it up. She pushes the seeds of greens into the brick and waves her dirty hands around triumphantly. Children should know where the food they eat comes from, says Faiz. Once children start growing a plant, it is like owning a pet. They become responsible and care for it. It piques their curiosity. The activity improves their hand-eye coordination too.Faiz has already despatched over 300 such kits across India and also to schools in Dubai. Schools buy the kit as a summer camp activity for the kids. It helps cut down on the TV time of children. Its an activity-oriented kit. It comes with a sheet that has images of the seeds in various stages of germination. Children can colour the images. The herbarium sheet encourages them to press the leaves and note down its botanical name. There is another activity sheet to name the parts of a plant, he explains.In the pipeline Corporate farming kits that support greening and farming activities in offices. The activity encourages team building, improves communication, and fosters healthy competition.A programme called Eco-systems at Schools for students in Std VII, VIII and IX. In the activity called Little Farmer = DFT 2, the students set up a 200-300 sqft blue room at the school campus where they grow 25-30 different types of vegetables ranging from tomato and onions to bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumber and green chillies. All these can be harvested in 20-30 days. The students learn data collection and farming as well as technology where they measure moisture content and temperature. They get a lesson in trading too, as they can auction the produce at the school canteen or to their parents.They have to spend 20 minutes every day on the farm and record the growth of what they have planted. This entire activity is incorporated into the syllabus. These eco-systems are already functioning in Tiruchengode and ChennaiYousuff is awaiting patent for the Little Farmer activity kit, which is designed in-houseFor details, connect@littlefarmer.in or call: 96263-77677. You can also visit www.littlefarmer.inHe says children are curious about farming. Recently, at the Young Learners Fest in Chennai, while there were workshops on aeromodelling, art and craft, robotics, so many children in the age group between 14 and 16 attended our workshop on farming, which is a good sign.Faiz Yousuff of Little Farmer | Photo Credit: M. PeriasamyFaiz, who comes from an event management background, has conducted employment remuneration programmes for corporate companies. When he networked with people in the education field, it struck me that my father A Yousuf is fond of plants. My house is full of greenery. Why not teach farming to kids? Thats how the idea was born.He sourced the coir pith base from Pollachi, and pre-mixed the coco peat with nutrients to make it healthy for plants. It is sufficient for three yields of greens. Once the base was ready, we focussed on designing activities to get the child engrossed. Then came the recipe card on how to make a salad with the greens they grow. We also added a cover where the child can stick a selfie clicked with the plant, says Yousuff.All the child has to do is spend 15 to 20 minutes every day with the plant to make the connect with farming. Says Faiz, They just have to record the observations in an activity chart. When they see the seed sprouting, they know that their plant is healthy. At the end of the activity, they can proudly call themselves a young farmer. Other perks are that their reasoning skills improve greatly. They learn about healthy eating. It motivates them to set up a kitchen garden.Faiz says this may lead to the child thinking of an option in farming too. If one out of every 100 students turns into an organic farmer, its a big success for us. I wonder, as I watch my daughter making plans to grow carrots..."

And what better place than the Burma Burma chain of restaurants and their ongoing Thingyan Festival to relish this concept?I cant get over the Village Set they first place in before me. Its an assortment of traditional Burmese dishes arranged beautifully on a cane flat basket. The colours, the aroma, the delicacies and ornamentation of the whole platter...so much like the Indian thali.Start by peeling and munching the sunflower seeds, says Ankit Gupta, Founder of the vegetarian Burmese cuisine chain. He explains how guests in Burma are first served sunflower seeds till the main course arrives. Gupta, as a host, is gentle and warm, makes sure I savour my food like the Burmese do. As the cuisine is based on a specific country, it is impertinent on our part to celebrate its customs, traditions and the grand festival of Burma. The Thingyan Festival is a big festival in Burma as it welcomes the New Year. We travelled back to our roots, to explore and bring back new, authentic dishes and flavours to India.By now, Im tasting the Yangon tea shop favourite Quack Quack Palata  square pockets filled with a special mix of tangy and sour spices. Next, I dig into the traditional 999 noodles, flavourful, without any sauces. My companion choose the black sticky rice with eyed pea and pickled vegetables, its robust nutty flavour was a welcome change. It went well the sweet, tangy and thick eggplant-long bean-and-potato curry. Shan Khow Suey is my favourite  rice noodles in tomato relish, garnished with tofu, pickled mustard leaves, carrot and radish. Another favourite was the Tofu Steamed Buns with fried tofu, a soft-and-crispy combo with lettuce, onion, tomato and mayonnaise stuffing. But the star of my meal was the Lotus Stem Fritters  lotus stems sliced, fried and dusted with roasted paprika, rightly flavoured with curry leaves.Our village sets will serve two and four (people), and for the first time Burma Burma will also serve a small plate menu inspired by West Burma, informs Gupta. This includes an authentic Burmese dishes with names Kyan Tribe Rainbow Soup; Spicy Sour Tea Leaf and Avocado Salad, and Rangoon Ruby.Burma BurmaTill: May 5Timings: Lunch (12-4pm) and Dinner (6.30pm-11.30pm)Outlets at Select City Walk, Cyber Hub & DLF Mall of India, Noida"

Srinivasan, director, HOPCOMS, said that most borewells have dried up and many areas did not receive rain in the recent spell around Ugadi, creating an acute shortage of water.Papa Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar, said most plants had wilted away as temperatures soared and there is a severe shortage of water.A few farmers have found a way to beat this  water the plants through tankers.Most farmers now have dug sumps in the fields in which they store water through tankers  around five tankers per week. Each tanker of 6,000 litres costs 600. This has only driven up the input cost manifold, which is reflected in the selling price as well, he said, adding that he could not sustain buying water through tankers any more and had stopped it two weeks back.Tomatoes are a three-month crop and the present crop has failed causing huge losses to farmers. We will sow the next crop in a couple of weeks in time for the onset of monsoon, he said, indicating that it may be a couple of months before the supply of tomatoes resumes.The prices of other vegetables have also remained high. For instance, a kilo of beans costs around 100. However, this is down from the 120 to 130 levels from three weeks ago.Carrots, capsicum, and brinjals cost in the range of 60 a kilo. The only saving grace has been the low prices of onions and potatoes  both being sold in the range of 20  25."

The new Head Chef of Megu a Japanese restaurant at The Leela Palace New Delhi cannot speak English. On occasion when guests beckon him to speak to him, appears with a big smile, he gestures emphatically wishing them an enjoyable meal, and a courteous bow later disappears. But when his food arrives on the table, the barrier of language begins to crumble expeditiously. After tasting it, we end up chatting nineteen to a dozen but not in the way you know it, but through the vocabulary of admiration.All his 26 years of culinary experience was laid out in the new menu in front of us. Kazuya, with each course, showed us exactly how modern Japanese has seduced connoisseur the world over. Either from serving Washoku or traditional Japanese for a large part, to progressive Japanese influenced by the Western world post The Meiji Revolution. This event brought down the Tokugawa shogunate (military government), established an Imperial rule, and brought in Western ideas in every sphere of life, including food.Kazuyas sensibility reflects a nuanced contemporary calibre with presentations such as the Cold Tomato Soup with Snow Crab; Goma Tofu, Simmered Duck, Smoked Chicken with Plum Sauce, and a minimalist dessert that came with neatly tucked fruit and gelly inside a scooped orange. While the soup was mildly seasoned, the tofu and duck had a smokiness to them. The Smoked Chickens was moist and its earthy flavour complemented the sweet-tarty plum sauce.Vegetarians can sample Crispy Asparagus with its sparsely seasoned crunchiness, the Cottage Cheese Teriyaki with its tanginess, the Vegetable Tempura (okra, enoki, baby corn, onions, ooba) with its golden crispiness, and the Potato Croquet with Mushroom-Truffle Oil with a distinct oakiness. These dishes are expressions from Japanese culture that values not just food but also the social context its set in given the 21st centurys modern flavour profile. The Jap cuisine made many improvisations to its ancient form to embrace indigenous meats such as deer and boar, fishes like Amur Goby and Ayu and Western meats of chicken, pork and beef.Kazuya habours a steadfast ambition to keep his food simple and sincere, upholding the benchmark that traditional Japanese cuisine was always known for. At every post hes served  Hinokizaka at Ritz Carlton Tokyo, or at the Michelin-starred restaurant Mizumi at Wynn Macau  hes experimented with sensory perceptions of sound, sight and smell to achieve a bespoke presentation. Take the Crispy Potato prawn, Sea Urchins Sriracha, Sesame Sauce and Maccha salt dish he presented to us. Every ingredient thrown in had undergone careful visual scrutiny for their textures and olfactory profiles to supplement other ingredients, and even judge how they responded to a cooking fire.Address: Megu, The Leela Palace New Delhi, Diplomatic Enclave, Chanakyapuri."

The farmers are selling their produce to Chhattisgarh traders at a throwaway price of around ` seven to ` eight per kg from the farm field.We are forced to sell onion at throwaway price. We have to dispose it as quickly as possible as it is not possible to protect the damaged onion for a longer period. Besides, there is no market to sell our product,  said a farmer.Horticulture department sources said this year, onion was grown in 2,485 hectares (ha) with a production target of about 38,000 tonne. The department had provided onion seed at subsidised rate for 50 ha. In the last rabi season, the onion was cultivated in 2,363 ha.Though 50 per cent subsidy is available for farmers to set up a 25-tonne capacity onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are few takers in the district. Each storage costs around `1.8 lakh.This apart, onion crop is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). As of now, crop condition is very good and harvesting has commenced in major growing blocks. The harvesting of rabi onion normally begins from mid-March and continues till June.Banamali Majhi, a small farmer of Matia village in Bhawanipatna block, said, This season, I had grown onion in two acre. We are forced to dispose the stock from the harvesting field to the traders due to inadequate storage facilities and market linkage. After storing for about three to four months, they sell it at higher price.Deputy Director of Horticulture Sailesh Pattnaik said in the last three years, only 187 storage facilities have been set up by the farmers under the mission. There are few takers for the storage houses as farmers have to first invest to complete the structure and be eligible for subsidy later. If banks come forward and finance the stores, more farmers can take the benefit of the mission, he said."

The five years gone by have been difficult, he says. Yet, he feels the countrys security is the most important issue. Desh ko bachaana hai to Modi ko hi laana padega (If we have to save India, we will have to bring back Modi), says the Jhunjhunu resident.His statement sums up the general mood in Rajasthans Shekhawati region, where the kisan and the jawan are the main poll issues. Most people here agree that the region has barely seen any development in the last five years. Water scarcity, lack of job opportunities and educational institutions, and poor state of healthcare are major problems.FOLLOW OUR FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HEREHowever, the Pulwama attack and subsequent airstrikes in Pakistan seem to have more resonance among the voters and have significantly improved BJPs prospects in the Jat-dominated region.The Shekhawati region, comprising three Lok Sabha seats of Churu, Jhunjhunu and Sikar, was also the epicentre of farmers protest in 2018 over poor crop prices, issues of government procurement and stray cattle. The farmers are admittedly frustrated, even furious.But the narrative of nationalism runs high and the BJP seems to have an edge in Churu and Jhunjhunu. In Sikar, however, the Congress has an upper hand and many say they would vote on the basis of real issues such as unemployment and farm crisis, not on the basis of TV propagated nationalism.Disappointment was writ large on the faces of farmers sitting at the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar. Three of their fellow farmers collapsed and died due to heart attack in this mandi within three months. They complained the Modi governments crop insurance scheme or Fasal Beema Yojana had not benefitted them.Jita Ram Sahni, who grows groundnut, onion and gram claims he has paid over `3 lakh in premium in three years but the government is not even clearing `1 lakh for the loss of his crops due to lack of water and poor weather conditions. This government has not done anything for farmers. I have not received a single penny under the Yojana. Every time I visit the insurance office, they ask for a new set of documents. I have all the papers, but they make excuses, he says.Sahni is interrupted by Lakshman Sharma who terms the scheme a success. But he is shut down by other farmers who term him a commission agent. Because the government does not purchase our crops, we are forced to sell our produce to people like him at dirt cheap prices. Onions are being sold at `2 a kg. We used to get better prices earlier, says Nathu Ram.In Jhunjhunu mandi too, farmers echo similar sentiments. Modiji said he would get black money through demonetisation. Demonetisation did no good, but wreaked havoc in our lives, says Som Lal. He has no hopes from Congresss Nyay scheme either, but expects that Rahul Gandhi will at least not force demonetisation.Among the three constituencies in the Shekhawati region, it is Jhunjhunu that sends maximum number of soldiers to the countrys borders. Hence, the narrative of India teaching a lesson to Pakistan with Balakot airstrike is the most popular here, especially among urban voters. Sipping tea in the heritage city of Mandava, Vijender Singh, 28, says, Modiji gave free hand to our soldiers to carry out airstrikes. No other leader has done this ever. We have to vote for Modiji to teach Pakistan a lesson.He denies that unemployment has been a problem. I was a teacher but am not working for past two years and thinking of doing business. I cannot say I lost my job. There are other people like me. Churu, which has a significant number of retired army personnel, also seems to be riding high on the sentiment of nationalism. Lawyer Sumer Singh Rathore says national security is the only issue and only PM Modi can show Pakistan its place."

Buyers thronged different daily markets in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to stock up on vegetables, dry food and fruits. Though grocery items remained unchanged, price of potato, onion and other vegetables has been almost doubled. According to market sources, potato, which was being sold at Rs 12-a-kg few days back, is now charged Rs 22 to Rs 30 per kg while onion vanished from the retail shops in the periphery areas of the Capital.While tomato, brinjal and ladyfinger are priced at Rs 40 to 50 a kilo each, bitter gourd, pointed gourd and coriander leaves are sold at Rs 60, Rs 100 and Rs 200 a kg respectively. Retail vegetable markets and shopping malls like Big Bazaar and Reliance Fresh witnessed huge rush on Wednesday and Thursday as people made a beeline to buy commodities. Not only shops, long queues were also witnessed before the fuel stations. If the prediction of Met office is to be believed, Bhubaneswar will experience heavy rainfall. Thats why I have purchased essential commodities and dry food for at least a week. The traders have already hiked the price, which may increase further, said Indumati Sahani, a resident of Unit-IX. Traders attributed it to the rise in demand from the consumers, who procured commodities two to three times of their usual requirement in anticipation of the stocks vanishing.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said there is no reason to panic as required quantity of essential commodities has been stocked and green vegetables will arrive as usual if there is no damage to roads. There was scarcity of some commodities on Wednesday as labourers did not load and unload as it was Labour Day. Though we have been advising people to buy only the quantity required, they are in no mood to pay any heed. Markets witnessed heavy rush and people went for more tuber and dry foods besides vegetables, Panda said. Panda informed that potato and onion is priced at Rs 1,350 a quintal in the wholesale market.It is the retailers who are taking advantage of the situation to make some easy bucks, he added and demanded the administration to step in immediately. Meanwhile, the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department has directed district collectors to keep a close watch on price and availability of essential commodities in the market and ensure that food items are available at reasonable prices to the consumers. Since disruption of supply of different commodities like pulses, edible oil, sugar, potato, onion, flattened rice and jaggery is apprehended, an official communication warned that unscrupulous traders may resort to unfair practices like hoarding and profiteering leading to public discontentment. The market intelligence wing has been asked to keep close watch on hoarding by unscrupulous traders. Collectors have been instructed to deploy civil supply and market intelligence field staff for surprise checks and take action under provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1995 against illegal hoarders if warranted."

Thus, on a recent morning, at the kitchen of the hotel, he got into full experimental mode. And the first dish that he made had fried pearlspot, and spread over it was a marinated mix. It consisted of raw mango, shallots, garlic, ginger, curry leaf and a dash of kandhari (chillies). This is a healthy combination, says Amal. And during the mango season, I wanted to add a touch of the fruit.At one side of the plate, there is a stretch of rice, almost like a pathway, but with a greenish tinge. This is the Kaima rice, which is usually grown in Wayanad and is an aromatic, non-basmati rice. To this, Amal had added air-dried curry leaf to give it a greenish tinge. Thereafter, he added a vegetable salad, consisting of thin slices of carrot and onions, with a dash of lemon.Amal C A at the Le MeridienI ensure that all my dishes have proteins, carbohydrates and fibre, he says. So, in this dish, the pearlspot provided the proteins, carbohydrates came from the kaima rice and the fibre was got from the vegetables.His next dish seems like the typical tapioca (kappa) and fish curry. But it is quite different because, for one, the kappa is creamy and milky. There are two fillets of pearlspot with a slice of masala in between, which has kokum and coconut. Once again, there are vegetables on one side.The third dish has been inspired by a Syrian Christian dish called chemeen koonthal idiyappam. So, in a circle on the edge of the plate are the pidis (rice dumplings) but soaked in a yellow coconut gravy. In the middle is the traditional idiyappam (rice noodles), but instead of the usual grated coconut, there are prawns and squids inside it. Again, there is a salad, with a small addition: a small cup of flavoured coconut milk, which you can add to the idiyappam.All three dishes are sumptuous in taste. You get gripped by the various spices, and the combinations clearly show that Amal has a natural talent and feel for cooking. As he beams, Amal says, I want to make dishes which do not loe its authentic taste. It should also be a mind-blowing experience. Many guests have told me, This is the first time I have ever eaten something like this.The chef who grew up in Kothamangalam got attracted to cooking at a very early age.Both my parents were interested in cooking, as well as a few uncles, says Amal. But the biggest inspiration has been my mother, Indira. We are three boys and had no sisters. From childhood, we would help our mother in the kitchen. Indira would show the boys how to make one appam and then would tell the boys to make the rest. That was how we learned, he says. She would always tell us to make food in our own style.And Amal learnt to implement it early. Since he was plump, his mother would tell him to eat one egg, while his brothers had two. So I would add a lot of onions, and chillies, to bulk up my omelette, so that it seemed I was having two eggs, he says, with a smile."

In the evening, after the zoo closes at 5 pm, they get khichdi, Akanrhawa says.After Heera has had his breakfast, the caretaker leads him to a stretch, close to the pond inside their sprawling enclosure, where he will be bathed. Lakshmi, meanwhile, is having fun wallowing in the mud in a shallow pit nearby. Elephants like spraying themselves with muddy water. A thick coating of mud acts as a natural sunscreen and soothes insect bites. And, they love it when they get a scrub, Akanrhawa says.Usually, I bathe them once a day. They waddle into the pond whenever it gets hot, he says. The zoo has four leopards, kept in two cages, each with a large desert cooler and two fans. Their caretaker, Sridhar, makes sure they get water after ever half an hour. The big cats get 6 kg of red meat, their only meal for the day, around noon.We reduce their meat intake by 2 kg in summer so that they can hold more water in their stomach and dont feel dehydrated, he explains. My leopards consume one kg of glucose a week. I also mix ORS in their water to deal with electrolyte imbalance due to the excessive heat, he says. The zoos curator, Riyaz Khan, says the workers stick to a diet chart prepared by experts for summers.We give beetroot, bael, onion, garlic, watermelon, muskmelon, etc to our bears. Glucose and ORS protect them from heat stroke, he says, adding that 70 desert coolers in the zoo operate round-the-clock in summer months."

But believe it or knot, thats what an official on election duty is dreaming of. Consider this: The seven-phase Lok Sabha elections may have given the politicians ample time to cool their heels dreaming of a win, but it has given sleepless nights for a section of government officials deputed for election duty as they will be relieved only after the election results are announced. One such officer posted on duty and in charge of electoral rolls is fed up as it is often bachelors who end up doing this tedious job. He thinks he has hit upon a brilliant plan: of getting married to avoid poll duty! Some poll effect this!For the sake of nameWhats in a name? For political foes, it means everything. In Mandya, you had many Sumalathas in the fray. Gulbarga constituency perhaps has its own share of namesakes. The idea is to confuse the voter and hoping to eat into the votes of the opponent. BJP candidate Umesh Jadhav perhaps doesnt know that that there is another person who shares his name. His opponents searched every inch of the constituency to find another Umesh Jadhav. When they found him, they persuaded him to file the papers. They brought him to the office of the Returning Officer just 10 minutes prior to the deadline on the last day of filing nomination papers. The officials provided him the necessary papers. While he was filling the forms, he received a phone call. He stopped filling the form and just vanished. This happened nearly a month ago. And the people who discovered Umesh Jadhav are still searching high and low for him.Sea food festival? Chew on this!Here is some food for thought. On Saturday, the first seafood festival at Bengre island was inaugurated on the sidelines of a wrestling tournament conducted by Bengre Veera Bhrathi Vyayama Shala. And the person who inaugurated it didnt know then perhaps that he would have to wrestle with the choice of fare before him. It was yummy and exotic alright. But there was a huge, huge problem. Panambur Inspector of Police Sathyanarayana along with community leaders inaugurated the seafood festival. The members of Bengre Vidyarthi Sanga Yuvaka Mandali, who organized the festival, laid out a royal spread for the Inspector. He was impressed no doubt. But it turned out that the Inspector was a vegetarian and had to content himself feasting on the cucumber and onions meant for the salad while others wolfed down prawns, squid, clams and fish items. This is what is called bite off more than one can chew!No kidding! Neta says sorryPolitical dishum-dishum is the norm. And when gloves are off, Congressmen are known to cross the line of control. No remorse, no regrets. But there is this Congressman who not only realised he was being ungentleman like but also apologised for it. And the ones who made him look inward were his children. Five days after he made a scathing and specifically gross personal accusation against actor Kangana Ranaut, Congress spokesperson Brijesh Kalappa withdrew his statement. My father asked me last night what I had tweeted about Kangana Ranaut that was so controversial. My children were around, so I said that I would respond later. It then struck me that if I cant explain to my children what my political stand was, Id clearly not done the right thing. Its been five days since my tweet on her. Some newspapers reported that I had deleted it instantly. I had not. I just did it. My profound apologies to her. I truly appreciate her as an actor and was angry that she had unjustifiably called our regime Italian (sic), he tweeted on Sunday morning."

For Ranjaha Singhal, it just meant planning a menu for her restaurants On The Go and Thats Y Food, where runners, walkers, swimmers, gymmers could have a meal AND keep a close watch on the calories they consumed. It is a big problem for me if I have to eat out, says Ranjana. I am always counting calories and the result is a bland, boring meal. Or, I may order a cup of coffee thinking it is only one cup, but there are three spoons of sugar in it! How nice it would be if I could have a ready reckoner about the calorie intake. Since more people are becoming mindful about what they eat, yet want to continue eating out, we are giving you that option, she says.My friend chooses Much Room for Mushroom. It has two pieces of garlic bread, three pieces of spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms, Penne Pasta in white sauce and a chocolate ice cream. I prefer to go desi so I choose Ginger Winger, which has all my usual favourites from On The Go. I am served Paneer Adraki, Dal Makhni, onion raita, a roasted papad and a tandoori rot prettily arranged on a plate. My dessert, chocolate ice cream will be served later, I am told. I could have also chosen Paneer Push ups (For the non vegetarians there is a Chicken Chin Ups!) that has paneer tikka biriyani, a green salad, roasted papad, raita and a flourless cake with a drink of a lemonade. Some of the menus serve a small portion of Caramel Custard as dessert and a drink.There is enough and more choice for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian (there are 20 planned menus to choose from) in both Indian and Continental cuisines. There is an interesting twist! While my total calorie intake with the Ginger Winger menu is 1076 calories and costs me 550, I can exercise my right to be more mindful and remove the ice cream from my meal. In which case my calorie intake will reduce to 920 calories, AND I get 50 knocked off from my bill.Info you can use From May 10, The Calorie Counter Menus will be offered at On The Go in Race Course and Thats Y Food in RS Puram for both lunch and dinner. If you are counting calories, ask to see the special menus.For details call On The Go (0422-4520116) or ThatsY Food (0422- 4365118)Can I refuse the rotis as I am off carbs, I ask, and Ranjana says I can but, while my calories consumed will be reduced, my bill will remain the same. We have to stick to the de-cal option. If everyone wants to change everything around, there will be confusion and my kitchen will not be able to handle it, she explains. She points out that, in most of these menus, the drink and the dessert constitute the decal option.For a strict dieter there is A Run in the Garden meal that includes a vegetable clear soup of only19 calories, a salad of 76 calories, two pieces of garlic bread (140 calories) and finally a portion of caramel custard (156 calories). The total count is only 391 calories and the price 415. Decal the dessert, and the count drops to a slender 235 calories and the bill is just 365!Ranjana has consulted a team of menu specialists in Kolkata, she says,who came up with the menus after four months of hard work. The menu is easy to read and understand and the calories of each dish is given next to it, says Ranjana. She also points out that there is no nutritional information given in this menu and that the calorie table has been taken from the Internet. Each meal is sufficient for an individual and the dessert portions are smaller than the usual servings. The limited portions have been measured and weighed.The menus are available at both her restaurants for lunch and dinner. However, she assures, The regular menu will also be on offer."

Michel, 58, complained to the special CBI court that he was being given only boiled vegetables and has lost 16 kilograms since December 4 when he was extradited to India from Dubai. Western food may be directed, Michels lawyer, Aljo K Joseph, told the court. Joseph insisted it was indeed possible when judge Arvind Kumar responded that he will see if it was so. They [Tihar jail authorities] have bread, cheese, and onion, said Joseph. Michel told the court that the jail doctor directed the prison authorities to offer him food other than dal, roti, and chawal more than once.The court sought a response from the jail authorities and the doctor in response to Michels complaints and requests. It listed the matter for hearing again on Friday. Michel also complained he shared his prison with the murder accused, who smokes cannabis.

This year, SodaBottleOpenerWala in Jubilee Hills not only has a platter of six varieties of Haleem, but also has dishes like Chicken Shish Taouk which is eaten at this time of the year in the Middle-East.As you dig into the Haleem platter, you will be amazed by the creaminess of the Persian Haleem which is served with a generous helping of cream. But as Chef Aneesh revealed later, the secret behind the smooth texture of the Persian dish is not the cream, but chickpeas! The Persian Haleem is subtly spiced with cloves, nutmeg and lemon powder made from dried lemons, added the chef. With great difficulty, you shift your focus to the other variants in the platter.The chicken Haleem and special chicken Haleem are the same, but the latter is garnished with succulent pieces of Talawa Gosht and cashew nuts. The Haleem is meatier than the Persian one and scores higher on spice level. There is a vegetarian Haleem too which is the Persian dish Haleem Bademjan, sans the beef. It is made from brinjals and whey sauce and tastes a bit like our own Baigan Ka Bharta. The mutton variants (normal and special) were aromatic and totally free of bones. The pudina sprigs and the birista took the taste quotient of the dishes several notches higher.The Chicken Shish Taouk was the first dish from Middle-Eastern fare to make an appearance on the table. Its a Lebanese chicken dish cooked on skewers with pickled chillies and spices. The chicken pieces, served with a garlic dip and naan, were very flavourful and slightly tangy due to the pickled chillies. There was a Mezze platter for vegetarians which included bell pepper Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Falafel, olives, Tzatziki and Pita bread.Rice lovers need not despair as there is an Irani Raan Pulao, made of spiced lamb leg and flavourful rice. However, the best of the lot was the lamb Arayes, which is pita bread stuffed with spiced minced lamb, onions and peppers. Its a lot like a kulcha, but softer, lighter and better. The stuffed bread, served with pickled vegetables and garlic dip, is a filling meal in itself.The desserts - Umm Ali and Kanafeh - deserve a special mention. With every stroke of the spoon, the puff pastry in Umm Ali broke away and got dipped in the warm, dry fruit-flavoured milk, hitting all the right notes. The Kanafeh was good too, though the cheese was a tad too sour for my taste. The Ramzan special menu will be there till June 5. Prices range between Rs 175 to Rs 395"

Prices of onions and potatoes remain the same. In fact, due to increase in the availability of onions and yam (chenaikizhangu), they are being sold at very low prices. Yam from Andhra Pradesh sells at 15 a kilo and that from Tamil Nadu at 10-12 a kilo."
2019-05-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/first-challenge-for-next-govt-food-inflation-set-to-return-5724369/,First challenge for next govt: Food inflation set to return,"THE BJP-LED NDA governments tenure has been marked by benign food prices. Consumer food inflation has ruled below general retail inflation for 31 months running, from September 2016 to March 2019, while averaging a mere 1.3 per cent year-on-year during this period, as against 3.6 per cent for the latter.AdvertisingBut food inflation could well be the next governments first challenge, regardless of who heads it. The past couple of months have seen prices of a host of farm commodities surge, mainly on the back of drought in large parts of western and southern India, coupled with an early and harsher-than-usual summer.On Friday, the average traded price of maize at Davangere (Karnataka) was Rs 2,010 per quintal, compared to Rs 1,120 a year ago. Jowar and bajra were, likewise, selling for Rs 2,750 per quintal (Rs 1,600) at Jalgaon (Maharashtra) and Rs 1,900 per quintal (Rs 1,100) at Chomu (Rajasthan), respectively.A lower crop  31.5 million bales in 2018-19, down from 36.5 million bales last year  has led to kapas (raw un-ginned cotton), too, quoting at Rs 5,800 per quintal in Rajkot (Gujarat), from Rs 5,250 at this time last year.AdvertisingExplained Good for farmers, not consumers This election, unlike previous ones, has not been fought on inflation. The central government, if at all, has faced flak not for high, but low prices of farm produce during its term. It makes the return of food inflation  bad for consumers, but good for farmers  that much trickier for the next government to handle.However, it isnt only coarse cereals and fibres.According to Vipul Mittal, head (fruits & vegetables) at the online grocery bigbasket.com, the average cost price of horticultural produce has gone up 13-15 per cent year-on-year since March. Thus, tomato prices at Karnatakas Kolar market are currently averaging Rs 2,000 per quintal, from Rs 580 a year ago, while increasing from Rs 655 to Rs 850 for onion at Lasalgaon (Maharashtra). Even summer season vegetables such as okra, bottle gourd and bitter gourd are wholesaling 36-39 per cent higher than last year; so is radish.The real problems, though, are in milk. Most cattlefeed ingredients are costing much more now relative to last year. That includes not just maize, but also de-oiled rice bran (up from about Rs 8,950 to Rs 14,350 a tonne), fine rice polish (Rs 16,750 to Rs 20,350), molasses (Rs 3,950 to Rs 7,200) and guar churi/meal (Rs 20,200 to Rs 23,650).Cottonseed oilcake prices have also risen from Rs 19,000-22,000 to Rs 27,500 per tonne since November-January.Its only a matter of time before all this cost push translates into higher milk prices for consumers, says R S Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation. The cooperative, better known by its Amul brand, had registered a jump in average milk procurement from 176.5 lakh litres per day (LLPD) in 2016-17 to 204.3 LLPD in 2017-18 and 223 LLPD in 2018-19.In this financial year, procurement has so far been 3 per cent lower year-on-year, despite our members union hiking prices from Rs 570-580 per kg of fat in December-January to Rs 630-650 now. Even in North India, procurement prices of buffalo milk with 6.5 per cent fat has soared from Rs 32-33 to Rs 40 per litre in this period, says Sodhi.While drought-induced fodder and feed shortages are a major cause of cost push and drop in milk procurement, R G Chandramogan, managing director, Hatsun Agro Product Ltd, Indias largest private sector dairy, also attributes it to sustained low prices over the last four years or more. Not getting good prices for milk has shaken the confidence of farmers. They have been underfeeding their animals or reducing herd sizes, which is bound to affect supply at some point, he says.Dairies were forced to slash procurement prices, especially after exports of skimmed milk powder (SMP) from the country collapsed from 129,868 tonnes in 2013-14 to 34,490 tonnes in 2014-15 and 11,476 tonnes in 2017-18. In 2018-19, they recovered slightly to around 45,000 tonnes. The resultant depletion of stocks has, in turn, helped prop up domestic SMP rates from Rs 135-140 per kg to Rs 210 levels in the last six months.Another commodity that has witnessed improved price sentiment, of late, is sugar. The key driver has been drought in Maharashtra. The state is expected to record 40 per cent lower cane area for the 2019-20 crushing season from October, with farmers  particularly in the Marathwada region and surrounding areas of Solapur, Ahmednagar and Nashik  reducing or not taking up plantings of the pre-seasonal (September-October) and suru (December-January) crops.My mill in Osmanabad had roughly 15,000 hectares of cane area last season. For the next season, this may not touch 1,000 hectares. Even the standing crop is being diverted by farmers for fodder, claims B B Thombre, chairman, Latur-based Natural Sugar and Allied Industries. He predicts that only 6-7 out of Marathwadas 47 sugar mills will have enough cane to operate in the coming season.For now, the main ray of hope is the southwest monsoon. The Met Department has forecast aggregate rainfall during June-September to be 96 per cent of its long period average, making it a near normal season. But Chandramogan feels that even if the monsoon turns out good and prices are finally looking up, farmers will not be able to step up production overnight, as agriculture isnt like switching on or turning off lights.Mittal sees the current uptick in food prices as a healthy and necessary correction. It may look inflationary, but the fact is that before March-April, the year-on-year cost increases in fruits and vegetables was in the low single digits or even negative. Farmers, then, couldnt recover their cultivation costs, which is not sustainable, he says.AdvertisingWhen the NDA government took over in May 2014, annual consumer food inflation was in near double-digits. By end-2016, that was brought down to low single digits by end-2016. Given the associated farm stress caused, it is unlikely that if food inflation returns, the next government  even if headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi  would be inclined to adopt an overly hawkish approach."

No empirical data was collected on the quantity and quality of ingredients used or amount consumed and amount wasted by children to certify food supplied by APF as nutritionally adequate, says the letter signed by 10 organisations and 94 individuals.Instead, the signatories say, the entire report had been prepared on the basis of a menu submitted by the Foundation.We urge you to withdraw the report immediately pending a systematic field evaluation of the food being supplied by APF, adds the letter.The NIN was asked to look into four major issues  nutritional compliance, food safety measures, taste, and diversity of meals. Earlier, the Karnataka State Food Commission (KSFC), following visits to schools, noted that the food provided by APF was bland and monotonous, as a result of which children were consuming less than the prescribed quantity of meals, defeating the purpose of the mid-day meal scheme.The letter also highlights how another institute that was asked to look into the matter, Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), sought four to six months to be able to comment on the issue.Activists say that following the KSFCs findings, a specific menu was prescribed for contractors, but APF had violated these norms. They also say that APFs refusal to provide onion and garlic on religious grounds is a violation of the law.In its report on February 14, 2019, the NIN had submitted that the nutritive value of APFs meals certainly meet and often exceed the prescribed energy and protein requirements and cited convincing personal accounts by scientists who visited APFs kitchens as proof of high safety standards. It concluded that the mid-day meals served by APF complied with nutrition norms laid down by the government."

Initially, police managed the camps from Odisha Police Welfare funds, but as the initiative received tremendous response from the people in the cyclone affected areas, they urged SRC for providing financial assistance.If situation demands, the camps will continue to provide food to the needy people beyond seven days, DGP Dr RP Sharma told TNIE.Karuna camps are mostly opened at the police stations in the affected areas of the district.Dr Sharma said the entire procedure to manage the camps has been streamlined. While cops in Puri are performing their regular duties, personnel from Reserve Police Line have been deployed for smooth functioning of the camps, he added.On coming to know about the initiative in Puri, SPs of other districts have started sending potatoes and onions for preparing food in Karuna camps.Cuttack Rural police on Sunday sent relief materials like rice, dal, chuda, biscuits, mineral water, vegetables and other items to various Karuna camps in Puri district. The relief materials included 20 quintal vegetables, 15 quintal rice and three quintal chuda.The camps are functioning at Brahmagiri, Satyabadi and Pipili.

Over the next 10 minutes a huge crowd makes a beeline for the tiffin room, waiting for the doors to open.Landmark sweets Chandrahaara: Want to know how the famous MTR sweet Chandrahaara got its name? As a tribute to 1948's Kannada blockbuster Chandrahara, the Maiya family created this sweet, a blend of flour, sugar and thickened milk, spiced with ghee and cloves.Spoilt for choice: Ghee Masala dose with Aalu Palya; Rice Idli with chutney and Rava Idli with Aalu Saagu; Kharabaath; Bisibelebath; Chandrahaara; Mysore pak, Dumroot halwa, Payasa; badami haalu; grape juice.Survival challenge: During the Emergency when the restaurant had closed down, MTR created instant food mixes and had their workers busy. The timing was perfect as ready-to-eat sector, with sambar, rasam, and chutney powders, instant idli, dosa, and other mixes took off.In the limelight: Amongst the thousands of bureaucrats, businessmen, politicians, actors and directors Raj Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Rajkumar, politicians Farooq and Sheikh Abdullah, industrialist Narayana Murthy and his wife, writer Sudha Murthy, poet DV Gundappa, and painter MF Hussain have enjoyed MTR food.For a group of villagers from Tumkur, 40 kilometres away, it is a day to relax after their vegetables have been dropped off at the nearby City Market much before dawn. It has been three years now since I visited MTR , and we cant wait to enjoy a hot MTR Rava Idli with alugadde (potato), and pack some for home too, says an excited Siddappa, a tomato grower from Gowripura. At 6.20 am, vendors selling jasmine and golden champak gather outside the restaurant. People buy flowers only after they are done with breakfast and coffee, they say.From 3 am onwards, the kitchen at MTR bustles with a dozen people. They are getting the mornings dishes ready. Idli and dosa batter is prepared a day before to ferment it. Vegetables are cut in the morning and noon, milk is boiled three times a day, only the vada batter is prepared fresh as that way the crispies emerge golden brown from the oil, says Hemamalini Maiya, daughter of Harishchandra Maiya, who took over from his uncle, Yagnarayana, who was one of the founders of MTR in 1924.Proficient cooks and brothers, Parameshwara Maiya with Ganappayya and Yagnanarayana had left Kota, a hamlet near Udupi to reach Bengaluru where one of their employers had encouraged Parameshwara to start a small hotel in 1924 to serve coffee and idli. That was the beginning of Brahmin Coffee Club. Later Yagnanarayana thought the word club sounded elitist, so changed the name to Mavalli Tiffin Room, named after the locality where it is situated.MTR has a couple of head cooks with nearly two dozen assistants, and a dozen more helpers. Each one has a specific role with their tasks cut out. It is like an assembly line, says Hemamalini, walking through an aisle where almonds are being crushed in a mixer for badam milk; coconut, chilli and coriander are in the blender for the famous MTR chutney, potatoes are being boiled in their skin for the saagu for poori and masala for dosa, fruits are being cut for fruit salad, and grapes are boiled and filtered for juice.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARThe din of plates and spoons are heard even as a mound of diced onions keeps growing. It may seem robotic, but this routine has been followed for decades, says Hemamalini, one of the siblings who with Vikram and Arvind took over the mantle of running this popular place after the death of Harishchandra Maiya in 1999.MTR thrives on loyal customers who have been dining here for generations. The weekends overflow with people. It is humbling to see serpentine queues with poets, actors and businessmen, she says. There are nearly 2,500 walk-ins each day during the weekends, apart from around 1,500 others who drop by just for coffee. Public holidays and Sundays see MTR serving nearly 1,000 masala dosas, 800 plates of rava idli, 800 plates of poori, with about 300 litres of milk used. Nearly 200 litres of onion sambar, and vegetable sambar are prepared each weekend.We get nearly 400 kilograms of vegetables and fruits. Provisions are sourced from long-established vendors who have been supplying us since our grandfathers time, says Hemamalini adding, Nothing much has changed.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARIn 1997, Harishchandra Maiya introduced thali meals as he felt, Dishes savoured at special party hall lunches at MTR should reach every customer. He introduced a huge platter with nearly 30 items for  50 and saw nearly 1,000 thalis sell out between 12.30 pm and 5 pm! We have now brought it down to two dozen items as we notice that people dont prefer some of the sweets and side dishes. After 22 years it now costs 270, says Hemamalini.So, what is their secret? It lies in the preparation that results in dosas that are soft and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside, says Hemamalini, adding that red rice and dollops of ghee lends to their signature taste. Rava idli, she says, is yet another signature dish from MTR. In South Canara, where the family hails from, there was a similar variant generations ago. During World War II, when rice was in short supply, my grandfather, Yagnanarayana , introduced rava idli mixed with curd and a seasoning of dal, cashew and curry leaves. This was paired with alugadde saagu and coriander chutney. The speciality is the rava is sauted to perfection. We train our cooks from scratch, none of them are well known before they join us, she says.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARDespite the no-frills dcor or conspicuously missing menu card, MTR retains its cultural stature, and is under the heritage list of INTACH. The food is wholesome with an abundance of ghee. Perhaps Keto dieters will subscribe to it! adds Hemamalini, and this is what her father wanted to maintain, and not bother with expansion plans. He always wanted peoples choice to decide the course of MTR! she says as we check out the 6,000 square feet of space with 14 rooms. We have basic tables and plastic chairs, and we still have the silver tumblers my grandfather introduced 75 years ago. He was captivated by them during his trip to England. Right now we have only about 100 sets left that we serve only during special meals!Apart from Lalbagh Road, MTR has branches at Indiranagar, Malleswaram, Gandhinagar, Whitefield, St. Marks Road, JP Nagar, Kammanahalli and Kanakapura Main Road; and in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai.A column where we experience the lives of people and places in the city"

It also violates the Union Human Resources Development Ministrys guidelines which prohibits the propagation of private beliefs through mid-day meal scheme, they added.NIN... to our utter shock and dismay, has made sweeping statements praising APF, without carrying out any systematic scientific study. No empirical data was collected on the quantity and quality of ingredients used or amount consumed and amount wasted by children to certify food supplied by APF as nutritionally adequate, the letter said.Instead, a paper menu submitted by APF, was considered evidence enough. The eagerness exhibited by NIN to offer opinions in this case, in absence of any scientific field evaluation, raises serious questions regarding NINs credibility and independence, the activists added."

I grew inquisitive and decided to have an early dinner. The menu is not very elaborate, but quite varied and focusses equally on regional Indian and global delicacies. We began with the Pumpkin and Coconut Puree soup along with the Karela salad. The soup, with its very delicate flavour profile, was soul food and prepped us for the meal ahead. On the other hand, I was moved by the sheer ingenuity in preparation of the Karela salad  crispy rings of bitter gourd tossed in a tangy raw mango relish with few tomatoes and shallots. Simple yet brilliant!For appetisers, I tried the Dhakai Chaat, Spinach and Rosemary Brioche, Dimsum Basket of Edamame & Truffle in Cream Cheese, and a portion of Siya Mirch Tikka. Prepared by Chef Richa Johri, she ensures that all the dishes flirt with your taste buds without leaving you overwhelmed with the uni-dimensional flavours. For example, the Dhakai Chaat, a crunchy paapdi with softer fried arbi, was balanced by yoghurt, date and jaggery chutney. On the contrary, the spinach dish felt wholesome with garlic cream cheese and onion marmalade, and a shot of mushroom tea. Mirch Tikka was a unique take on Chicken Tikka. After marinating with pipli (long peppers), morsels of well-cooked chicken are rolled in crushed papads and served. Personally, Id want the marination to have amalgamated better with the meat, and the outer coating of papads to be more crunchy and spicy.For the mains, we requested for Hyderabadi Khatti Dal, Achaari Kathal Tikka Masala, Kaju Sukkhe with a portion of Chicken Elettaria. The dal stole the show. Tempered with tamarind and curry leaves, it felt homely, and it is one preparation that will make me visit The Finch over and over again. The Elettarias thick and sumptuous curry with strong green cardamom flavour and aroma, was another winner. Served with crisp garlic naan, it can satiate strong carb and curry cravings. The Achaari Kathal and the Mangalorean preparation of Kaju Sukkhe with neer dosa hit the spot. We wrapped up meal with some Kheer Gil-e-Firdaus and a portion of tender coconut and lychee cream with crumbles. Between the two, my vote would go to the kheer made from bottle gourd and rice, laced with saffron.A knowledgeable staff and efficient service are other high points. Spread over three floors, the restaurant has live music on the topmost floor on select days. The fully stocked bar makes it a good spot for an after-work drink and a quick snack. I am yet to try the Rendang curry, mutton pepper fry and Tabak Maas, and hope to do so on my next visit!In a nutshellThe menu is not very elaborate, but quite varied and focusses equally on regional Indian and global delicacies.

The demand for vegetables has therefore gone down and customers have not been enthusiastic about their purchase, one vendor Salman Kudus said.Our sales have definitely decreased as a result and we do not see as many customers as we earlier did, another vendor K F Naik said.They said that the dayto-day supply of vegetables from neighbouring states has not drastically altered, but the demand certainly has, which means the perishable items remain on their shelves.Despite their desire to make a bountiful purchase, the fluctuating prices have taken a toll on the pockets of consumers, with the lower and middle-class consumers being the most affected.Even though the increasing prices do not affect our ability to buy the vegetables, but our monthly expenditure does increase, and we end up buying smaller quantities of vegetables, consumer Sarla Katariya said.Basic kitchen ingredients like chillies are being sold at Rs 60 per kg against Rs 40 a few weeks ago, while onions are being sold at Rs 20 per kg as opposed to Rs 16 earlier.There is nothing we can do besides cutting out on the costlier vegetables. The government should do something to standardise rates so that people can afford nutritious vegetables, another consumer said."

There is no religion or community barrier for those who consume haleem. The dish that was introduced in the Mughal period by foreign migrants has been one of the most sought after dishes in Vizag.Tedious taskThe preparation of haleem is a rather tedious task. Wheat, lentils and meat are soaked overnight until they get tender and 14 different kinds of spices are added. Chunks of meat are made to boil over a simmering flame for about 14-16 hours if its mutton, and 8-9 hours if its chicken. It is topped with mint leaves, onions, various spices and coriander. Haleem is a high calorie dish and also provides carbohydrates and proteins from the variety of ingredients used in the course of preparation.Mr. Sheikh Zubair, who owns Dil se- Hyderabadi Haleem, serves one of the finest haleems in the city. Mr. Zuber has been running this Haleem centre for the past 10 years only during the period of Ramzan. This year the centre is set to function till June 8 from 4 p.m. to 10p.m.Over the period of time, I have seen people go shaukeen for haleem in their first bite says Mr. Zubair.He is one of the first people in Vizag to begin the live haleem process, portraying the method of preparation to the public.Dil Se has chefs from Hyderabad for cooking haleem.Mr. Zubair also strongly believes that one has to take the long road in order to attain the original taste of haleem.At Dil Se, Haleem is served with paya, roti and sherwa. A kaddu kheer is also available that is specially made from bottlegourd.I eagerly wait for the Ramzan season solely to eat haleem. I can never get enough of it. Its a dish right from the heaven! Nothing is more perfect says Renuka, a resident of Vizag.Haleem is the essence of Ramzan in my point of view. The fact that it has travelled all the way from the Arab countries to here , and yet retains its taste, authenticity and the vibe of the festival makes it one of my favourite dishes. says Chandini, a college student. And so haleem is officially back in the city! There are several places in the city to grab the mouth-watering Haleem. Make this best of this summer by tasting the Dish of God as some people call it."

It also violates the Union Human Resources Development Ministrys guidelines which prohibits the propagation of private beliefs through mid-day meal scheme, they added.NIN... to our utter shock and dismay, has made sweeping statements praising APF, without carrying out any systematic scientific study. No empirical data was collected on the quantity and quality of ingredients used or amount consumed and amount wasted by children to certify food supplied by APF as nutritionally adequate, the letter said.Instead, a paper menu submitted by APF, was considered evidence enough. The eagerness exhibited by NIN to offer opinions in this case, in absence of any scientific field evaluation, raises serious questions regarding NINs credibility and independence, the activists added."

No empirical data was collected on the quantity and quality of ingredients used or amount consumed and amount wasted by children to certify food supplied by APF as nutritionally adequate, says the letter signed by ten organisations and 94 individuals.Instead, the signatories say, the entire report had been prepared on the basis of a menu submitted by the Foundation. We urge you to withdraw the report immediately pending a systematic field evaluation of the food being supplied by APF, adds the letter.The NIN was asked to look into four major issues  nutritional compliance, food safety measures, taste, and diversity of meals. Earlier, the Karnataka State Food Commission (KSFC), following visits to schools, noted that the food provided by APF was bland and monotonous, as a result of which children were consuming less than the prescribed quantity of meals, defeating the purpose of the mid-day meal scheme.The letter also highlights how another institute that was asked to look into the matter, Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), sought four to six months to be able to comment on the issue.Activists say that following the KSFCs findings, a specific menu was prescribed for contractors, but APF had violated these norms. They also say that APFs refusal to provide onion and garlic on religious grounds is a violation of the law."

How could NIN prepare a report without a field-level assessment of the ingredients used in preparation of food to ensure nutritional requirements were being met and not verify claims being made on a paper menu by APF. The issue is not just about absorption of nutrients, but is also about the food not being as per local tastes. The most important question that authorities are glossing over is why not provide onion and garlic, which are available all round the year and are cheaper than other ingredients."

With locally produced vegetables being diverted to the affected coastal districts , people here are facing a shortage situation and consequent price hike.Local demands are met by the output from Borrigumma, Pottangi and Semiliguda farmlands. Besides, more than 5,000 farmers of Lendri-Maliguda, Paliba, Suku, Chandal-Mundar, Mali-Dussra, Parja-Mundar, Banmalipur, Champaguda, Dumriguda and Kadamguda, all located within 15 to 20 km from Koraput town, are into vegetable farming.Locals consume about 60 per cent of the vegetables produced in the district and the rest are sent to markets in Chhattisgarh and neighbouring districts.However, after Fani hit the State, locally grown vegetables are diverted to markets in Cuttack, Puri, Khurda leading to scarcity in Koraput, Semiliguda, Kunduli, Nandapur, Lamtaput and Borrigumma vegetable markets. Middlemen who have been camping in these markets, procure large stock of vegetables daily and send them to Fani-affected areas. As many as 20 truck loads of vegetables are sent to the coastal districts every day.Price of almost all the vegetables have doubled since May 5. Potatoes and onions which were earlier sold at Rs 14 per kg are now selling at Rs 20. Brinjals were being sold at Rs 20 a kg but have now become costlier at Rs 40 per kg.

He now brings water by tankers from Bhadra canal, located 17 km from his village, to save the palms.He pays 2,000 for tankers of 24,000-litre capacity for each trip. The sub-adult and adult areca palms on one hectare land need at least one lakh litres of water per week for survival. From January third week, he has spent 5.5 lakh on hiring tankers.Tankers galoreWith many farmers resorting to this method to water their plantations  even though not authorised  one can see 40 to 50 trucks and tractors mounted with tankers drawing water from Bhadra canal near Hanchina Siddapura, Nallur and Santhebennur villages in Channagiri. This often leads to traffic snarls all around. In some cases water is transported to distances of 40 to 50 km.The returns from selling arecanut next year will be lower than what I have spent for bringing the water by tankers. But my focus right now is saving the crop and hoping for good rain in coming days, he said. Arecanut cultivation that was once considered as profitable venture in Davangere district is now burning holes in the pockets of farmers, owing to successive droughts and failure of pre-monsoon rain.Deficient rainFrom January 1 to May 15, Davangere district received 24 mm rain as against the normal of 70 mm during this period. The deficiency of pre-monsoon rain in the district this time is around 66%. Since January 2019, arecanut crop cultivated on 7,000 acres has completely dried up in the district. As the release of water from Bhadra reservoir along the canals for summer crop is likely to be stopped from May 23, the water crises will aggravate further in the coming days.Farmers in Davangere district have taken to rapid expansion of areca cultivation in recent times, abandoning traditional crops such as ragi, sunflower, and onion. This was following a boom in areca prices. Lakshmikanth Bommanavar, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu that the area under areca cultivation that was at 24,000 hectares in 2000-01 had gone up to 46,000 hectares now. Of these only around 15,000 hectares was in the command area of the Bhadra reservoir. The remaining 31,000-hectare plantation that was dependent on borewells was vulnerable to drought and loss of yield owing to moisture stress caused by shortage of water, he said.When the price of arecanut escalated in 2004-05 and when it was fetching more than 1 lakh per quintal in August, 2014, many farmers in arid regions of the district shifted to areca. Borewells were sunk to water the areca palms. Indiscriminate drawing of ground water and successive droughts have left the borewells dry, he said.Cultivation of arecanut, a water-intensive crop, in an arid region such as Davangere is not advisable. The Department of Horticulture is promoting the cultivation of less water-intensive crops like mango and cashew here but there are few takers for them, he said.Bhaanappa from Madalu village in Channagiri taluk spent 4 lakh in 2019 to bring water for his two-hectare arecanut plantation from Bhadra canal, near Nallur. Running out of resources, he has not stopped fetching water. I have already borrowed 3.5 lakh to save the crop. I cannot afford to purchase more water. If the plantation dries up, I will go back to ragi cultivation, he told this correspondent.Tanker businessThe increasing demand for fetching water from the canal has resulted in the tanker business becoming a profitable one.Narayanaswamy, who once transported milk in his tanker in Ramanagaram and now ferries water in Davangere, says milk yield is lower in summer and he does not get sufficient business in his native district. He says that more than 600 tankers are operating in Channagiri taluk alone.The Bhadra Command Area Development Authority(CADA) though periodically issues warning against drawing of the water from the canal for commercial crops in non-command areas, desperate arecanut growers are not any paying heed."

Delicious smoky aromas waft through the air drawing food lovers, across communities, to indulge their taste buds with the months specials and some year round favourites. We are spoilt for choice between the crisp and flaky mince meat samosas, fiery seekh rolls, nutritious haleem, simmering tawa ghosht, lip-smacking baida roti, refreshing falooda, matka firni and lots more.Among the many streets in the city, Mosque Road is one of our all-time favourite foodie destination to enjoy the best of this month-long food mela. We start our journey at the legendary Albert Bakery where we brave the crowd to get our share of the mildly spiced kheema samosas, savoury brain puffs and a sweet khova naan. We can tell you for a fact that all the jostling in the crowds at the bakery is well worth the effort once you come out victorious with your share of the food booty.Next, we hop across the road to reach Hyderabads famous Pista House who set up shop only this month to sell their legendary haleem and qubbani ka meetha. Haleem is a comforting nutritious meal which comprises meat, pounded wheat, lentils, pure ghee, spices and dry fruits - continuously stirred in large cauldrons over wood fire from early morning until afternoon. It is best savoured with a garnish of coriander, crisp fried onion slivers and a dash of lemon juice. Baida roti, a tava fried roomali roti stuffed with a mixture of beaten egg, kheema, chopped onions andgreen chillies, is another popular savoury dish flying off the shelf in Mosque Road. You can get this roti at several outlets, however, our favourite is at Chichabas Taj and Charminar Kabab Paradise, next to the mosque. Other exotic offerings include patthar ghosht (meat slow-cooked on a stone slab over charcoal), barbecued phal meat slivers, seekh rolls, chicken lollipop, kutt, quail, falooda, double ka meetha and matka firni.In addition to the makeshift food booths, the local restaurants in the area are also offering iftar goodies along with their year-round menu. There is Alibaba Caf, Rahhams, Empire and Savoury, but our vote goes to Karama for their rich nihari ghosht, Afghani dajaj (chicken), laham meshwi (mutton), mandi rice and Karachi naan and Chichabas Taj on MM Road where you can get hot paya ka salan and a rich gurda-kaleji dish apart from a range of savouries and sweets.Since all this food can get tad heavy, we recommend you finish your meal with a sulaimani chai to settle down the meats and greasy savouries. Also, try hareera, a healthy hot drink made with milk, almonds, chironji, cardamom, saffron and sugar, all boiled over several hours in a huge utensil.The good thing about this mouth-watering street food fiesta is the price. If you shop right and share the food with family and friends, it would add up to around `200-250 per head for a satisfying meal here. Samosas are `10-12 each, bheja puffs`35, baida roti `80, haleem `150-190, patthar ghosht `80, seekh rolls `80-100, phirni `50, hareera `20 and sulaimani chai `10.Some tips: Shops open around 4pm, so get here early to avoid large crowds. Finally, we suggest you take a walk down the streets, which will allow you the time to soak in the sights, sounds and aromas of this foodie haven while intermittently stopping to savour delicious iftar treats.Aslam Gafoor is a Bengaluru-based hospitality professional, food lover and travel enthusiast"

Muslims around the world have begun their fasting for 30 days, in remembrance of the Quran being revealed to Prophet Mohammed the first time. The dawn-to-dusk fasting begins after the 'suhoor' (pre-dawn meal) and is broken with 'Ifthar' in the evening. Haleem, which is known as the 'complete meal', plays an important role in Ifthar.Prepared with mutton, varieties of dal and spices, haleem is a stew-like meal rich with proteins and carbohydrates. ""Because of the day-long fasting, the dish helps boost the energy of the faithful. Also, the lentils in the dish replenish one's protein levels,"" says Ravinder Singh Panwar, executive chef, Kochi Marriott Hotel.The dish, which has the semblance of oatmeal, takes long hours and is traditionally prepared in mud containers under firewood. ""It usually takes seven to eight hours to prepare. As haleem needs to achieve a batter-like consistency, the entire chunk of meat and lentils have to be broken down. Because of the presence of the dal and broken wheat which has a lesser cooking time, the dish cannot be prepared on a high flame,"" says the chef. Furthermore, the quantity of the dish plays a deciding factor in the cooking time.While many choose to have haleem as it is, some choose to savour it with accompaniments such as dates and salad.RECIPELamb HaleemThe complete mealIngredientsLamb boneless: 500 gMoong dal: 50 gMasoor dal: 50 gChanna dal: 50 gUrad dal: 50 gTuvar dal: 50 gBroken wheat: 200 gOnion: 50 gBay leaf: 1 gCinnamon: 2 gGreen cardamom: 2 gAllspice: 5 gGinger: 5 gGinger garlic paste: 50 gGhee: 300 gLemon: 2 nosGreen chilly: 2 nosSalt: 10 gMilk: 1 litreMint: 10 gPreparationHeat ghee.

In addition, direct income support to farmers should be increased from current Rs 6,000 per year to at least Rs 18,000 per month in order to bring them out of the vicious cycle of indebtedness,"" he said.Sharma also said the government should allow public investment in the farm sector and come up with 'ease of doing farming' on lines of ease of doing business.""Over 50 per cent of the population in the county is dependent on agriculture while what we spent on it is just 2-3 per cent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Setting up the ease of doing farming would help clear bottlenecks and hurdles in the sector, thus addressing about 80 per cent of the farm distress,"" he said.Experts and analysts had last year said that the BJP, which came to power at Centre in 2014 mainly on the poll plank of doubling farm income, would see farm distress haunting them in the 2019 elections.However, the Balakot airstrike changed the narrative.""There were two major issues-- unemployment and farm distress. However, they were successfully ambushed after the Balakot episode,"" said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who is credited for bringing over 200 farm outfits under one banner-- All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).""These issues were definitely sidelined and did not become as important as people thought.""One-third of the country witnessed drought-like situation last year and not-so-good prediction of monsoon this year means farm distress could aggravate, Yadav said.""The new government will have to take immediate measures to tackle drought if monsoon turns out to be below average,"" he said.He also sought the new dispensation to refrain from efforts keep crop prices low so as to control food prices in urban areas under control.""Farmers should not be punished for it,"" he said.Economists need to change their outlook as higher production does not mean higher income, Sharma said.""Economists cannot see beyond what is prescribed in the textbook. Punjab has the highest productivity ratio in the world. However, it has become a hotbed of farm suicides,"" he said.He said growth in real farm income from 2011-2016 was below 0.5 per cent and it was at stagnant for the past two years.It also implies the government's ambitious scheme of doubling farmers' income by 2022 cannot be achieved merely through boosting production.Making credit available to farmers besides expanding agriculture market network and building logistics and transport linkages could be some of the short-term and long-term solution to improve the farm sector, the experts said."

As there was scarce rainfall during Kharif, SK Siddarama, a middle-aged farmer in Santhakudulu, who owns those 40 acres of land, left half of it fallow and cultivated cotton in the rest.But, the drought that had gripped the village in Adoni mandal for nearly one decade now, continued to cast its effect and there was not enough rain or water to save the crop. I have invested nearly Rs 1.7 lakh on the crop, expecting Rs 5 to Rs 6 lakh income. But in just a few weeks, the crop withered for want of water and yet again I suffered loss, he told TNIE.Not losing heart and with a hope to recoup his loss, Siddarama sowed bengal gram in Rabi season in 20 acres and the second crop also withered due to lack of sufficient moisture in the soil. His losses have only accumulated further. With interest, my debts have increased to Rs 10 lakh. I dont know how to clear my debts. To cut my losses, I have decided not to raise crop in the ensuing Kharif, he said.Adoni is one of the worst drought affected mandals in Kurnool district. In Kharif 2018, 50 of the total 54 mandals in the district were declared drought-hit. In Rabi, the number of drought affected mandals was 33. The drought had not only hit the agriculture production, but also had a telling effect on the lives of farmers.Boya Badai Ramudu alias LIC (nickname), who owns 10 acres of land in Santhakudulu village had migrated to Bengaluru. He lamented that even though he was the owner of 10 acres of land he was unable to celebrate Seemantham of his only daughter. He said all the family members, including his two sons and their wives migrated to Bengaluru in search of work and there was nobody in the house to take care of the family function. Now, my pregnant daughter has no other option, but to deliver at her in-laws place, he rued.It is not just Siddarama and Ramudu, but most of the farmers in the village are facing a similar situation. Some were forced to sell their livestock to support the families during hard times. The village with 2,000 families, has less than half of them now as most of them migrated to other places like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Guntur in search of livelihood. About 5,000 acres of land around the village, in which different crops used to be cultivated, now looks barren as most of the crops withered in both Kharif and Rabi.The same situation prevails in most of the drought-affected mandals in the district. Due to continuous dry spell for the past 10 years, in most of the villages, groundwater table got depleted and borewells stopped yielding water.Village and mandal level teams formed for enumeration of loss due to drought had recorded more than 60 per cent crop loss in 6.53 lakh hectares in 50 of the total 54 mandals in Kharif.P Dastagiri of Bapanadoddi village in Krishnagiri Mandal said that he raised cotton, groundnut, red gram, onion and tomato crops in an extent of 15 acres, 10 acres his own and the other 5 acres taken on lease for `10,000 per acre. Cotton was raised in 6 acres, groundnut in 3 acres, tomato and onions in 4 acres and red gram in 2 acres by investing Rs 5 lakh on all the crops.In the initial stage, all the crops were fine, but in course of time, the crops slowly started withering due to water scarcity. Groundnut, cotton, tomato and onion needs a good amount of water at regular intervals, he said.To save his crop, K Ramanjaneyulu of Kothiralla in Pattikonda Mandal borrowed water from a borewell owner with a promise to pay some amount. He wanted water for 4-5 wettings to save his groundnut crop in 5 acres. However, with the depletion of groundwater, the borewell owner expressed his helplessness to supply water and Ramanjaneyulu crop withered.Now, I have a total debt burden of Rs 3 lakh. How am I supposed to clear the debts and how can I support my family, he narrated his helplessness, with tears in his eyes. His sorry tale reflects the plight of most of the farmers in the drought-affected villages of Kurnool.District Collector S Satyanarayana said that they submitted details of drought to the government. The Central team also visited the district to assess the drought. Crops in an extent of 5.17 lakh hectares, including 4,02 lakh hectares in Kharif and 1.15 lakh hectares in Rabi were damaged. The estimated crop loss in both Kharif and Rabi was Rs 649.41 crore, he said and hoped that the government would release financial assistance to the drought affected farmers soon.Bleak scenario54 Total mandals50 Drought hit mandals in Kharif (2018)33 Drought hit mandals in Rabi40.53 lakhTotal population asper 2011 census6 lakh Total farmers4,75,458Drought affected farmers in Kharif1,36,201Drought hit farmersin Rabi6.53 lakh hectares Crop acreage in Kharif3.4 lakh hectares Crop acreage in Rabi4,02,509hectares Crop damage in Kharif1,15,335 hectares Crop damage in Rabi"

The officials seized 4 tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 3.5 crore. The prime accused was exporting red sanders to China, Vietnam and Bangkok. A special team was formed to crack down on the gang and they were tracking their movements for the past two months, the police said.The accused have been identified as Abdul Rashid, Zubire Khan, Saleem Khan, Tahir Khan, M S Basha, Shafi Mohemmed, Munna, Noushad, Siddiq, Ibrahim, Annu, Mubharak and Ali Khan. They are all between 35 to 48 years of age and reside in Bengaluru and Dakshina Kannada.City Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar said the prime accused Rashid, who hails from Puttur, had been smuggling red sanders for several years and the police were on the lookout for him for the past two years. However, he always managed to give the cops the slip and he would tip-off other gang members and buyers using the WeChat app in case of a police raid. He knew the police might trace his call records so he was using this app.Special teams conducted raids on several godowns in Electronic City and Vinayakanagar and seized 4 tonnes of red sanders. The team was keeping a close watch on the movements of the gangs vehicle since they had ceased operating during the Lok Sabha elections as cops would run routine checks on all vehicles. The gang was waiting for an opportune time to export red sanders to Chennai from where it would be smuggled further.Police officials got details that the gang was collecting huge amounts of red sanders and conducted the raid. There are some other gangs who are still actively smuggling red sanders. The police officials said the accused were using private buses to export red sanders to Mumbai and Chennai. The gang used to get red sanders from Andhra Pradesh. They would load it into trucks to store in godowns in Bengaluru. The wood is highly valued in China, which is the biggest importer of legal and illegal red sanders.Each year, an estimated 50,000 kg of red sanders is seized in Karnataka.Officials said the wood is hidden in crates of onions or disguised as ready-made furniture and shipped to Kochi, Mangaluru or Mumbai from southern Andhra Pradesh, from where it goes to China. Furniture made from the wood is considered auspicious while smaller pieces are used in traditional medicine."
2019-05-19,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/rice-on-the-water-anyone/cid/1690773,"Rice On the Water, Anyone?","Today, of course, panta bhaat has made its way to posh restaurant menus, especially during Bengali New Year Source: WikipediaIf you ask people what is the best way to combat the scorching summer  in terms of the food they eat  the answers you get will leave you with almost no surprise.Thats because few are initiated into the simple charms of panta bhaat. But let me rewrite that sentence  few among those reading this would know of panta bhaat, or how it does a cool job of washing away the angst that comes from bearing tonnes of heat and humidity, on your mind as well as your body.Just imagine, yaar Das Auntie gave me some watery rice and alu bhaji to eat, a friend had complained. The anecdote from 20 years ago floats into my platter every time I sit with panta bhaat and begin to enjoy a certain oneness with it. Rana hailed from Uttar Pradesh; he was an urban educated aspiring engineer.Summoned to Bhubaneswar to write an exam, he had to stay the night at a friends place. That friends mother lovingly served him panta  Bhubaneswar was simmering at that time and Rana was like her son, who was working far away from home.One doesnt quite know what transpired at the table that day, but Rana returned to teach us an important lesson in hospitality  to serve watery rice to the uninitiated eater isnt the right thing to do; it is downright insulting.For long years I believed panta was an Odiya thing. Pokhal or pakhala was a staple in many of the Odiya households I was familiar with during my growing-up years. Much later I learnt that Odisha has even set aside a Pokhal Bhaat Day in honour of this fare. Somewhere along the line I came to know that it was a favourite of the Assamese people too. Poita bhaat, they call it. Homecoming for little Pokhi  I saw in an Assamese film by the same name  meant a bowl of cold poita with crispy fried fish caught from the waters of the Brahmaputra.For the Maithils of north Bihar, it comes christened as geel-bhaat. For Tamils, its pazhaya saadham; Telugus call it chaddannam. Theres a saying somewhere in the Northeast that eating panta bhaat gives you the strength of a tiger. Theres one in Bengali that goes  Panta bhaat e noon jote na, begun pora-e ghee. Meaning Cant afford salt for panta, and you want ghee in your roasted brinjal?Truth to tell, panta bhaat is widely known as the poor mans food, an easy morning concoction from the previous nights leftover rice that you fill your stomach with before you head off to the fields or to work in other peoples homes.The fermentation, if you allow it to rest overnight, makes the nutrition quotient swell. Minerals and vitamins of the B group get hugely multiplied. Apparently it also helps keep fat at bay, is good for the bones and so on. Today, of course, panta bhaat has made its way to posh restaurant menus, especially during Bengali New Year. There are also celebrity chefs telling you how to prepare and serve panta bhaat in attractive pans and plates. Fancy food bloggers call it the Buddha Bowl.And why not? Such endeavours are enlightening. I learnt, for example, that panta can be eaten with kasundi, and bits of mango cooked in dal, so on and so forth. But panta is good even sans accompaniment, with just the basic green chilli, raw onion and lemon.A foodie friend tells me about at least 10 ways of preparing it, some of which include mixing it with curd or grated coconut or crushed gondhoraj leaves or pickle. A colleague had once said that as children, they would be given only panta bhaat to eat in times of intolerance, since it was the easiest to digest. There was no escaping it, or its charms, he spoke of it fondly.A few days ago, as I sat down to a dinner of panta with crisp daaler bora and spicy mashed potato, a question was served to me  Do you know theres a song about panta bhaat, asked my worldly-wise kind cook. Of course, I replied, and we regurgitated that Gulzar song from the film, Namkeen, in which Shabana Azmi and Sharmila Tagore sing Panta bhaat e tatka baigun pora... while they go about grinding grain and performing other housework.It was a strangely good film, centred around a family of four women  an ageing mother and her three marriageable daughters  set somewhere in a remote Himachal village. There was much in the 1988 film that lingers, but what comes to mind spontaneously is this quaint song.Ill never know what inspired Gulzar to write those lyrics, but make a guess I can."

I never saw myself doing a remake of any film. Bharat is not a conventional remake because we have completely rewritten it.

I wanted to create a character that was taking care of a family over a span of 70 years and map the parallel journey of a nation during this time... to see how he resonates with the principles this country is built upon and to live his life on these principles because thats the promise he made to his father.Youve always written all your films. Was the process of adapting different, and what did you find the hardest?The hardest was to create a character which would suit Salman Khan and at the same time be very true to the story. Once I understood the essence I wanted to take from Ode to My Father, we went into a complete rewrite. The central character in the original is very different. When you do a film with a superstar like Salman Khan, somewhere or the other you need to keep in mind what his strengths are, and what the audiences expectations of him and his films are. This film has six songs unlike the original.The challenge was to incorporate that Indian style of screenplay into a very simple story, yet to make the protagonist the quintessential hero whos a little larger-than-life but still rooted in reality. The emotional thrust needs to be so strong that when he takes a little larger leap of faith, the audience stands by it because theyre believing in the emotion rather than what hes doing.Like in Tiger Zinda Hai, when he comes off shooting 5,000 bullets, hes doing it to save those 49 nurses and the audience stands by him because that reason is far bigger than the logic of Why isnt he getting shot back?. As long as the reasons for him doing what hes doing are bigger than his on-screen persona, the leap of faith will always work.Salman used to be resistant to films outside of his comfort zone but weve seen that change recently, especially with Sultan. Bharat takes it further  ageing on camera isnt something actors like doing. Was that an easy conversation to have with him?When I took the film to him after rewriting it, he understood why he had to age. The film doesnt work if he isnt 70 years old because thats the journey of the country and him together. His maturity and what he is at the present time is built upon his experiences of six-seven decades. An actor is like a child and the script is their toy. If it fascinates them, they will do any and everything that the script demands.Do you remember Salmans reaction after he first saw himself in full make-up?We did a lot of look tests. I was clear that I wanted to create a very strong old man, someone who believes that age isnt something that kills you, its your mind that does. So, it was about being mentally fit and thats the persona wed bring into the film. The film also goes back and forth and we were very clear that each and every thing he does in life should be a part of that persona. When Salman first saw himself as an old man, he liked the look. He said he thought hed age very gracefully (laughs).Its common knowledge that Priyanka Chopra was originally signed on to play the part thats now been played by Katrina Kaif. How much before the shoot did Priyanka back out?I was in the middle of my first schedule with Disha (Patani). Priyanka was supposed to join us after 20-25 days and we were going back and forth on her dates. When you are making a Salman film, youre looking at either an Id or a Christmas release. Waiting for Priyanka would have have pushed our release back. Luckily at the time she backed out I had enough scenes that I could shoot without her character. Katrina at that time was shooting for Zero and Thugs (of Hindostan) and hadnt signed anything else. Within three hours of getting the script, she called and said she was doing the film.Katrina and you have been friends since your first film Mere Brother Ki Dulhan. Beyond films, what is it that binds the two of you?What binds the two of us, I think, is that we come from a similar background. I come from a middle-class background. And before she became an actress, she was a middle-class girl raised in a family with six sisters and a brother, her mother being the essential driving force keeping that family together. That is very relatable and despite her coming from another culture, when you have conversations, there are similar responsibilities. Shes a very responsible girl, she keeps the whole family together... her sisters, her mother. And whatever space shes made is of her own and her work is only getting better with time.Today, when I see her in Zero or Tiger (Zinda Hai), shes only blooming as an actress. Its a very good sign and as an artiste and a creative person thats what matters the most... that you mature with your work and become more sensible and understand life a little more closely. When you talk to her outside of films, she can really hold a conversation about anything, especially when it comes to relationships and values and the normal things that people talk about  food, fitness, sports... she knows what shes talking about. Thats rare to find... most of the time people only talk about how theyre looking or whats happening in the industry. A friendship, however, has to go much beyond that to sustain for 10-12 years.Youve done multiple films with both Salman and Katrina. When you work with the same set of leads multiple times, is there a sense of fatigue because youre constantly trying to figure how better to show them? Or do you see the comfort being the bigger pay-off?I would say there are good days and bad days. There are certain days when you feel fatigued because you suddenly see exactly the same thing you did in the last film. And then there are days when you thank God theyre there because they understand you. Its like being in a relationship  you stand together when its a bad day and you party when its a good one. But I try to put maximum effort into writing the script. If I can put a new character on paper, automatically itll look new even if its the same set of actors. Then a love scene or drama scene for Bharat thats different from the scenes in Tiger will look even more different because the characters are very different. I reserve my maximum effort for the scriptwriting part, no matter the tiredness, because I feel script is gold. Once youre excited about that, everything else becomes exciting.This is just your fifth film and you are seen as one of the biggest filmmakers in the industry. How has this level of success impacted your life outside of films?Not much has changed. I come from a very middle-class background. My parents stay in Dehradun... they dont ever come to Mumbai because they dont want to. I visit them three-four times a year. When I am in Mumbai, I dont go out too much, I dont have too many filmi friends, there are very few people that I interact with. Most of my life revolves around YRF (Yash Raj Films) because thats where I started my career.You cant get consumed by this world. I cant get taken in by expensive clothes, fancy cars or my bank balance because these are all secondary. Itll all follow if my work is going right. Whats important are my reasons for being here and the stories I want to tell. As long as I dont lose sight of that, I think Im okay.How do you not get swept away by success?Somewhere or the other, it all goes back to where I come from and the anchor I have in my parents. They keep giving me reality checks. When I go back to Dehradun, they send me to go get gas when the cylinder is empty or go find a plumber to get stuff fixed in the bathroom. When you know that onions cost Rs 40 or that atta which used to cost Rs 20 is now Rs 40, you understand the realities of life very quickly.My closest friends are from outside the industry. They are people I have known since I was in school and they are my test audience. I go to Dehradun after finishing my script and in an hour, I narrate it to them. If they say they like it, I make the film. If they say it isnt making any sense, I stop it there and then. I have done this for every film.Theres been talk about a film with Ranveer Singh and also rumours about the next film in the Tiger franchise. What are you thinking about next?I really want to take a break after Bharat. There is definitely an idea that Ive cracked for the next instalment of Tiger. I have shared with Salman, Katrina and (producer) Aditya Chopra and Im very excited about it. There are two other stories that excite me a lot right now. Ranveer (Singh) and Arjun (Kapoor) are close friends who keep pulling my leg. They say now I am treating them like sautelas because I have moved on to Salman Khan! (Laughs) Thats not really true and Ill hopefully work with them very soon. Lets see what happens to Bharat at the box office. If its a big success, I just want to take some time off."

It dealt with garbage: Why do we generate so much waste? It took me three years to understand the impact on the environment. When I did, I made a switch over to a sustainable life where I reduce waste generation at source.I say no to plastic bags, cups and straws. I carry water in stainless steel bottles and use cloth hand towels not paper tissues. My mother makes a powder with aavaram poo, dried rose petals, hibiscus flowers, and orange peels. All soaps and shampoos are out and what is in is shikakai, payatham maavu and besan. I have replaced sanitary napkins with cotton pads and buy rice, cold-pressed oils and fresh produce from the farmer's market. I avoid anything that comes in packets. I use a herbal tooth powder, which I buy in glass containers, from the naatu marundhu kadai in my neighbourhood. As a result, less garbage is sent out from my home. I have never felt healthier. See how my skin glows.Priyanka DharmakumarCorporate trainer, runs Dugout CafeI am taking baby steps to achieve complete sustainability. I watched YouTube videos on zero-waste lives in the West. I am inspired by Marie Kondos videos on the magical art of tidying up and also hooked on to the show on Netflix. You have to de-clutter first to achieve minimalist living. I started using a bamboo toothbrush and reduced bath products to a single natural handmade soap made of turmeric and besan. I have minimised my wardrobe by 50%. I now have just five sets of clothes, one handbag and one wallet. My house is clutter-free. I have stopped online shopping. As for books, I borrow and exchange. I have started using menstrual cups ( I can use them for a lifetime without contributing any waste to the landfill), which is liberating. Three years ago, I started composting waste at home. I am more aware and conscious of the environment. I keep motivating people around me to make the shift.Sangeetha SubhashUpcycles furniture; apex member of SiruthuliWe just need to follow our grandparents lifestyle to achieve sustainable living. My design outlet, Design Infinity in Coimbatore, specialises in upcycling and custom-designing furniture. Through Siruthuli, I teach people how to make cloth bags with discarded fabric. I use soapnuts to clean. Combining the soapnuts with bio-enymes, yields a chemical-free detergent for the washing machine. Did you know that sour dosa batter is an excellent cleanser for dishes? We use ash too. I have replaced all chemical cleaning agents in the kitchen, toilets and washing with home-made natural cleaners made from waste citrus peels, soapnuts, gram flour so that we can use the water for gardening and ground water recharge.I also make a body scrub with leftover coffee grounds and besan and my toiletries are basically a combination of besan and orange peel powder. My kitchen walls and living area have natural lime plaster and my compound wall is constructed with rammed earth. I carry groceries in paper bags, veggies in cloth bags, oil in steel containers and carry my own dishes for takeaways. I compost kitchen waste and use the manure for the garden. We have created a landscape with a mix of ornamental and vegetable plants. We also have rainwater storage and harvest facilities.My Facebook page, Clean and Green Homes, has recipes and tips towards chemical-free sustainable living.It is about building awareness and giving back to Nature by making the right choices. And, a safe environment for the future generation. There is no indoor pollution and I feel my home is guilt-free. Though we are aware of chemicals used in many products, we choose to ignore them. Its time to wake up and pay attentionShanthini BaluGardener; apex member of SiruthuliGuavas, sapota, mango, lettuce, herbs, native vegetables like brinjal, drumstick, ridge gourd, bitter gourd, 40-50 varieties of greens.... I grow 60 per cent of my vegetables and fruits at home and ensure that they are free of pesticides or chemicals. I have been into natural gardening for over two decades. It has cut down the number of trips I make to the supermarket (I buy onions and carrots once in a while) and thereby reduces carbon footprint. I made the shift to sustainable living five years ago and support from my immediate family members helped me.I compost my kitchen and garden waste and use them as manure. The amount of waste sent out from my home to the landfill has come down drastically. As I make my own cleansing agents with soapnut powder, bio-enzymes, peels of citrus fruits and pomegranate peel, the waste water from kitchen and the washing machine is upcycled and used to water plants . Egg shells are powdered and used as manure. Leftover idli batter, buttermilk... are all used for plants. I dont send any decomposable waste out.It is my way of giving back. Its like going back to a simple life and being aware of the waste you add to the environment. When you buy packed stuff from the supermarket, you get addicted to the brand. Even small steps  for example we have stopped ironing our daily clothes  cut down our contribution to global warming. I teach kids how to live a sustainable life through Siruthulis initiative called Chittukuludan Siruthuli. The kids in turn work with their parents and bring about a change.N.A. SujathaMarketing Manager, Brookefields MallDid you know a pair of jeans uses up 10,000 litres of water and a kilo of cheese consumes 3,000 litres? Having been part of Brookefields Wonder Women Forum and Kovai Green League (both part of the Malls outreach programmes), I have participated in many awareness creation events on Sustainable Living.What we need to cut down is greed. I implemented sustainable living in small ways. We still have a long way to go. I use besan for my hair and body and started growing indoor plants to purify the air and keep my house pollution-free. It has a calming effect too. We reduced electricity consumption to near minimum and have done away with refrigerator at home to cut down carbon footprint."

2019-05-23,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vegetable-production-in-chittoor-wilts-under-heat/article27212157.ece,Vegetable production in Chittoor wilts under heat,"The summer heat, which started early in April first week, has a telling effect on the production of vegetables in Chittoor district, coupled with soaring prices.Chittoor district, predominantly its western mandals, is known for high production of vegetable varieties, suffice to meet the demands at markets in Tirupati and Chittoor corporations, six municipalities and hundreds of panchayats.Though the eastern mandals also come out with small size production of vegetables, this summer it went missing in the fields.Unlike the previous years, this year saw mercury levels crossing 42 Celsius in the otherwise tolerable areas of Madanapalle division. The tomato production took a sudden dip from April, with arrivals of stocks at just 200 metric tonnes or even below per day at Madanapalle market.While the first grade tomato is priced at 40 a kg at the wholesale market, the second grade is tagged at 20 a kg, which is selling at 30 in the open market. A big solace to consumers is that the price of onions continues to be between 20 and 30 since May first week.Coming to the other prime vegetables, the price of several varieties is causing concern to consumers. Ladies finger is sold at 50 to 60 a kg, while brinjal is sold at 60 a kg. Cabbage, beetroot, cauliflower, drumsticks and almost all varieties have witnessed sudden jump in their prices since a fortnight. The quality and size of the vegetables remains low. The reason of stunted levels in production is attributed to lack of moisture in soil and air.Ginger is commanding a price of 200 a kg, as against 80-100 in March.Greens affordableAnother big solace to consumers is that greens of various kinds are sold at cheaper rates compared to vegetables. Women are seen showing keen interest in adjusting with greens at their disposal at 5 to 10 per bunch.Rama Naidu, a farmer at Punganur, said that the summer had adversely impacted the economy of vegetable farming, with production hit by low yields and poor quality. It is felt that the condition would continue till June-end. Even if the arrival of monsoon is early, we have to wait for a fortnight to see signs of change in the fields, he said."

You mean pottukadalai? In response, my colleague sent me a poster on WhatsApp, confirming that it was indeed Put Kadalai.The team behind Put Kadalai (from left) Senthilkumar, Vidhya, Nisha and Harish Venkat | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementWhen I bring up the name with Nisha Venkat and Vidya Senthilkumar, who run the show along with their husbands Harish Venkat and Senthilkumar, Nisha laughs. We had the name before everything else. Last May we were considering starting a snack bar with healthy options, and couldnt come up with anything. Then Senthil suggested peanuts and Harish came up with the name. We registered it over dinner.Put Kadalai, as the name suggests, is all about peanuts. Nisha points out that there is a misconception that peanuts are not healthy. She ticks off the positives: sustainable nut (actually legume), very reasonable, available everywhere, diabetes friendly, unsaturated fats, rich storehouse of minerals and vitamins, contains folate naturally ... But we dont value it enough, she concludes dramatically. When we started working with peanuts, we realised how versatile it is: Thai and Malaysian cuisines use it extensively. In India too, theres peanut chutney from Pollachi, we add it to puliyogare, bisbele, poha and sabudana khichdi ... it can be sweet or savoury.Ginger cinnamon peanuts for a snack | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThe next step was to look at menu options. The initial idea was to have roasted peanuts in different flavours. We thought of a kiosk or vending machine, recalls Vidya. Nisha continues, This will be our flagship store to promote the brand. We want to have ramped-up versions of the peanut cart in malls and other places. Theyre also planning pop-up weekends where chefs will present different cuisines using peanuts.From roasted peanuts, they now have desserts, drinks, cotton candy, peanut butter in three flavours, peanut powder and a trail mix. Everything is natural and made in house, emphasises Vidhya. We dont use any preservatives. The cotton candy (Fluffy Bears) is made with organic sugar and natural flavours.A healthy bhel with peanuts | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementI opt for the Peanut Bhel and my mother-in-law the Beach Kadalai. Both are served in coconut shell cups. The bhel has boiled peanuts, grated carrot and beetroot, chopped onion, masala covered with crisp sev. The beach kadalai has coconut and mango shavings and is finished off with a dash of lime.Info you can use Put Kadalai is at 283, Race Course, oppposite Tata Motors showroomOpen from 6.30 am to 10.30 pm, the outlet will offer snacks, cold-pressed juices, and coffeeApart from peanut-based snacks, chocolates, eclairs with peanut butter, regular shakes and peanut milk shakes are also availableThe only plastic Put Kadalai uses is the packets for the takeaways. Even these are re-sealable and can be reused once you finish with the peanuts. However customers are welcome to bring their own containers as well.The bestseller in the cold-pressed juices is ponangani keerai, says Nisha. Its a mix of the green with sorakkai (bottle gourd) and pineapple. Those who are not too sure about it are offered shots, she smiles, and they love it.Contact 8110910910 for detailsIf you prefer peanuts with the shell, they have boiled and sand roasted.

Its just the right shape to fit into a pocket for people who are going on a walk, explains Nisha.Before we left, thanks to Senthil egging us on, we had packed two flavours of roasted peanuts and a bottle each of the Peanut Garlic Podi and Peanut Butter with Honey. The stone-crushed podi has a coarse texture and tiny chewy bits and goes well with plain rice, idli/dosai or even sprinkled over toasted and buttered bread. A spicier version made with Guntur Chillies was too hot for us. Peanut Butter is also available in a savoury form  with Jalapenos  and a sweet chocolate version.While seating at the outlet is limited, the ambience is lovely. Bar tables and stools have been placed under a huge neem tree on the ground floor. On the first floor, the branches hide the road from view and give the impression of being in a tree house. But we have to plan for the rains, says Nisha ruefully."
2019-05-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/agrarian-crisis-farmer-suicide-marathwada-drought-modi-5751338/,Farm opening,"Agrarian distress wasnt seemingly a factor in determining the outcome of the recent Lok Sabha polls. Despite sugarcane payment dues to farmers by mills in Uttar Pradesh crossing Rs 11,000 crore, the BJP won 17 out of the states 23 key ganna-growing constituencies. It also practically swept the entire middle and upper Doab aloo belt from Mathura to Kanpur, notwithstanding three consecutive years of low potato prices. Farmers across UP complained about the crackdown on cattle slaughter causing a collapse of the livestock trade as well as their standing crop being devoured by stray bovines. Yet, they voted overwhelmingly for the party of the incumbent, Narendra Modi. The ruling alliance similarly made mincemeat of the Opposition in Maharashtras Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, synonymous with drought and farmer suicides. Farmer leader Raju Shetti losing from his own seat in Western Maharashtra is further proof of cane, milk, onion, grape, pomegranate and turmeric producers reposing faith in Modi than those offering no credible alternative.AdvertisingThere could be three explanations for the above results. The first is, of course, an inept Opposition  its inability to weave a coherent narrative around farmers problems and its focus on issues (Rafale and corruption) having little resonance with rural voters. Secondly, the Modi governments own schemes  the building of about 1.55 crore houses, 9.27 crore toilets and 2.18 lakh km of all-weather roads during the last five years in rural India, besides providing 11.21 crore active LPG connections (between June 2015 and April 2019) and reducing the number of un-electrified households from roughly 4 crore to a mere 18,735  may have considerably neutralised the impact of the crash in agri-commodity prices, especially post demonetisation. Third, low crop realisations would have hurt farmers  specifically those with surplus produce to sell  more than the landless rural poor, who are likely to have benefitted both from benign food inflation and the various Pradhan Mantri asset creation-cum-welfare schemes.It would be a mistake, however, for the Modi government, in its new innings, to brush aside the serious structural problems confronting Indian agriculture. The resounding political mandate it has got provides an opportunity for restructuring the existing farm subsidy regime  based on under-pricing of fertilisers, water, electricity and credit, along with physical grain procurement at market-distorting minimum support prices  in favour of direct benefit transfers. The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi should be extended to every farmer and all current input/output subsidies converted into a fixed per-acre money payment. This is also the time to dismantle all restrictions on farm produce, whether relating to sale, stocking, domestic movement or export. Finally, scrapping the Essential Commodities Act and state-level Agriculture Produce Market Committee laws will help revive price sentiment and attract investments in processing, warehousing, transport, finance, research and extension."

The latest row to hit the programme surrounds Akshaya Patra, a charitable organisation run by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement.Akshaya Patra claims that it serves ""wholesome"" school lunch to over 1.76 million children in 15,024 schools across 12 states in India.It found itself in the midst of a controversy after an article in a national daily claimed that school-children in Karnataka were not happy with the food provided by the organisation as it lacked garlic and onion.Following this, many people bashed Akshaya Patra for forcing its own food preference on the children, while others raised questions about nutrition. Some even claimed that food was being wasted as the children were not eating the meals served by Akshaya Patra.""The size of a programme doesn't prove that it's working. Children are not eating enough food because onions and garlic play a major part in Indian food. Due to this, there is large amount of wastage of food,"" claimed Twitter user Sunil Revathi.However, the claim was countered by T.V. Mohandas Pai, who is on the board of the trustee of Akshaya Patra. ""You are lying: any data you have to make this statement?"" Pai shot back.Some supporters of the organisation pointed out that food without onion and garlic could be quite nutritious and since it is a charitable organisation, it should reserve the right to decide what it serves as long as it does not violate the norms for midday meals laid down by the government.Akshaya Patra said that it follows all the norms laid down by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.""We have regular quality audits, food safety audits etc. We have given our blood, sweat, tears and personal monies for our children: we follow norms of MHRD; for this selfless service over 20 years we are being abused!,"" Pai said.""We also have 17 ISO 22000: 2005 certified kitchens, which are testaments to our priority of protecting the health of children,"" the official handle of the organisation tweeted on Friday.After the controversy, many social media users came forward to offer donations to the organisation.

Wrong. A nice, satisfying dinner is all it takes to make one forget the experience, and that is exactly what we felt on Wednesday evening at SodaBottleOpenerWala on Lavelle Road.What better way to cool down than savour something that have mangoes in it? In addition to this, luckily for us, the restaurant was screening Indias first big game in this seasons World Cup tournament and we couldnt have asked for more.The Mango Pop-up menu looked colourful and utterly delicious (no, it wasnt Amul!) and since it is in place exclusively for summer, the King of Fruits held a prominent position in all the food items, including the cocktails/mocktails. We tried the Raw Mango & Berry LIIT, sans the alcohol, and the first sip made us feel relaxed on our seat. The flavour of raw mango with a little jaljeera masala stood out. The drink sat pretty on the table with three differently-coloured layers and a flower adorning it on top.Next, we aimed to try a little from each of the main-course dishes but ended up having more than 70 per cent portions. Its mango-flavoured and tasted absolutely delicious, we just couldnt resist! We had Raw Mango & Papaya Salad, with a tangy Kolah vinegar dressing topped with a lot of peanuts. Thinly sliced Keri  mango is called Keri in Parsi  and raw papaya along with nicely chopped tomatoes summed up for a very healthy yet tasty salad.The Keri Chicken is the star dish on the menu. A combination as beautiful as chicken and ripe mango is rare, and it was an eye-opener for our taste buds. The chicken is cooked in Parsi style, along with loads of ripe mangoes, and served with pav and Keri kachumbar salad. The strong flavour of mango was enough to keep us going till the last bite.The last one was Keri Kanda Par Eedu, which is a spicy mixture of onion and ripe mangoes, baked with an egg on top. Those love egg and mango will simply love this, though the flavour of mango here is not as strong as it was in the chicken. The poached egg gives a twist to the dish and when eaten with a pav, brings out the richness in it.Keeping an eye on the dessert section, we ordered all three from the mango menu and werent disappointed at all. The Mawa Sundae was just the perfect kind of summer dessert, with vanilla ice-cream topped with cubed mangoes, cream and fresh mango puree. We, of course, had it all. The Mango cheesecake was, likewise, a sweet dessert and needless to say, it was soft, flavourful and topped with chopped mangoes. To balance the sweetness, the menu had Keri nu Samosa, which is a thin, crispy pastry stuffed with mango mixture. Quite satisfied and removing the bad beginning to the evening from our memory, we bid goodbye.The mango Pop-Up menu is on till June 30 and cost for two is `1,500 (approx)."

It is a nutrient-rich liquid extracted from farm animals. One cup (250 ml) of 2% fat cows milk contains 285 mg of calcium, which represents 22% to 29% of the daily recommended intake (DRI) of calcium for an adult. According to Recommended Dietary Allowance ICMR 2010, a human needs 1,000 mg to 1,200 mg of calcium per day which can be received from two or three glasses of milk, says Coimbatore-based dietician Pradeepa DS.Milk is a rich source of protein, providing approximately one gram in 240 ml. It contains whey proteins that can decrease blood pressure and stress. It is also excellent for growth of muscles. Milk is good for people across age groups.

It is better to consume milk without sugar, she says, adding that one should have at least two glasses of milk, preferably cows milk, twice a day.Having milk after a meal or immediately before going to bed will lead to weight gain. It is always advised to drink a cup of milk one hour before going to bed. Milk is high in B12 and calcium. Dairy products are a good source of phosphorus, an essential mineral for the body.Diabetics can also consume milk. People who are lactose intolerant can have coconut milk or badam milk, she says.The by-products of milk include buttermilk, cheese, curd, ghee, paneer and yoghurt.

2019-06-11,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/jun/11/exploring-the-soul-of-citys-festival-souks-1988475.html,Exploring the soul of city’s festival souks,"Gulnaar Mirza ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: There are some days of the year when Bengalurus shopping district loses its soul  the days after a festival, or on a bandh. It suffers from the morning-after syndrome, a post-climax when trade loses its lustre, and it is business downtime. This is usually the scene post-Ramzan and Diwali, luckily, Christmas only marks the beginning of the year-end magic, when the frenzy never really ends.As I walked down a deserted Commercial Street after the Ramzan after-party, that loss of spirit was palpable. No buzz in the bazaar. Fundown. Unbelievable, for I had seen that shopping hysteria first-hand: When vendors, shoppers, mehendiwalis (and walas), trinket sellers, vehicles, beggars had converged on to the narrow streets, purposeful and on the go. There was a mass of humanity on every precious square feet of real estate, mornings, afternoons and nights. It can overwhelm the uninitiated.Yet, there is a magical couple of weeks every Ramzan, when spirituality is nudged to the background and the focus shifts to giving of alms and the more worldly pleasure of shopping. The diurnal and nocturnal merge, the circadian clock ticks to a different rhythm, and merchants keep in tune with this new cycle. Glittering store windows beckon with Ramadan Kareem posters  a new import from the Arabic world.Stores and food joints are open all night, shutting only around dawn, to again up their shutters at noon for the morning shoppers. And there are many of those  I have always envied that army of women who can brave the heat and traffic, togged up in burkhas, weighed down by shopping bags and a couple of kids in tow. But all these seemingly debilitating factors fail to dent their deft bargaining skills. You have to hand it to them.Then there is an army which comes out of the woodwork at night, housework done, kids asleep at home, indulgent husband in tow. They shop as the stores glitter with bling and lights, through the night, forever young. It is also peak-hour for tailors, who clatter well into the nights through the last week, at times completing orders at 5am on the day of Eid.For those on the periphery of all this action, the question remains: What is this copious shopping all about, why such fuss and bother? Check out their laundry lists and you will find everything and anything: Crockery, gold, furnishings, linen, kitchen stuff, shoes, clothes, clothes and more clothes for the poor, for family, and themselves. For many, Ramzan marks a new beginning, and homes sparkle anew. Couture takes top priority, and fashion is divided into pre-Ramzan and Ramzan designs.And to cater to these foraging folk is a smorgasbord of fodder  hot, cold, spicy, sweet.... I do believe that the mountains of samosas, cauldrons of haleem and gallons of sherbet and tea demolished during those 28 days of Ramzan make for an interesting study in the economics of onions, oil, meat, milk and spices. Besides the crores of rupees that change hands in this market.And when the last roza is done, the merchants and tailors take a (well-deserved) break. The soul of the souk? Well, that takes a small vacay too."
2019-06-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/fruit-production-triples-in-13-years-in-haryana-5776114/,Fruit production triples in 13 years in Haryana,"The area under horticulture has doubled in 13 years in Haryana while the production of fruits has gone up by three times in the same period. The production of vegetables too has more than doubled in the same period in the state.AdvertisingSeeking to give a boost to the horticulture activities, the state government has increased its budget for the sector for the 2019-20 fiscal year to Rs 523 crore, more than double of Rs 210 crore in 2014-15. The government is aiming to double the area under horticulture by 2030 while increasing the production to thrice that of the current figure.Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Om Prakash Dhankar told The Indian Express that they were working on multiple strategies to increase the production of fruits and vegetables with introduction of more excellence centres in horticulture sector and Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana (BBY) scheme for vegetables.Dhankar said that they were developing 340 horticulture villages and 140 clusters, which will offer all facilities to the farmers including facility to sell farm produce. Director General, Haryana Horticulture Department, Arjun Singh Saini said they have trained farmers for protected cultivation of vegetables and fruits in the state. Now, we will focus more on increase in production, said Saini.AdvertisingIn 2004-05, the area under horticulture was just 4.04 per cent of the total geographical area of the state. It increased to 8.17 per cent in 2017-18. The production of fruits was 7.93 lakh metric tonne in 2017, a major jump from 2.32 lakh metric tonne in 2004-05. The production of vegetables increased to 71.40 lakh metric tonne in 2017-18 compared to 29.80 lakh metric tonne 13 years back.In fact, the state government is keen on implementing the Beijing model to provide fruits, milk and vegetables to Delhi just like the Chinas capital that developed a peri-urban agriculture zone on its periphery. Dhankar, who had visited China in 2015 to study the Beijing model, believes that it was easier to provide fruits, vegetables and milk to Delhi from Haryana than to the far flung areas of the country. Dhankar has been stating that an annual turnover of Rs 3,600 crore takes place in the International Mandi of Delhi and the farmers of Haryana can reap its benefit by selling their produce there.Aiming to safeguard the interests of vegetable farmers, the Haryana government in 2018 had launched BBY as an MSP scheme for four crops  tomato, onion, potato and cabbage. The MSP in this case, unlike for other crops, is meant to cover only input costs and not provide any margin. By enabling farmers to recover basic production cost, the scheme intends to prevent them from throwing their produce on roads in the event of a price crash.Dhankar says that the scope of compensation for these vegetables will be increased by Re one each per kilogram. In case of potatoes and tomatoes, it will be increased to Rs 5 per kg while offering Rs 6 per kg for cabbage and onion. He said that in the first year of BBY, 10,579 acre land was covered under the scheme and 4,435 farmers were registered, who were compensated with about Rs 12 lakh. In the second year, 20,346 farmers had registered 66,250 acres and they were compensated with about Rs 9.40 crore. Under this scheme, provision of budget amounting to Rs 25 crore has been made for ongoing financial year."

The subsidy was announced on December 28, 2018, under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) after a drastic fall in onion prices had rocked the cultivators.AdvertisingOver the last few weeks, the average traded price of onion across wholesale markets in Nashik  the onion hub of the country  has seen a steady spike. On Monday, the bulbs average traded price at wholesale markets of Lasalgaon in Niphad taluka of the district was Rs 1,301 per quintal. Retail prices in markets like Pune and Mumbai, meanwhile, have crossed Rs 20 per kg over the last few months.Sources in the government had expressed concern over the rising prices, given its possible political fallout. Onion growers had also taken to the streets on multiple occasions in Nashik over low realisations.With a 10 per cent subsidy, onion had seen a steady rise in exports. Figures from the Ministry of Commerce and Industries indicate a nearly 30 per cent rise in exports year-on-year. A total of 21.83 lakh tonnes (lt) of the bulb was exported during 2018-19 fiscal as compared to 16.75 lt exported in 2017-18. The subsidy had further pushed exports towards the end of the financial year.The present price hike, traders say, is mainly due to a dip in onion acreage due to drought.AdvertisingIn the current rabi season, onion average is around 2.66 lakh hectares as compared to 3.15 lakh hectares sowed last year. Sown in December-January and harvested post March, the rabi crop is amenable for storage and feeds the markets till the arrival of the next crop in September-October.Onion growers in Maharashtra also take kharif (sown in June-July and harvested post September) and late kharif (sown October-November and harvested post January) crops to ensure round-the-year supply.In view of the price rise in onion, the central government has also started creating buffer stock of 50,000 tones of the bulb.Trade sources say following a roll back in the subsidy, the wholesale prices are expected to drop. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon wholesale market, said the present price range had not resulted in a steep hike in retail prices. By clamping down on exports, the present prices will not sustain, he said.Traders fear re-introduction of Minimum Export Price (MEP) as the next step for price control. MEP is the minimum price below which exports are not allowed."

I learnt it from the masters.He did not say Calcutta but Kolkata.It was noticeable the Brit was being environmentally friendly. He ripped up a page from a magazine, deftly rolled it into a paper thonga, just the way it is done back in India, tossed in the jhalmuri, sprinkled some chopped red onions and added a dash of sauce.Next please.Indian: Absolutely, you are doing a great job you are doing an absolutely great jobIndian: Guys see whats happening.Indian: I am going to make you famous in India.Woman in the crowd: He is already famousIndian: Look at the ingredientsmans got everything hereall the chutneysthats imli chutney?Angus, who is a bit busy trying to keep up with the orders, confirms: Thats imli chutney.Anguss performance at the Oval has now gone viral on social media, with even Amitabh Bachchan liking it.Angus Denoon Duncan  he has dropped the Duncan  is a former chef who has become something of a celebrity in London where he wheels his colourfully decorated cart to festivals and dispenses his spicy offerings.At 3.50 a portion, the jhalmuri is competitively priced. One food writer was impressed: Calcutta flavour is brought to London in the form of Bengali street food.Jhalmuri is crunchy, spicy, sweet and sour, thanks to fresh lime juice, cucumber, ginger, onions, tamarind sauce, hard chickpea noodles, puffed rice and fried lentils.He provided Anguss back story: some 15 years ago, former chef Angus Duncan made a random stopover in Calcutta and his love affair with Bengali culture began. Readers of The Telegraph, where he was featured in 2013, shouldnt be too surprised Angus was such a hit at the Oval.He told the paper: It was in 2004, I think. I came on via a stopover from Australia on my way back to the UK. I stopped at Calcutta so I could go to the mountains. I went to BBD Bag to buy my ticket and saw the sprawling street food stands there. I was cautious and ate chapatti and sabji and thought what a friendly and relaxed city it was  very different from what I had imagined.He returned the following year for a proper experience of Calcuttas street food.One stall that had a place to sit was a jhalmuri stall in front of the old Dunlop Building on the corner of Mirza Ghalib Street and Royd Street near Park Street. The guy was very beautiful to watch as he swirled around his set-up mixing and chopping and roasting... like a dance, and at the end, he produced a bag of mystery to me that tasted wonderful. It was light and fresh but substantial in its effect. I was sold.He has tried out street food in other places in India.I have spent a few days in Mumbai and I did like the papad chaats they had on Juhu beach. Also outside the palace in Mysore, I had some cucumber chaat, I have never seen elsewhere. The chaat carts of Goa were wonderful with their versions of sev puri and paani puri. But for variety, quality and price, Calcutta is in a league of its own.Angus is now in demand at upmarket Indian parties in London."

The tubers prices have jumped 47 per cent in a month.The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notice, announced the removal of incentives paid out for export of fresh and chilled onions under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme.Export benefits for exports of fresh and chilled onions granted under the foreign trade policy has been made zero from the current 10 per cent with immediate effect, the DGFT notice said.The decision to withdraw export incentives comes as the agriculture ministry has started work on creating a buffer stock of 50,000 tonnes of onion to check prices in the coming months.India had actually doubled the export incentive last December, after a glut saw onion prices crashing, hitting farmers ahead of a crucial general election.Onion, which is an indispensable ingredient in Indian cooking, is politically important.High prices have often led to consumer protests and pollsters believe they played a major role in the electoral reverses suffered by ruling state governments in Delhi and Rajasthan in 1998 elections. Low prices have led to farmers discontent.Wholesale prices of onion hovered around Rs 1,300 per quintal at Lasalgaon, near Nashik. Indian exporters mostly sell onion to Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Gulf countries.Onion production in the current (2018-19) crop year is estimated to be slightly higher at 23.62 MT, against 23.26 MT in 2017-18, mainly on account of the winter glut.But with low supplies spurring higher prices and drought fears in key onion producing districts, the government decided to take no chances."

Called Chetna ben lovingly by friends and family, her love affair with food began when she was just nine years old. My mother told me to go out of the kitchen every time I wanted to cook, but I never listened to her, she says. The first dish she made was bhakri no ladvo, laddoos made with bhakri, a thick roti made of wheat, which is a Gujarati staple. The 58-year-old prepares it every Monday to remind herself of when her journey began.Her skills came in handy when her mother fell sick. There were 20 people in my family so the pre-preparation like chopping vegetables and soaking dal would already be done, after which I used to cook for all of them, adds the cook, who has been in the business of preparing traditional Gujarati food for almost 20 years now.However, she likes to take things up a notch. From tomato-flavoured dhoklas to chutneys made of kairi (raw mango) and doodhi (bottle gourd) peels, Chetna loves creating new dishes. I look at the ingredients I have and think of how I can combine all of them to create a new dish. I may not be educated, but I am very innovative when it comes to cooking, says the self-taught cook, who has the ability to create varieties of the same dish by changing a few core ingredients.In her take on the classic puran poli, a flatbread that is made with a dal, sugar and cardamom stuffing, Chetna stuffs the dough with a sweet potato masala or a mixture of peanuts and coconuts. She also prepares different varieties of buttermilk that include orange buttermilk, lemon buttermilk and onion buttermilk. Depending on the type of buttermilk you are making, add a small piece of orange, lemon or onion to the curd with other masalas and blend it before adding water. It is that simple, she shares.However, her not-so-simple twist on the traditional Gujarati snack, bhakarwadi, is one that makes jaws drop. I use hariboot (green garbanzo beans) to fill the bhakarwadis instead of a mixture of coconut, sesame seeds and poppy seeds, she says.When asked if she uses any secret ingredient in her recipes, she shakes her head furiously saying, I do not see what one could possibly do by keeping the ingredients a secret. If one possesses knowledge that can help another person grow, why not share it? Chetna keeps good thoughts in mind while cooking. Agar bhagwan nu naam laine rasoi kare, toh badi vastu sari bane (When you chant gods name while cooking, everything will turn out well), she says."

I was affected by the stories of rural distress and farmer suicides. I took up farming to understand the pains and troubles of farmers, he said.Around five years ago, Sen purchased 27 gunthas (0.67 acre) land and took another 1.25 acres on lease from a neighbouring farmer. If you want to do something extraordinary, then the challenges should be extraordinary as well. Hence, I chose rocky soil. For the first three years, I grew pulses, roots of which are so strong that they can break through rocks, he said.Sen said he also had to implement water conservation methods as the groundwater level in the region was low. In this region, there is either too much rain or none at all. I thought, if people can grow peepal trees on the third floor of their buildings and railway tracks can have banyan trees, I can also grow something on rocky soil. I created huge trenches and allowed rainwater to seep, Sen said. The toil, the singer-actor said, had paid off and the farm now boasts of papaya, coconut and tamarind trees.AdvertisingSen, who has held several shows across the world and even at the Parliament and Rashtrapati Bhavan, said he now invites groups of farmers from around Lonavala to his farm and teaches them methods of trapping water and ways to keep wild pigs, crabs and rabbits in check. The problem is that farmers have become dependent on hybrid seeds. I want to teach them a model where they dont have to buy compost or seeds every year. If you stick to indigenous seeds, you dont have to buy it every year, he said.Another problem, Sen added, is that farmers children dont want to pursue farming anymore. They prefer to drive autorickshaws or take up odd jobs because they cannot rely on their farm yield alone, he said.Asked if being an artist helped him on the farm, Sen said: One of the virtues artistes possess is that they are never in a hurry. We let things happen in their own time."

Of the 443 buildings, 373 are still in use while 70 have been vacated.The corporation has classified the structures under four categories: C-1, C-2A, C-2 B and C-3. Buildings under C-1 are extremely dangerous and unfit for staying, while structures under C-2A need the owners to vacate for undertaking repair work. Buildings classified as C-2B do not need vacating for repairs and those under C-3 require minor repairs.An official from the encroachment department said 55 buildings have been identified as C-1. These structures are completely unsafe and have no scope for being repaired. The onion-potato market and JN type buildings in Vashi fall under this category. There is no other way but to demolish them, which the owners will have to do themselves. While 106 buildings have been classified as C-2A, 226 come under C-2B, and 56 under C-3.As per the notice being issued to C-1 type structures, the administration has absolved itself of any responsibility in the event of mishap and has instructed for their demolition. We will disconnect the water supply and electricity to the dilapidated buildings. We have issued enough notices, and hope people take cognisance of them and vacate the buildings to avoid any kind of loss in case of mishap, NMMC Commissioner N. Ramaswami said.An NMMC official said the ward offices had sent notice to housing societies to submit their structural audit reports. A few housing societies had also presented their audit reports directly to the town planning department, which were also taken into account while compiling the list of dangerous structures.In 2018, the number of dangerous buildings was 367, followed by 315 in 2017, 98 in 2016, and 74 in 2015. The highest number of buildings added in one year was in 2017, when it was 143. Officials said the reason for the increase was the inclusion of numerous CIDCO-constructed condominiums and government quarters, which are largely situated in Vashi.Among the 55 structures are the police quarters in Belapur; Maharashtra State Electricity Board colony, Employees State Insurance Corporation colony, JN-1 and JN-2 type buildings, and B type buildings in Vashi; MAFCO market and onion-potato market of APMC; and many other government quarters.This year, among all the nodes under the NMMC, Vashi has the highest number of dangerous structures at 185."

We are waiting for a decision, Ashok Walunj, an onion-potato trader and director of Maharshtra Rajya Bazar Samiti Mahasangh, said.Onion-potato and garlic traders have been waiting for rehabilitation since the building was declared dangerous in 2003. On March 22, the APMC sent a notice to 234 of the 250 traders to vacate the market by June 1, which was later extended by 15 days, and now till July 15.But the traders have been demanding that the authorities first make an alternative arrangement.In 2005, when I was the director of the market, we had processed a tender and a work order for a new building was issued for 52 crore , which the government was to fund. The plan was to shift each wing to the auction hall in the market and construct a new wing. The project was to be finished in three years. But there was a dispute among traders. While some wanted an increase in FSI, some didnt. Hence the plan was cancelled, and now the entire market is suffering, Mr. Walunj said.Currently, the market is spread across 15 acres with seven buildings. The authorities had given as an option of shifting to a two-acre plot that belongs to the MAFCO market. We are already finding it difficult to operate from the 15-acre plot; working on a two-acre area is impossible, Mr. Walunj said.With around 300 trucks entering the market every day, the traders have urged the authorities to allot a bigger space.Anil Chavan, secretary of APMC, Mumbai, said, We will set up transit camps of 200 square feet at the MAFCO market for each trader. This is the only land available where we can relocate them temporarily. Later, after the processing of tender, the work at the market will start. While the government will fund the work of drainage, road and electricity, the traders will have to bear the expenditure of the construction of their shops."

What makes the junction noteworthy are the four thattukadas that align it, whose lights refuse to flicker even after the street lights wear themselves out. However, the last stall will undoubtedly trigger all your senses.SightThe long queue of customers would be the first to catch your eye. Move closer and you will notice the thattukada manned by two women, doling out chicken fry at an extraordinary speed. The stall which displays a banner saying 'Chicken 65: 100 gms for `30', is manned by P Smitha, a Changanassery native, and her helper, Kanchan from Uttar Pradesh. Smitha's thattukada was among the first in the region to serve cheap and lip-smacking tasty chicken fry, 100 gms for Rs 30. ""The other thattukada owners were serving it for Rs 60. They immediately switched to Rs 30 upon seeing my business soar,"" a shy Smitha says, with her ally, the balance scales.soundIt is rather difficult to speak to Smitha, respecting her to serve customers without delay. ""My mother and I started the thattukada four years ago, at this very junction, as a source of income. After a short while, she left it to me. For months, I cooked and served customers by myself. Then I'd have temporary helpers from other states. Now its Kanchan,"" she smiles at her helper, who has a no-nonsense attitude while she dutifully attends to the frying pan. ""We started off with chicken 65 and mutton soup. Later we added spring chicken, quail fry, chicken soup, chappatti, porotta and appam,"" she says.SmellWafting through the air is the aroma, a blend of spices and coconut oil, serving as your catalyst to venture further and request her best preparations.TouchHer most popular delicacy, Chicken 65, comprises pieces of chicken, browned to a lovely shade, garnished with onion, crispy curry leaves and a slice of lemon to sharpen your taste buds.TasteWith loyal customers thronging the stall, they pinpoint to her USP. 'The taste', someone says. ""All my masalas are home-made. It is a special blend and I start preparing them and marinating the chicken at 12 pm and arrive at the junction at 6 pm. Also, the meat is solely fried in coconut oil,"" says the Chalikkavattom resident. A bite into the chicken can vouch for her statement and those of her customers. Sans artificiality, the chicken is a paradox, soft but crisp, 'naadan'(local), a crunchy snack to accompany your choice of drink.""My husband picks me when I wrap up at 11.30 pm. Earlier, there was a beverage counter nearby and the customers would give me a hard time. The journey was by no means easy; I hated the toil initially and there weren't other women who ran a thattukada in the vicinity. I have been frightened several times working at night but I never gave up,"" she says while she attends to the next customer. Truly, a woman in a man's world."

But her physical education teacher, Thara, saw that her real talents lay in football, and introduced her to coach S. Mariappan.That turned out to be a game-changer for Kathiresan. Mariappan, 67, a former Tamil Nadu State player, not only taught her football, but also helped her turn her life around dramatically.Today she is one of the star players of the Indian womens football team and a sub-inspector in the Tamil Nadu Police. My dad earns money carrying sacks of rice and onions in the market, she says. My mother used to work too, but now that I have a job, she stays home.Kathiresan is not the only one. Mariappan has introduced several young women like her, mostly from very poor families, to the beautiful game, and helped them transform their lives. Today, the former girls school headmaster runs the Indira Gandhi Academy for Sports and Education in Cuddalore, a small and dusty town 175 km from Chennai and 23 km from Puducherry. The academy has 33 footballer students, all of whom have excelled at the sport.Changing livesI used to see so many sad faces. Most of the girls did not have a father, and some had neither parent. I wanted to change their lives through football since I am a footballer myself. Seven of the girls now have jobs, says Mariappan, who is also vice president of the Puducherry Football Association.R. Sandhya does not have a father, and her mother is a small-time farmer. She was a student at the Government Childrens Home, a sort of orphanage hostel in Cuddalore. Since I did not have a father, I was admitted there, she says. Then one day, they asked at school if anybody was interested in football. Thats how it all started, says Sandhya, now a player on the Indian team.All 33 girls of the academy have represented the university, and many of them helped Vellores Thiruvalluvar University win the national inter-university title three times. And now, 11 of them have played for the country, says Mariappan.And its not just about sport for these young women  theyve done very well academically, and some of the girls are postgraduates too, says Mariappan.S. Mariappan watches a practice session. | Photo Credit: S.S. KumarSpringtime for TNIt has been an amazing football season for Tamil Nadu. While Chennai City FC clinched the mens I-League title in Coimbatore on March 9, it was Madurais little-known Sethu Football Club that lifted the Indian Womens League (IWL) title with a shocking 31 victory over the strong Manipur Police team in the final in Ludhiana on May 22.But this wasnt a first for the Tamil Nadu women. Even though Manipur  with their 19 National Championship trophies  are the queens of Indian womens football, Tamil Nadu had pulled off a coup of sorts in Cuttack early last year by grabbing the Senior National Football title from their hands. And 10 of the players on the Tamil Nadu team were from Sethu FC (SFC).Founded by M. Seeni Mohaideen in 2017, SFC became the first club from Tamil Nadu to play in the IWL  launched in 2016  last year, and lifted the cup this year. SFC has very quickly grown into a team to reckon with. And the young women from Mariappans academy? Theyve not only been an integral part of the club, but also now of the national womens team. It was Sethu FC captain Kathiresan who played a leading role in Tamil Nadus national triumph last year by scoring the opening goal to give her team its stunning 21 victory over Manipur; she was adjudged player of the championship. Incidentally, this was the very first time Tamil Nadu had entered the womens football finals.The little known Sethu FC team after winning the IWL title. | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementWhats behind SFCs meteoric rise? A lot of credit goes to coach Amrutha Aravind, the former Kerala State star from Kochi, who planned the clubs moves smartly. Aravind, a Kerala State Sports Council coach, kept close tabs on the Hero Gold Cup in Bhubaneswar in February and on the Indian womens team during the Asia Zones Olympic qualification matches in November 2018 and this April. And when the national camp was held in Bhubaneswar earlier this year, Aravind was there. Her closeness to the Indian teams assistant coach, Chaoba Devi, also helped.In the end, Aravind helped SFC pick up some fine gems for its IWL team. Apart from packing the team with quality Tamil Nadu players, SFC was able to rope in five internationals from Manipur  Indian captain Ashalata Devi, Dangmei Grace, Ratanbala Devi, Asharani Devi and Sweety Devi.Madurais revolutionSo what made Madurai turn to womens football in such a big way? What was the trigger that started the womens football revolution in Tamil Nadu?I was appointed Womens Committee chairman of the Tamil Nadu Football Association in 2014, and I continue to hold that post. We wanted to field a team from Tamil Nadu in the IWL, but since no one came forward, we started a team ourselves and last year, we took part in the IWL for the first time, says Mohaideen.Sethu FC also has four mens clubs and a womens team in Madurai, and a mens team and a womens academy in Chennai.Sethu FC players celebrate after scoring a goal in the IWL final against Manipur Police. | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThe IWL debut last year became SFCs classroom, but most importantly, it brought the club into close contact with the countrys finest women players. We didnt have much information about womens football before that. We had some six players from North India, mainly from Maharashtra and Punjab, last year. But when we played in the IWL, we realised that the Manipur players were the ones to look out for, says Seeni.This year, we had built up a good rapport with players from other States. We recruited Manipur players. Only one club from a State can qualify for the IWL; this year the Manipur club that our players had played for earlier did not make the cut. They were available, so we spoke to their coaches and got them for SFC.With virtually half the Indian team on its rolls, SFC, which has its training base in Chennai, began as a strong favourite for the IWL title. But the Manipur Police had one player who could make all the difference: Bala Devi. Entering the match, Bala was the IWLs highest scorer with 26 goals from six matches and there was nobody even close to rivalling her.Manipur Police star Bala Devi. | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThen, SFC coach Aravind laid out a strategy to deal with Bala. When we watched them play against Gokulam FC in an earlier game, we noticed that there was not much flow of passes from the wings. We felt we needed to focus only on Bala, says Aravind, who has been a coach in all three editions of the IWL, each time for a different club.Sweety Devi, SFCs central defender, was given the job of marking Bala, and she laid a neat trap. The message to me was, if Bala gets the ball, I should not let her turn towards the goal. That was it, says the 21-year-old from Imphal. If she turns, she can do anything she wants, so I did not let her turn, I marked her tightly. She was so effective that Bala, who had been unstoppable in earlier games, couldnt even score a single goal.Sweety is a former baseball player who was even selected for the nationals, representing Himachal Pradesh  but with her father Ruhi Kanta being a football coach, she turned to pro football. We dont get much support for womens football, but we all love the sport back home in Manipur, she says.Another player in great form for SFC was Nepal striker Sabitra Bhandari, whose two goals in the first six minutes had given India a huge headache in the Hero Gold Cup in Bhubaneswar in February. Bhandari was SFCs top goal-getter in the IWL.And it was Sandhya, with her speed and great ball sense, who walked away with IWLs Most Valuable Player award.Sethu FCs Indumathi Kathiresan (left) and R. Sandhya. | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementMight-have-beensAs they watch the ongoing FIFA Womens World Cup in France (June 7 to July 7), the Indian players may well be thinking that they should have played on footballs biggest stage decades ago.Sitting on the 63rd rung in FIFAs world rankings and 12th in Asia, the Indian women may not present a very impressive picture, but there was a time when they were among Asias best. India was runner-up when it hosted the third edition of the womens Asian Football Championship in Kozhikode, Kerala, in January 1980.Three years later, India finished second again in the Asian event, this time losing to hosts Thailand in the final in Bangkok. West Bengals 19-year-old Shanti Mullick, who had been adjudged best player in the 1980 Kozhikode edition, emerged as top scorer in the 1983 championship.With such a team, India could well have been playing in France today  but since FIFA launched the Womens World Cup in 1991, India has never qualified, either in the mens or womens sections.The climb back upThis need not continue. The Indian women are much further up the ladder than their male counterparts  ranked 101st in FIFAs list  and are thus a lot closer to the World Cup; with a little push, they could work wonders. And they do seem to be getting there, having entered the second round of the Olympic qualification event for the first time.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is now planning to bid for the 2022 Womens Asian Cup, which is a qualification event for the 2023 World Cup. Does AIFF believe the women can make it? Yes, that is the goal... starting with the U-17 Womens World Cup in India next year, says Kushal Das, General Secretary, AIFF.But for that to happen, a lot needs to be done. Womens football is developing but we want more; we want things to move faster. We went to Spain last year for an exposure tournament; we were there for about 10 days and also played matches with a Spanish club, says Sweety. We need more exposure in European countries; to look at their game, find out our capabilities, see where we stand.Interestingly, it was Tamil Nadu that showed the way in the past as well, when former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa took the lead to host the eight-nation Jayalalitha Gold Cup in Chennai in April 1994. For the first time, the Indian women were able to see the playing styles of teams from Europe, Latin America and Africa.Many years ago Sepp Blatter, then FIFA President, called India the sleeping giant of world football. The women seem eager to get the sleeping giant up and running. And they just might do so."

Any guesses? Ask a Bengali and he/she will promptly tell you, Of course! Its the gondhoraj lebu (lime) thats missing!Over centuries, gondhoraj lebu has been a welcome guest in Bengali households and even today, it is considered as a dear relative of all types of dal and in some cases, fish and chicken curries cooked in the kitchen.Known to be a cousin of kaffir lime and having no such English word in the dictionary, gondhoraj keeps its head held high as the ultimate king of aromas, the essence of which can be felt even from a few metres away. Oh! Calcutta in Church Street is hosting the Gondhoraj Cocktail and Mocktail fest, and true to its spirit, we went Oh! Gondhoraj after the meal.To beat the heat, we were offered Gondhoraj Lychee Cooler, which was simply aromatic, fruity and soothing. The lime and its leaves did the magic of accentuating the magical aroma and lychees in the drink put in more flavour, turning the mocktail into an absolute delight. My dining companion had the Gondhoraj Lychee Caipiroshka, a vodka-based cocktail infused with flavours of the East. The vodka-mixed lychees gathered at the bottom of the glass gave a nice kick to the start of a sumptuous Bengali dinner ahead.Oh! Calcuttas fortnight-long summer food festival, Grishher Khabar, includes innovative yet traditional recipes, keeping in mind the ingredients that are essential to the summer cuisine. For starters, we had Sosha Diye Bhapa Maach, which is steamed boneless fish with cucumber and mustard. Soft bhetki fish topped with slices of cucumber melted in our mouth, with the right amount of spices and mustard that left our Bengali taste buds wanting some more.Coming to the course that is fit for a king, we were served rice along with Jhinge Pabda Aam Jhol, Lau Chingri, Doi Moricher Mangsho, Kancha Aam Diye Maacher Paturi and Enchorer Dalna. Only a Bong will understand the feeling of maa er haater ranna, (moms cooking), especially when he/she is living outside Bengal, and the main course reminded us of just that.The Jhinge Pabda dish, which is butterfish cooked with green mango and ridge gourd, is known for its amazing health benefits. Although the fish was not too fresh, the flavour came out really well, as anything that has hints of raw mango gives a tantalising taste to it.Lau Chingri, or bottle gourd cooked with prawns, is again a common dish prepared back home. With the right amount of ginger, tempered with dry red chillies and cumin, we loved this dish with rice.Chicken or mutton, when cooked with yoghurt, gives a creamy scrumptious flavour to the meat, and Doi Moricher Mangsho was no exception. The mutton, stewed in a clay pot, was cooked with yoghurt and black pepper and its richness got to us quite well.The Maacher Paturi, which is steamed fish marinated with mustard paste and wrapped in banana leaf, was marinated with green mango and stood out as our favourite. It was as soft as it could get, and the spices helped amp up the flavour. The jackfruit cooked in onion and tomato gravy (Enchorer Dalna) was wholesome, which we relished till the end of the course.Lastly, we ordered Nolen Gurer ice-cream, which is date palm jaggery added to the dessert, and ended our dinner on a sweet note. The summer food festival is on till June 25 and cost for two is Rs 1,700 (approx)."
2019-06-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/govt-drought-cover-record-stock-pulses-food-inflation-monsoon-fci-5782717/,Govt has drought cover: a record stock of pulses,"As India stares at the prospect of a sub-par monsoon  cumulative rainfall so far this season (June-September) has been 43 per cent below normal, on top of a 25 per cent deficiency in the pre-monsoon period (March-May)  it can take heart from two things that can significantly combat any threat of food inflation.AdvertisingThe first is the stocks of wheat and rice with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the Central pool. That, at 741.41 lakh tonnes (lt) plus another 120.08 lt of unmilled paddy (equivalent to roughly 80.45 lt of rice) as on June 1, is highest ever level for this date since 2012.It is also nearly twice the normative minimum operational-cum-strategic buffer of 411.20 lt to be maintained at the beginning of July.But what is perhaps more heartening is the large stocks of pulses held by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed). As on June 11, these, on its own account, totalled 27.46 lt  comprising 20.35 lt of chana (chickpea), 3.02 lt of urad (black gram), 1.47 lt of moong (green gram), 1.42 lt of arhar/toor (pigeon-pea) and 1.19 lt of masur (lentil).AdvertisingIn addition, the apex produce marketing cooperative was holding another 13.90 lt as buffer stock on the Centres behalf. That included 7.05 lt of arhar/toor, 2.41 lt of urad, 2.37 lt of chana, 1.43 lt of moong and 0.57 lt of masur.Never before have we had so much of pulses stocks (41 lt-plus) before the beginning of the agricultural year. This should help us comfortably tide over any domestic production shortfall in the event of a poor monsoon, said Sanjeev Kumar Chadha, managing director, Nafed.The prices of pulses went through the roof in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the first two years of the Narendra Modi governments first term, which also witnessed back-to-back droughts. Retail prices of arhar, which scaled Rs 180-200 per kg levels in October 2015, were seen to have contributed to the BJPs defeat in the Bihar Assembly polls that year.Wholesale inflation in pulses has climbed from 2.11 per cent to 18.36 per cent year-on-year between December and May this year. But most pulses, barring arhar/toor, are still trading in mandis at below their official minimum support prices (MSP).Also, unlike five years ago, government agencies have sufficient stocks to allow market intervention. The Modi government, for the first time, in October 2015, decided to create a buffer stock of pulses, initially through imports and later, by domestic procurement.From 2014-15 to 2019-20 (until June 12), aggregate procurement of pulses under the Centres price support scheme and price stabilisation fund programmes, at 87.86 lt, has been more than 12 times the 7.16 lt bought during the preceding 13 years. The bulk of this procurement has taken place after 2016-17 (see table).The stocks that we have built through our MSP-based procurement operations should also enable keeping imports within limits, Chadha said.Indias imports of pulses soared from 36.55 lt in 2013-14 to 66.09 lt in 2016-17. Subsequently, they fell to 56.08 lt in 2017-18, and to 25.30 lt in 2018-19, on the back of increased domestic production and procurement by Central agencies. For the current fiscal, the Centre has imposed quantitative restrictions, limiting annual imports to 2 lt of arhar/toor and 1.5 lt each of urad, moong and peas. Chana imports, too, now attract 60 per cent customs duty.Besides pulses, the Centre is seeking to create a 50,000-tonne buffer stock of onions, which has also recorded a spike in wholesale inflation from minus 63.83 per cent to 15.89 per cent year-on-year between December 2018 and May 2019. Out of the 50,000 tonnes target, Nafed has already procured 46,000 tonnes.On June 11, the Commerce Ministry withdrew the 10 per cent MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) subsidy on onion. The move was intended at discouraging exports of the bulb, which rose from 16.92 lt (valued at Rs 3,359.60 crore) in 2017-18 to 22.04 lt (Rs 3,521.33 crore) in 2018-19.In its first term, the Modi government was very hawkish on food inflation, invoking the Essential Commodities Act to clamp stockholding restrictions on pulses, onion, and sugar, apart from practically banning their exports while permitting unlimited duty-free imports.AdvertisingThe general expectation is that it may be more circumspect in the current term, despite wholesale inflation for food articles shooting up from minus 0.42 per cent to 6.99 per cent between December and May. One reason for this could be that in Maharashtra, which is slated to go to polls in October, the votes of sugarcane, onion and pulses growers may count just as much as those of urban consumers."

Street vendors have been enduring losses due to low market price and desiccation of fruits in the hot weather. ""Vegetables, if not sold, go waste and these cannot be used the next day most of the time due to heat,"" says a vendor at Sector 26 grain market.Currently apple, which comes from Himachal Pradesh , is selling at Rs 100/kg and its wholesale price is between Rs 18,00 and Rs 2,000 per carton while mango, which is being brought in from Uttar Pradesh, is fetching Rs 100/kg with wholesale price at Rs 90 per carton.Plum is costing Rs 120/kg with wholesale price at Rs 100/kg while musk melon is Rs 100 for four kg. Both these fruits come from Punjab while cherry, which is brought in from Himachal Pradesh, costs Rs 250 per box with wholesale price of Rs 220/box.Prices of vegetables have greater fluctuations as compared to fruits. Tomatoes that are being brought from Andhra Pradesh are selling at Rs 40/kg and have touched Rs 44/kg, cauliflower from Punjab id being sold at Rs 60/kg and can touch up to Rs 80/kg while onions are fetching Rs 24/kg, which is an increase as compared to Rs 20/ kg a few days ago.""Vegetable rates this year are quite stable and is not expected to vary much in the coming weeks. Due to heat, plucking of fruit has started. This year arrival of fruits and vegetables has been satisfactory, said Gurminder Singh, supervisor for the Sector 26 grain market committee.The continuous fluctuation in the price of vegetables has made it difficult for the vendors to predict their profit and loss, especially when fruits dry out quickly and require water to be sprinkled at frequent intervals.Although the prices increase every year in June, the rise is higher due to the prevailing heat wave. Varying prices will be the result of shortage in supply."

Chennai Corporation officials have now started visiting his home to study all aspects of composting wet waste.Explaining the process adopted by him, Mr. Singh says he has been using a 500-litre plastic drum with 300 minute holes in the lower portion for composting the waste. Each of the 300 holes in the drum has a dimension of 6 mm. He fills 1.9 cm blue metal for a height of 5 cm at the bottom of the drum and tops it with 15 cm of wet waste.Dos and dontsI do not include onion or waste from citrus fruits. I do not include meat either, says Mr. Singh. He adds 500 g of fresh cow dung mixed in 2 litres of water, before adding layers of waste again. Just four earthworms are added to the waste to facilitate composting. The top layer of the drum is closed with 2 cm soil. There is no stench at all, he says. Jaggery is used to attract the earthworms. He gets 150 kg of manure every two months.R. Padma, a resident of the Officers Colony in Anna Nagar West Extension, says civic officials should study the cause of stench in the decentralised waste processing facilities in the neighbourhood."

The number of lorries arriving at the market has also drastically reduced during this summer.We used to get close to 400 lorries every day during summer. But only 200-250 come now.

How can I increase my calcium intake? Am I doing the right kind of fitness training? Do children and pregnant women have food restrictions? These are some of the questions that Dr Nandita Shah gets from participants at her plant-based diet workshops and lectures. For the past 14 years, she has presented health workshops in India and abroad, inspiring others to make dietary and lifestyle changes resulting in positive health. She conducts specific health workshops like reversing diabetes and reversing heart disease and hypertension as well as organising a residential 21-day health retreat. Dr Nandita is also the founder of SHARAN, an organisation devoted to disease reversal through food.What is a plant-based diet?A plant-based diet means eating only those foods that come from plants. It means no meat, fish, chicken, eggs, not even honey or dairy since all of these foods require the exploitation of animals. Although we have been brought up thinking that we, humans, are omnivores, the scientific truth is quite different. Every animal eats according to instincts. On a farm, we would be instinctively attracted to fruits and vegetables. But seeing a chicken, a goat, a cow, or even a fish swim in an aquarium would not make us salivate. These are not our foods. Nor is milk, for that matter, as every mammal produces milk only for her young, and we are not calves. No animal in nature drinks another animals milk. Instinctively, every human child loves its mothers milk but refuses cows milk when its first given.Anatomically too we have the features of herbivores and not those of omnivores or carnivores. We have learned to eat foods that are not suitable for us through social conditioning and marketing. Now if we see a plate of chicken or mutton, curd or cheese, we may feel like eating it because of this conditioning. Eating foods that are not suitable to our species is a bit like putting diesel in a car that runs on petrol. It doesnt promote health.Whats the difference between plant-based and vegan diet?A plant-based diet is only concerned with the diet. Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as possible, all forms of, exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.What comes under whole-food plant-based diet?We are the only species that make our food less nutritious before we eat by refining it. The maximum nutrition in plants is found just under the skin, and when we remove the skin we are losing not only a lot of nutrition, but also a lot of fibre.Some refined foods that we commonly eat are sugar, oil, white rice and white flour. But juice, jaggery and even soy and coconut milk are refined because the fibre is removed. Most packaged and ready-made foods are full of refined products. Also peeling fruits and vegetables renders them less than the whole. Fruits such as apples, chickoos, guavas etc should never be peeled. Similarly, no vegetables except onion, garlic and certain yams and tubers should be peeled.What are some of the benefits of plant-based diet?Freedom from minor complaints like colds, coughs, fever, headaches, body aches, acidity, constipation, skin diseases etc, but also prevention and often reversal of major illnesses like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, cancers and even degenerative conditions like cataracts.When did you adapt to a plant-based diet? What were the challenges and how has it transformed your lifestyle?I started adapting to a plant-based diet in the early 1980s, after I understood the cruelty aspects of dairy. As I was already a vegetarian, this change made me a vegan. At the time, veganism was unheard of in India, so some of the challenges were social. However, I do feel that its all in the mind. I had travelled the world being vegetarian, and I faced no problem anywhere. Similarly being vegan is a mindset. Once we are clear about what we want to do, the fruits and vegetables and other vegan items will be available everywhere. The biggest change is the change in the state of mind. It has made me a calmer person. One of the reasons people are so stressed these days is because they are indirectly consuming the stress of animals in our food chain through the adrenaline present in their secretions or body parts.Are there markets that cater to a plant-based diet?Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans and grains are available everywhere. Perhaps ready-made alternatives may not be easily available, but our basic Indian food  dal, chawal, roti, sabzi  can be vegan by default. Its true that there may not be enough restaurants that serve high-quality vegan meals everywhere. As the demand increases the supply will increase. Nowadays in the west, there are may pure vegan restaurants, and most restaurants, including fast food outlets, cater to vegan clients. Nowadays there are hundred per cent vegan fast food outlets as well, and there are high-quality replacements for all kinds of animal-based products from milk and eggs, to chicken, meat and fish.What should we keep in mind while starting to experiment with plant-based diet?It is wise to do overall basic blood tests including vitamins B12 and D so that you know the state of your body before embarking on this lifestyle. Even though a whole plant-based diet will definitely improve health, there are possibilities that health is already compromised before you start. If tests are not done before starting then there is a chance later to blame the issue on the change in diet. Vitamins B12 and D can be low in anybody whether they are vegan or not and these are very important for our body.Our website, www.sharan-india.org provides a wealth of information on how to embark on this lifestyle and also has many recipes."
2019-06-19,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/19/do-you-know-to-eat-1992039.html,Do you know to eat?,"KV Navya ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: You can make more of the food you eat simply by thoroughly chewing it. Wondering how? Our obsession with what we eat has taken over some of the most important aspects of healthy eating. CE spoke to Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician with the Tamil Nadu Government Multi-Specialty Hospital on how to eat your food. You need to chew every bite of your meal in order to nourish your body. Only then the nutrients get digested, absorbed and utilised by the system for nourishment. Chewing synchronises with the release of several digestive enzymes. Skipping this step means inadequate digestion thereby leading to inadequate nutrient absorption. The simple act of chewing can reduce your calorie intake. It works by increasing the satisfaction you get from meals. Eating quickly may not give the intricate hormonal (Leptin) cross-talk system enough time to work effectively towards satiety. Eating quickly is associated with a higher body mass index (BMI). Chewing insufficiency is also associated with increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome. Blood glucose control or glycemic control is dependent on chew count. This simple lifestyle modification of thorough mastication can be a preventive measure against diabetes in people with a strong family history and other risk factors for diabetes who have not yet developed diabetes or are pre-diabetes. The lower the glycemic index and load of the meal, the higher the chew count. The glycemic index of a meal will vary depending on whether the food is coarsely ground, roasted, fried or finely ground. For example, if ragi is consumed in the form of porridge, one takes lesser time to chew and if it is prepared as adai/dosai the chew count is more, making it a healthier option. We spend more time chewing fibre-rich food. For example, between rice and chapati we spend more time on chewing chapati. As per National Institute of Nutrition, at least 20 grams of fibre (inclusive of soluble and insoluble) must be added per 1,000 calories consumed (by a healthy individual). Per day, it is recommended to take five whole servings or a handful each of fruit, vegetable, greens and whole grams. Even onion and tomato which are added into sambar or curry count as vegetables. In a plate, quarter of it must be whole grain cereal and the remaining must consist whole grams/pulses, vegetables and greens. In one of the studies we did, we controlled water intake to 200 ml within the meal. We observed that there was a dip of 25-30 milligrams in postprandial or post meal blood sugar. So, limit the intake of water during the meals. If one has a strong family history of diabetes or obesity, always prefer having fruit in between meals and never along with the meal. If you are a diabetic, never replace your meal with a fruit. For dinner, only eat until you are 50-75 per cent full, so that there is enough time for digestion. Eat at least two hours before you sleep.For all health queries, write to healthexpresschn@gmail.com"

This order allegedly from the captain to a flight purser on an Air India flight about to take off from Bengaluru for Kolkata on Monday triggered a major fight. They almost came to blows in full view of passengers. Air India immediately grounded both, and the flight was delayed by two hours as a replacement captain and purser had to be found.AI may conduct random drug tests on crew While pre and post-flight breath analyser (BA) tests are conducted by all airlines, the Maharaja is planning to pioneer this step in India to enhance flight safety. Crew members who are found to have a drug abuse problem could be barred from operating flights till they are completely give the same up for good.NEW DELHI: Air India will clamp down on the practice of pilots getting meals from home and then asking cabin crew members to heat it up or sometimes asking them to prepare a salad and even wash tiffin box afterwards. The decision was taken on Wednesday when TOI reported how a captain and flight purser of a Bengaluru-Kolkata flight this Monday had a fight when the former reportedly asked the latter to rinse his tiffin. AI has grounded both the crew members.AI chairman Ashwani Lohani said: This nonsense has to stop and will stop. Lohani has taken a very strict view of the fight on Bengaluru-Kolkata flight and both the crew members have been summoned to the airlines Delhi HQ on Thursday for questioning.A senior cabin crew member said: AI pilots often bring home tiffin boxes on board and ask crew to heat and serve that meal. There are often requests from pilots like asking crew to chop onion, roast almonds and cashews in honey and make cheese toasts and fruit salad. All this must stop as cabin crew are on board for passenger service and safety and are not personal cooks of pilots.On the other hand, pilots of private Indian airlines do not do this. Why so much drama in AI? the crew member added.Earlier this year, AI had barred its pilots from ordering special meals for themselves and asked them to take the regular meals ordered by the airline. Flight caterers had complained it was a regular practice to get special meal requests from AI pilots.AI director (operations) captain Amitabh Singh had written a mail pilots this March saying: It has been brought to (his) notice that flight crew are ordering special meal/s which is against rules. The only crew, who for medical reasons, may order for special meals, (that is) food recommended by doctor.

Brinjal and ladies finger are sold at 60 a kg. Homemakers are shocked at the prices of coriander leaves and ginger which are commanding 50 a bundle (as against 20 last week), and 250 a kg (as against 160 last week). The price of green chilli has doubled at 200 a kg.To make things worse, the price of garlic has also shown an increase this week, selling at 150 a kg (fine variety) as against 100.Going by the present market trend, the catering dynamics have changed phenomenally at not only star hotels in Tirupati and Nellore, but also with all the catering units attached to marriage halls.At a star hotel in Tirupati, the cost of a single plate has been hiked from 450 to 525. The middle class families performing the betrothal and marriage functions are forced to cut down the quantum of vegetables in cooking and serving to the guests.Strange, we are cooking as per the dictates of our customers. Cutting down the quantum of vegetables will result in poor taste of stuff such as sambhar, kurma and vegetable rice and curries. We are helpless, though we know the guests would feel it bad as they search for vegetables in their plates, Mani, an experienced hand in catering business in Chittoor said.Villain of the pieceAdding that one particular thing  coriander leaves  is playing the villain. It has the capacity to supplant any defect in catering, but our customers are not listening to us.Apart from functions, the hotel industry is dampening the mood of customers, by cutting down the quantity of vegetables in the servings. Instead of two or three curries, the serving is limited to one in most restaurants.Homemakers complain that though they took a hard decision to adjust things with the greens twice a week, they were disappointed as greens too had jumped their price tag of last week. Some vendors are dishonestly splitting a bundle of greens into two to make a fast buck."

While restricting pilots from getting outside food, say a home-cooked meal, for consumption inflight is not possible, AI is contemplating asking them not to seek crew help in any way like heating up the meal for consuming the same. These moves come after a spat between a pilot and flight purser reportedly on the issue of washing a tiffin box that the captain had got from home when he finished his meal.Cabin crew is for the comfort and safety of passengers. We have asked for meal scheduling to be decided before flight so that accordingly the same can be served to pilots inflight. Also the number of visits by cabin crew to cockpits should be as per laid down norms and not more than that.

This week, the prices of fruits and vegetables are higher than that of last week.A little rain last week and it has affected the prices of the fruits. When TOI spoke to a few vendors in the market, they said that it was because of the rains that the prices have been affected.Last week, the rates of fruits were less when compared with what they are being sold for now. For instance, 10 days ago watermelons were sold for Rs 10 per kil. Now they cost Rs 30 per kilo. Musk melon was only Rs 20 10 days ago, but today one will have to pay as much as Rs 35 for a kilo. Even prices of all-season fruits have increased. Apple, for instance, costs anywhere between Rs 150 and Rs 180 per kilo today. It was priced in the range of Rs 120 to Rs 150 10 days ago.With temperatures soaring as high as 42 degrees, demand for seasonal fruits like watermelon , muskmelon, mango and papaya , which are considered tradionally to have cooling properties, have only increased, much to the delight of fruit sellers.Mohammad Ali, a fruit seller who has a stall in Chandigarh said, ""The demand of seasonal fruits has really peaked this time, as they are more affordable than the fruits that are available all through the year, like apples and bananas.""Kanta Devi, a vendor who has a fruit stall in Sector 8, said, ""We have stopped keeping litchis because they are no longer in demand and it is almost the end of the season for this fruit. People prefer all varieties of melons these days.""Health experts point out that to avoid diarrhea, sunburns, and heat strokes, it is essential to consume seasonal fruits and vegetables. These are filled with essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that can help in beating the heat, they said.""Eating raw onions and drinking raw onion juice are very beneficial in the summer season. They not only aid in digestion, but also help us keep our body cool,"" said Kamlesh, a fruit seller in Sector 26 market."

But if you are MasterChef Australia contestant Sandeep Pandit, thats exactly what youd do. With ancestral roots in Kashmir, this Bengaluru boy wowed the judges with his preparation of lemon rice, lemon pepper chicken and raita, much to the delight of south Indians. Who knew that the classic lemon rice would earn him the perfect score (30/30) and an immunity pin.Taste of two statesSandeeps difficult childhood had a big role to play in his cooking. He was forced to move from Kashmir to Bengaluru in 1990. Sandeep says his childhood ended abruptly when he turned nine. We migrated from Kashmir to Jammu at the peak of militancy in early 1990. My mother was employed with HMT and was given a job at Bengaluru. My parents, my sister and I went to Bengaluru and the rest of the extended family stayed at Jammu.I still remember that truck journey and watching the last of the melting snow as we were going away, leaving the mountain passes of Kashmir. It was a rough phase, with no money, very limited resources but a strong will to survive. We were encouraged to remember our Kashmiri roots and language, and were also asked to respect the local south Indian culture, he shares. What started as a necessary chore to help his mother at the age of nine, turned into his happy place.Sandeep has featured both Kashmiri and south Indian dishes on MasterChef. He prepared a Kashmiri thali during his auditions. Kashmiri cooking has different nuances, depending upon the communities in Kashmir. The uniqueness of the Kashmiri Pandit communitys food is the absence of onions, garlic or tomatoes in the dishes. As surprising as it may sound, even the meat dishes do not have onions, garlic or tomatoes. For example, the traditional rogan josh is made with a blend of spices, curd etc.The other unique aspects are the garam masala  which is cumin based  and the fact, that we do not traditionally use coriander seeds (powder) in our spice blend; fennel seeds powder (saunf) are used instead. This gives the dishes an additional aniseed flavour dimension and makes it unique, he says.But trolls have slammed Sandeep saying that he cooks only curry. The man of the moment, however, is unperturbed by such criticism. His focus to showcase the versatility of Indian cooking, which he understood when he had his first idli-sambar in Bengaluru, is unwavered. Everyone has the right to criticise. Our cuisine is too broad and complex to be subjected to one word  curry. I am trying to cook on the basis of the brief given to us. I am just fortunate that my motherlands cuisine is so versatile that in most of the briefs I can create a dish from the Indian cuisine, he says.One with his artFor Sandeep, cooking is spiritual. His eyes welled up and he folded his hands when his lachcha paratha won over celebrity chef Rick Stein. My family has always taught us to respect food (Ma Annapurna). Food, to me, is not just nourishment, its spiritual. I have always been a fan of Rick Stein and have watched most of his shows. Stein came to my bench and lovingly tasted the food. I was moved by the joy on his face, as he watched me cook Indian cuisine with an Italian Mystery Box.When they selected me for the tasting, I saw that joy again on the faces of the judges and Rick Stein. I was moved to tears. That entire experience had a spiritual notion to it, because I had just created something taught by my mother to give happiness to another person, and in this case, someone I revered as a Guru, he shares.From not having a fridge at home to cooking with the choicest ingredients in the MasterChef kitchen, life has come a full circle for Sandeep. He wishes to be associated with food, through cooking or any other engagement. The world is my oyster now.Follow Sandep on Instagram: @sandeep_cooksKeeping in touch with foodFrom not having a fridge at home to cooking with the choicest ingredients in the MasterChef kitchen, life has come a full circle for Sandeep.

But, theres more to the deep-fried snack. A testimony to this is The Samosa Factory, one of the pioneers in introducing the city to the delectable mini samosas. During a recent visit to their in-house unit at Anna Nagar to understand the fascinating and intricate making process of this snack, we took a quick bite and sunk our teeth into the soft centre of their samosa, and what followed was an explosion of flavours.Orange signage boards reading The Samosa Factory, dot the streets of Anna Nagar, Vepery, and Kilpauk  a reflection of how the brand has stood the test of time and garnered fame among patrons for its tiny snack.In 2007, on his way to work, my father Arun Shah happened to notice a shopkeeper making samosas on the roadside.A carton with 16 pieces of samosas ispriced at `100  D SampathkumarThe unhygienic surrounding in which it was prepared turned him off. He brought the man home, gave him orders for our home parties, and eventually decided to turn it into a business based on feedback from relatives. The Samosa Factory was launched in 2007 in Shanti Colony, Anna Nagar. Its been a wonderful journey of 12 years with eight kiosks in different parts of the city, said Arjun Shah, the second-generation owner.The makingTheir factory unit at Anna Nagar is where the samosas are prepared and delivered to the counters in different outlets. There are 10 workers involved in different stages of production. Firstly, the dough (maida) is kneaded. Its rolled out into flat, thin rotis and slightly charred on a tawa. Then, they are cut into different shapes based on the requirement.The strips have to be elastic to ease the folding process. Meanwhile, the marination for the stuffing is prepared. The onions are sliced, mixed with other vegetables like carrot and cabbage, and placed in separate trays based on the flavours. A group of women meticulously fold the dough strips, stuff it with spices, and take them for frying. The folded pockets are sauted in boiling oil until it turns golden-brown. The final product is packed in cartons.Evolving businessThe desi mini samosas have a certain size. The Mexican and Chinese-flavoured samosas are bigger. Jain samosas are made without onion and garlic. Weve expanded our service to school and hospital canteens, and offices. After delivery services, the footfall has come down and the online orders have picked up. Were adapting to the evolving style of business. However, hygienic, fresh and pocket-friendly snacking is our motto, he shared.Served hotOn an average, 8,000 to 10,000 samosas get sold in a day. The semi-fried samosas are distributed to the kiosks. The representative at the shop fries and serves them hot to the customer, on demand. The Samosa Factory has an extensive menu with options such as sandwiches, spring rolls, cutlets and kebabs.The chaat legacyThe business of food is not new to the entrepreneur. Were told that his grandfather JB Shah was the first to bring in the concept of chaat to the city in 1969. He owned a shop called Milan. The pav bhaji concept was also introduced to the patrons for the first time. However, with time and commitments, the shop shut its front door. Patrons who drop by the kiosks remember my grandfather. Were taking it slow with limited options. We will eventually move into south Chennai when we have the necessary bandwidth. Mass production is something were working on.We also have a dark kitchen  mainly for delivery services to pick up orders. The production fluctuates on different days. Festivals like Ramzan keeps us busy. Vacation time is relatively dull and once schools reopen, the speed picks up. Were planning to expand our services to co-working spaces in the future, said Arjun. The shop is located at 177, AH block, Third Street, Auroville Colony, Shanti Colony, Anna Nagar. For details, call: 9962260985"

These are probably the words that come to your mind to describe Kashmiri cuisine. It was evident from the interior decor at Navaratna restaurant in Le Royal Meridien to the delicacies they served. Small portions of Kashmiri spices are on display. Cushion chairs, copper cutlery and paintings of sceneries in Kashmir make us feel cosy and comfortable.Chef ShivaMeat expectationsWe start our meal with nadur monji  a starter made of lotus stem and rice flour. The lotus stem is ground along with flour and spices into a coarse mixture and made into a tikki. While we let the flavours burst in our mouth, we are served juicy cubes of paneer tandoor marinated. The appetisers are served with a dip made of caramelised onions and raddish.Chef Shiva, the brain behind this menu, tells us, Earlier, I worked in New Delhi. My familiarity with north Indian cuisine got better when I decided to visit Kashmir two years back. The Valley is known for its home-style cooking. The neighbours were amiable and let me inside their houses to get a glimpse of their native practices. Ive picked a few of my favourites.Touch of nativityAfter a brief pause, were served breads accompanied with ghushtab  minced ball curry with mild flavours. The base of the curry is tomato and Kashmiri red chilli. The chilli is roasted, boiled and blanched to lessen the spice and add colour to the gravy. The second important ingredient is saffron. Its roasted, boiled, filtered and the liquid is added to induce the scent. Saffron and Kashmiri red chilli form the essence of authentic Kashmiri cuisine.Lamb and chicken are the common preference in the hills. People grind their ingredients in traditional equipment and store them for months. It doesnt get spoilt because of the temperature. All it requires is marinating the meat with pepper and salt and grilling it in a tandoor. Longer the process, better the taste, shares Shiva.Bringing a sweet closure to this flavourful meal is phirni. With a moderate consistency and sweetness, a final coating of saffron made it visually appealing and gave it a traditional wrap.The Kashmiri festival at Navaratna will conclude on June 30."

The word, which is a portmanteau of lunch and dinner is a trend catching up, like its more popular forebearer, the brunch. Introducing it in Kerala is the Thai Soul restaurant at Grand Hyatt Kochi Bolgatty which every Saturday is hosting a Bangkok street food inspired market from 4 to 11 pm.Supattra Boonsrang, Chef de Cuisine, and her team have put together an exhaustive assortment of the cuisine's most veritable fares. The spread is accompanied on Saturdays by food carts specially imported from Thailand to replicate the street food markets of Bangkok. Lined next to each other, these carts dish out delicious portions of dumplings, satays and rice bowls giving you a sense of the vibrant Asian and Indian influence on the cuisine.Sous Chef Surachai Arsarat recollects his childhood in Northern Thailand as he talks about khao soi gai (noodles with yellow curry) being served at the first cart. He remembers coming home to a hearty pot prepared by his mother. The dish is a soulful bowl of soupy ramen with coconut milk infused in aromatic curry powder.Topped with crispy fried noodles, it comes with the option of tender chicken or duck breast to go along. Right next to khao soi gai is the cart serving the quintessential Thai papaya salad which occupies a sacred spot in the pantheon of the country's cuisine. Prepared right in front of your eyes, the lush and crunchy salad is both tart and sweet, and a generous garnish of peanuts works perfectly to cut the acidity giving it an amazing balance.The other four carts serve an array of smoked, steamed and sauteed treats, of which bite-sized skewers of chicken satay are particularly rewarding. The meat is marinated for over six hours before being charred on the grill and tastes best with a rich peanut paste dip that adds a mild sweetness to the smoky flavour. And as you ponder over choices for your next helping, you will notice a waiter going around with clear packs of red slush hanging from a bamboo shaft on his shoulder. This is Pattaya packet, a zesty refreshment made of cranberry juice, strawberry puree, lemongrass and galangal sold on the streets of Bangkok by vendors.Apart from the six food carts that do more than enough to please your appetite, the indoor restaurant, with two live counters, will spoil you with options. The buffet is extensive with at least eight varieties of starters, of which laab hed, a spicy chewy mushroom salad with mint and spring onion and goong tord grob, surprisingly moist deep-fried prawns are worth mentioning.The main course options run well into double digits and Pad Thai, the other iconic dish of the cuisine has been given a dedicated counter. These glassy flat noodles with a striking nutty relish can be made in multiple variations according to your liking. Add four types of fragrant savoury Thai curries, an Asian duck, fish and crab preparation into the bargain and you are set for a very satisfying dining experience.Just as you think you are sated, your eyes spot the dessert section. You can't help but dig in, there is enough and more to cater to your sweet cravings. Try the uber authentic khao neaw ma-maung (sweet sticky rice topped with sweetened coconut milk and ripe mango) or the tab tim krob (water chestnut dumpling in syrup served with coconut milk) or bring out the child in you with num keang sai, a shaved ice popsicle dowsed in Thai tropical fruit syrup.The experience is not just limited to food. Reach early and you can enjoy a dip in the pool overlooking the beautiful Vembanad lake. There is live music and a kids activity area as well, everything for just under `1,500."
2019-06-22,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/chandigarh-electricity-water-supply-down-prices-of-seasonal-vegetables-fruits-go-up-5795284/,"Chandigarh: Electricity, water supply down, prices of seasonal vegetables, fruits go up","(Written by Jaspreet Singh)AdvertisingWith the onset of peak summers, and monsoons expected to hit the region by mid-July, the Tricity residents are braving heat, poor water supply, frequent unscheduled power-cuts and surge in prices of seasonal vegetable and fruits. The ongoing heatwave has also hit the flower industry, which is otherwise a booming business here. According to the India Meteorological Departments forecast, isolated rains may bring slight relief next week, but there will not be much difference in the maximum and minimum temperature.20 per cent rise in fruits and vegetables pricesDue to the scorching sun, vendors say, vegetables are rotting early. As a result, a marginal increase in prices of seasonal vegetables and fruits are adding to the residents woes. There is about 20 per cent increase in the wholesale price of vegetables this month. Retail hike is only because of the heat wave and drastic change in climate. Vegetables corrode within a day because of the heat wave. Thus, it is having an adverse impact on the sellers too, because they have to sell the products within two days, otherwise the vegetables become stale and rots, said Chander Shekhar, Sector 26 mandi supervisor for vegetables. Abbas, a native of Jammu and Kashmir, who deals in wholesale vegetables in Chandigarh said, The price of onion is rising . Earlier the onion was Rs12 per kg, while it is now Rs16 per kg. Chaman, who sells cherries, said, You can see how the hot climate is affecting the cherries. I always try to keep fruits under shade but it is not possible to save the cherries in this hot weather.Flower supply and demand hitThere is a sharp dip in demand of flowers, these days. Although there is not much increase in price, but because flowers are rotting in a days time, our wastage has doubled. Also, since it is not the wedding season, flowers demand is minimal. Hot weather further affects our business these days, since people do not get out of their homes. We have to extensively use air-conditioners to keep our flowers fresh. It adds to our expenditure, says Karan, a florist in Sector 35.AdvertisingDue to the ongoing heat wave, customers are very less. About 70 per cent of the flowers that are coming this season are of poor quality. It is leading to a lot of wastage. Also, school vacations are going on and many people are out of the city on vacations with their families, said another florist.Maximum price of a best quality rose is Rs 300 and it varies according to the quality of the flowers. A lesser quality of rose is priced at Rs 100. The other prices of rose vary from 150 to 250. Similarly, carnation flower, which is one of the favourites of the buyers and blooms the most in summers, has recorded a dip in its price because of the hot weather. Earlier, a bundle of carnation flower cost Rs 250, but now it costs 100 to 150. The price of Marigold in April was Rs100 per kg in April and the price nose-dived to Rs 50 to 60 per kg in June. However, it is expected to shoot up to Rs 150 to Rs 250 per kg in July.Electricity and water pangsWe are suffering from extremely inadequate water supply. Due to the hot weather, the demand for water peaks in the months of June and July. However, the supply in our sector is very erratic these days. The water-pressure is also low, making it difficult for people living on the first and the second floors, said BS Jatwani, a resident of Sector 38-C.Harminder Singh, a resident of Kharar said, This year we are facing acute power shortage. A lot of unscheduled power cuts are happening. A few days ago, we did not receive power supply from 10 pm to 6 am. Unscheduled power-cuts have become a daily affair in Kharar.In the absence of adequate water supply, residents in several areas are depending on water-tankers. We hardly get any water supply in our area. We have to depend on water tankers. Many days, our children have to go to the school without bathing, because there is no water. We can not afford bottled-water. Thus, we depend on water-tankers. We boil the water we get from there and then use it for drinking, said Sudesh Kumar, a resident of Ram Darbar."
2019-06-26,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vegetable-prices-soar/article28159800.ece,Vegetable prices soar,"A routine trip to the market is increasingly digging a deeper hole in the pocket, with prices of many vegetables soaring.Coriander leaves, a kitchen staple, has turned into a luxury in the city, with a bunch now touching the 100 mark. Owing to short supply, coriander leaves costs 70 a bunch even in the wholesale market.An entire bunch of coriander usually costs not more than 20. But when I handed over 10, the shopkeeper gave me exactly three stalks, said Chandramathi, a resident of Banashankari.Other vegetables too have become expensive, more so beans and brinjal. A kilogram of beans costs in the range of 90 to 120, and brinjal 100 to 110 per kg. Most of the gourds too are trading at the higher end.The only saving grace has been the relatively low prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes  staple items in most homes. However, garlic, another widely consumed vegetable, has also turned dear at 130/kilo. In the case of lemons, each one costs 5 to 8.Though the monsoon has set in in the State, farmers are yet to take to sowing. The rains that the State is receiving now will take another month or so to have an impact, said G. Srinivasan, member, HOPCOMS.A punishing summer, high temperatures and a severe drought over the past three months have caused stress on the production of vegetables and greens.Most borewells have dried up. Water scarcity is so acute that most farmers have been watering the farms with tanker water. This has only shot up the input cost, said G. Muniswamy Gowda, a vegetable farmer in Devanahalli.Also what has hit vegetable supply in the city is the drought in Tamil Nadu.We get a bulk of the coriander from the Hosur region. We also get Lady Fingers and other vegetables from Tamil Nadu, which is reeling under water shortage, cutting off most supply and pushing the prices upwards, said a senior procurement official from a prominent retail chain in the city.But there is hope. The onset of monsoon and the upcoming Ashaada month, considered inauspicious for holding any programme, is expected to bring down prices over the next three weeks."

Think of Kerala food and sadhya is all that comes to mind. The richness of coconut milk, the fragrance and sweetness of cardamom and the mild proportions of spices lend a native touch to the recipes. At a food festival organised by Hotel Regenta Central Deccan, home chef Saraswathi N prepared an extensive menu with delicacies from the state. She was invited as a guest to the hotel following a feature coverage in The New Indian Express on her recordbreaking feat of attempting 108 dishes in an hour a month back.Saraswathi N recently set arecord of cooking 108 dishesin one hour  DebadattaMallickThe interiors of Olives restaurant at the hotel was decked up with photos portraying festivities of the state. Kathakali and Theyyam masks were displayed on the wall. Single strands of garland were suspended from the ceiling. Food was prepared and kept in earthen pots. Saraswathi was busy interacting and explaining the traditional cuisine to the guests. We began our meal with drumstick soup made from the inner pulp and seasoned with mustard seeds. The base gives it a creamy texture. Crispy mango and onion pakodas were served as accompaniments. The idea is to serve authentic items with a touch of fusion.Most of the ingredients are sourced locally except for a few that are brought from Kerala. Im trying to make aviyal out of red spinach but its hard to get it here. Even the raw mango here is less tangy compared to said Saraswathi who runs a restaurant in Thrissur with her younger son. Back in her hometown, Saraswathi is popular for her eggless and multigrain cakes. From vada moru kootan to puliserry there are around 15 dishes in the spread.All these can be eaten as accompaniments with Kerala red rice. To break the monotony, the chef instance, erissery pachadis made parottas with mildly-spiced moilee were served. Sweet unniappam has been a hot-seller among the crowd. I love cooking for gatherings as it runs in my genes. Ive imbibed traditional Saraswathi. Among the other highlights in the menu were idichakka thoran, jackfruit ring biryani, and kaya tholi thoran. Snacks like banana chips, chakka varatti, jackfruit chips and sweet banana chips were also available for quick bites.The desserts for the day were pazhamuruku, elaneer payasam and idichu pizhiya payasam. Jaggery, coconut milk and rice are the three our desser t s. Pazhamuruku is p r e p a red by steam cooking banana in jaggery syrup. Ive also made a fusion of pal ada, elaneer special one is idichu pizhiya payasam made of rice, coconut milk and jaggery. This sweet is lord Ayyappas favourite and usually given to devotees as prasadam at temples, she said. The sweets were satisfying and easily the best part of the meal.

2019-06-28,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-many-chillies-can-you-name-join-kunal-vijayakar-on-a-spicy-trail/story-P2z4JuJwrnvuS6ajwo0ICM.html,How many chillies can you name? Join Kunal Vijayakar on a spicy trail,"Very often in life, the effects of small things prove to be inversely proportional to their size. I dont mean to get mysterious or philosophical. But take for example the chilli. I often gawk in awe at this tender, slender little fruit, and marvel at its huge gustatory impact on food.When it comes to Indian food, there is hardly any cuisine that doesnt use chilli or at least chilli powder. Could you imagine cooking without fresh green chillies? I dont think so. We have so embraced their flavour and piquancy, that weve quite forgotten that they are not native to India. Until 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed here, India used no chilli in its food. I cannot imagine what pizza without capsicum tasted like in the Vedic period oops, just kidding.There are now many different varieties grown in India. All chillies contain a biologically active ingredient called capsaicin, which is the cause of their heat and which stimulates the palate and increases our blood circulation. Thats why some believe that chillies are good for low blood pressure, the heart and our respiratory system.Chillies also make you sweat, which in turn has a cooling effect, which is why they are so popular in tropical regions like ours. That seems a bit warped to me; I hate to sweat. But Im guessing its true. Each type of chilli has its own profile and heat level, and while some are used for heat, others are used for their complexity of flavour.Green chillies are unripe or fresh, hot if eaten with the seeds, and are used for their acidity and raw grassy flavour. I love slitting a long green chilli and adding it to scrambled eggs. It adds dimension and elevates the flavour of the creamy eggs. Chopped green chillies ground to a paste with coriander and mint is a chutney that can be used as a marinade, a base or just by itself.When tempered with ginger, garlic, onion, tomato and masalas, the same chutney makes a great green chicken or mutton curry. A simple green chilli paste is a key ingredient in most Mughlai cooking. It makes the flavours more complex. I cannot imagine a Qorma or Biryani without green chilli paste. When you add salt and lemon to green chilli paste, it can be stored and used in many vegetarian dishes, like Vatana na Ghughra, Khatta Dhokla and Doodhi Muthia.We Indians also use a large variety of dried red chillies. In fact, there are different ones, used differently, in different parts of the country.The Reshampatti from Gujarat are short, broad and dark red. They are medium in pungency and used in powdered form or stuffed as pickles. They add a vibrant red colour to food.The Kashmiri Chilli is known to everyone for its flaming colour and for being non-spicy. Its what makes a Rogan Josh that bright, brilliant red without heat.The Mundu chilli is round and button-like and native to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Its only slightly spicy but has a unique flavour that makes it indispensable to the cuisine, when tempered with curry leaves, mustard and methi seeds and added, for instance, to curd rice.The Byadagi chilli is grown in Karnataka and no Karwari Fish Curry is complete without this dry, long, crinkly fellow. The chilli is pungent and imparts a bright red colour to curries and gravies. The Byadagi chilli really comes into its own when combined with coconut.The reason Andhra food roars with spice is because of the Guntur Sannam chilli. This one can in fact be deadly and that is why, though India grows a lot of it, very little is exported to the West. Demand for the Guntur chilli comes mainly from other Asian countries. Andhra uses the Guntur with passion and fervour. No Natu Kodi Kura (spicy Andhra chicken curry with coconut) or Guntur Kodi Vepudu (spicy chicken fry) or the Mamsam Pulusu (spicy mutton) would taste the same without Guntur chilli.Mathania chillies, named after a town in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, have a powerful aroma and flavour but are not that spicy. This is the chilli that brings the laal to Laal Maas.The Sankeshwari mirchi from Kolhapur is used in combination with other chillies to make chilli powder. Its a bright orange and is also used in a lot of central Maharashtrian cuisine.Little known outside Goa, the Titimiti is a bright orange, inch-long thing that is the reason a true Goan Prawn Curry looks and tastes the way it does.And then finally there is the Naga Bhut Jolokia, or Ghost Chilli. It is one of the worlds hottest, is used both fresh and dried, and is the key spice in a Naga Smoked Pork.These are just a few of the chillies we use in India. Overall this fruit is so adored that the Lavangi Mirchi is not only a bright red, spicy, detonative chilli from Kolhapur, but also a term used to describe a sensual, smouldering woman. Hows that for spice?First Published: Jun 28, 2019 20:10 IST"

The sector provides livelihood to close to half of Indias population and it is very important for inclusive growth, which also matters for this governments agenda of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. Sometime back, I did a study on how much decline in poverty was witnessed when there was 1% growth in agriculture and 1% growth in non-agriculture. I found that agriculture growth had much more significant impact than non-agriculture growth. We should recognise some of the positive changes that have taken place in the agricultural sector. In the 1970s, we were producing 1 kg of food per person per day  and food here includes not just foodgrains, but also fruits, vegetables, milk etc. At that time, our population was about 56 crore. Now, that has gone up to more than 130 crore, but our per capita food production today is roughly 1.74 kg food per day. This has its own implications, as we are no longer living in scarcity.Why Ramesh Chand?AdvertisingA member of the NITI Aayog, Ramesh Chand is seen as key to the Narendra Modi government driving agriculture sector reforms, especially in its second innings. A farm economist of repute, he has been an advocate of dismantling provisions under the Essential Commodities Act and APMC laws that enable restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports, besides preventing large retailers from buying directly from farmers. These views may find resonance in a context where food inflation and shortages have ceased to be a major worry, with the focus now shifting to addressing agrarian distress and doubling farmers incomesHARISH DAMODARAN: Do you think the Narendra Modi government in its first innings was excessively pro-consumer and not pro-producer?I doubt the government was pro-consumer at the cost of producers. We draw this conclusion only because producer prices have risen at a very low rate after 2014-15, when this government came to power. But agricultural prices historically move in cycles. During 2006 to 2012, there was a sharp increase in global agricultural prices, which fell just around when this government came. In 2012, they were at their peak. But still if one looks at the terms of trade for agriculture  the prices that farmers pay and what prices they receive  these had been improving up to 2015-16. Only in the last two years, the prices paid by farmers have increased at a slightly higher rate compared to the prices received. But overall, the terms of trade figure for 2018-19 is higher than 2011-12 This government has tried hard to keep these prices high with a new formula for fixing MSP (minimum support price) and also through procurement. So it is a combination of factors  international prices, demand and supply cycle  that is responsible for the current agrarian distress. It is very difficult for the government to influence prices beyond a point.AdvertisingHARISH DAMODARAN: As you say, the scarcity of the past is over. Is it time now to scrap the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), export controls and other restrictions that are clearly anti-farmer?The farmer is a consumer too. But I agree, the sectors interest today lies in scrapping these restrictions. In the last (June 15) meeting of the NITI Aayogs Governing Council, we proposed some reforms, including on the ECA, APMC (agricultural produce market committee) reforms and enabling contract farming. The Prime Minister announced that a high-power committee of chief ministers would be constituted to examine these reforms. In 2016, the Union government passed an order, after which there are no real restrictions on food commodities with regards to stocking, movement or exports. But people say that a similar order was issued in 2002, but when prices increased in 2006, the controls were brought back. So they believe that unless the Act changes, the government will always find ways to bring back control if things are seen as going against the consumer. The NITI Aayog has suggested a way out  classifying commodities into two categories: foodstuffs and others. There are some commodities such as drugs where the ECA is needed, but not in case of agri produce. If the ECA has to be used, let us clearly define the conditions. If, say, there is a 20% decline in production because of natural calamity of an extraordinary order, or a war, only then can the provisions be brought back.RAVISH TIWARI: How do you deal with political opposition to these reforms being suggested?The supply situation is much better than in the past. The need for ECA to stop hoarding or black marketing does not arise in the case of most commodities, where even exports are happening. When we meet politicians, we give them examples by asking them if they ever felt the need to have ECA on eggs or milk (which are non-perishable and cannot be hoarded). Price volatility may be extreme in onions, but not in most other commodities. The best way to address volatility is through buffer stocks, not by ECA. Recently, West Bengal, for example, imposed movement controls in potatoes under ECA, but that only did a lot of harm to its farmers. Todays India and its agriculture situation are very different.PRABHUDATTA MISHRA: How does the NITI Aayog plan to make MSP more effective on the ground?Everybody wants only the Centre to act. But agriculture is a state subject. It can only be the joint responsibility of the Centre and the states. The total production of all commodities where MSPs exist will be about 300 million tonnes. If the Centre is taking care of rice and wheat, whose production is about 200 million tonnes, cant all the states combined take care of the remaining one-third production? Under PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan), states were given the option to implement MSP by procuring up to 30 per cent of the produce (similar to what the Centre is doing for rice and wheat). If in the process of procurement and disposal, the states incurred a loss, the Centre would bear it up to 30-35%. But the states did this only at a very small level. When the financial cost is being borne by the Central government, the states should come forward and take advantage of PM-AASHA by putting in place a procurement mechanism.HARISH DAMODARAN: But instead of physical procurement, why cant we have direct benefit transfer and simply pay the difference between MSP and market prices into farmers accounts?The NITI Aayog has suggested this as well. If you take the MSP of wheat today, it is actually 30% higher than the international price. So if you procure wheat at MSP, you will only distort the market and exports will be hit, as domestic price is very high. Stocks, too, will pile. Direct benefit transfer is a very good idea and under PM-AASHA, we have the option of physical procurement as well as provision of deficiency price payments. In this case, we dont have to look at the price received by each and every farmer. Farmers just have to register the area they are sowing under different crops before the seasons start on a portal. For every state, the harvest season is defined. So, at the end of the season, we monitor the actual price received by farmers in every district. Every district has 3-4 mandis. We take the average price at these mandis for the produce of Fair Average Quality. If that price is lower than the MSP, the difference can be paid for the area that has been reported by the farmer on the portal and taking the average yield for the crop in the district. I think the Madhya Pradesh governments Bhavantar programme, despite the criticism it faced from some economists, was a good initiative. Today, the Food Corporation of India incurs a cost of Rs 700-800 per quintal in the process of paying Rs 1,600 as MSP to farmers. That can be avoided through direct payment of the price difference.PRASANTA SAHU: Following the implementation of PM-KISAN, should the government now use this scheme to replace fertiliser and other input subsidies to farmers?Income support and subsidies are two different things. PM-KISAN is the former. Subsidy was originally meant to promote the use of a particular input to ensure increase in productivity. When Dr C Rangarajan was the chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council (2009-2014), he asked me to find out the impact on the countrys food security and agriculture production if fertiliser subsidy was completely withdrawn and it was sold at market price. At that time, I calculated that if we do it suddenly in a knee-jerk manner, there will be 10% decline in foodgrain production. I look at PM-KISAN in a different way. It was brought in as some sort of income support, as crop prices remained low, and farmers in many places could not get the MSP. Subsidies are a different issue and they exist in many countries. We must try to make subsidies more efficient than they currently are. Subsidies in water and power are serious issues and must be addressed. Agricultural power subsidy for the country as a whole is about Rs 1 lakh crore. We did calculations to find how many irrigations a farmer would apply in case he is charged for power or if he is not charged anything. They will use 40% less irrigation on paddy alone if power is fully priced. Also in most cases, the yield will not fall.SANDEEP SINGH: Rural consumption is slowing down. The government had talked of doubling farmers income. Where are we on that?It is not proper to use agriculture and rural synonymously today. In rural India, only one-third of the income now comes from agriculture and two-third from non-agricultural activities. The last five years have been unique. For the first time in 65 to 70 years, we have had five consecutive years of less than average rainfall and the current one could even be the sixth. But Despite that, the annual growth rate of the value added in agriculture has been 2.9%, which is not bad. If growth rate becomes 5%, prices will crash and farmer incomes may decline by 30-40%. The slowdown in rural demand may be due to many reasons. One of it could be that loan waivers have reduced the flow of bank credit to rural areas. Industry people were happy when rural demand was good. But much of this demand was debt-based, with people taking loans to buy commodities. But families dont have internal income to buy resources. As far as agriculture is concerned, for doubling farmers income, you need it to rise by over 10% every year. In the last three years, the growth rate, according to my calculation, has been 6%. We can still achieve the target if we are able to do something to prices. If farmers get 10% more than what they are getting, the income elasticity with respect to price would be 1.6. Then, farmers incomes will increase by 16%.RAVISH TIWARI: How can we improve the current level of private and public investment in the agriculture sector?If you look at public investment in agriculture as percentage of the GDP, the latest available data for 2016-17 shows it at 2.35%. For most of the recent period, it was 3%. Almost 85% of public investment in agriculture comes from the states. The Centre invests about 15% and that includes investment on irrigation and agriculture technology. Within private investment, the bulk of it comes from farmers themselves. If investment has to go up, that should now come from the corporate sector, which is currently very low. That is why the Prime Minister said last week in Parliament that corporates should not only see investments in agriculture in terms of making and selling tractors. They should make investments in agriculture, including in backend extension and working directly with farmers. This government wants to create an enabling environment for corporates to invest in agriculture. That will also require making changes in the regulatory environment, particularly facilitating contract farming.RAVISH TIWARI: The private sector can invest in technology. But given the kind of protests against GM technology, how can the private sector be confident about investing?GM technology is not the only technology through which countries have made progress in agriculture. There is public sensitivity about GM technology. But the biggest damage was done when Jairam Ramesh (former environment minister) took the issue of whether GM technology should be adopted to the streets and not leaving it to be decided by an expert body. On GM crops, the NITI Aayogs stance has been  there should not be a blanket ban on the technology. It should not be encouraged in areas where we are able to get success through conventional means. The other thing that we emphasised was to finance public sector research in GM technology in a big way. This was mainly to allay the fears of people that private sector developers were charging hefty royalty. Some of our public sector research institutions were very close to developing a GM chickpea. Moreover, there are many more opportunities for the private sector other than GM. That includes GE or gene editing, which is different from modification (through introduction of alien genes).RAVISH TIWARI: Cattle trade rules enforced two years back disrupted the market. Do such rules help farmers or create trouble for them?AdvertisingThe livestock sector grew by more than 6% in the last five years. If there were so many problems, it would not have been growing so fast. On the other hand, the crop sector, particularly cereal, oilseeds and pulses, is growing at just around 1.15%. This is why the overall agricultural growth rate comes down to 2.9%. But on the whole, I would say that Indian agriculture has now reached a stage where more the intervention by government, the lower will be the growth. The more the sector is liberalised, the higher will be the growth rate."
2019-06-30,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/jun/30/cold-storages-seek-revival-package-from-odisha-government-1997301.html,Cold storages seek revival package from Odisha government,"By Express News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: With no support coming from government, the cold storage industry in the state is in dire straits.After eroding their working capital, owners of private cold stores have sought immediate intervention of the government.The Odisha Cold Storage Association in an extraordinary general body meeting here urged the government to announce a revival package to save the cold storage units running under stress from the brink of closure.Of the 47 functional cold storages, 26 units came up after State Potato Mission was launched in 2015 to attain self-sufficiency in production of potato.With a target to increase potato production from two lakh tonne to nearly 12 lakh tonne within three years time, the government proposed to create additional storage capacity of 7 lakh tonne by setting up 112 new cold storages in private sector.As the Potato Mission failed, the new cold stores that came up after 2015 are unable to utilise the storage capacity and as a result incurring huge losses.Each of the cold stores was constructed with an investment of Rs 7 to Rs 8 crore. As potato productivity never materialised, promoters have to depend on neighbouring West Bengal, a major producer of potato.""But, the government is not allowing storage of outside potato and onion leading to losses, said Cold Storage Association Secretary Janardan Sahoo.The cold storage owners have eroded their capital base in the last 4 years due to huge capital investment, electricity tariff, high transportation cost, under utilisation of storage capacity and lack of warehouse receipt finance, he added.The units are on the verge of closure. All the promoters of cold storages have lost their hopes of revival, Sahoo said.The farmers who think that the units were going to provide them a safe landing for their produce and security to their earnings are also at stress.Each cold storage of 5,000 mt capacity provides direct and indirect employment to 300 individuals and could serve 10,000 farmers for storage of their produce.Neglecting this industry affects the livelihood of 10,300 farmer families in the catchment area and closure of these units will have a cascading effect on lives of around 4 lakh farmer families throughout the state."
2019-06-30,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/as-sowing-drops-by-97-per-cent-in-maharashtra-concerns-about-rising-prices-of-vegetables-and-other-commodities-5808194/,"As sowing drops by 97 per cent in Maharashtra, concerns about rising prices of vegetables and other commodities","The dismal situation for most farmers in Maharashtra continues as, even days after the arrival of monsoon, the rainfall is inadequate and farmers have little to cheer about. Sustained absence of rains has resulted in little or no sowing activity.AdvertisingUrban consumers can feel the brunt of the delayed monsoon and sporadic rains as the steep rise in prices of vegetables like tomatoes and onions, and the high prices of tur and chana daal, have hit them. At the same time, almost all dairies in the state have increased the retail price of milk in plastic pouches by Rs 2 per litre. This has stoked fear about the return of food inflation. But all of it is not bad news. Once monsoon rain finally finds its momentum in the next few weeks, sowing activities are expected to pick up. The prices of vegetables and milk, however, may take some time to drop to normal levels.The impact on sowing activityData released by the state Agriculture Department has revealed that there has been a 97 per cent dip in sowing this year, when compared to the sowing activity in this period last year.As on June 18, only 39,176 hectares of farmland have reported sowing of any kind. Last year, on June 22, sowing had been completed on as much as 12.04 lakh hectares in the state. Due to lack of moisture in the soil, farmers had put on hold the sowing of pulses, soyabean, sugarcane, cotton, paddy and some vegetables. Some portions of Konkan and southern Maharashtra have seen nursery plantation of paddy and some millets, but most farmers are yet to begin their operations.AdvertisingThe silver lining is that in the last 72 hours, there has been a good spell of rain and if the rainfall remains consistent, sowing activity will pick up in the coming days, but farmers may decide not to cultivate some short-duration crops.The crops affectedThe main crops which may have missed their sowing window are pulses like moong and urad. Grown within a period of 90-100 days, the sowing window of both pulses ends by mid-June. If sown later than usual, there is a possibility of rain at the time of harvest and subsequent crop loss. Usually, Maharashtra has nearly 8 lakh hectares of area for both crops, with farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha predominantly cultivating the crop. While reduction in the area of cultivation in Maharashtra may not have much of an effect on the national basket, as produce from Rajasthan and Telangana would compensate for any shortfall, this may lead to a slight rise in the prices of moong and urad daal.Once the sowing window gets over, farmers prefer to opt for long-duration crops like tur, soyabean and cotton. Soyabean is the sturdiest of the lot and is resilient towards the many vagaries of nature.Maharashtra reports around 37-38 lakh hectares of land under oilseed and this year, the acreage is expected to go up by 10 per cent. Throughout the last season, the oilseed had traded above its government-specified minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,399 per quintal, giving farmers an incentive to opt for the crop.Another crop that may see more cultivation is cotton, given the better realisation farmers have received in wholesale markets. But farmers are also wary of yield loss due to delayed sowing.Delayed sowing can cause up to 20-30 per cent less yield as rains, during the crucial picking time, can harm the produce. Maharashtra reports around 40 lakh hectares of cotton area, which is likely to see a slight dip due to delayed rains.The prices of pulses, which had earlier been on the higher side, have corrected themselves in the last few weeks. Several steps, such as the Centres approval for an additional quota for import, directions to NAFED to offload its stock and a veiled attack on black-marketers and hoarders have led to a correction in prices, both in wholesale and retail prices. Tur daal, which was retailing in Laturs wholesale markets for Rs 85-86 per kg, has since then settled at Rs 81-83 per kg. Similarly, the retail price of daal in Pune, which had crossed Rs 120 per kg, has since then dropped to Rs 95-100 per kg.Rising pricesOf immediate concern for urban consumers, however, is the higher prices of vegetables and milk. In Punes retail markets, the price of tomatoes (Rs 50-60 per kg), onion (Rs 20-25 per kg) and beans (Rs 120 per kg) have caused much concern for retail consumers. The price rise ia a result of the falling production of summer vegetables, due to the water scarcity. The present trend may continue as the delayed monsoon will take a toll on the arrival of the new crop. As of now, the new crop of vegetables is expected to arrive by the end of July and prices are expected to fall only after that. Similarly, it will take some time before the price of milk, which have seen a Rs 2 per litre increase, corrects itself."

Paulo newspaper that ""Everton must start for the Selecao.""""You have to have the courage to pick those that have the audacity to play football,"" he added.Everton doesn't quite have the wing wizardry of one of Brazil's greats, Garrincha, but his bustling, powerful running and impressive close control are mightily effective, as is his ability to cut inside and shoot.Like a right-footed Arjen Robben, who likewise operates on the opposite flank to the one he should naturally occupy, Everton has been particularly dangerous cutting in from the left onto his good peg.Both his goals came from that move, firing an unstoppable shot into the top far corner against Bolivia, and catching out Peru goalkeeper Pedro Gallese with a drilled low effort to the near post.""That's one of my characteristics, I like to cut inside,"" Everton said after his goal against Venezuela.""I feinted to shoot twice and then hit it hard, giving the goalkeeper no chance.""That was his first goal for the national team, in his seventh appearance, many of which had been as a substitute.""I really wanted to score that first goal, I was starting to beat myself up about it and get impatient.""He didn't have to wait long for his next one -- it came two matches later -- and given the way he's playing, he surely won't be getting impatient again.Brazilians, though, will have to make the most of watching him here because he looks a certainty to be heading to European shores before the new season begins in August, no matter how much the fans want to hold onto him.Manchester City are waiting in the wings and although a defiant internet user suggested this would be possible only if the Premier League champions offered Sergio ""Aguero and 50 million euros,"" given his release clause is 60 million euros, City won't have to part with their Argentine star if they do decide to move in on the popular Brazilian."

The liberal use of quinoa, and vegetables like lotus stems and sweet potatoes to recreate common dishes have paid off richly. The food is not only light and nutritious, but agrees with the taste buds too. One of the unique features of the menu is that they use jackfruit flour instead of the regular all-purpose flour and wheat flour. Jackfruit seed flour is packed with nutrients and is gluten free. So, if you are having Chicken Momos there, you will notice that the dough covering, made from jackfruit flour and root starches, is thicker and has more texture. It is served with an amazing spinach and garlic dip. The Shakarkandi Tarbooz Salad turned out to be a meal in itself.The dish has roasted sweet potato cubes drenched in a citrus dressing, juicy water melon pieces and a handful of pumpkin seeds. The Jhalmuri Salad is the ideal snack mixture which you can gobble up without counting the calories. The mixture has puffed quinoa, makhana, peanuts, onion, tomato and coriander coming together in a citrus dressing. The papdis in the Tri-grain Papdi Chaat Medley, which are made of kuttu, jowar and bajra, were crispier and denser than the normal ones. The Spicy Sprout Filled Golgappas, which came with pomegranate, pineapple and mint water, touched the right spicy and sweet notes.In the main course, Kathal Quinoa Biryani and Six Grain Paranthas were served with Chicken Chettinad curry. In this city of Biryanis, the quinoa Biryani might take some time to find fans. However, the paranthas, made from whole wheat, gram, soyabean, oats and ragi, were delicious and had zero oil. The Chettinad curry was flavourful without being too spicy.Apart from a wide range of creatively done dishes, they have an impressive number of beverages. Their Kokum Coconut coolant is a treat for coconut lovers. The restaurant, which also offers cold coffees and vegan shakes, has a kids menu too. The dessert section has Caramelised Banana Cake, Fruit Payasam and others. The Fruit Payasam seems to be inspired by Elaneer Payasam, with tender coconut being replaced by fresh fruits. They also have two varieties of artisan ice cream  Berry Ice Cream and Coconut Caramel Ice Cream.The interiors of the restaurant is earthy and full of light.

The meat is not cut and weighed in front of customers, there is hardly any clanking of pots and pans, the noise of onions and tomatoes being chopped on wooden cutting boards is missing and theres barely any smoke emanating from the rows of burning embers.Britains strict cooking norms have reduced the spectacle of baltia style of cooking in Pakistan and India using high heat on a steel kadhai, not unlike a stir fryto a mere in-house experience. Mohammed Aftab isnt happy that traditions like sheekhs and katakata stir fried or bhuna dish that gets its name from the rhythmic clanking of iron spatulas mincing meat on flat pansthat need an open fire had to be shelved or modified in keeping with the law.READ | Miracles can happen - Sarfaraz Ahmed on the possibility of beating Bangladesh by 316 runsAdils, a restaurant that opened in 1977 and is considered the pioneer of balti cooking in Britain, has tried to keep the experience as authentic as possible, which is why here, the balti is served in the same wok used to cook it.Zulfi, the head chef at Adils for 15 years now, gets to work once the slip makes it to the pass. With deft hands, he chops the tomatoes, pours the vegetable oil (instead of desi ghee, another British compromise) and lets the chicken simmer in it before cranking up the gas. Everything is measured out in time: when to add the garam masala, the turmeric, the kashmiri laal mirch, the whole spices, chillies and the final garnish. Its done in 10 minutes. Zulfi gets back to checking on his inventory. Its a slow day at Adils; four customers sipping on wine and praising the curry even though its making them sweat on a chilly evening.File photo of cooked dish. ( Getty )It was not always like this, says Aftab, the manager. Earlier we used to be open for lunch and dinners. Now its only dinners. We still do brisk business on weekends but weekdays can be pretty slow. When I think of those days, it feels pretty unbelievable that once we had a footfall of 55,000 in a month.READ | Virat Kohli crashes KL Rahuls interview on Chahal TV  WatchAftab is talking of a time when Indian food was the only option apart from the local pubs and fish and chip shops. Those were the heydays of balti cooking, when a slew of Indian and Pakistani restaurants used to make up the popular Balti Triangle of Birmingham, attracting locals, touring cricketers and even former prime minister David Cameron.Big names often came here. Imran Khan, Inzamam, Shoaib Mohammad. Tab to mehfil hota tha yahaan (It used to be a soiree here). Dinners used to continue till late at night, remembers Aftab. Siyasat (politics) and cricket, dinner conversations used to be incomplete without them.Cricket is integral to life around these parts of Birmingham. Not very far from Stoney Lane grew up Moeen Ali, still remembered as that wiry chap who could bat very well and went on to become the beard thats feared. Ali studied at Nelson Mandela Primary School, situated adjacent to a huge field lining Stoney Lane that hosts community cricket matches every Sunday. Some teams in fact, are sponsored by the balti restaurants as a way of supporting the game and the youth of Birmingham. Like Al Faisals, established in 1982, a stones throw from Adils and their biggest competitor. This restaurant too is steeped in cricket. Among the most liked photos on their social media handle is one that has Mohammad Ajaib, the restaurants founder, with Javed Miandad during Pakistans 1986 tour. Qasim, the sprightly 22-year-old manager, tells how they had sponsored Pakistans team bus during the 2017 Champions Trophy.Getting players to visit the restaurant has become difficult over the years. Locals at Stoney Lane feel increased security and fear of being approached by bookies have made players apprehensive. Still there are the odd calls requesting balti shops to deliver baltis, biryani, korma and the massive table naans to team hotels. The players connect isnt as real time as it used to be, says Mohammad, one of the oldest hands in Adil. Still, the community around Stoney Lane breathes cricket. Often its the only distraction from the tough immigrant life. Accha lagta hai cricket dekh kar, says Mohammad. He had come to Birmingham when he was eight, worked for 30 years before deciding to head home to Mirpur, in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir in 2018. It was an emotional decision, one he would regret quickly. Life back home is difficult. Every day we dont have electricity for hours. Generators cost a lot. At least here you have insurance, health care, he says. Better sense prevailed and he returned six months back.Wapas kab jaoge?Pata nahi. Its better here.Living far from home, cricket becomes an emotional connect to the land left behind. This year has been good. Pakistan toured England just before the World Cup. It all got heady the day Pakistan beat New Zealand in a World Cup thriller, right here in Birmingham. It sparked off celebrations that went on all night.Those are the best days to be in the food business, says the young manager, Qasim. Surviving in the Balti Triangle for a balti joint isnt easy anymore, with Chinese, Lebanese, Turkish and Ethiopian food making inroads. So when Pakistan plays here, and especially when they win, the happy countrymen, generous orders, and lavish tips go a long way. The loss to India hurt. But there is still hope against hope.Arent Pakistan coming back to Birmingham for the semi-finals? asks Mohammad. Better to leave the answer unsaid.First Published: Jul 04, 2019 23:35 IST"

Not too far from work, my colleague and I reach there at 2.30 pm (feverishly thinking about alternatives if the place is shut). But no! The doors are wide open and a beaming Lakshmi T Priya welcomes us in and seats us at a table (I sit on a stone bench that runs along the wall).The meals room is a no-nonsense affair and brightly lit and focussed only on the business of serving food to its customers. Just outside is the menu of the day written in chalk. We must have looked starved; before the banana leaf is placed in front of us, two cups of steaming hot wheat and coconut milk paaysam is served to us.Lakshmi started the all-vegetarian Kongunad style restaurant only recently. It is possible to get a lot of our non vegetarian dishes perhaps, but the equally impressive list of vegetarian cuisine is hardly out there, she says. As a vegetarian I am delighted and the happiness only grows as wholesome, vegetable-filled, non-paneer dishes are served one by one. A kothavarangai poriyal smells tantalisingly familiar, and oh so fragrant. That is because EVERY spice is hand pounded every day,says Lakshmi.Info you can use Sree Vidhya Meals Room is on Kalingarayar Road, (opp Bank of Baroda), Ram NagarOpen only for lunch (12.00 noon to 3.30 pm)A meal is priced at 100Call 0422-2238444 or 8220010913 for detailsIt began, like all good food stories do, with Lakshmis grandmothers. Alamelu Ammayi was a queen of thokkus, pickles and non-vegetarian fare and while Rajalakshmi Ammal cooked vegetarian delicacies like none other. I grew up watching both of them cook. They were affectionate, says Lakshmi, but strict, and tolerated no short cuts or laziness in the kitchen. Nothing made them happier than cooking for near and dear ones. It is that generosity of spirit and giving that inspired Lakshmi to open this Meals Room.I want to revive country recipes and produce and bring alive my grandmothers recipes. They only used local and seasonal fare and I am doing just the same. She is a farmer first, says Lakshmi, and nothing pleases her more than cooking from what grows on her farm including the native oils that are milled there. Farm to table is a philosophy that I subscribe to completely.Lakshmi and Mani are the only cooks. I have watched him cook for 45 years! We both cook from our heart and soul. She brushes aside our awe that just the two of them handle the cooking and says, it takes no more than what it takes to turn out a meal at home. Just requires a bit of planning, that is all.The Meals Room serves a different menu each day of the week. So be prepared to be pleasantly surprised when vegetables like pirandai, thoodhuvalai, ponnangani keerai and thandu kovakkai appear on your plate. We enjoy an exemplary pachadi that we try hard to decode. Lakshmi takes pity on us and reveals that it is a kovakkai pachchadi! We are not inventing anything; just reviving old recipes and I follow my grandmothers recipe to the last word, she says, plonking down two beautiful, glistening urundais onto our elai. The kadalai podi urundai is a peanut and red chilly powder fashioned into balls that Lakshmi encourages us to eat with hot rice and gingelly oil. Someone had a brilliant idea when they told her to patent it!Lakshmi wears her love for her grandmothers on her sleeve. I am dedicating this restaurant to them. I learnt about integrity, passion and the importance of keeping my kitchen and surroundings scrupulously clean. They taught me that food tastes good only when one cooks from the heart and, even today if I am upset about something, I wait till I have resolved the matter before I enter the kitchen1The sambar follows. You must come again and taste Alamelu Ammayis vengaya thokku. And the arisi paruppu sadham, kollu rasam, pirandai chutney, surakkai thattai payiru kulambu and pachai payiru kadaisal, Lakshmi tells us. And throws in a mention of adhirasam as a possible dessert too!We assure Lakshmi we will be back for more and stagger out, after calming down our protesting stomachs with comforting jeeragam and karuvapillai rasam.Recipe for arisi paruppu sadamServes 4200 gm ponni rice200 gm toor dalSmall onions peeled 100 gmRed chillies 6Tomato 50 gmSesame oil 100 gmMustard 1/2 tspJeera 1/4 tspSambar powder 10 gmTurneric powder 1/2 tspCurry leavesSalt to tasteWater 750 mlMethod: Soak rice and dal together in water for half an hour.

The operation was based in the central English city of Birmingham.The victims were kept in squalid conditions and constantly monitored to make sure none escaped.""Eighty-eight victims came forward but the investigation revealed in excess of 300 other probable victims,"" said Mark Paul of England's Crown Prosecution Service.""Vulnerable men and women were recruited off the streets in Poland with the promise of a better life, only to be cruelly exploited and trapped into a desperate cycle of dependency with nowhere else to go.The eight gang members have been sentenced to jail terms of between three and 11 years, in three trials that concluded on Friday.They were convicted of crimes ranging from human trafficking to money laundering and conspiracy to require another person to perform forced labour.""This is the largest modern slavery prosecution of its kind in the UK and perhaps in Europe,"" Paul said.Bentley and sports carsNews of the human trafficking operation first emerged after two of the victims fled their captors and contacted the Hope for Justice anti-slavery charity.Polish national Miroslaw Lehmann said he was paid ""nothing"" for working up to 13 hours a day and then returning to a squalid apartment with no hot water nor heat.""We slept on the floor on the mattress and we used our clothes as blankets,"" the 38-year-old said in an interview broadcast by the BBC.""I couldn't even leave the house for a walk,"" Lehmann said. ""They were following me, spying on me. They were controlling me.""Another victim whose name was not revealed said he was forced to wash in a city canal.

As the sowing gets delayed, the threat of cyclones, which usually hit the coast during late September or early November, looms large.While the farmers across the State have sown paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, red gram, green gram, black gram, groundnut, sesamum, castor, sunflower, cotton, chilli, onion and turmeric in kharif, the sowing of none of these crops has crossed a fourth of the normal area as on July 5."

The assistance will be to the tune of Rs 20,000 per hectare under TOP scheme of the Centre.The scheme will be piloted in Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts with a cluster approach in the Rabi season to encourage farmers to take up tomato farming in a commercial scale, said sources in the Horticulture Directorate.Tribal-dominated Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj have been selected for Government intervention as these two districts are the top producers of tomato due to suitable soil and prolonged cold climatic conditions during winter. However, farmers, mostly tribals, failed to recover the cost due to lack of storage facility and proper marketing linkage.With the bumper harvest of tomato last year but lack of demand, farmers of Keonjhar resorted to dumping the highly perishable vegetable on roads to register their protest against Government apathy towards their interest.Though the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has operationalised Operation Green, a scheme to stabilise the price of tomato, onion and potato, from last year, Odisha has not taken advantage of it.The scheme, if properly implemented, will lead to enhancement in income of farmers growing tomato, onion and potato, capacity building of farmer producer organisations (FPOs), reduction in post-harvest losses, creation of processing infrastructure, provision of agri-logistics for supply chain and reduction in price volatility of TOP for consumers, the sources added.The State has identified five districts for the development of agro-processing clusters of fruits and vegetables under the Centrally-sponsored Kisan Sampad Yojana (KSY). Apart from Keonjhar and Mayurbhnaj, the three other districts which are major producer of tomato and other vegetables are Balangir, Ganjam and Sundargarh. Balangir is one of the major producers of onion in western Odisha."

The accused, Mohammed Jahangir Pasha, who was working as a teacher in a school, began pursuing the 21-year-old victim, a student of the same school in 2011. Saying that he is in love with her and wants to marry her, the accused took the girl to a resort and raped her, but married another woman in July 2011.Even after getting married, the accused fooled the victim by saying that he did not like his wife and instead promised her to marry her. Later, he went on to again rape the gullible girl. The girl became pregnant in 2012 and gave birth to a baby boy. When Pasha refused to take responsibility for their son, she lodged a complaint with Meerpet police, who registered a case in December 2012 under Section 420 and 376 for cheating and rape.During the investigationion, the blood and DNA samples of the boy proved that the accused was the biological father of the child. The court, which found the accused guilty, sentenced him to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and asked him to pay a fine of Rs 60,000."

Walmart currently sources fruits and vegetables mainly from mandis and the move to bolster direct sourcing comes against the backdrop of Walmart Foundation committing around Rs 180 crore for farmers over the next five years.""Currently, our major focus is on hardy vegetables such as potatoes, onions, garlic and on some other vegetables with slightly longer shelf life compared to greens. This is because in this category, we can have a supply chain advantage rather than just source from mandis. The major focus is on building a supply chain for vegetables. The centres that we plan to open in North India to enable us to directly source from farmers will be outsourced, as it's a pilot project that will help us understand the whole game plan,"" said Krish Iyer, president & CEO of Walmart India.In 2018, Walmart had announced that its Indian arm will grow its direct sourcing from farmers to 25% of the produce sold in its wholesale stores over a five-year period. But apart from focusing on fresh fruits and vegetables, Walmart India is also accelerating its store openings. The company opened its 25th store in Indore, MP, earlier this month.""It takes about three to four years to open a store. The initial period was more about rebuilding the team, revisiting the processes and the basics, and then starting to rebuild the pipeline. We got some experts back into the country to start the process. We are in a growth phase and we are investing for growth,"" said Iyer."
2019-07-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/this-chennai-restaurant-is-merging-cuisines/article28354106.ece,This Chennai restaurant is merging cuisines,"Its like stepping back into 2017. Everything looks the same: from the quirky portraits of historical figures (look for the one of Emperor Shah Jahan playing golf) to the painted and upholstered furniture, and indoor cabannas with silken drapes. Walking into the soon-to-be-launched Desi Di in Poes Garden feels exactly like walking into the Desi Di premises of Perambur just a few years ago.We kept all the [decor] pieces and furniture from that restaurant to use in this one, grins Chef Aaron Coutinho, back in Chennai after a recent stint in Hyderabad. The chef, who also has some experience under Mumbai-based The Bombay Canteen under his belt, is proud of how much of Desi Di he has managed to keep consistent despite the long pause, and also of the things he has changed.I want this to be a space where people have conversations about food, he says over plates of banana leaf wrapped tawa fish fry and and bhutta (corn) kebab made two ways. To demonstrate his point, he gestures to the fish  soft, pungent with a hint of mustard, but otherwise very familiarly Chennai. This week, we are using an Indian version of puffer fish for this dish. I chanced upon it at the market this afternoon, in a batch of small fishing boats that had just come in. The catch contained many local varieties that arent well-known, and dont sell much. But that is the kind of fish I want to serve my guests, and explain where it comes from, why they should try it.Inspired by IndiaThe mustard in this marination is an idea Aaron borrowed from Bengal. Other dishes are nods to other parts of the country, like the chicken tikka khakhra, which comprises meaty little chunks sprinkled like pizza toppings on a sturdy khakhra. And then there are the two-way corn kebabs: an oh-so-soft potato chikki; and sliced cobs marinated in spicy tandoori masala and, well, tandoored. It is corn this week; well change it to some other seasonal vegetable next week. Brinjal has a lot of scope, says Aaron.He calls it adaptive Indian cuisine  taking flavours from around India and adapting them to the local region. I either give familiar dishes and ingredients a different recipe, or take something hyperlocal yet lesser known and give it a typical Chennai preparation.Its clear that the chef had his fun when coming up with creations. Take, for example, his Naga chicken curry that is served with dosa. Not the dosa you get when you pour batter on a pan, but what you get when you pour the same batter into a waffle maker. This thick, soft dosa waffles are surprisingly just right for dipping into the thick, rich onion-laced gravy and munching along with soft chunks of boneless meat. But the sugarcane chicken kebabs, on the other hand, are just a game of mix and match. The tikkas themselves are just regular seekhs, if a tad too garlic-heavy, but each is skewered on a sugarcane stick instead of a regular one. So you finish your meat and then chew on the skewer too.But Aaron isnt just creative with the big stuff: a large part of his seasonal and local plan is focused on the chutneys, dips and sides. I wanted diners to see that the vegetables we used to hate as children, actually can be a lot of fun, he says. So the sugarcane chicken kebab is served on a bed of shredded gongurra salad, sweetened with oodles of honey and made crunchy with crushed peanuts. The mutton boti kebab comes with a smooth turnip relish fit to replace all mayonnaise dips from dining tables. And at the centre of the chicken khakhra sits a dollop of ridge gourd chutney, which looks exactly like its mint version, but tastes greener. As if plucked fresh from a garden and crushed then and there.Desi Di  Indian Restaurant on Kasturi Rangan Avenue, Poes Garden will be open to the public from July 13 onwards.

While the restaurant exudes a classic look with its minimalistic decor, its Chef Murenus curated menu titled Flavours of Sardinia that really wins you over.Murenu, 41, who recently joined the property and is still getting accustomed to Delhis heat, grew up on a 250-acre farm eating farm-to-table meals with his large family. This shaped his opinion on food, and these dishes are thus inspired by the time he spent on the farm.With a warm smile, he introduced us to Zuppa Dorzo Ai Frutti Di Mare  barley soup with onion, carrots, celery, garlic croutons and bits of seafood mixed in it. The first thing you are bound to remember on taking a sip is home. The soup was hot, lighter on spices with a dash of pepper, while the shrimp and the crab were perfectly cooked.Next, we tried the Pizza Ali Carcioffie Caciotta Affumicata. I have always enjoyed the extra cheese with extra toppings, but this one challenged my choices. Thin crust pizza with mozzarella, tomato and smoked caciotta cheese, topped with artichoke  its mild flavour doesnt overpower the overall taste, and certainly adds texture. Its best if you dont add any chillies or oregano. Taste it in its true form.Pancia Di Maiale Arrosto E Vernaccia is one of Chef Murenos own favourites. The roasted pork belly, especially when you mix it with the sweet wine sauce and the vegetables... you are sure to forget the rest and completely concentrate on your plate. In between, the chef tells us how his father was a chef in North Italy but when his grandfather became sick, he returned home to be a farmer.He always regretted not being able to continue his passion. So, when my brother and I grew up, I continued in the agriculture sector and my brother cooking. Suddenly, we decided to switch our professions. And there was no looking back. With a farming background and the love for cooking in his blood, Murenu worked in England for years, from hotels to casinos. After 16 years in London, he joined Marriott and went to Jordan for three years. Then an opportunity cropped up in the land of spices and now hes here.His signature dish, the one he had already warned us to keep space for was Seadas Con Miele Di Acacia  Seadas stuffed with sweet cheese and acacia honey. Of all the unique Sardinian dishes, this is probably the best on the rest of the Italian Peninsula, shared Chef Murenu.Seadas are one of the best-known dishes from the region served at the end of every Sardinian meal, which uses simple ingredients like cheese and fresh acacia honey to turn it into something delicious. This Sardinian dessert, famous across the world, pairs divinely the sweetness of the honey with the saltiness of the Pecorino cheese (Since the authentic Pecorino cheese isnt available here, the chef mixed mozzarella cheese and cow cheese to achieve a similar taste) resulting in an intriguing and intense flavour.Though, it took us more than hour to reach the venue, we left happy and satisfied.What: Flavours of SardiniaWhere: Prego, The Westin GurgaonWhen: Till July 15Time: Noon to 3:00 pm, and for dinner from 6:00pm till midnightReservations+91 9871226953Seadas Con Miele Di Acacia recipeIngredients:  For the dough (12 pieces approx)  500 gms durum wheat flour  50 gms lard or extra virgin olive oil  240 ml warm water  Pinch of salt  For the stuffing (12 pieces approx)  500 gms of fresh Pecorino cheese  Olive oil/vegetable oil for fryingMethod:  Make a dough by combining the flour and salt with water bit by bit till you have a silky, elastic consistency. Add the lard (or olive oil) and knead until well incorporated.  Let the dough rest about 30 minutes, covered.  Roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Cut circles and put the fresh Pecorino cheese on it. Cover with another circle of dough closing it well and press the edges well with fingers or with the tines of a fork.  Then fry the Seadas by immersion on the hot vegetable oil, till is a golden colour.  Remove from pan and place on the kitchen paper till they are dry (keep warm).  Gently warm the honey then pour over the Seadas. Best consumed when freshly made and piping hot, and the cheese still oozing.  Serve with a dust of icing sugar.Recipe courtesy: Chef Marco Murenu"

To experience the world full of monsters, superpowers and magic, the limited menu has combinations and flavours that denote the Upside Down, which is the primary theme of the series.As CE soaked in the surrounding, our eyes immediately caught the Mind Flayer LIIT, a cocktail based on the giant monster in Season 3. With an IPA syrup that has been carefully tended to, the dark rum with walnut falernum, fresh lime juice and soda was a good, tall start to the evening.While Socials outlets in Bengaluru are well-known for their LIITs, this one was more on the sweeter side and would be a good pick for someone who doesnt prefer hard drinks. The Spice Bomb was a pleasant savoury chaat consisting of yogurt, tomatoes, onions and a lot more. We finished it in a jiffy, no surprise there. Next came the Crunchy Upma and Upside Down-nuts. According to the menu, the former is crunchy on the outside, soft inside, just like Hopper, the famous police officer from the show who unfortunately dies in the last episode (or, does he?). Its a plate worthy of just the right amount of everything that a vegetarian might love. The latter is doughnuts filled with well-cooked ghee roast mutton and the menu goes on to say, Youll be on it just like Eleven on Eggos (a Stranger Things reference). Served with green chutney, the doughnuts were a delight and not at all heavy on the appetite.Meanwhile, our Strange, Sweet Death arrived with a combination of gin, cherry and hibiscus syrup, balsamic vinegar, earl grey tea, egg white and jaggery syrup. Sounds strange, but our taste buds loved it. Once the Kebab Paella came, we couldnt stop hogging at the delicious risotto rice, garnished with onions and coriander leaves and topped with quite a few creamy chicken kebabs that melted in our mouth.We encountered something strange with Biscuits and Gravy. Although we understand biscuits paired with tea, we didnt realise that the simple Parle-G would taste so unique with classic dal. Add to that, the biscuits were butter-fried, which would be loved by children and also makes for a perfect snack while playing Dungeons & Dragons.To finish it up, we were served the Mirchi ka Halwa, which in true sense, was not spicy at all, as the name suggests, but was more of butter mixed with hints of chilli served on crunchy breads. Quite strange, eh?The Stranger Things menu is on till July 14 and cost for two is `1,300 (approx)."

For something like bunny chow, you dont need anything from South Africa because it is an Indian-origin dish. Even the chakalaka consists beans that are found easily here.The refreshing sweet potato and coconut salad served as a the perfect sweet and tangy start to the meal. What followed was the must-try Chicken Sosaties, which was a unique blend of char-grilled apricots and onion with juicy and tender chicken chunks. The combination is exotic and a real treat. The bunny chow was nothing short of a dream with lamb cooked to perfection in a mouthwatering sauce and topped with red and yellow bell peppers to balance the flavour and add a dash of tartness. The beef babotie will leave you craving for more as it is blends spice, salt and all things nice for a hearty and lip-smacking dish.If you think there is nothing much for vegetarians, youll be in for many surprises.

""Against an order for 30 sacks, we get only around 10 these days, said Rajan, a retailer in the Palayam market. The price of tomatoes saw a threefold rise during the past couple of weeks. It doubled from I20 to I40 last week, and increased by I20 this week, pushing it to I60 per kilo. Shallot rates also increased from I30 to I70 in the past week.Ginger sales appear to be in jeopardy due to the sudden hike in price from I150 to I200 a week ago and peaking at I240 on Friday. Due to the hike, no one wants to buy ginger, says Nandu, a street vendor at Palayam market. Another item which showed a similar rise is coriander leaves, which went up from I35 in February to I210 last week.Other vegetables which saw a similar price hike in the past two weeks include beans from I50 to I60 per kg and cabbage from I20 to I50.Fruit prices have also increased due to their scarcity during the off-season.

Buyers in Bandra's Pali Market Andheri West and Ghatkopar were shocked to pay Rs 60 per kg for the essential item.Traders blame heavy rainfall in the state for a ""shortage"" of crop. APMC tomato wholesaler Mangal Gupta said, ""The recent heavy rains in Maharashtra have put a spanner in the works. Flowering of local tomato has been adversely affected. So most of the fruit is coming from dry locations of Bangalore and Gujarat. High prices will persist for one month.""Shrikant Jaiswal of Pappu Vegetables in Bandra's Pali Market said, ""Until Friday, the rate was Rs 40 but on Saturday the cost rose to Rs 60. Some of our buyers do complain but we explain to them. In any case prices do peak once a year. I have seen that customers grin and bear it till the rate climbs to Rs 80 per kg. Once it crosses that mark then we see the situation becoming difficult.""Housewives however, point out that firm red tomatoes are available in robust quantities, with no sign of spoilage or shortfall. Bandra resident Valerie Soans said, ""I hope this price rise is not the work of a cartel that causes artificial inflation a couple of times a year. Irrespective of the government that comes to power, there seems to be no mechanism to deal with high food prices. How can we pay Rs 60 for an item as basic as tomato that is required in most vegetarian and non-vegetarian recipes? Even those who do not eat onion and garlic must have tomato.""Other vegetables are also selling for 25-30% more than the average retail rate. Already coriander is off the table at Rs 20-40 per bunch. French beans are at Rs 160, green peas Rs 160-200, cauliflower Rs 80-100 and gavar or cluster beans are selling for Rs 100. Yam, brinjal, and other common beans have become costlier too."

He is believed to have carefully hand-picked his two junior ministers, Kishan Reddy from Telangana and Nityanand Rai from Bihar. These two deputies not only introduce bills in the House but also counter the Oppositions arguments on those bills.So far, Shah has only spoken on the Jammu & Kashmir issue in the Lok Sabha while seeking an extension of presidents rule in the troubled state. The Kashmir issue is widely believed to be important to Shahs political plans, and he wants to use it to carve out a certain image for himself: that of a leader with an iron fist.The decision to promote juniors by giving them more opportunities to speak in Parliament is seen to be part of a long-term strategy.

And I have been lucky enough to find this at the microscopic The Himalayan Caf. The busyness of Sri Ram Nagar is enough to make you miss it because, well, theres no board. Make your way up a dimly-lit staircase and simply follow the fragrance of fresh garlic and stir-fries and youll find yourself gunning for space in the tiny space that is THC.The interiors arent much to write about but if youre lucky enough to grab a seat, youre practically audience to the flurry of food-prep in the kitchen. Some work on the parcelling of the dumplings, a few chop up ingredients with unbelievable ease, others toss ingredients in a large and reflective wok, and one supervises the entire chain of command. And all of this is done with easy smiles and welcoming hospitality.Tasty endeavoursMeet Vasudev Singh, the founder of THC, and youll understand why the place has its charm. I used to work at Google, he explains, but showing Hyderabad 100% authentic momos and other dishes has always been my dream. I text a couple of friends that Im at THC and they reply instantly, Try the pork momos! and The noodles are to-die-for!The Himalayan Caf USP Hand-made momosHand-made momos Where Sri Ram Nagar, KondapurSri Ram Nagar, Kondapur Cost for two Approx 750Before I dig into a platter of six pork momos, I inspect the translucent parcelling and watch the steam from the pork and other ingredients inside plump up the dumpling in an appetising way. I shove one in my mouth, rather inelegantly, and bite down. The bursts of flavour and juice are enough to have me savouring the thoughtfully-balanced levels of salt and spice. But as good momos do, the work of the chef has let the pork do all the performing in this yummy concerto of flavours. The sauces which accompany the appetisers at THC are honestly worth taking home too.A friend of mine texts, urging me, Find out how they prep it!The khow suey at The Himalayan Caf | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniVasudev then brings out a few chicken dishes, not too eager to feed me till I end up having a food coma. But with cuisine such as this, its not possible, I later find. The chicken starters are richly tasty and are enough to go with a cold beer or soda pop.Speaking of drinks, be sure to bring your own or have one of the boys pop to the nearest supermarket and pick up a beverage. Yes, this place requires quite a bit of pro-activity on your part.After a chat with Vasudev, a server brings out a well-stacked dish: khow suey. The smile on his face tells me Im in for a treat and hes right. The fragrance of the coconut melding with spice is hypnotic and the toppings are plentiful: fried onions, eggs, peanuts, coriander, chilli flakes and more.A good khow suey will feel like a meal on its own and will have even the most timid diner digging in with gusto. And THC achieves this."

Traditionally, the farmers practice flood irrigation for the cultivation which takes lot of water usage and with situation in drought-prone Marathwada getting bad to worse with every year, the figures comes as a surprise to everyone.Highlighting that farmers cannot be restricted from cultivating the crop of their choice since it fetches them good returns, the government as well as experts have emphasized the need for strict use of the drip and micro-irrigation techniques on war-footing for sugarcane.Agricultural superintendent for Aurangabad division S K Divekar on Sunday said that the drip irrigation techniques for sugarcane can ensure judicious use of water. ""Even if not made mandatory so far, the drip irrigation technique is being emphasized by the government. In the wake of drought last year and late arrival of monsoon this year, the area under cane cultivation is likely to come down. The estimated area under cultivation, however, is still high considering the drought-prone nature of Marathwada,"" he said.Notably, a study conducted by advocacy group South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) on sugarcane cultivation in Marathwada had found that drought-prone region consumed nearly 4,322 million cubic meters (mcum) of water, nearly double the live storage capacity of Jayakwadi project, to irrigate sugarcane standing on 2.3 lakh hectares in 2013.Divekar said farmers should also explore sustainable cropping pattern instead of sugarcane. ""Planting different orchards and cultivating vegetables, onions and potatoes could be also explored by farmers in keeping with the weather conditions,"" he said.As per the official figures, an estimate made by the State Agriculture Department, Latur division of Marathwada will have over 1.25 lakh hectare of cane cultivation, while Aurangabad division will cultivate the cash-crop over 69,305 hectare area. Latur division which comprises of Latur, Parbhani, Nanded, Hingoli and Osmanabad and Aurangbad division, made up of Aurangabad, Jalna and Beed districts, together account for over 1.9 lakh hectare area under cane cultivation.The estimated agricultural area under cane cultivation in Marathwada during 2018-19 was around 2.96 lakh hectare.The sugarcane cultivation takes place under four-identified seasons including 'Adsali' that coincide with the Kharif season, pre-seasonal getting planted preferably during November - December, followed by 'Suru' cultivated in January - February and the subsequent Ratoon season. Marathwada witnesses sugarcane plantation during all these seasons depending upon the weather conditions and availability of water.Deepak Joshi, a progressive farmer from Paithan taluka said sugarcane cultivation has remained prerogative of a section of farmers from Marathwada who have easy access to water from dams and canal systems. ""The stat authorities must ensure judicious use of water for sugarcane cultivation by making drip irrigation mandatory. The farmers cannot be prohibited from cultivating the crop of their choice since it fetches them good returns, but at the same time there is a need for drip and micro-irrigation techniques for sugarcane instead of the traditional practice of flood irrigation,"" he said."

But have you ever sat down to think of what an ayurvedic diet could do for your body? Chef G Muthu Kumar, executive chef at Novotel-IBIS OMR came across Ayurvedic principles of cooking by chance. It was mere curiosity at first but in no time he deep-dived into the fascinating and rich world of Ayurvedic diets and cooking. He took it upon himself to not only practice but also educate others on these simple yet beneficial methods of eating and cooking, that he believes can go a long way to not only understanding the spices in your masala dabba better but also to recognise their significance in your diet.Eight years back, when I was going through recipes to create new dishes, I stumbled upon the fact that Indian cuisine is based on Ayurvedic principles, he says. I was curious about how something as ancient as Ayurveda is affecting our food habits and cuisine even today. When I began reading, there was not much reference available, so I started delving deep.Last year, I was asked to do a health talk, but went as a judge instead because I felt that to deliver a talk like that you need to have some fundamentals in place. At this point, I checked for some Ayurvedic courses and enrolled in the Kerala Ayurveda Academy for a two-week Ayurvedic diet and cookery course to understand the context and significance of each ingredient. It was a truly transformative course.Know your prakritiThe course had a profound impact on his understanding of food. It taught me to be more appreciative of the seasons. I understood why it is important to use seasonal food and also developed an understanding of different prakriti (body types/composition) and what food is suitable to which prakriti, he says. Ayurvedic understanding is based on the inner workings and balancing of the doshas, it is about understanding your bodys software, and how your eating habits can help have a good life.He explains that prakriti is the determination of dominant biological energies such as vata, pitta and kapha that govern mind-body process that underlies individual health. These three pillars are derived from the five elements  vata is a combination of space and air; pitta of fire and water, and kapha of earth and water. According to chef Muthu, the road to wellness begins with the process of aligning internal energies with the external environment. Even within the family, he says, each member could have a different prakriti and it is important to analyse it.Sharing knowledgeIn the last six months, he has shared his knowledge with over 150 enthusiasts including hotel guests as well as neighbourhood corporate employees of UST Global, Cap Gemini, where he has passionately nudged people to realise the magnitude of benefits in small dietary changes based on choices of food along with changing seasons. Our ancestors were very smart and knowledgeable. They ingrained certain aspects of our culture and roots that we blindly follow today as customs, but there is much more to it than that. Why is it that we eat particular foods during different festivals?There is a reason for everything. We are unaware of the science behind the custom. Ugadi pachadi is a good example. It is made with many ingredients and has six different tastes  sweet, salty, bitter, tangy, spicy and sour  that are meant to depict the highs and lows of life. But more than that, it is one dish that gives you everything that you need, he says. The biggest problem today is that people are unaware of this ancient yet relevant science of eating.He says that even most chefs do not realise why every ingredient in the spice rack has its own purpose. I see a huge gap in the understanding of ingredients and ayurvedic principles of cooking among modern chefs, he says. No culinary school is teaching students why we are using certain ingredients in our cuisine. It is imperative for chefs to have this knowledge and even people at large to understand their prakriti and eat accordingly.Chef Muthu will host a sit-down four-course dinner on July 26 at the Novotel, OMR where participants will interact with the chef and deduce their body type through prakriti analysis.

The street leading to the cafe ends at a small black gate, which opens up to a colourful complex with outdoor seating, a reception counter that is the replica of a truck hood, and miniature trucks carefully placed in the nooks and corners to give you a feeling of an actual nukkad (street corner). Not to forget how water is served in small ketlis (kettles). Nukkad is beyond a caf and bar. It takes you to the old nostalgic times, and also serves an experience one cherishes forever, shares Kanishk Tuteja, owner of the quirky caf has youngsters frequenting the place for a taste of homefood or to celebrate birthdays  exactly what was going on when I entered.The quirkiness is not limited only to the interiors; the menu too mirrors the same. I started with a glass of Bomb Liit from the Long Island Ice Tea section, which was a combination of vodka, gin, tequila, rum, Triple sec and Red Bull. The taste sweet enough to mellow the bitterness of alcohol.Nukkad is trying out some new innovations and if you are up for some experiments, you can always try the Matka liit which has a twist of masala along with alcohol.For appetisers, I tried the Chicken Tikka Chaat, which was traditional tikka with a tangy flavour of chaat. The perfectly cooked chicken with onion and tomatoes lived up to the theme of the place. Next was the Mushroom Galouti, of small naans accompanying each piece of Galouti. Though Im a huge fan of mushrooms, the dish itself wasnt the best version of itself. It lacked flavour.For the main course, I went with the Rara Gosht, a combination of mutton pieces and mutton kheema. The mutton was well-cooked and went perfectly with the naan. Next, I tried The Asian Market Bowl, full of vegetables, sauce, noodles and rice to choose from. I opted for mix veggies with Spicy Thai sauce and Hakka noodles. The thick Thai sauce, rich in butter and coconut is a must if you enjoy Thai cuisine.For a sweet ending, I had Gulab Jamun with ice cream.Those who want to visit this monsoon, try their special Nukkad Bhelpuri, Vada Pav, Samosas, Pakodas and Railway cutlets.The rain might make the service slow but sitting outside with a glass of your favourite drink will make you forget about these things.As for me, I left with a happy stomach and nostalgic memories, guarded by my umbrella against the rain."

The minister directed the agricultural produce market committee to convene a meeting of tomato wholesalers and ensure stable and sufficient supply of tomatoes, the statement said.""Hussain also directed various agencies to take effective action against any hoarding activity.

There is now a general bonhomie and people are seen going about their daily chores.Residents of Lal Kuan have been living in peace and amity. However, on the night of June 30, a scuffle broke out between two men over a trivial parking issue. Later, the situation snowballed, says M. Nafis, a social worker, who resides near the iconic Lal Masjid.Recalling his memorable years spent at Lal Kuan, Sanjay Jain, a retired bank employee, says: We lived in a Jain-dominated area. We often walked down to the iconic Jama Masjid. We had good friends like the nihari wallah. Since Jain food doesnt have onions and garlic, our Muslim brothers served us special vegetarian food in their weddings. We have seen that kind of generosity then and even now.While he speaks glowingly about mehman nawazi (hospitality) of neighbours, he laments that outsiders vitiate the atmosphere to give a communal colour.It happened even during post-Babri Masjid demolition. Tension was visible at the Bara Hindu Rao area, says Mr. Jain.The bond between Hindus and Muslims goes back a long way. I have so much faith in my friends like Yusuf that I can even keep my cash with him. He blessed my son on his wedding. He is just like family to us, says Mr. Jain, who puts the blame squarely on outsiders who create mischief and go scot-free. For years this place has been a bond of harmony.No riots since PartitionCorroborating this, Firoz Bakht Ahmed, Chancellor of Hyderabad-based Maulana Azad National Urdu University, says since Partition, no riots have taken place in Lal Kuan. What happened on June 30 was at the behest of some politically motivated individuals who don want peace and cordial relations between the two communities, says this former resident of Shahjahanabad.Reminiscing her memorable evening spent at Kucha Bulaki Begam, Madhu Jain, a fashion designer, says she would go with her grandmother to Jama Masjid to buy vermicelli. It is best dry seviyan in the world. Members of both communities would come to the terrace of our home to watch Ravans effigy being burnt at Parade Ground.Summing up his thoughts, Mr. Bakht said: Koi mushkil nahin hei Hindu ya Musalman hona. Haan badi baat hei is daur mein insaan hona. [It is not difficult to be either a Hindu or Muslim. But it is a big thing to be a human in todays times.]"

Its not that famous Gymkhana, the one thats close to the prime ministers residence in Delhi.The restaurant at the HUDA Gymkhana Club in Gurugrams Sector 4 has no pretensions. The curtains are frayed. The garden-facing windows are smudged with misty stains. The walls look a tad discoloured. The ceiling glows with red and green lamps as if inspired from traffic lighting. The tables are decked with fake flowers.This late afternoon the air in the empty restaurant is steeped in the scent of some creamy gravy. The lunch hour is long past and a housekeeper is sweeping the floor. A handful of waiters are watching a cricket match on TV.The place is cosy ambiance is suggestive of a time when life was less competitive, choices were few and eateries didnt have to fret about customers online reviews. The restaurant menu, in fact, gels with the mood. It is like a blast from the 1990s when nobody had heard of kale seeds and sushi was a rumour. The most exotic item thats available here is... well, chilli gobhi.And now its served.Glistening with oil, the fried cauliflowers appear to be dyed in a curious shade of red, interspersed with pieces of lightly sauted capsicum and onions. The garlicky smell is intense. Just a bite reveals that the oil has percolated deep inside every canny and crevice of the gobhi. And it is so spicy. The dishs Haryanvi-Chinese grandeur is overwhelming but tastes less wild when downed with a glass of nimbu soda. Indeed, this is a kind of unsophisticated comfort food to be tackled only in a disarming place like this easy-going, slightly shabby and almost-secretive restaurantit is so discreetly situated inside the neighbourhood club (lovely lawn!) that one wont have any idea of its existence while walking on the road outside.The restaurant is open to non-members.Come around 4pm when you might have the entire place to yourself.First Published: Jul 26, 2019 15:26 IST"

The thundershowers are dark omens of waterlogging, waist-deep water at Lalbaug, a crippled Central Railway. But the Mumbaiite does not fear the waves that lash Marine Drive. He has learnt how to survive the potholes, wade through the currents and embrace the red rivulets that stream across Shivaji Park.He knows that an umbrella is an extraneous appendage and a raincoat a waste of time. When it rains in Mumbai, as it has in the 50 years of my memory, what happens, happens. We get drenched, we take holidays, we wade through floodwater, jump onto whatever BEST bus passes by, help push taxis that have stalled and are stranded in the glut.The other thing we Mumbaiites do is eat.My school was in low-lying Byculla and even a little rain would mean our football field was ankle-deep in muddy water. Sometimes, wed file into the school bus at 7.45 am sharp, but by the time we got to school 15 minutes later, a holiday had been declared. Wed all turn back with a feeling that I rarely feel nowadays  a sense of absolute and utter freedom.Either Id jump right back on the bus and head home, or wed cross the road and go to a little place called Queen Marys Caf to eat some breakfast. Breakfast when it poured was hot Omelette Pav; a two-egg omelette spiked with green chillies and onion; a plate of Special Kheema served with hot Laadi Pav; and a cup of hot Irani chai. On some days, Id skip the omelette and ask the guy to serve the kheema with a half-fry on top. Half-fry, as you know, is Bambaiya for an egg sunny side up. Let me tell you, the joy of soaking a slice of pav in the yolk of the egg and mopping up some oily mince is unparalleled, especially if its raining outside and the water is threatening to creep into the roadside caf.Pakoras and bhajiyas, baarish and tea, these are a few of my favourite things.I grew up at Chowpatty, where Caf Ideal, a corner restaurant with French windows, offered views of the lashing waves and the beach. Caf Ideal is the only vegetarian Irani restaurant I know of. They serve eggs, though, and on such a day, sitting by an open window, the rain coming down in torrents, the air wet and the throat parched, a bottle of London Pilsner and a plate of cheese and corn balls was bliss. Also a Parsi Akuri with Brun Pav, with a side order of Veg Patti Samosa.On a grey rainy day, a bunch of us would sometimes board the BEST Bus No 123, a route that had only double-decker buses. Wed clamber in just before Marine Drive. If you were lucky to get the front row on the upper deck, it was a breezy ride with the sea lashing to your right and palms swaying to your left and no one in between.En route to Colaba, there were stops we could make. Often we would disembark at Churchgate and go to Pizza by the Bay, with its bay windows opening onto the sea. Or stop over at Gaylord, whose al fresco section has wrought iron chairs and serves snacks all day. Hot buttered bread rolls, with a pot of mint tea. Or Grilled Chicken Sandwiches with Hot Chocolate. And you could always step into their patisserie and get yourself a large chunk of meringue or a slice of lemon tart.The 123 goes down Colaba Causeway and stops right outside Kailash Parbat. If you havent tried a steaming hot plate of Ragda Patties or Ragda Samosa with chutney and pickled onions on a very wet day, you havent experienced heaven yet. If you want to do the Pakoda in the rain thing, then their Sindhi Bhajiyas and Bhee (lotus stem) Pakodas are a treat.When one felt richer, there was always Sea Lounge at The Taj. An occasional snooty eyebrow would arch as wed stumble in with wet rubber chappals and dripping shorts, not a care in the world, preferring to sit on those cane sofas on the open verandah instead of in the carpeted, air-conditioned section. Wed watch the sea, grey and snarly, a lonely dinghy bobbing atop it, the waves trying to break the barriers of the Gateway and come across the road.Wed order the Cona Coffee in round-bottomed flasks, with Mumbai Toastie Sandwiches and a plate of really expensive Sev Puri. As the sky grew darker, wed walk along the pier munching on hot bhutta, freshly coal-grilled, rubbed with a wedge of lemon dipped in salt and chilli powder.I dont do these things anymore. Though I do enjoy sitting on the verandah at the Willingdon Club with a hot bowl of Cream of Asparagus Soup, as the water cascades down its colonial columns and onto the golf course. Or sipping a malt and chomping on Golden Fried Prawns on the terrace of the Chambers at the Taj, as the top of the Gateway of India peers through the trees and the cloudburst.Or simply looking out at the old trees getting drenched outside my big window at home and eating a bowl of piping hot, freshly made Maggi. Which brings me to the point Im trying to make. That no real Mumbaiite fears the rain.First Published: Jul 26, 2019 21:45 IST"

Reason: The Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission (KAPC) has advised the farmers to stop growing tomatoes and go in for potatoes or onions instead. The suggestion comes in the wake of the worsening water crisis and depleting groundwater levels in the region. The Commission has written to the state and central governments to change the crop cultivation area.The tomato-growing season is from May to August. Tomatoes are supplied to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, New Delhi, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.Of the total 33,000 hectares under horticultural crop cultivation, 8,000 ha are under tomato cultivation in Kolar. According to horticulture department, on an average, 4 lakh tonnes of tomato per year are cultivated.Farmers in Kolar have to go up to 2,000 feet to get groundwater to grow tomatoes. The commercial crop is high in demand, but farmers are suffering, T N Prakash Kammardi, Chairman, KAPC, told TNIE.Farmers in Kolar have to go up to 2,000 feet to get groundwater to grow tomatoes. The commercial crop is high in demand, but farmers are suffering. So we have suggested that Kolar is no more ideal to grow tomatoes. It has also been suggested that the government look into the issue at the earliest as this plays a vital role in crop pricing, T N Prakash Kammardi, Chairman, KAPC, told TNIE.CR Srinath, CMR Tomato Mandi, APMC Yard, Kolar, said that the proposal was good. Farmers spend around Rs 1 lakh per acre to cultivate tomatoes. This high investment pays off because tomato is a commercial crop. Of late, the farmers are facing many problems. Kolar farmer favour cultivating tomatoes because of the soil and climate. But now the groundwater is contaminated with fluoride and pesticides are being used indiscriminately. Earlier, farmers used to grow potatoes. But they turned to tomatoes as this was more profitable. It looks like now the farmers will have to go back to growing potatoes.The Commission has also suggested that farmers in the Mumbai-Karnataka region drop sugarcane cultivation due to the water crisis. Since sugarcane is a water-intensive crop, the Commission suggested cultivating onion and jowar. Shivashankar Reddy, outgoing agriculture minister, had agreed in principle to these proposals. Now after the fall of the coalition government, the proposals have to wait for the new governments clearance."
2019-07-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-simple-yet-complex-flavours-of-naga-food/article28727295.ece,The simple yet complex flavours of Naga food,"Nagalands cuisine, is usually clubbed under North Eastern Cuisine with the rest of the seven sister states. This is a disservice, because its distinct, from other North East cuisine. Karen Yepthomi of the Dzouka Tribal kitchen is helming an ongoing food festival in the city, thats a must visit for those who love heat, simplicity and complexity in their dishes. [Nagalands] local cuisine stands out in terms of taste as well as variability, says Yepthomi. A visibly excited Chef Paul Kinny, Culinary Director at St Regis, says A lot of research, hard work and excitement has gone into this festival.Naga cuisine is simple in its meal composition  indigenous red and other rice varieties are central to the diet and eaten either boiled or steamed accompanied by a meat dish of some kind (either fresh, smoked or dry), boiled vegetables (a simple soupy dish to neutralise fat from the meats and wash down the meal) and assorted condiments (largely fermented food and or chilli based) to spice things up. The complexity lies in the staggering diversity of ingredients. Rice, meat, fish, molluscs, crustaceans, arachnids, and a plethora of home grown and foraged vegetables, dried, preserved and fermented foods, indigenous herbs and spices are all available in the Naga kitchen. A typical meal includes a meat dish, and sometimes even simple dishes may have a chunk or two of meat added for flavour. There are no dainty bite-sized offerings; meat dishes unapologetically boast large, chunky pieces of meat. Big cubes of pork, with chunks of fat is de rigueur. Add to that a variety of sun dried and smoked meats preserved for use all-year round.As side salads, the ubiquitous boiled vegetables literally vegetables boiled with hint of salt, at most, so their real flavour prevail. These vary from cabbage, long beans, and gourds to seasonal greens cooked individually or in combinations. Yepthomi showcases vegetables admirably, her salad of Red Flint Corn Salad combined slightly fruity kernels of corn bursting with flavour with subtle heat from Raja Mirch and Naga garlic. Its a cuisine that uses little or no oil at all, instead employing culinary techniques that bring out the natural juices and fats of vegetables and meats. A dish that underlined this, was the Smoked Chicken with Naga Ginger, which brilliantly combined smoky flavours with aromatic spicy notes of Naga ginger.Its Naga cuisines deftness with flavours which is integral to dishes and yet does not overpower the flavours of vegetables or meats. Most often, dishes literally, boil down one or two specific ingredients added for flavour such as Pumpkin curry with Napa (Wild Lemon Basil) or Yam with dried Roselle flowers. The Naga cook has access to a staggering variety of indigenous spices, herbs and flavourings. Yepthomi showed me ingredients such as momg-monm (Naga variety of Sichuan peppercorn), Naga ginger, garlic (Chinese onion) raja mirch and more that she uses. One of the standout dishes was Rosep Aon, which is assorted vegetables, beans, greens, karela cooked with likok a kind of bitter brinjal, bamboo shoot vinegar and chilli. Full of texture and flavour, the bitter notes worked like a palette cleanser between bites of other dishes.Another vital element is fermented flavours. From axoni (pronounced Akhuni) to bastenga (fermented bamboo shoot), fish and lots more is fermented  to be used in dishes as well as to make chutneys and condiments. A classic condiment is the axoni and raja mirch chutney. In direct contrast to all the simple cooking, subtle flavourings and hero ingredients is the flamboyant Naga love for fiery heat. The state is home to the legendary raja mirch (aka bhoot jolokia / ghost pepper), and other less potent members of the capsicum genus. These add serious oomph, sometimes in small measure to dishes like a pomelo salad. Most meals will always have a condiment or two made with chillies. A mind blowing (literally and figuratively) Naga Raja Mircha and Yard Long Bean chutney was on offer when I visited. I am told that the rotating menu promises a few more through the festival. Its yet another reason to go back for a second taste of unforgettable Naga food.The Heritage from Nagaland cuisine festival is ongoing at The Seven Kitchens at St. Regis, until July 28."

Ive been cooking them for 18 years. Growing up in New Delhi, it was amusing to find so many authentic kebab joints dotted along the streets.Although Chennai has a few eateries that offer kebabs, we wanted to organise a whole festival themed around it. Some kebabs are prepared in tandoor and some are tawa-fried. As you indulge in the diversity of options, you will eventually be able to pick out the distinct flavours. Weve given a good set of choices to vegetarians as well, said executive chef Amit Thapliyal who joined the hotel two weeks back.Smoking hot delightsThe strong aroma from burnt flavours of kebab wafts through the air. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian platters served to us look appetising. We take our first bite with kadak seekh kebab  crisp lamb rolls filled with masala cheese. Moist on the inside, little dry on the outside, this one was just a sample of what was going to take over our senses. The kamli kebab or chicken drumsticks paired with mint chutney and seasoned onion rings became an instant hit with us. It was a perfect melt-in-the-mouth, and the tanginess of the chutney spiked the flavours of this best-selling combination.The vegetarian menu comprises vegetable galouti, makai kebab, matar ki tikki, achari paneer tikka, aloo shakarkhand, mirch pyaz ki kebab, tandoor phool, kurkure khumb, subz seekh, and tandoori ananas.

Sometimes we refrigerate the masala for three days. How much of it is absorbed depends on the choice of meat. Ive also used cheese in the marination for selective varieties. Some kebabs are constant while the rest of the menu keeps changing.A couple of south Indian masalas with coconut and peppercorn as base has been introduced to cater to the local crowd, said the chef. Overall, the kebabs are sufficient to satiate your appetite. Guests can avail their regular buffet with a line-up of desserts to wrap up a light dinner.

Complete with a slight tangy flavour, the triangular dumpling is on the bland side, and will be liked by people who like their food steamed up.Coming to the appetizers, we loved the Crispy Fish Salad in Spicy Sauce, a unique dish topped with onions, coriander leaves, French beans, spring onions, tomatoes and cashews. Like the name says, the fish had been minced, tossed with bread crumbs and deep fried in order to make it thoroughly crisp. The sauce enhanced the flavour, and the dish gets itself placed on one of the must-haves here.In order to make lunch hours faster and easier for working professionals in and around Whitefield, the restaurant has introduced a Make your own bowl concept for this monsoon season. From a variety of noodles to sauces and choice of toppings, the Asian bowl will be rightly put together according to your preference. We chose Pad Thai noodles with chicken and prawns, seasoned with onions, tomatoes, cabbage and spring onions in chilli garlic sauce. We kept it simple and voila, we didnt make a nasty choice of ingredients after all.To end an Asian culinary experience, we took Sang Kaya Ob. It is baked coconut caramel custard and the taste lingers in our taste buds till date. One bite of the dessert and we immediately knew this was the winner of the entire course.Cost for two: 3,000 (approx)"

Yogesh Thorat, managing director of the MAHAFPC  the consortium of FPCs in Maharashtra  said this was their first step in entering the retail market.AdvertisingAlong with pulses and spices, NAFED  the procurement arm of the central government  also retails Assam tea, both in bags and powder form. This tea is sold through NAFEDs outlets and online channels. Thorat said MAHAFPC has been accorded the status of stockists by NAFED to sell the tea. Its been just a month since we started this exercise and we have sold 10 tonnes of tea, he said.The model adopted by MAHAFPC is simple. They get the tea from NAFED and village-level FPCs procure it from them at a concessional rate to sell in villages. FPCs are able to sell the tea at Rs 260 per kg. As and when FPCs place demand for the tea, we replenish their stock and place orders for more from NAFED, he said. NAFED operates a tea factory in Assam and has nominated stockists across the country.FPCs entering the retail chain marks a significant step for them, because these village-level companies have been only concentrating on the wholesale procurement of foodgrain since their inception. MAHAFPC has been given the status of State Level Agency (SLA) by the state government and was involved in the procurement of pulses, acting as sub-agents of NAFEDs under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). They have also worked towards procuring onions under the Price Support Fund (PSF) to create a buffer stock of onion to be disposed of as and when required. Some of the FPCs had taken up seed production and are also involved in the sale of fertilisersAdvertisingThorat said it was felt that FPCs should diversify their businesses to generate more revenues and better sustain themselves. The FPCs are village-level organisations so they can easily enter retail markets, he said.Based on the feedback, FPCs will plan their growth in the retail space. The pilot project is being taken up in districts of Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Beed and Aurangabad."

(iStock)Sir  It has become commonplace for the Bengali bhadralok to express a virulent distaste for anything vegetarian. Yet Bengal has a rich tradition of serving a variety of such dishes; items like fish and mutton are just a part of a diverse meal. The Bengali kitchen churned out dishes ranging from the simplest mashed potato enlivened with mustard oil, green chillies and onion to a miscellany of vegetables that are fried, boiled, roasted or combined with other veggies and seasoned with spices. But the anxiety of meat and fish disappearing from plates across the country is causing the Bengali to rebel against vegetables in general.Kalyan Banerjee,CalcuttaNo one is surprised at the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy in Karnataka PTIPower gamesSir  No one is surprised at the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy in Karnataka. The Aya Ram, Gaya Ram culture in Indian politics that began in the 1970s is now a flourishing business of sorts. One could hope that the Narendra Modi government, which has a huge majority, will bring a more stringent anti-defection law to put an end to this unethical practice. But alas, toppling state governments headed by parties other than the BJP seems to be a priority for the saffron outfit.One only needs to look at the Madhya Pradesh leader of the Opposition, Gopal Bhargava, for proof. Bharghava shamefully claimed that the Congress government in the state would collapse in 24 hours if the Number 1 or Number 2 in the Bharatiya Janata Party issue an order to that effect. The way the BJP is proceeding by grabbing power in one state after another, it seems that its dream of one nation, one election will soon be fructified. India is undoubtedly headed towards becoming a totalitarian state.Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,FaridabadSir  The editorial, Steep fall (July 25), raises a pertinent question regarding the ease with which legislators defect en masse to change the fortunes of political parties without caring for the peoples mandate. This is a breach of fundamental democratic principles. The anti-defection law is not strong enough, making life easier for turncoats. When an elected representative changes his political affiliation, he must be made to seek re-election. This is the only way to ensure that democratic principles are not trifled with.Birkha Khadka Duvarseli,SiliguriSir  The collapse of the coalition government in Karnataka was expected. Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) are traditional rivals who came together not for the betterment of the electorate but to keep the BJP from coming to power. The relationship between the coalition partners was uneasy from day one. As is the case with most political alliances based on compromises, the denial of ministerial berths proved to be the undoing of the Congress-JD(S) combine. It is encouraging that the party in power at the Centre will also be ruling Karnataka. People in the state can now hope to be treated on a par with the citizens of other states.K.V. Seetharamaiah,Hassan, KarnatakaSir  The Congress-JD(S) alliance are as much to be blamed for the state of affairs in Karnataka as the BJP. Each political party is only concerned about holding on to power. When does the government have time to focus on welfare measures if it is busy ensuring that its members do not defect? The BJP is not different. In state after state, members conveniently defect to its benefit. In Bengal, the prime minister openly claimed that he was in touch with elected representatives from the Trinamul Congress. Democracy has gone for a toss in the country.Sanjukta Das,CalcuttaModernity callsSir  The Rajasthan High Court has taken a long overdue step by directing lawyers to dispense with the colonial practice of addressing judges as My Lord or Your Lordship and asked that they simply be called Sir (Dear Sir, July 25). Similarly, the British left the country over seven decades ago, but lawyers in India still have to wear the long black robes that were customary back in colonial times. It is time such superfluous rituals are done away with. Further, it is expected that the directive of the Rajasthan High Court will be applicable all across the country. There is also ample scope of simplifying the language of the legal documents, which are drafted using unnecessary jargons, complicating matters for lay citizens not trained in law.Asit Kumar Mitra,CalcuttaSir  It is heartening to note that the suggestion to address judges as Sir instead of My Lord or Your lordship has come from the judiciary itself. The change in salutation will be a step towards bringing equality between the dispensers of justice and lawyers. One only hopes that this initiative will be the forerunner of other, much-needed judicial reforms .Tarsem Singh,Hoshiarpur, PunjabSir  Cumbersome robes and needless courtesies only come in the way of dispensing swift justice. The directive of the Rajasthan High Court is, thus, heartening. The apex court should now officially ensure that such gratuitous practices are done away with.Rima Roy,Calcutta"

2019-08-02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/riding-the-tractor-to-independence/article28789066.ece,Riding the tractor to independence,"For most of her adult life, Vandana Sonawane had not driven a vehicle. The farmer from Manegaon village in Sinnar taluka, Nashik, now confidently drives her tractor through her field.The last time I rode anything was a bicycle, that too in school, says Ms. Sonawane. I was scared at first, but then I thought, women need to gain knowledge if they want to get anywhere in life. Despite my fear, I rode a tractor and it raised a lot of eyebrows.Ms. Sonawane went on, undeterred. And when a Marathi newspaper carried her photograph, she had her moment in the sun. Her relatives began to congratulate her.She is hungry for more. A lot of us have never even gone to an Agricultural Produce Market Committee. I want to go there to sell my produce, and have learnt how to check the rates (of crops) on my mobile phone.Ms. Sonawanes transformation has come steadily, as women in her village in the drought-hit taluka prepare to learn and experiment with new farm techniques to tackle crop failure.A corporate social responsibility initiative has ensured that they are responsible for their farms, and have decision-making power as against earlier, when they were workers in the family farm.We did not have a say in what crop to grow, what techniques to use, where to sell it. Now, we have our own farmlands and are taking those decisions, said farmer Jyoti Ambekar.Acknowledge, EmpowerIn October 2017, Mahindra & Mahindra unveiled Prerna, to empower women farmers through its Farm Equipment sector. With women as the change makers in agriculture, the idea was to acknowledge their contributions and empower them through opportunities to help them become better farmers, thereby improving their lives, said a company note.The initiative consists of direct access to knowledge of improved agricultural practices, introduction of farm tools and technology for reducing farm drudgery and increasing productivity, with the ultimate objective to improve income.In the first phase, Prerna reached out to 40 villages in Odisha over the past 18 months, covering 2,000 women farmers. In its second phase, it covered 60 villages in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.Prerna has been working in six clusters across these States for the past six months. The company aims to reach 6,000 women farmers.In Manegaon, organisers chose 100 women as Champion Farmers from among those who have at least one acre land, have access to water and were interested in the initiative. The idea was that these 100 would reach out to 1,000 others.Sinnar has been drought-prone for years and farmers have traditionally been growing onions and other vegetables. But Prerna introduced green peas in the region as it requires less water.The innovation did not meet with immediate acceptance. Farmers were apprehensive about growing new crops since water in the region is limited. Most families have continued with their traditional crops and techniques and set aside land for crops like green peas and soyabean.Farmers are being given constant guidance through WhatsApp. They share pictures of their farm processes and receive tips.Acheiving a balanceWomen were taught how to process seeds using a seed treatment drum that involves putting a medicine in with the seeds for a few hours to improve yield. If seeds are sowed directly, their germination speed is slow but using this process, it becomes faster, said Prashant Dudhade of BAIF Development Research Organisation, Prernas partner non-governmental organisation.The farmers would add fertiliser later in the process, but were taught to do so after sowing. Since we knew they would not agree to organic fertilizers or pesticides immediately, we taught them to balance both, said Mr. Dudhade.Women have been also maintaining a record of their farms, from the time they do the sowing to how many times they use fertilisers and pesticides, the date of the first germination, and so on.The farm equipment and tractors have been of help, although few in the taluka have actually begun to use them. Some cannot afford to lease or buy the equipment, and since it is peak season, most of it is already rented.Of the 100 women we trained in using farm equipment, about half decided to take further training and four of them successfully ploughed their farms using a tractor this season. We are hoping the numbers will increase with time, said Mr. Dudhade.Prerna has planned a Customer Hiring Centre in the taluka with women as stakeholders. About 10 women will run it, while the rest will be allowed to rent farm equipment. Preference, though, will be given to Prerna women.The ones who are using the equipment are relieved. Ploughing using bullocks costs 800 per 0.5 acres while through tractors, it only costs 600, said farmer Mathura Sonawane.For Sangita Sonawane, it was about reducing stress. Since we women did most of the farm labour, our back, legs and hands would hurt. There is also no escaping the household chores. We were relieved when the equipment was introduced to us, she said.Combating stereotypesThe going hasnt always been easy, though. There are stereotypes to combat, and dismantling power structures will take a while.My neighbour laughed at me when he saw me sowing groundnut using the token method (also called the dribbling method, where seeds are sown deep in the ground manually and the flow of water is designed to give optimum yield), said Poonam Sonawane, another champion farmer. He said, Is this what champions do? I was embarrassed. I hope I prove him wrong.Whether at home or outside, the women still do not call the shots. They have spent nearly 15,000 on their farms, loaned to them by their husbands  and that, in a sense, makes them beholden. Asked how they would spend the income from their farms, many said it would be a decision they would take along with their husbands.Still, theres one thing they know for sure: they are on the right path. Apart from the learning, most of them said they wanted to bring more women into the fold."
2019-08-02,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/around-31-restored-paintings-based-on-the-life-of-adi-sankaracharya-are-on-display-at-art-and-mind-art-gallery-in-north-paravur/article28797019.ece,How 40 kgs of onions were used to restore paintings on the life of Adi Sankaracharya,"In 2018, when artist Saju Thuruthil, head of the Fine Arts Department, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit (Kalady), saw for the first time, after the floods, the condition of the Universitys 31 oil paintings based on the life of Adi Sankaracharya, he was shocked. College had re-opened after the floods, and we had opened the Kanakadhara auditorium. Cleaning was being done and we had opened it for classes. Thats when we discovered the paintings  some had fallen off, the frames of some had broken. It was a very sad spectacle, recalls Saju.A trained art conservationist and art restorer, from the National Museum Institute (Delhi) Saju offered to restore the paintings as was possible. On getting the go-ahead from the University VC, Dr Dharmaraj Adatt, he embarked on an eight-month long effort to restore the 6ft by 4ft paintings. Cleaned and restored, the works by Thiruvananthapuram-based artist JR Palakkal, believed to have been done in the early 90s, are on show at the Art and Mind Art Gallery in North Paravur at an exhibition, Sree Sankaram 2019.The oil paintings, in the hybrid Indo-European style called company painting, were done 25 years ago for the University. The series has 32 paintings (32 is symbolic of the years the philosopher lived). The series charts the course of his journey through episodes in his life, from his parents moving to Kalady till his passing. The last painting, of Adi Sankaracharya, hangs undamaged in the University  this work is not on show at the exhibition. The response has been amazing...teachers from nearby schools brought students to exhibition. They were able to show Sankaracharyas story to the kids, who have lessons based on his life.He hadnt expected the restoration to take so much time. I thought, at the most, it would take two months, but I had misjudged the damage. There were several layers of dirt and fungus on the paintings. Then there was humidity  these were hung in the auditorium which has air holes for ventilation. These extreme conditions wreaked havoc on the paintings. The works were restored at the art gallery, which is also Sajus studio.Saju explains that he brought the paintings to the studio in North Paravur as the floods had almost destroyed his house-cum-studio in Kalady. He had lost a number of his works there, he and his family had moved to the first floor studio space.The restoration had to be executed carefully; in this case it was more conservation. The 51-year-old artist explains, We had to first remove mud and dust from the paintings, only then did we remove the paintings from the frame. After which we dried the canvas in the sun, not under direct sunlight which was followed by rubbing the paintings with onions, to remove fungus and bacteria. Then wiped with isopropyl alcohol (diluted in water) and also acetone  these dont damage the works. He offers as an interesting nugget that they used 40 kilos of onion for the conservation. Primarily a mural artist, Saju has restored murals in 14 temples across the State.Each process had to be done carefully, lest it do more damage to the already diseased canvas for which reason he skipped a few things. Mainly I did not stretch/tighten the canvas when we re-framed them, might have caused more tearing which I wanted to avoid.Saju agrees that 25 years is not a long time, but the extremes these works faced exacerbated the condition. He consulted with other restorers while he worked on these paintings, inputs from others would only help, I believe. If there is a better way of doing something then why not plus these are valued works. I didnt want to take a chance. Also it helps when an artist does the restoration he understands the canvas and the work on it. The original artists signature on the work should never be lost because of either conservation or restoration. Saju was assisted on this effort by an assistant, Vinayan. Saju says he couldnt find the artist, JR Palakkal, despite several attempts.The idea of the show came from the response of those who came to see him at work. There was so much curiosity about the works and Sankaracharya, I felt we ought to show the works.  As part of the exhibition, conducted in association with the Fine Arts department and the Vedanta department of the Sree Sankaracharya University, a seminar on Adi Sankaras philosophy was held and also a music concert of the philosophers kritis.The future of the paintings, Saju says, lies in a museum of art planned at the University. The VC has said that the paintings will get the pride of place at the show. The show concludes on August 5, for details contact 9496576876."

While Patio 805 (yet another address-encrusted name) does not offer dreamy limestone cliffs topped by a rain forest, it does offer authentic pan Asian fare.Founded by Nirav Rajani and his Vietnamese wife, Diep Vu Ngoc, Patio 805 offers Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Malaysian and Chinese cuisine. The fact that Patio 805 serves vegetarian food is big bonus for all those who carp about there not being enough vegetarian options in far-eastern cuisine.Located in Jayanagar, the stone and green dcor is pleasing to the eye and echoes the outdoorsy vibe of a patio. We start with Vietnamese bun nuoc soup where sweet, salt and sour blend excellent well with the delicate rice vermicelli while the lemongrass flavour is just strong enough to be noticed but not overpower.Patio 805 Ground Floor #805, 35th C Cross Road, 4th Block Jayanagar,8884999805Ambience: Minimal, contemporarySpeciality: Vietnamese coconut rice, stir-fried water chestnutsWallet Factor: 1,000The Thai green papaya salad finds juliennes of carrot and papaya working well in a sweet and sour Thai dressing and oh for the crunch of peanuts! Stir fried water chestnut was the winner in the starters game. With a spicy Manchurian sauce, capsicum and onion, it was crisp as it was comforting. The deep fried Thai wonton looked like little golden purses stuffed with cottage cheese and sweet corn.Let it not be said that we stuffed ourselves with fried comestibles. The Vietnamese rice paper roll stuffed with fresh cucumber, carrot, spring onion, coriander, mint and rice noodles was a delicate dream. And then there were the dim sums in their little bamboo basket  mixed vegetable and cheese. For the main course the Vietnamese coconut rice cooked in coconut milk was delightfully different from our south Indian version and went perfectly well with the five-spice curry.Dessert was Nutella waffles, which was rather underwhelming. I should have opted for a Vietnamese coffee. So the next time you long for a trip down Halong Bay, take the metro instead to Patio 805."

Veer Bazaar (Thursday market) at New Rajendra Nagar in Delhi offered, and possibly continues to offer, a smrgsbord of goodies for every possible buyer.The real stars of the bazaar, vegetable vendors from the hinterland, sat deep inside the heart of this shanty that would crop up once a week. And this is where we headed every week for the freshest of produce  bright green palak and methi, pearly-white mooli and cauliflower, red carrots for halwa, water chestnuts during the season, pods bursting with green peas, plump parwal and purple eggplant...the list was endless.But we had a stop before that. Cutting through all the noise and clutter and peoples voices was the aroma of just-cooked food. Is there a word for the mehak (fragrance) of freshly-fried salty with a hint of sweet bhatura? Or for the puff of steam that rises when the finger makes a dent in the oblong bhatura? Ill get to the chole, a dark-brownish black thanks to the sachets of tea powder dropped into the bubbling cauldron, in a bit.Market anticsIts been 17 years since I left Delhi, but fond memories drop by to say hello every now and then. In the five-odd years I lived there, some routines never changed  Thursdays dinner for my husband and me, and Sunday brunch for the former. Thursday was my weekly off at the news agency where I worked, and it coincided with Veer Bazaar.Sheela Aunty, who is possibly smiling now from heaven reading this, and I would wash our casseroles and dabbas, and carry these along with the bags for vegetables.The dabbas would be dropped off at cholewale bhaiyya. It was a rite, almost to convince ourselves that some good would emerge out of this Thursday evening expedition. Our dabbas would join the long line of containers already sitting patiently on a counter while a chhotu would bag the onions and pickled mango and carrot that accompanied every parcel. Half an hour of shopping later, we would have just enough money left to pick up the chole-bhature and hire a ride back home.The cholewale corner was a beehive of activity. Some men would be patiently pulling out small bits of dough and rolling them into small roundels before semi-stretching them. As soon as we identified our dabbas, the bhaiyya would stretch the bhatura further and slip the hand-shaped dough into the dark hot oil.Hed fish them out as soon as they resembled puffy off-white rugby balls and pack them in the casseroles. The chole would be put into another dabba, ready to be heated before being served at home. Even after all these years, though people tell me I make good chole, its nowhere near my gold standard  that dark flavourful concoction spiced just right and flavoured by the swirling dust of New Rajendra Nagar. Its texture was neither thick nor runny, but just perfect to scoop out with a piece of bhatura. No spice overpowered the masala; it was like theyd become best friends during the hours of simmering, helping each infuse the others special secret, but also remove any sharp edges from the flavour profile.Bhatura dramaSome days, overwhelmed by the aroma, Id order a single bhatura to eat right there at the shop, and convince the utterly dignified Sheela Aunty to take a bite too. All charged up, we would head home to our banker-husbands. They would have missed all the drama associated with the chole-bhature, but the sheer taste made up for it, I guess.Sundays usually meant the early morning shift at United News of India, and I would head out by 7.45 a.m. And my husband would wait patiently for the street vendor who brought chole-kulche just in time for Sunday brunch. This bhaiyya, always in a spotless white kurta-pyjama, rode royally into Old Rajendra Nagar on his bicycle. He had a peculiar sing-song voice. His call was usually OoooooOoooooOOOOooooo, and as if he were the Pied Piper, children and adults would make a beeline for his cycle, plates in tow. He sold pre-made kulcha, which he would quickly heat on a kerosene-fuelled stove attached to his cycle carrier. The chole would emerge from a huge dabba hanging from one handle. This was quite the poor cousin of the Veer Bazaar version, but had its dedicated army of followers. Was it the way he called out his wares, or was it the joy of seeing him create culinary magic from a bicycle?In those narrow bylanes of both the Rajendra Nagars, I discovered and embraced a food routine that also served as a socialising tool. Now I live thousands of kilometres away in a coastal city, and that particular chole-bhature thrives only in my memory.SUNDAY RECIPERoadside choleDear friend and chef and restaurateur Rangeeta Murada, a fellow Rajendra Nagar resident, says the secret of perfect roadside chole is generous quantities of dalda and baking soda, something no one will admit to adding.Photo: Getty Images/ iStockINGREDIENTSKabuli chana  1 cupChana dal  1/4 cupGheeGingerSaltMETHOD1.

And to make matter worse, there has been a continuous flow of rumours for the past few days.On Sunday morning, a rumour started circulating that the state flag of J&K was taken down from the civil secretariat in the heart of the city, until civil servant-turned-politician Shah Faesal dispelled it by posting pictures of the flag fluttering alongside the Tricolour on the top of secretariat. Dont pay heed to rumours, he said.For the past week, there has been speculation that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government could be preparing the ground to scrap Article 35A of the Indian Constitution that gives special privileges to permanent residents of the state.The deployment of a large number of security personnel and curtailment of the Amarnath Yatra have added to the concerns that something ominous would happen in the state, which is currently under Presidents Rule.An uneasy calm prevailed in the Valley on Sunday. Residents were out on the streets to stock up essentials. While most of the petrol pumps in Srinagar are running dry, one could see long queues outside the ones that are dispensing fuel. Shopkeepers said even their stocks were exhausting in the wake of the panic buying by residents in the past few days. Even forces personnel are stocking items; in the morning a team of officials took 250 bags of onion from the mandi, said Abdul Rashid, a vegetable vendor.Earlier, employees of the Srinagar Municipal Corporation and the staff at the hospitals have been asked to prepare their curfew passes. The authorities took our details for the curfew passes. It means curfew will be imposed, said an employee of SMC.According to officials, 25,000 additional troops have reached the Valley and been deployed in various areas.First Published: Aug 05, 2019 05:10 IST"

There appeared to be a let-up in the hill areas late on Sunday night, but it increased again in the evening of Monday.The people living particularly in habitations on the slopes of hills through which the Godavari flows heaved a sigh of relief when water level in the river fell by 1.5 feet at Bhadrachalam and the first warning was withdrawn in the early hours.

Though she didnt contest the elections due to her poor health, she hadnt said she intended to retire from politics.She rose in politics at a young age, but her detractors in the BJP called her an outsider to the Sangh, the partys ideological fountainhead. They labelled her a socialist nominee to the Janata Party government in Haryana under Devi Lal. Swaraj, however, would say it was her husband Swaraj Kaushal who should be called a socialist and that her father had been a swayamsevak.Sushma Swaraj with Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal and former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma and Union Parliamentary Affairs minister MAdan Lal Khurana at a press conference in 1998.(HT Photo)After losing in the parliamentary polls of 1980, 1984 and 1989 in Haryana, she did a stint in the Rajya Sabha before breaking her Lok Sabha jinx with a victory from South Delhi in 1996. She was made a cabinet minister in the 13-day government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and became a cabinet minister again after a win in 1998. Swaraj was made Delhis CM after Sahib Singh Verma stepped down in 1998, but the rising price of onions during her short tenure of about three months drew much criticism.In 1999, she contested against then Congress president Sonia Gandhi from Bellary in Karnataka. Though she had just 12 days to campaign, she lost to Gandhi by a margin of just 7%.During the second Vajpayee government, she briefly held the information and broadcasting portfolio during 2000-03. She also served as the minister for health, family welfare and parliamentary affairs from 2003 to 2004, when the NDA lost the election.She also made her mark as a powerful and articulate Hindi orator in Parliament who was just as well known for her quick wit.As Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha from 2009 to 2014, she was seen as one of the possible claimants in the BJP for the prime ministerial position. It was at this time that then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi went from strength to strength.She was considered to be close to BJP stalwart and former home minister LK Advani. Swaraj went on to become external affairs minister, taking the oath of office after only Modi and then BJP president Rajnath Singh. As the external affairs minister, Swaraj functioned in an understated manner, with Modi steering the foreign policy with an aggression seldom seen before. She actively used social media to engage with Indians around the world and to outline the governments position on key foreign policy issues. Swaraj also was known for responding to numerous requests for assistance from Indians in distress around the world.In this file photo dated Oct 3, 2018: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj greets Senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, at Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi. Swaraj who was on Tuesday night admitted to AIIMS, passed away. ( PTI )However, Swaraj faced accusations in 2015 of having lobbied on behalf of former Indian Premier League chief Lalit Modi after she recommended to the UK government that Modi, then a fugitive, could be provided travel documents to visit his wife, who was being treated for cancer in Portugal. She defended her decision by saying it was made on humanitarian grounds and was defended by both the BJP and the RSS.Born on February 14, 1952 at Ambala in Haryana, she earned a bachelors degree with majors in Sanskrit and political science from SD College before going on to study law at Panjab University in Chandigarh. During her political career, she was elected a Member of Parliament nine times and a member of the legislative assembly three times.She was married to Swaraj Kaushal, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court who served as governor of Mizoram during 1990-93 and was an MP during 1998-2004.Her stint as the external affairs minister was affected by poor health and she underwent a kidney transplant in 2016.First Published: Aug 07, 2019 00:55 IST"
2019-08-06,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sushma-swaraj-former-external-affairs-minister-dead-5884096/,Sushma Swaraj no more,"At 7.23 pm Tuesday, shortly after Lok Sabha cleared the governments decision to take away J&Ks special status and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories, Sushma Swaraj posted a congratulatory message on Twitter: Thank you Prime Minister. Thank you very much. I was waiting to see this day in my lifetime.AdvertisingHours later, the former External Affairs Minister, one of Indias most admired leaders, passed away. She was declared dead by doctors at the AIIMS in New Delhi. She was 67. She is survived by husband Swaraj Kaushal and daughter Bansuri.Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the nation in paying her tribute. A glorious chapter in Indian politics comes to an end. India grieves the demise of a remarkable leader who devoted her life to public service and bettering lives of the poor. Sushma Swaraj Ji was one of her kind, who was a source of inspiration for crores of people.BJP working president J P Nadda said Swarajs body will be kept at her home until 11 am Wednesday and will then be taken to the BJP headquarters on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg. The last rites will be performed at the Lodhi crematorium.AdvertisingStarting her political career under the Janata Party, Swaraj was elected to the Haryana assembly in 1977 and became a state minister at age 25. She was again elected to the assembly in 1987 when Devi Lal ousted the Congress from power that triggered an electoral cascade which eventually saw the Congress lose power at the Centre in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections.She came into national limelight because of her ideologically fierce oratory in Lok Sabha, especially during the 1996 trust vote. Her political articulation, drawn from Indias mythological traditions, endeared her to the common man who could grasp her arguments.Her political career was a trail blazer for many a woman politician  she graduated from student politics to state politics to national politics and became an icon. Her rise within the BJP, considered a party of conservatives, was testimony to her political acumen, courage and mass appeal.At the end of a long innings, she opted out of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and was left out of the new Cabinet. She remained politically senior to every important position-holder in the current BJP government. She was part of Atal Bihari Vajpayees 13-day government in 1996.A disciplined party worker, Swaraj was politically combative, never hesitating to wage a good battle for the sake of the party. She displayed this when the party deputed her to Delhi as its first woman Chief Minister just ahead of the 1998 assembly elections. The sky-rocketing onion prices, however, put paid to BJP hopes in the state as the Congress won the elections and Sheila Dikshit replaced her, only to continue for the next 15 years.But Swaraj did not lose heart and retained her political gumption. She jumped into the electoral fray against Congress president Sonia Gandhi, heading to Bellary in Karnataka during the 1999 Lok Sabha elections. Though she was pitchforked by the BJP at the very last moment to contest against the Congress president, she learnt a smattering of Kannada to connect with the electorate in Bellary, forcing a keen contest. She lost narrowly (by a margin of less than 60,000 votes) to Sonia from Bellary, a seat held by the party since 1952 and considered safe by the Congress for its party president.Groomed by party patriarch L K Advani as the next generation leader of the party, Swaraj worked under Prime Minister Vajpayee as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, and Health. Her crackdown against content being broadcast by FTV for the Indian audience created a flutter during her stint at the I&B. Though the move was frowned upon by a section of the industry, it burnished her image among the partys traditional support base across the country.Before the BJP was cast aside in the 2004 elections  it was the start of the BJPs decade-long political wilderness  Swaraj had raised the political stakes by declaring she would shave her head if Italy-born Sonia Gandhi was elected as Prime Minister. It defined her political contest with the Congress leadership.With Advani forced out of the leadership position after the partys crushing defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Sangh Parivar went for a recast of partys leadership. The next generation leadership of the party was assigned crucial responsibilities  Nitin Gadkari as party president, Sushma Swaraj as Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Arun Jaitley as Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha.In Lok Sabha, Swaraj led the BJP charge during an era which was described as one of policy paralysis with allegations of corruption hounding the Manmohan Singh government. In a verbal duel with the then Prime Minister over the 2G scandal, she told him: Tu idhar udhar ki baat na kar/ yeh bata ki kafila kyun luta/hamein rehzano se gila nahin/teri rehbari ka sawaal hai. On another occasion, when an Indian soldier was beheaded by Pakistanis, she outlined BJPs muscular outlook when she sought the heads of at least 10 Pakistani soldiers in return.As Leader of Opposition, she was widely considered the natural claimant for the partys leadership in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections given her long stint in national politics. But it was the BJP Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, who upstaged all internal calculations to become the prime ministerial candidate of the party.After the historic results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reposed his faith in Swaraj by appointing her as the External Affairs Minister, the countrys first full-time woman Foreign Minister.As a disciplined soldier of the party, she did not let her seniority over Modi in national politics come in the way. She remained a trusted member of the Cabinet Committee on Security. In fact, she began in right earnest when steered Indias diplomatic corps to get the UN declare June 21 as International Day of Yoga.AdvertisingThe party behind her, she staved off a controversy surrounding Lalit Modi in 2015. But her activities were constrained after her kidney ailment and treatment. Her health virtually grounded her from electioneering, and she devoted her time to External Affairs. It was her last public office, and also the one which won her many more admirers, even in Pakistan, given the spontaneity with which she would attend to Twitter requests for visas."

But even during that brief stint, Sushma Swaraj worked as if she was on a mission and did firefighting for the BJP in 1998, say those who worked with her when she reigns of the Delhi government.Then, an MP from South Delhi, Swaraj was appointed the Delhi CM on October 12, 1998, just months before the assembly elections in Delhi. She took charge from late Sahib Singh Verma, who served as the CM for two-and-a-half years.Reason for her selection as Delhi CMParty old-timers say Swarajs appointment was a desperate attempt to salvage the deteriorating situation just months before the assembly elections. The then BJP-led government under Verma had come under sharp criticism as it was unable to curb the price of onions, which was fast becoming an emotive issue. The party was also unable to address the demand for autorickshaw fare revision, and complaints of shortage of electricity, especially in unauthorised colonies had been increasing. The party wanted a new face to counter anti-incumbency.Verma was also engaged in a turf war with his predecessor late Madan Lal Khurana, who had to quit following allegations of corruption after his name appeared in the Hawala scam. After Khurana got a clean chit from the courts, he staked claim to chief ministership but Verma refused to relinquish the post.BJP leaders say this created an impression that the party was unable to govern Delhi. Sheila Dikshit, who was head of Congresss Delhi unit, was actively taking on the BJP government, holding protests against the onion prices. Elections were approaching. It was felt that a new face, especially a woman, would help the party. Swaraj then an MP from Delhi, said Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel, who worked with Swaraj twice in NDA-led government in 1999 and 2014.As Delhi CMIn her brief stint, Swaraj mostly had to firefight on several fronts. With the opposition upping the ante against the government, she formed a special committee to restore the supply of onions. She even ordered setting up vans for distribution of onions.Those who worked with her recall how she carried out surprise inspections, especially at police stations, at night. BJP veteran Ved Vyas Mahajan said, Police was not under the CM, but she would carry out inspections at police stations to see if they were working to address the problems of the people.However, her efforts did not succeed. It was too late by then, as the public had made up its mind to vote BJP out. But she worked as if she was on a mission and tried to control the situation. She would carry out inspections at government offices to ensure the official were working.Omesh Saigal, the chief secretary in Swarajs government, said, She had to grapple with a lot of issues. During her brief stint, she was fighting control price of onions due to the commoditys shortage. But she had very little time to make any significant impact.Her rapport with the bureaucracy played a vital role in her nearly two-month tenure. Jagdish Mukhi, governor of Assam and Mizoram (Additional charge), who was then finance minister, said, She was a very forward looking, positive and open to new ideas. She took the bureaucracy in confidence while working in the Delhi government, he said.SK Sharma, former Delhi assembly secretary, said Swaraj didnt call any session of the Assembly since she didnt get enough time. Sharma said Swaraj decided to resign as MLA from Hauz Khas to continue as MP from South Delhi after the BJP lost the 1998 assembly elections.First Published: Aug 07, 2019 21:22 IST"

Imports from Pakistan declined by 92 per cent to $2.84 million in March this year compared to $34.61 million in March 2018, according to the commerce ministry data.India imported goods such as cotton, fresh fruits, cement, petroleum products and mineral ore from Pakistan.

The country has repealed a security exception clause of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to withdraw this status. Both the countries are members of this body.India can also restrict trade of certain goods and impose port-related restrictions on Pakistani goods. India had granted the MFN status to Pakistan way back in 1996, but the neighbouring country had not reciprocated.Under the MFN pact, a WTO member country is obliged to treat the other trading nation in a non-discriminatory manner, especially with regard to customs duty and other levies."
2019-08-08,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/this-them-restaurant-lets-you-eat-and-swear-like-a-pirate/article28896806.ece,This theme restaurant in Chennai lets you eat and swear like a pirate,"For me, Talk Like A Pirate Day has arrived earlier than usual this year  just so you know, the day is celebrated on September 19. I am aboard The Black Pearl, a pirate-themed buffet restaurant at Sholinganallur junction on Old Mahabalipuram Road. With pirate caps on sale and an ongoing selfie contest, the restaurant intends to get its guests to participate in the theme.So, blimey! Why am I still talkin like a landlubber, and not like the true-blue sea dog that I am?I am just settlin in and the mobile beeps. Shiver me timbers, its a WhatsApp video call from my brood. I ignore it, thanks to the wisdom of the seas. As my two kids love role-playing games, I am not showing them where I am, and risking a cold reception later at home.With what looks like a labouriously-crafted decor offering vignettes of life aboard a pirate ship and statues and busts of characters from Pirates of the Caribbean, The Black Pearl creates a world of make-believe and role-playing that should naturally appeal to children. The evidence is not far to be seen: At the next table, the excitement on a childs face proves it.As I travel on The Black Pearl on a Monday, there is piped music, with the selection expectedly restricted to English songs (a live band plays on other days). The sounds are a tad too loud for my comfort. It can be an irritant while I am trying to catch up on scuttlebutt (gossip in my seafarers parlance) with my fellow liquor-guzzling buccaneers.Aaarrrggghhh! Now, the Pirate Tavern is a let-down. It presents a sight that a sailor of my stripes can never appreciate. Mocktails flow freely where liquor should. Joel Rajadurai, manager of the restaurant, explains, The liquor licence is expected to come, tentatively, before the end of August. Until then, it will be only mocktails.Now, the food is marked by variety, but sticks to the tried and tested, largely staying in Indian waters. In the main vegetarian section, the paneer Kolhapuri and pineapple sadam have been interestingly made and the results match the efforts. Paneer Kolhapuri is spicy without being hard on the oesophagus and stomach  and that comes from someone who battles GERD (a gastroesophageal issue). I learn that freshly-ground cashewnut paste takes the edge off the spices, which include Kashmiri chilli powder.Pineapple sadam, said to be a new addition to the menu, seems set to run for many weeks. Besides pineapple slices, peanuts and roasted channa dal are significant flavours apparent in the dish that is garnished with curry leaves.In the non-vegetarian main course, kozhi varutha curry packs a punch. Marinated chicken is sauted with onion and tomato sauce along with Indian spices. Mustard fish curry is bland in a nice way: catla fish is fried in mustard oil, and the gravy prepared with mustard sauce. The egg masala, though, can be improved upon: it comes with a gravy that is right for rice, but too thick for rotis.One gets a sense of a large spread, at the very beginning with the starters, which alone are served.For those choosing non-vegetarian fare, there is an on-table barbecue grill, with its offerings to choose from. The appetizers, small-eats and desserts section seems to beat the rest, in terms of items. There are dedicated counters for chaats and pizzas.The desserts section, with its sugar-overloaded shakarpara, jalebi with rabri and paan ice cream, closes the dining experience with a taste that is likely to linger on."

This is expected to go up once the formal trade ban is effected.ALSO READ| India's illegal move to revoke Article 370 will destroy regional peace, says Pakistan PM Imran KhanDespite tension between the two nations, total trade between the neighbours had risen by 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 to USD 2.56 billion, with India selling USD 2.07 billion worth of goods to its neighbour and Pakistan selling about USD 495 million worth of goods to India.The trade ban will have a marginal impact partly as trade would be pushed through Dubai and partly as the volume of trade is very low. However, border trade through Wagah in farm commodities such as tomatoes and onions will be left out in the cold as they cannot be transported through third countries, said Prof Biswajit Dhar of JNU.The major exports sent from India to Pakistan include raw cotton, cotton yarn, chemicals, plastics, manmade yarn and dyes. While India mostly imports fresh fruits, cement, petroleum products, bulk minerals and ores and finished leather from its western neighbour.ALSO READ| Pulwama-like attacks can happen after revocation of Article 370, says Pakistan PM Imran KhanPakistan maintains a negative list of 1,209 products that cannot be imported from India.

While the Delhi government was still reeling under the onion crisis, newly appointed chief minister Sushma Swaraj had another tough task at hand; the national capital was staring at a salt shortage. She had hardly completed a month in office.Though a rumour, salt shortage was looming large over the city. The government was on the back foot following the onion crunch. But Swaraj decided to lead from the front. She decided to crack down on godowns in north Delhi after the government received reports of hoarding, said MS Sehrawat, media adviser, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), who was attached to then civil supplies minister Poornima Sethi, as an information officer. Swaraj accompanied Sethi and other officials, who raided warehouses in Samaypur Badli and Alipur areas of north Delhi.READ HERE: RIP Sushma Swaraj - India loses its peoples minister, a powerful oratorThe raids continued for nearly five hours, Sehrawat said. She was an able administrator and a confident politician. However, she couldnt do much as she had just three months, he added.On October 12, 1998, Swaraj replaced Sahib Singh Verma, who had to step down in wake of the skyrocketing prices of onion. She remained at the helm just for 52 days.She had resigned from the Union cabinet to take oath as Delhis first woman CM.Omesh Sehgal, then chief secretary, echoed the sentiment, adding Swaraj was a fighter and a quick learner. When she took over, the city was grappling with onion and power shortage. Even though she was not getting any support from her party colleagues, she left no stone unturned to ease the pain of the common man. She set up a task force to tackle the issue (onion). She fought really hard but ultimately, it (onion price surge and power shortage) cost BJP the government, Sehgal recalled."

I spoke to her for a good 25 minutes at her daughters residence where she kept repeating that she was feeling fine and was okay. I still cant believe that the photo that we took together was our last.Senior Delhi BJP leaders said that Swaraj, who was appointed Chief Minister of Delhi between October and December 1998, was brought in to help the party tide through a tough phase  the Delhi Assembly elections.A new faceSushma Swarajwith former Prime Ministers I.K. Gujral and Chandrashekhar in May 1998. | Photo Credit: PTIA BJP leader recalled, The issue of skyrocketing onion prices and lack of cohesion between the two tallest leaders of the party at that time, Madan Lal Khurana and Sahib Singh Verma  both of whom who wanted the CMs chair  triggered the need for an internal party survey which called for the projection of a new face. Swaraj was that new face.Vijay Goel, who served with Swaraj in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Cabinet called her a disciplined party hand and a simple human being.Maintained a balanceShe was frank in her communication and was able to maintain a balance between being broad-minded in her thinking and traditional in her being just the way she conducted herself. For example, when she contested against [Congress leader] Sonia Gandhi from Bellary in 1999 she knew it would be an uphill task but she never questioned the partys decision to field her, he said.Sushma Swarajwith former Delhi Chief Minister M.L. Khurana. | Photo Credit: THE HINDU ARCHIVESRecalling her fondness for traditional festival, Mr. Goel said that for Swaraj, festivals like Teej and Karva Chauth were occasions that she celebrated with as many people as she could. BJP national executive member and former Delhi Mayor Arti Mehra recalled how Swaraj would both nurture and scold her as an elder sister .Grateful for guidanceShe was always frank about what she had to say. Both praise and criticism came with the same honesty. She may not have been very active in Delhis politics but her guidance on issues related to it was invaluable, Ms. Mehra said.As a first-time councillor in 1997, Mr. Gupta remembered with fondness the guidance he received from her as well as her dedication towards the cause of womens safety in Delhi.Sushma Swarajwith BJP president L.K.

Mr. Gupta said.Passionate personCongress leader Haroon Yusuf said, Swaraj was a very passionate person and while she was CM of Delhi in 1998 for the three months, any work that we, from the Opposition, approached her with, she was always willing to consider and help. We were never considered like Opposition MLAs during her tenure as CM and our suggestions were welcome.Sushma Swarajwith former Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma. | Photo Credit: V.V. KrishnanShe had many plans for Delhi at that time but her tenure was short and lasted only three months before the Congress came to power in the election that followed.

She insists that everybody sample a slice. Meanwhile, she takes a piece of tart and fills it with vegetable stuffing. This is Usha Seetharam for you. Exuberant, multi-tasker and a peoples person, Seetharam is the home-baker you want to have on your speed dial. After all, her bakes can cure every ache and comfort every weary soul. No wonder then her Instagram page, Ushbakeistan, is the virtual land with real goodness-filled goodies.My mother is a big inspiration. I vividly remember those round ovens she used to have. We had to lift the lid off, put the cake inside, and wait for the bell to buzz. I purchased a similar model of an oven in 2001. The aroma of freshly baked cake or bread gave me an adrenaline rush. The journey began then and theres been no looking back, said Usha. One of her first trysts with cooking was rose milk. The frothy delicious drink with crushed ice was her favourite. Seetharam is an environmental science graduate and has a Masters degree in Communication from Manipal University. She was born and raised in Bengaluru. The home-baker moved to the city in 2002. She worked in the corporate field and also in the radio industry for a brief period. In 2008, she got into professional baking after attending workshops. She took part in an event organised by Home Bakers Guild in 2011. After intermittent breaks, she has ventured full-time into baking for the past one year.My mother is a fantastic cook. I vividly remember her snack item called gold coin. Round slices of bread would be coated with mashed potato and then deep-fried. She would top it with onion slices, chutney and sev. She would go for all kinds of snack workshops to ensure that our evening tiffin wasnt repetitive. I have her recipe books till date and those gathered from my friends mothers. Alongside baking, I love regular cooking as well. I grew up with guests around and thats also a reason why I love hosting parties, reminisces Seetharam.The first cake she baked was for her husbands birthday  a chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream and coconut topping. Usha loves watching British cooking shows and takes inspiration from the techniques she watches on screen. My lactation cookies for feeding mothers are popular. Ive personally eaten them and theyve helped me to a great extent. Its eggless and has millets, jaggery, oats, flax, oats, fenugreek, and artisan chocolate. Alongside this, themed cakes, cookies, bread loaves and tarts are regulars, she said. Usha wants to master the nuances and fine-tune the processes of baking. She hopes to excel in her field while taking it slow. Usha takes orders and delivers across the city.For details, Instagram and Facebook page: Ushbakeistan or call: 9940196209"

According to Disaster management cell officials, a large part of the city was submerged or affected by the floods and included areas like the District collectorate, Mahavir Garden, Mahavir College, New Palace, Ramanmala and Bapat camp.Lack of power supply to large parts of Kolhapur had made life miserable with all routine activities having come to a standstill.In a statement, Vikas Puri, spokesperson of Kolhapur circle of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Ltd (MSEDCL) said as many as 3,333 transformers across the district had been shut down affecting 1.59 lakh electricity connections.As many as 14 substations across the city and district also stood affected. Sub-stations from Dudhali, Gandhinagar, Nagala Park, Radhanagari, were among those which were kept shut as a precautionary measure.Several parts of Kolhapur and Sangli district faced power outages due to continuous rainfall.About 1.59 lakh consumers in Kolhapur and 1.24 lakh in Sangli have been badly hit due to the power cuts amid heavy rains in the past four days. The floods have damaged 29 power sub-stations and 5,582 transformers in both the districts.MSEDCL officials said that there has been large-scale damage, with floodwater damaging electricity supply equipment. It will be a mammoth task to repair and rebuild the equipment and transformers damaged due to the floods, an official said.For the fourth day the BSNL landlines are not working across the city.Most ATMs (automated teller machines) remained closed because of lack of power supply. Many citizens were seen going from one ATM to another in desperation to withdraw money. Some ATMs with power supply had been deliberately shut because of security reasons.As a result of the acute water shortage and breakdown in supply four days ago, residents have taken to collecting rainwater for drinking purposes. People were seen roaming the streets with empty cans and trying to collect rainwater.The supply of vegetables was also hit for the fourth consecutive day as the wholesale vegetable mandi wore a deserted look. The officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee said the trucks carrying onions and potatoes were stranded on the highway.Despite the scarcity of food grains, the traders did not increase the price of food grains to avoid unrest and anger among the residents.Owing to floods, all entry points of the city have been closed and the district administration has written to all the petrol pump operators to keep a stock of fuel for emergency purposes such as ambulance and rescue operations.Meanwhile, the district health administration claimed they have adequate stock of medicines and injections at hospitals in both rural and urban areas. A senior health official said the stock of medicines has been kept ready to deal with any emergency that may arrive due to floods.First Published: Aug 09, 2019 20:41 IST"

We have not yet received detailed crop-wise damage figures, but major crops affected include soybean, sugarcane and paddy, he said.In Pune division, for which the first damage estimates have been readied, crops in around 691 villages have been affected due to heavy rains and inundation recently. Among the three districts, most villages have been affected in Pune, followed by Ahmednagar and Solapur.Around 203 villages in seven blocks in Ahmednagar have been affected, with crops on over 13,409 hectares damaged in the recent flood situation. Crops affected in Ahmednagar include soyabean, maize, bajra, cotton, sugarcane, vegetables, onions, fruits and vegetables. In Solapur, crop losses have mostly occurred due to inundation of agricultural fields adjoining rivers and rivulets, the official said.Nearly 116 hectares of land, mostly along the river side in Pune and Solapur districts, have been rendered uncultivable due to strong and excessive water flow, an official said. The top soil has been washed away by flood waters. If flood waters have excessive speed, they tend to strip the land of its top soil layer. Such land cannot be used for cultivation till the next year until there is deposition of fresh alluvial soil from the adjoining rivers or reclamation of affected land manually,  the official said."

Shiyas, secretary of the cooperative bank.Almost all of those who queued up at the shop were our regular customers. Taking the risk of selling the goods on credit, we provided them everything they wanted. Barring onions, which was out of stock, we supplied everything that was on our shelves, he said.The rush of customers, which began shortly after the heavy showers on Friday, lasted till Sunday. Though a holiday, we opened the shop on Sunday till afternoon and downed the shutters when we ran out of stock, he said.Foodstuff and other essential commodities worth over 2 lakh, which is a significant amount for a super market on the outskirts of the city, were sold out in two days. Over 300 families of the Kunnukara area benefited out of the largesse of the cooperative bank.Neither the bank nor the super market management can formally clear any proposal to sell goods in credit under any circumstances. However, considering the plight of the people of the region, the director board members of the bank unofficially gave their consent for the credit sale, Mr. Shiyas said.During the 2018 floods too, the super market had stood by the residents of the area and sold consumables on credit. That time, people from nearby areas too benefited. This year, since the impact of the flooding was limited, it was mostly people from the Kunnukara area that came up for purchase, he explained.On March 31, during the annual stock taking exercise, the sales proceeds and the stock in hand should tally and its a huge risk that the shop has taken. Last year, most of the creditors repaid their dues in two months. This year too, the residents would repay their bills on time, he hoped.The society has already started distributing drinking water in the flood-hit areas. The volunteers will go out cleaning the wells in the area from Tuesday."

So one must consider recommendations about railway station snacks with a pinch of salt, or in this case, with a fistful of green chillies.A snack cart in Gurugram railway station rustles out the most punchy green chilli pakoras. Ever. They are so fiery that they almost make you sweat with their heat. They keep you on a delicate borderline between enjoying the taste and feeling your brains about to blow out of your head.Or could this taste be a deception? This afternoon, every element in the station is conspiring to make things so conducive to the senses that even sawdust might taste like delicious sabudana.Its raining non-stop (which is the ideal moment to consume pakoras), travellers are hurrying about in all directions,trains are appearing after regular intervals, and the rain can be heard pattering on the stations tin shed. Its all very romantic.But the carts green chillies are popular even before and after the rains. The cooksSameer Gujjar and Dinesh Sharmafind it such a best-seller that they dedicate a big container just to store these pakoras. There are onion pakoras, too, but they look pathetically soggy against the firmness of their green chilli counterparts. They move so quickly that we keep making fresh stock after every couple of hours, says Mr Gujjar.The cooksSameer Gujjar and Dinesh Sharmafind it such a best-seller that they dedicate a big container just to store these pakoras.

And soon, weather officials sent out a warning saying the deluge is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. While this would substantially reduce the citys current monsoon deficit of 44%, it has also brought cheer to hilsa lovers who have not been able to indulge in their favourite fish as much this season. Thanks to a dismal spell of rain, the supply of hilsa has remained largely affected this season. But with the current weather, theres no stopping Bengali foodies, who are all geared up for khichuri and ilish maachh bhaja for their Sunday lunch.I just bought a stock of 1,000 kg of ilish. Finally, I have some good stuff here, said Ratikanta Bar, a wholesale fish seller in Howrahs Kalibabur Bajar, on Saturday morning. So, after months of small, inferior catches, at last good-quality ilish has just started to come in. However, with the depression that set in on Bengal in the last two days, the fishermen boats are stationed in the harbours. There is a weather alert and no boat can go fishing now. It is a government instruction. If anyone disobeys, he has to pay a fine. But this is temporary. Since good fish has started coming in, I presume all the markets in Bengal will be stocked up with quality ilish in a weeks time, he added.Talking about the price of ilish here, he added, Any catch between 700-800 gm is available at around `800 per kg. We are selling one-kilo ilish at `1,200 per kg. Fish weighing 1.2 kilo to 1.5 kilo is available for about `1,500 per kg. There is absolutely no fish coming from Bangladesh. However, given the trend, now we are getting pretty big-size catches too.According to an official from the state fisheries department, until Friday, the amount of rainfall received here was rather low. So, the fishermen havent been able to get a good catch this season. But they expect the situation to improve by month-end. The current downpour that Kolkata is experiencing is a result of a cyclonic circulation over south Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh. We are hoping that the situation will improve by the end of August. With more rain, the supply of hilsa is expected to normalise. However, in between, small amounts of hilsa have been caught from the coasts of Digha and Diamond Harbour , said Chandra Nath Sinha, the West Bengal minister for fisheries. Actor Ritwick Chakraborty, who loves to gorge on ilish, said, ""While my father is from Dhaka, my mom is epar Banglar. So, ilish dishes at home have always been influenced by both the sides. I love the patla jhol of ilish or even bhapa. Even fried ilish along with steamed rice, mixed with the bhaja tel, is so appetising!""When do you say your ilish has gone bad? It is never when the curry is too jhaal or nunpora. Ask Bengalis and they will tell you that ilish goes bad only when it is not served in plenty.Way before the silver harvest started pinching a deeper hole in our pockets, a middle-class Bengali familys monsoon feast would include three to four varieties of the fish  ilish maach bhaja with ilish bhaja tel, begun diye kalo jeere-knachalonkar jhol and ilish maach bhaapa or shorshe ilish. Be it jora ilish on Saraswati Puja and special items on Jamai Sashthi, what the queen of fishes enjoys in Bengali households is pure love.While certain dishes of ilish, including shorshe bata, paturi, bhaja and bhape, are Bengalis staples, there are several other items that are as delish but do not enjoy the same popularity for their region of origin.In the eternal cultural fistfight between Ghoti and Bangal, ilish is one of the biggest stakeholders. While Bangals claim they can cook more than 400 different items, some unique dishes, including ilish maacher tok and posto ilish, were introduced by Ghotis. Santanu Bhattacharya  a Kolkata-based HR professional, who hails from East Midnapore  said ilish maacher tok is cooked regularly in his household. Besides shorshe bata ilish, my father prepares this chutney with tamarind pulp and ilish maacher matha. We have it with rice or on its own, he told us.Not just in Midnapore, in 24 Parganas too, the chutney is popular. Kakoli Bhattacharya, who hails from Bakhrahat, South 24 Parganas, said, I remember my mother making this chutney in our childhood. But none of our siblings were fond of it and, hence, she stopped making it. Instead, they lapped up a curry that had panch phoron (a mix of fenugreek seed, nigella seed, cumin seed, black mustard seed and fennel seed in equal parts). My mother used to make ilisher jhol with alu-begun and dhonebata (potato, aubergine and coriander seed paste). She would add a dash of mustard paste and after the jhol was done, she would temper it with paanch phoron. She would also make pui shak (Malabar spinach) with ilisher matha, Kakoli told us. The fishermen community of South 24 Parganas has a unique recipe for their time of sailing. Bimal Bera, owner of a couple of ilish-catching mechanised boats near Sagar, said, Our trawlers travel for over 18 hours at the average speed of 15 kmph. We travel almost 300 km from the harbour. There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Meanwhile, several households in other parts of Bengal use locally available ingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacing mustard with posto (poppy seed). We prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is common in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Ilish became hilsa in the kitchens of our colonial past. Not all British households in India could debone ilish with fork and knife and, hence, the khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire. British rulers are gone more than seven decades ago. However, smoked hilsa remains popular. Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later. It is seasonally available at some traditional restaurants in the Park Street area.While a lot of areas in Bengal have their own version of ilish preparations, many items have a strong Bangal influence too. Sandhya Roy , whose family hails from Barisal and is settled in the colony area of Garia, said their cooking involves garlic. We take a heavy-bottom pan with a lid. We lay about two banana leaves. On the top of the leaves we arrange the fish with garlic and kochu shak with mustard oil. We close the lid and put it on low flame. We often replace kochu shaak with mustard paste, Sandhya told us. The influence of Bangal recipes is visible in North Bengal, where nona ilish is common. Sayantan Sarkar, a businessman from Cooch Behar , claimed that his early memory of ilish mach is all about nona ilish  ilish dried with salt. We are from Mathabhanga and fresh ilish was not widely available in my childhood due to lack of proper roads and transportation. I remember my mother and grandmother preparing nona ilish with onion and garlic. I think the dried fish used to come from Assam. Now, we get a lot of fresh fish and, hence, the supply of nona ilish has gone down. Our staple fresh ilish preparation is with potol, jhinge and danta (pointed gourd, ridge gourd and drumstick)  an obvious influence of Purbo Bongo, he said. The post-Partition settlement in North Bengal has influenced the local peoples diet a lot. Mandabi Bhattacharyya, a city-based NGO worker, who hails from Jalpaiguri, said, Earlier, there used to be days in the festival season when people used to buy fish from the other side of the border at a cheap price. My father and uncles used to go there. Ilish maach is usually prepared with kalo-jeere (black cumin seeds) and aubergine. We temper it with fenugreek seeds and add diced pumpkin.The way she movesAccording to food writer Amitabha Malakar, every province has its own story of ilish. Take Sylhet and Noakhali for example. Ilisher shnutki is popular in both these places. In Sylhet, people make shnutki because of lack of availability of ilish. In Noakhali, people dry ilish for its abundance. The same happens with ilisher tok in this part of Bengal. In Midnapore and 24 Parganas, tok is made of tamarind pulp. As you move west, the same tok is made of chalta (elephant apple) and kamranga (star fruit). Some Bengali diaspora grill ilish like they grill salmon, he said.Several households are other parts of Bengal have made use of locally availableingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacingmustard with posto (poppy seed). We usually prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is prettycommon in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Not all British households in India could debone ilish with elan with fork and knife and, hence, their khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire... Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later.

There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Both my parents are Ghotis. At my house in Santiniketan, my mother makes two types of ilish. One is the bhapa preparation. For the other one, ilish is first fried and then put into a curry, which is made of tomato, ginger paste, coriander powder and kalo jeere. Salt and sugar are added as per taste. It is a light curry but tastes heavenly. For me, having ilish is a task, what with all the bones. I need someone to help me remove the bones from the fish. Ma amake kaanta bechhe daye. So, outside home, I prefer having boneless ilish only. Aparajita Ghosh, actressI am a die-hard ilish fan. Though I am a Ghoti, my wife is a Bangal. So, every ilish recipe cooked at our place will always have the Bangal essence. I am fond of all their hilsa dishes, but my most favourite is the one made with doi, kalo jeere and begun. This season, I have already had hilsa thrice. But since monsoon has just begun properly here, I look forward to gorging on a lot more hilsa in the coming days. During the rainy season, we make hilsa at home at least twice a week, if not more. I not only love eating this fish, but I have also learnt a lot of Bangal hilsa dishes from my wife and at times I like to prepare them myself too. Kharaj Mukherjee, actor"

But farmers in Chitradurga who were suffering from drought, are seeing a sliver of hope.Farmers of the district are eyeing good prices this season for their onion crop, considered a major commercial crop. As onion is mostly grown in Maharashtra, most of the crop there has been destroyed by torrential rains.Even though onion is usually grown in about 60,000 hectares in the district, due to scarcity of rain and depletion of groundwater, the area was reduced to approximately 8,000 hectares. Onion is also grown in Gadag, Davangere and Chikamagaluru districts, however, the rains have washed away the crop in these parts too. If the central government allows export of onion, the prices will soar above Rs 100 per kg.Somendra, an onion grower from Belaghatta village, said, After borrowing water from neighbours, I have sown onion in 5 acres of land. I am expecting good returns so that I can pay back my dues.Sunil Reddy, a villager of Dhyamavvanahalli, said, Regularly, I used to grow onion in 45 acres of land, but this year, I could not sow as 25 borewells in my plot did not have even a drop of water.Last year, I sowed onions is about 10 acres of land. With no rain, I had to get tankers to water the crop. It was not possible for me to do the same this time too, he added.My village Dhyamavvanahalli used to sow about 1,000 acres of onions every year. However, this year, only 100 acres were sown. Unless we get water from Upper Bhadra Project, the problem cannot be solved, Sunil said.He said that the central government should allow export of onion and stop import temporarily as it will help farmers overcome their financial burden.Horticulture department sources said that the area under onion cultivation this year is very less. Purple blotch disease is also affecting the crop."

Hence, when we challenge Harish Rao (chef and food consultant), who exults in researching ancient recipes and discovering local gems, to curate a roving menu, we quickly realise its a tough route to define.How do you taste a city in 380 minutes? After shifting through many contenders, we start the timer, and set out with steely determination and empty stomachs, all set to eat, pay and love every meal.First, hit the books10 am, Anna Centenary Library, Kotturpuram (Minute 0)An odd choice to begin a culinary tour? Be patient and take the lift from the cool, sprawling lobby to the sixth floor. Shelves here are tightly packed with an impressive array of food books, right from the classic Larousse Gastronomique to more contemporary titles from chefs like Jamie Oliver, Nigel Slater and Heston Blumenthal. The selection includes paperbacks as well as hard-bound books giving precise instructions on everything from Cooking the cowboy way to eating foie gras.Inaugurated in 2010, the library has around 5,50,000 books and is visited by nearly 2,500 people everyday. Harish says it is popular with city chefs for research when planning menus. One can sit here for hours and pore over research material in the hushed space between earnest civil service aspirants and researchers. But we have places to go, and things to eat.The secret vault11.15 am Roja Muthiah Research Library, Taramani (Minute 75)Welcome to the Fort Knox of libraries. Behind the quiet reading room is a glass door that leads to a row of blue vaults. These hold within them a rare, old collection of books, journals and newsprint. Do note, the librarian here is even tougher than the vaults. She watches anxiously as each page is turned, and and firmly reprimands you if there is the slightest carelessness. But Harish is delighted. After half an hour of polite pleas, we have two classic Tamil recipe books in our hands, both frail with age: Nalavima Pakacastiram, published in 1884 and Periya Pakacastiram, from 1893.Amma in the kitchen12.20 pm, Shree Konar Vilas, Besant Nagar (Minute 140)We will try just a few of their specialities, says Harish. Fifteen minutes later, the table is covered with food  creamy brain masala, fluffy mutton kari dosai and their special kudal (intestine) tava fry. There are also the crowd pleasers: mutton chukka, bun parotta, veechu parotta, and pepper chicken 65. And of course, a pot of fragrant mutton biryani.We are known for home-style Madurai food. The recipes are all by the owners mother, who still cooks in the central kitchen, says the beaming manager. Harish is a fan of the restaurant, which opened as a cramped space in Purusaiwalkam in 2018. They recently launched this Besant Nagar branch.No one can eat just one1.45 pm, Sri KarpagambalKabali Sweets Stall, Mylapore (Minute 225)Count your blessings if you manage to find parking. Then, consider yourselves doubly lucky if you can snag some medu pakodas. A local favourite for 45 years, this stall begins frying the pakodas at noon and by 2.30 pm, its all sold out. Two or three batches of 200 pieces each are fried everyday. We position ourselves outside the stall as the cook starts mixing ingredients, elbow-deep in batter. A determined crowd of regulars gather. Some buy onion pakodas for the wait. An elderly couple helps themselves to a handful of garlic sev while waiting for their tea-time snack is under way. As soon as it is on a tray, three staffers begin counting pakodas (2.50) and dividing them into paper bags, before handing them into the outstretched hands of eager customers. Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside, these deftly made snacks are addictive.Chef's other picks 1. Tanjavur Military Hotel, Park Town2. Amasavalli Biryani, Anna nagar3. Arulandam Mess, T Nagar4.

A part of the lane is occupied by four large degchis. Under them, there is a smouldering wooden fire. A chatty cook uses a ladle thats as tall as himself, to saut huge quantities of onions in preparation for the evening biryani. These vessels can hold 20 kilograms of biryani, says Khaja Mohideen, whose grandfather started this place in 1962. In a day we make around 200 kilograms of biryani, he says. On Sundays, however, the numbers increase. His team of cooks start work at 2 am and have the dish ready by 3.30 am for people waking up early to offer prayers. By 6.30 am, its mostly over, he adds. The speciality here is everything is cooked using firewood and coal, that is what gives the unique taste. They also make paya curry and mutton chops.A mess-y affair3.25 pm, Kasivinayaga Mess, Triplicane (Minute 325)The staff eats first here. My staff eats before my customers, smiles K Vasudevan, who started this mess in 1973. That way they can tell us if we need to improve any of the dishes. After service, they eat again. Vasudevan does not allow parcels, because he wants to feed people in the neighbourhood, and feed them well. So not surprisingly, portions are generous and prices are low. The space is basic and can hold up to 40 people at a time, so there are inevitably customers lined up outside. Like a classroom, there are rows of small granite tables lining the powder blue room. The meal, priced at 75, has 10 items including poriyal, kootu, sambar, chutney and a very generous serving of white rice. We calculate it as one kilogram of rice per eight people, says Vasudevan. Nearly 300 people lunch here and around 125 join us for dinner, adds the 70-year-old. The food is simple and tasty, especially if you opt to pay  5 extra and top your hot rice with a generous dollop of ghee and dal powder.This is the third of a five-part series through a 380-minute tour of heritage sites that celebrates 380 years of Madras"

And, for the record, the chai doesnt taste of onion.The unnamed tea stall near old Gurugrams Budheshwar Temple actually clings to an onion warehouse. The tiny establishment has been here for five years and is run by the charming Ashok Kumar, who has a tendency to promptly remind his customers that he shares his name with a Bollywood legend.

2019-08-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/onion-prices-rise-to-rs-2200-per-quintal-highest-so-far-this-year-5925450/,"Onion prices rise to Rs 2,200 per quintal — highest so far this year","After a relatively long plateau, onion prices have more than doubled in the last three months. On Wednesday, the average trading price of the bulb at the onion market in Lasalgaon in Nashik was Rs 2,200 per quintal, the highest price of onion this year. Lasalgaon is the largest onion market in the country and sets the price for the commodity.AdvertisingTill about May, onion prices were around Rs 1,000 per quintal as a bumper crop had resulted in a long glut in the market. Average traded prices in the months of January to April were Rs 531-Rs 931 per quintal.Prices have since climbed steadily with the average price in August (till date) being around Rs 1,603 per quintal.Arrivals at the Lasalgaon market, which normally is in the range of 3.5-4 lakh quintals per month, have seen a dip with just 2.2 lakh quintals arriving in August (till date).AdvertisingTraders point to lower arrivals as one of the major reasons for the price rise, which they say will continue for the next few months. Jagdish Apshunde, a trader and onion exporter operating out of the wholesale market in Nashik, said Rabi onion acreage was hit due to the drought in 2018.Heavy rains especially in Karnataka has resulted in damage to onion stocks, which has pushed up prices in the domestic market, he said.Onion farmers in Maharashtra take three crops, which feed the market round the year. Farmers sow a crop in June-July, which they harvest post September-October which qualifies as the Kharif crop. Once this crop is harvested, farmers sow the late Kharif crop, which hits the market by January-February. Farmers also take the Rabi crop, which is harvested post March. This is the only crop which can be stored and feeds the market till the next Kharif supply. Farmers store their Rabi stock in moisture- and dust-proof structures on farms called kanda chawl and liquidate their stock when the prices are right.Growers have failed to receive good prices for both their Kharif and late Kharif crops as a glut in the market kept prices down. The Rabi crop also hit the market after April but the prices have been lower than expected. This despite the Rabi acreage of Maharashtra falling to 2.66 lakh hectares as against 3.54 lakh hectares in 2017-18.Apshunde said that the present price rise has also to do with good exports despite the 10 per cent export subsidy withdrawn by the central government in June. There is good demand from the Middle East and Bangladesh and overall crop availability is low, which has resulted in the present price correction, he said. Current prices, traders feel, will remain till the new crop in Karnataka hits the domestic market later in September."

The transport department officials on Tuesday met the truck operators. But the meeting failed as the truck operators refused to withdraw the strike.We have demanded a meeting with the chief minister or at least the transport minister, since it is a matter of policy. The officials were non-committal on our demands and complaints, said Subhas Bose, secretary of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Associations (FWBTOA), an umbrella organization of truckers bodies. The supply of perishables like vegetables and fish to the city could be maintained as the police helped some trucks cross the inter-state borders. But the supply line is being hit with the price of some commodities soaring. Potato, onions and ginger are getting costlier than what their prices were before the strike.There will be impact on supply of food items and construction materials, including heavy metals, said a truck operator. The operators had also blocked national highways for two hours on July 10.The truckers strike has failed to make an impact the way we feared. The stock of non-perishables is good and inter-district transportation of vegetables has not been affected much. Apart from small trucks, vegetables are often transported in local trains. If the truck strike continues for a few days more, the wholesale and retail markets will be affected, said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vegetable Vendors Association."

The prices of vegetables, especially onions, have doubled in the past 10 days. The reason being that crops were damaged by heavy rains and vegetables could not be transported from neighbouring states due to bad roads.Speaking to The New Indian Express, Prasanna BN, MD of Hopcoms said, The price of onions has gone up considerably as compared to other vegetables. We are paying a much higher price just to get them to the city.Chandrakala, the owner of Sai Enterprises, a vegetable shop in RT Nagar, said, ""We buy all vegetables from the Yelahanka vegetable market. I personally check the vegetables before buying them. So we maintain standards, but I have seen extremely low quality vegetables as well.""For retail selling, onions cost Rs 2,000 per quintal exactly two months ago. As of August 21, the rate has gone up to Rs 3,000. This increases the selling price from around Rs 25 to an average of Rs 40 per kg. As onions are used in almost every household every day, these fluctuating prices has left consumers deliberating if they need it or not.Gangambike, a housewife, said, I have started to think if my family really needs these vegetables, because the prices are so high. If the prices go up, we dont buy a lot, so our vegetable consumption decreases but when the prices are down, we buy a lot. So it depends on the prices.Another consumer, Shobha Shankar said, I have a family of four to feed, so I buy a lot of vegetables. Keeping this in mind, I cannot bargain with the seller. They will give me reasons like rent needs to be paid or that they need some profits as they bought the vegetables at a high price, what do I do then? Life becomes very difficult during at these times."

In 1998, Madan Lal Khurana of the BJP lost Delhi to Sheila Dikshit because of skyrocketing onion prices, and it became a national issue in 2014. Onions have also influenced election outcomes in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Attitudes to essentials may well signal political change, because they relate to the home and the hearth. But never before have biscuits, a completely discretionary purchase, flagged an economic downturn.AdvertisingLast week Varun Berry, managing director of Britannia Industries, walked out of an annual general meeting where he reported slowing growth in sales, and mused that things have come to a pretty pass if people are thinking thrice before buying a Rs 5 pack of biscuits. And now Parle, Britannias competitor, threatens to lay off upto 10,000 workers. The only biscuits that are doing well are made of gold. Demand for precious metals has increased in response to a global recession signalled by the bond market, which produced the much-discussed inverted yield curve last week. One can almost hear the spirit of Marie Antoinette prescribing: If they cant buy Marie, let them eat gold.In 1986, the Economist launched its Big Mac Index, which tracks purchasing power parity across currencies via prices of a Big Mac hamburger in different countries. Now, perhaps the world is ready for a Marie index, a tracker of discretionary purchase which can detect the tightening of fists in real time, leaving bond yield curves to predict recessions which are still far away. In addition, since political turmoil is often associated with economic uncertainty, there is room for an onion index, tentatively named Vidalia, which would alert rulers to the rising frustration of people fed up with their economic policies."

Read MorePUNE: The recent floods and destruction of crops in Kolhapur , Sangli and Satara have led to reduction in supply of vegetables grown in these districts to the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in the city and escalation of their retail prices.Prices of vegetables, such as brinjal, okra and cauliflower, have now gone up to around Rs100-Rs120 for a kg in the city retail market. Vendors said it would take some time for the situation to become normal because the floodwaters have wiped out vegetable crops in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara, besides some other districts in Pune division. Besides, it would take another month for the new harvest to be ready.An APMC official said arrival of vegetables, such as onion, cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal, to the market has significantly reduced. As a consequence, prices of these vegetables have increased. In fact, prices of onions have almost doubled in the last few days. For the other vegetables, the rise in prices is around 40%, he said.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association, said there was a 50% shortage in the wholesale market for vegetables such as cauliflower, brinjal, cluster beans and okra. Before the heavy rain lashed Maharashtra , many parts of the state were battling a drought-like situation. This caused a drop in production. After that, the downpour worsened the situation by destroying crops in many parts, he said.New onions usually reach the market by September. But this time the rain has damaged 50% of the new crop and various markets are now using the old onions. This stock is also finishing fast. This means prices of onions are likely to rise further in the near future, Bhujbal said.Vitthal Hanamgar, a vegetable vendor on NIBM road, said, The floods in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara and other parts of the state caused huge destruction of vegetable crops. Supplies have reduced from these districts. Besides, vegetables from Pune are also being sent to the flood-affected areas. All this have triggered the current shortage.Kailash Shankar Kolhe, a vendor in Koregaon Park, said supplies in the wholesale market have halved in the last few days. Brinjal and cauliflower are selling for Rs100 for a kg in the retail markets, he said.Nilesh Patil, a farmers son and vendor in Wakad, said, High prices are likely to continue for the next two months. The lack of sunlight this monsoon and heavy rain have caused significant damage to vegetable crops."

How well do we know ourselves? Did you become who you thought you would be when you grew up? Did circumstances make you a better, a worse or just a different person? And why am I asking you all these questions? Well, this week I want to apply all these same questions to food. Food as we know it. Indian food.So here goes. What is Indian food really? Did all the food we love in our country come from within India? Or did some of the food we now consider traditional actually come from somewhere else  another city, another country, other continent? Has that food then become better, worse or just different?I dont have the answers to all these questions but as I burrow into the histories of some our favourite Indian foods, its time for me to tell you the truth. Some things are just not what they seem to be.Look familiar? Thats the zalabia, a popular Lebanese sweet made of fried fermented dough. Like its descendant, the jalebi, it is crisp, sweet and sinfully good. ( talesofjewishsudan.com )Take, for instance, the Punjabi mothers favourite instrument of love: Rajma Chawal. Its a delicacy for some and comfort food for most. Its red kidney beans cooked with spices till creamy, in an onion-tomato gravy. Its best had with your fingers, mixed into hot steamed rice. But Rajma is not a Punjabi bean; its not even Indian. And no it doesnt trace its origin to Canada either.The Rajma bean, it is said, originated in Peru and became a craze throughout South and Central America, travelling to Europe around the 15th century, when Spanish wayfarers returned home from their adventures. Migrating Indian traders carried the bean to India via Guatemala and Central America. Punjab fell for the red bean, and so did Nepal, where Rajma Ko Tarkari and Rajma Curry are staples.Then theres the Samosa. Not sub-continental, definitely not Indian. The idea of this snack of pastry or bread stuffed and deep-fried is common in many cultures. The samosa can be considered part of the same family as the Portuguese Pastel, Spanish Empanada, Italian Calzone, and South East Asian Curry Puff. Historians trace the name and the triangular shape to Central Asias pyramid-shaped samsa, and the meat-filled Uzbek version, called the Pompoqcha Somsa (samsa made with yeast dough).The word is derived from the Persian sanbosag and in North Africa and the Middle East is referred to as sanbusaq or sanbusaj. So the next time you bite into a hot Punjabi Samosa, you may just think of it as International Cuisine.The chicken tikka masala at Shish Mahal, Glasgow. Scotland is the home of this desi-sounding dish.The Persians have a lot to answer for. Not only did most tandoor cooking of bread and the great Mughlai cuisine find its beginnings in Persia and the Middle East, so did the Jalebi and Gulab Jamun. Zalabia is a very popular Lebanese sweet fritter made of fermented dough. There, sugar is added to the batter of the Zalabia, while the Jalebi is fried and then soaked in sugar syrup. Both are crisp, sweet and sinfully good when eaten hot.Gulab Jamuns as well, they say, were brought to India by Persian invaders. The Persians called it Luqmat al-Qadi, and made it by taking yeast-leavened dough and deep-frying it, then drenching it in honey or sugar syrup and rosewater. The recipe dates back to the 13th century and the dish, tis said, was popularised, in the 14th century in India, by the explorer and scholar Ibn Battuta.The rustic-sounding Chicken Tikka Masala has its roots in Scotland. Ive eaten CTM in a Scotland Pub; its a Thursday-night tradition and nearly everyone was gorging on this pale reddish-yellow special after several beers. The story goes that Ali Ahmed Aslam of Shish Mahal, a Scottish curry house in Glasgow, to assuage his customers who thought his roast chicken was too bland and dry, tossed some spices together with tinned tomato soup and, lo and behold, the Chicken Tikka Masala was born.And then, of course, there are our two favourite beverages  Tea and Coffee. Coffee was not part of Indian culture or custom till at least the 16th century. Baba Budan was a 16th-century Sufi who returned from Mecca with the blessings of Allah and seven coffee beans hidden in his beard. He returned home to Chikmagalur in present-day Karnataka and planted them on the slopes of the Chandragiri Hill. Chikmagalur remains the countrys largest coffee-growing area.Tea, of course, is not Indian but Chinese and was brought to us by the British, who found India a great place to grow tea for themselves. I personally cannot stomach the light English tea, so I am glad that we not only embraced the beverage, but also really, truly made it our own.To end with, the Ganesh festival is around the corner and in that context Id like to leave you with a question. The modak, a steamed dumpling made with rice flour, filled and steamed. Does that sound perilously close to the Momo, Dim Sum or Sui Mai? So which came first? I dont know. Why dont you find out and tell me.First Published: Aug 23, 2019 20:50 IST"

The wholesale price in the benchmark Lasalgaon mandi in Maharashtra was recorded at Rs 14.76 per kg on Thursday. The price rose after rains disrupted supplies as well as due to damaged crop in major-producing states of Maharashtra and Karnataka ""The government is keeping an eye on rise in prices of pulses and edible oil in the past few days. The main reason is artificial shortage created by hoarders. The government will take immediate action against them,"" Food and Consumer Affair Minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted.The government has sufficient stocks of pulses and oil seeds, he said.Paswan added that he has written a letter to the agriculture ministry to sell pulses and oil seeds procured by Nafed in the open market, so that consumers can get these food items at reasonable prices.The government is also supplying pulses through ration shops, he said and added that it may fix stock limit on pulses if required.Meanwhile, the Department of Consumers Affairs said in a statement that it has reviewed the prices of essential commodities, such as onions, pulses and oilseeds, with all stakeholders under the chairmanship of its Secretary Avinash K Srivastava.""The committee decided to substantially increase the daily supply of onions from government buffer to Delhi and directed Nafed to release the stock from PSF (price stabilisation fund) buffer so as to ensure improved availability at reasonable rates,"" the statement added.Import of onion is duty-free under the open general licence and currently, there is sufficient stock of onions available in the government buffer, the department said, adding that supply of onion can be further enhanced if needed.""Police representatives from Delhi and various states around Delhi were also present at the meeting and they were asked to hold regular meetings to ensure seamless check on hoarding in Delhi-NCR specifically and in their respective states generally,"" the statement also said.The police officials from the neighbouring states were also asked to share the data available with them on hoarders and profiteers for more effective inter-state enforcement, it added.The committee directed the police officials to check the entry points around Delhi-NCR to ensure that supplies are not held up at the border to create artificial shortage, it added.Earlier this week, the department had decided to cap the retail price of onion at Safal (a Mother Dairy outlet) at Rs 23.90 per kg (for Grade A variety). Mother Dairy has over 400 retail outlet in the Delhi-NCR.Onion has been a politically-sensitive commodity. The Bharatiya Janata Party had lost state Delhi Assembly elections after the onion prices rose sharply in 1998."

A month ago, the tuber was being sold at Rs 15 to Rs 20-a-kg.Traders attributed the rise in price to floods in Maharashtra and Karnataka besides ongoing strike by truckers in West Bengal.Odisha is largely dependent on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in floods in two major onion producing States.A trader at the Unit-I market said the State is not getting the commodity from Nashik, Bengaluru and Tadepalligudem (Andhra Pradesh) as per demand.We are now completely dependent on Nashik where the onion was priced Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,200 per quintal. What can we do if the product is highly-priced at the source? The price may come down after the arrival of new crop from Andhra Pradesh, he said.Similarly, potato price also witnessed a rise of 20 per cent due to the truckers strike in WB. The commodity, which was being sold Rs 12-a-kilo, is now priced Rs 15 in the retail market.Since there is a huge gap between demand and supply, the retail price is bound to increase. The State Government has warned traders against hoarding. The officials have been asked to keep a close watch on hoarders and black marketers.Meanwhile, workers of Samajwadi Party led by its State president Rabindra Nath Behera staged a demonstration on Thursday demanding check on onion and potato price."

During the 2014 elections, he twice came to our shop and relished the Amritsari kulchas and lassi. He also recalled the love and affection he got from the people of the holy city when his family shifted from Lahore and during his election campaign and whenever he visited Amritsar.""A senior leader of the Punjab unit of the BJP Rajinder Mohan Singh Chinna recalls, ""I had a personal relationship with him and visited him in Delhi too when he was unwell. Part of Jaitley's family had moved from Lahore, while his maternal relatives belonged to Amritsar. He had many relatives in Amritsar and many old memories too. He knew each and every nook and corner of the city and all the shops where good food is available. He spoke fluent Punjabi at home. Whenever anyone from Punjab visited him in Delhi for any work, it used to be done immediately. His wife Sangeeta Jaitley was born in Amritsar.""In a Facebook post titled ""The Campaign Diary - 30th April, 2014"", he elaborated on his love for Amritsari food. Jaitley wrote, ""Today is Polling Day in Amritsar. Having spent past six weeks in Amritsar campaign in this heat, it will be time for me now to move to other states where elections are still being held. An integral and enjoyable part of the stay in Amritsar is obviously the food in this city. I have always regarded Amritsar as the Food Capital of India.""""The Kulchas and chanas of Amritsar have now created a national impact.

The Kulchas in Amritsar served with chanas with an option of having onion Chutney is now available in almost every eatery in the city. The kulcha Chana is a preferred menu for breakfast, lunch or even dinner.""""Breakfast in Amritsar is still the stuffed Parantha or the Poori Chhole. The city has a tradition where households still prefer to outsource the poori chhole from the famous Halwais rather than cook it at home. Most parts in the old city have their own special Halwais. But the most famous one in the city isnow Kanahiya at Lawrence Road. The chanas are mixed with potatoes for the curry preparation. This breakfast is highly recommended but should be taken rarely because of its high caloric value,"" he added.He further wrote, ""The Amritsari Lassi is available at most of these Halwai shops. But Ahuja and Gyan have acquired a special reputation. Either of them will provide an excellent treatment for insomnia. Kesar still continues to dominate the vegetarian preparations. It enjoys a reputation for beingthe most famous dhaba in the city. Bharawan with its chain of dhabas, under the name of Bharawan or Brothers, is also recommended for vegetarian food for the tourists and the locals.""For the non-vegetarians, it is Surjit all the way. His Tandoori chicken, Amritsari fish and mutton champs (cooked like Old English cutlets) are highly delicious. The Makhan fish has been a gourmets delight. What I have not tried so far but has been recommended to me is Beera known also for its high-quality chicken,"" he stated.Jaitley wrote, ""The morning tea at the Giani Tea Stall initiates the entire gossip which circulates in the entire city. This was my alternative to the Lodhi Garden Tea. I foresee a situation where some of these outstanding places will acquire a brand value across the country."""

While 1,619 acre gets water from the left canal, 879 acre gets water from the reservoirs right canal. The length of the earthen reservoir is 722 metre while its water spread area is 56.26 hectare and catchment area is 72.23 sq km. Since the reservoir is located in the forest area, heavy rain in the hills bring copious water to reservoir as it reaches its maximum storage level in a few days.In its 41 year history, the silt was not removed even once, said N. Subramanian, president of the Gunderipallam Pasana Sangam who have been demanding the district administration to desilt the reservoir for the past 15 years.The reservoir is the second biggest reservoir next to Bhavani Sagar in the district. During rainy season, the surplus water is let out which enters River Bhavani. Earlier, the water is used for carrying out irrigation for over 70 days, but now we cannot depend fully on the reservoir and had to depend on borewells, he added. Currently, water was released for irrigation for 40 days and farmers had cultivated banana, sugarcane, tapioca, maize and onion in the ayacut areas.Farmers said that water in the reservoir helps recharge of groundwater of wells and borewells in 15 km radius and raised the issue during the grievance meeting held at Gobichettipalayam recently. It was disclosed during the meeting that one-third of the water spread area comes under the control of forest department and approval is needed. Hence, the issue was taken up with the Public Works Department who had taken up the issue with the forest department.Senior officials at the Sathyamangalam Forest Division told The Hindu that currently the dam has water and desilting works could be taken up only after four months when the dam goes dry."

On Monday, retail prices were ruling at Rs 45 per kg in Chandigarh, Rs 42 per kg in Delhi, and at Rs 40 per kg in six cities including Varanasi and Aizawl.

2019-08-26,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/aug/26/being-bohra-in-chennai-2024184.html,Being Bohra in Chennai,"KV Navya ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Their favourite food is not biryani and they wear burqas in hot pink, forest green, bright blue and every colour one can imagine, except black. Meet the Bohras, a sect of the Shia Muslims whose history in Chennai dates back to more than 200 years.The Bohra community originated in Yemen and later spread to India and Pakistan. In India, they primarily settled in Gujarat before spreading out to different cities. So, we have Gujarati influence on our food, language and traditions. We speak Gujarati with references from Persian and Arabic, said Tasneem Kutubuddin dressed in a dark pink burqa or rida, their traditional costume. She was leading a heritage walk  Understanding the Bohras in the city  on Sunday at George Town.While women wear ridas that cover their head and body but not their faces, Bohra men wear a three-piece white outfit and white cap called a topi with gold embroidery.Migrating to ChennaiMulla Jafferji Ibne Mulla Ismailji was the first Bohra to come to Chennai. He travelled till Arcot in 1790 via the Malabar coast to join his uncle in the bangle business. He later migrated to Chennai in 1793 and set up a garment business in George Town.Whenever Bohras migrate to a city, if they are the first ones from their community there, they buy a land for cemetery and prayer. Also, each prayer area has a community hall attached to it where we all dine together. So, this was the first piece of land brought by a Bohra in Chennai, said Tasneem pointing towards the Mohammedi Masjid in Angappa Naicken Street at George Town.Chennai has three Dawoodi Bohra mosques  Mohammedi Masjid, Saifee mosque in Moore street, Mannady and the third one at Basin bridge. Today, more than 1,800 Bohra families are living in the city and are primarily settled in Madhavaram, Royapuram and George Town. The Dawoodi Bohras are followers of the 27th Dai or high priest and can be found in about 40 countries around the world. They have separate administration offices in each city.The MSB Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Thiruvalluvar Nagar in George Town is set up especially for the children of Bohra community. According to Tasneem, the school follows the Tamil Nadu State Board syllabus along with a Siyat Islamia curriculum.About 800-odd children study in this school. For the kids from the community who are studying in other schools, MSB offers a weekend programme to educate them on the history of the community and Quran, she said.Communal diningFood plays an integral part of a Bohras daily life. Eating from a thal is a tradition that still continues in many families. A thali is a large round metal plate, around which the family sits, helping themselves from the same plate, course-by-course, during every meal of the day. A lot of their dishes are influenced from the Gujarati cuisine.Apart from non-vegetarian dishes like pulao and kebab, the cuisine boasts some unique vegetarian dishes including a cold baingan bharta made with curd and spring onion, sev ni tarkari in which bhel puri sev is cooked with onions, and their quintessential dal chawal palida, a combination of rice and dal served with a flavourful concoction of drumsticks, bottle gourd and kokum.Unfortunately, the Bohra community does not have many restaurants serving the savoury dishes. But, to try their traditional sweets, head to Mannady Street to find sweet shops maintained by Bohris including Hatimys and Alambaradar.Try some of their heady sweet treats like malida (a sweet made with wheat and jaggery), lacchka (a cracked wheat halwa, usually made on first day of the year of Bohra calendar), kalamro (a yogurt based rice pudding) and the famous malai khaja which is also called Bohri puff pastry.An interesting concept among the Bohras are the community kitchens that are attached to the masjid. The concept is similar to the dabbawalas in Mumbai. Food gets prepared early in the morning, packed in boxes and numbered. People collect their boxes and replace it with an empty box for the next meal. One needs to pay a nominal amount. Usually, the well-to-do families pay for four to five people, so that the poor can get food for free, said Tasneem.The concept of community kitchen began around five years ago when their religious head, Syedna Dr Mufaddal Saifuddin said that women must be freed from the kitchen. So, this kitchen makes lunch for the entire Dawoodi Bohra community across Chennai, every day. The rule is applied across every city and every country."

The Kurnool Market Yard is now receiving about 6,000 to 7,000 bags of onions, each weighing 50 kg. The inflow of stock increased in the past couple of days, Mr. Reddy said.However, Mr. Reddy added that prices in Tadepalligudem have been consistently hitting over 3,000 while the average price in Kurnool is hovering around 2,600.Exports to other StatesMarket Yard Secretary R. Jaya Lakshmi said that due to late sowing, the onions would keep coming into the market till late December. She added that some onions are being exported to West Bengal as well as Tamil Nadu, to meet the demand in those States."

The production of horticulture crops  vegetables, fruits, spices, flowers and plantation crops (arecanut, cashewnut, cocoa and coconut)  is estimated at 313.8 MT in 2018-19 as compared to 311.7 MT in 2017-18.Except for plantation crops, output of all other horticulture crops is estimated to be marginally higher in 2018-19.

In contrast, tomato sales have remained steady, though prices have declined from a high of 40-46 a kg in the middle of the year.Market superviser Vinay Kumar told The Hindu that compared to previous years, tomato farmers this year are a happier lot as they are reaping considerable profits in Madanapalle region.Last year, prices plummeted to 6 a kg for the fine variety, forcing farmers to stay away from harvesting, Mr. Vinay Kumar said.Production of tomato was low at around 500 tonnes per day this year due to a prolonged dry spell  almost half of last years production  which also helped balance supply and demand, said Mr. Vinay Kumar.A steady demand for tomato was also partly due to a spate of local festivals such as the Ganga Jataras of Tirupati and Chittoor and other prominent village festivals elsewhere in the neighbouring Nellore and Anantapur districts. The Adi month (a sacred month for devotees of Lord Muruga) in Chittoor and Tamil Nadu also helped sustain the demand in June and July. Traders are hopeful that the price would continue to remain the same till October, as major festivals are around the corner.Slump in exportsMr. Vinay Kumar said that there has been a slump in exports at the Madanapalle market since the middle of the year. Tomato farming has immensely picked up in Maharashtra and a couple of northern States. So, it has impacted exports here this year, he said.Coming to the retail market, the tomato price continues to be a source of worry for household consumers with the second variety (10 per kg in the wholesale market) is selling at 20 a kg in the vegetable markets and at roadside vendors. The first variety is as usual hitting supermarkets in major cities in South and North India.Meanwhile, the price of onion is perturbing consumers all over Chittoor district, with 60 a kg for the fine variety, 40 for the second grade and 30 for the last category."

Come September and India explodes with colour, light, fireworks, and food. The two big festivals just round the corner are Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam, to be followed by the gaiety of Dussehra and the explosion of Diwali.Both Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam are festivals that tug at the emotional bonds of people, Maharashtrian and Malayalam people in this case. Weary form a years work, Malayalis from all over the world rush back to their native towns and villages for the festival of Onam. Maharashtrians do the same, going from cities like Mumbai and Pune back to their villages and hometowns. This is a time to bond with family and friends and celebrate culture and heritage as our people have, for centuries.Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival close to my heart, and Ive often written about how it was celebrated in our homes, and the special foods that were so typical of the festival. But I havent delved much into a classic Onam celebration. Onam is primarily a harvest festival, celebrated all over Kerala to commemorate the golden rule of king Mahabali, a fabled asura ruler. Jealous of his acclaim, the legend goes, the Gods conspired to end his reign. They sent Lord Vishnu to earth in his Vaman (dwarf Brahmin) avatar, and he trampled Mahabali into the netherworld, but granted his last wish  to visit his land and people once a year.That day is celebrated as Onam. With Onam come banana leaves, colourful Kathakali masks, the aroma of incense and the beats of the Panchavadyam and Chenda drums. Onam is the emotional string that binds all Malayalis together.And nothing brings together all Malayalis like the Sadya does. Sadya is the Malayalam word for feast and it is Keralas most popular and revered Vegetarian Thali. Sadya is not only served during Onam, a Sadya can also be the traditional meal served during a wedding or on Vishu (another festival celebrated in Kerala and in parts of coastal Tamil Nadu).I am an ardent worshipper of food from Kerala, especially of Mapla and Syrian Christian delicacies, but the Sadya has a special place in my heart. Its the one vegetarian meal that I adore. Maybe its the coconut that features in the Avial and Payasam or the crisp south Indian papadams or all the lovey fritters that go with a traditional Sadya.Normally the Sadya served on Onam is cooked without onions or garlic. A full-fledged Sadya should have at least 23 items. The meal is usually had sitting on the floor; cutlery is definitely avoided. A Sadya must comprise of Avial (curd curry), Thoran (dry vegetables), pickles, lemon, salt, boiled rice and Payasam (a sweet dish).It starts with Kaya Varuthathu (crisp banana chips fried in coconut oil), Sarkara Varatti (jaggery-coated banana chips), at least two kinds of pickle, raw mango or lime. Along with that is served a Pachadi (a sour curd curry made with cucumber and ash gourd cooked in coconut, mustard seeds and curry leaves). Then comes the classic Avial, the nectar of Kerala  soft and creamy vegetables cooked with coconut, curd, coconut oil and curry leaves. The omnipresent Sambar and a pepper-spiked Rasam. Then there is Parippu (a thick moong dal curry cooked with grated coconut and seasoned with spices and drizzled with ghee).Thoran can be made from any vegetables that are fresh and available  carrots, cabbage, beans, tomatoes or leafy veggies. The curry is flavoured with coconut and green chillies.You can take the Sadya to whatever level of fanciness you wish. You can add dishes like Erissery (a coconut curry of pumpkin and black-eyed peas), Kaalan (a sour dish made with bananas or yam cooked in yogurt, and coconut) and Olan (spiced black peas in coconut milk).As with most meals, you end with a sweet dish. Here, Palada Pradhaman (a sweet dish made with rice, milk and dry fruit) or Pazham Pradhaman (rice with coconut pieces and jaggery) is typically the last dish served.If you truly want to understand what an Onam Sadya means to a Malayali, there is a saying that describes it best. They say in Malayalam: Kanam vittum Onam unnanam, which means We should have the Onam Sadya even if we have to sell all our land.First Published: Aug 30, 2019 19:23 IST"

Starting from Silver Oaks to Khushbu Chowk, the green belt has been an unmaintained patch with heaps of garbage. The trees in the green belt were dying owing to continuous waste dumping and lack of maintenance. The residents want to develop the green belt, like it has been done in DLF-1, said RS Rathee, MCG councillor of the area.The idea to have kitchen gardens in the green belt drew the attention of residents, and they came together to request MCG to maintain the green belt. Even though the green belt always had a few trees and some wild shrubs, the belt was in very bad shape. However, installing streetlights, building walkways and planting trees would help provide ample shade and clean the air in the area. It will also offer a safe place to women and children to walk and play, said Rashi, a resident of the township.Residents of H-Block are growing spinach, coriander, radish, onions and various herbs in the green belt located in front of their block.We will involve residents in the same way.

It cost us Rs40/kg in wholesale last week. I got it at less than half today. There were tomatoes all over the market and the quality was good. I sold them for Rs30/kg through the day, said S Palani, who owns a vegetable shop in Moggapair. But Palani refused to buy onions whose prices, with poor supply from states like Maharashtra, nearly doubled. Wholesale dealers say onions cost Rs15/kg in wholesale two weeks ago.

Wholesale dealer Sounderrajan said they had been getting a good quantity from within the state, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for a week-.Farmers from Mecheri and Vazhapadi in Salem and Rayakottai in Krishnagiri said their yield rose several fold this month and the increase in supply led to a drastic drop in cost. In Erode, prices crashed to Rs5 per kg.I used buy 28 kg of tomatoes at Rs800. Now, I pick up the same quantity for Rs150, said K Vairavel, treasurer of the Nethaji Vegetable Market in Erode.The markets in the district, which usually get 700 boxes (each 28 kg) of tomatoes every day, now get 5,000 boxes, he said.

Last years Onam saw a kg of cucumbers sold for Rs 80. Now, it is Rs 10 in the wholesale market, said C Ravindran, a vegetable merchant at Connemara Market, Palayam.Usually, the prices of vegetables such as brinjal, bitter gourd, cucumber and drumstick see an increase during Onam.

A kilogram of okra which cost Rs 40 last year has come down by Rs 20 and the rate of a kilogram of tomatoes has decreased from Rs 50 to Rs 25.Foreseeing the Onam sales in Kerala, farmers in Tamil Nadu increased their production and now we have surplus vegetables, he said. Last week, a kilogram of ginger cost Rs 300 which plummeted to Rs 120 in the wholesale market this week. The vegetable prices are on the decline. Regardless, we cannot give up on the profession.

With social media fuelling a rise in neo-nativism, many are risking lives by turning to such unscientific treatments, rue healthcare professionalsTIRUCHY: Twenty-four-year-old Sumitra and her husband Saravanan, 31, are shocked that a practice common to people in their region left their two-week-old daughter, their firstborn, in critical condition at the Thanjavur Raja Mirasdar Hospital. The baby had been fed a drop of mercury with betel leaf juicie by an aged relative to treat karappan, a skin problem, while Sumitra and child were at Peruncheri, her native village.The baby, who had been born at Mayiladuthurai government hospital on August 16, had to be rushed back to the GH after the mercury caused vomiting and swelling of the stomach. Doctors there were amazed when an x-ray showed a glowing speck of mercury in the digestive system. The GH referred the child to the Thanjai hospital where she is being treated. Doctors said that this baby was lucky. If there had been complications, the simple act of feeding mercury  easily available at provision shops  could have turned fatal. Feeding mercury to babies to treat karappan is a common practice in Mayiladuthurai block. I do not know how only my baby got sick because of this, Sumitra, furious at the media attention, said.Indeed the practice is not prevalent in most of Nagapattinam district. However, medical professionals rue that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unscientific practices that people in Tamil Nadu, both in cities and villages, refuse to give up, despite the risks to their health and health of their children. Unfortunately, practices that were on their way out due to rise in education levels and growing awareness, have returned thanks to social media.Some of these practices are ancient notions passed from generation to generation and mainly followed by grandmothers. They are followed more in villages but due to the rise of modern education and awareness, they are not practised as much as before, said Dr J Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas, Senior Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery, Madras Medical College.But, of late, social media forwards and posts are causing havoc with many spreading lies about such home remedies. The lies that catch the imagination of urban dwellers, who seem to have developed an antipathy to modern medical practices, are spread through WhatsApp, Facebook and Youtube, said Dr Mascarenhas.Indeed, social media has led to a recent resurgence of neo-nativism among a section of the educated people in cities, experts say. This poses a risk of reversing the States many gains in healthcare.Some native beliefs and practices are fairly harmless. One such practice is the adorning of the hair of a new mother with neem leaves when she takes her infant outside to ward off evil spirits. Another is the making of a talisman (thayathu) out of a piece of umbilical cord. However, there are others which can cause serious health issues, especially among infants and toddlers.For the first six months, babies should be fed only with mothers milk. Not even water is required. But some people give castor oil (vilakkennai) to babies to relieve constipation or respiratory issues. This may cause pneumonia if the oil enters the lungs, explained Tiruchy pediatrician Dr K Senthilkumar.There is another practice known as vayiru oothuthal in which a tube is inserted in the toddlers mouth to suck out small items such as a grain of rice or a piece of onion skin. This is done because parents believe that stomach troubles in a toddler are caused by the swallowing of some tiny particles while crawling. However, this practice may cause infections in the child. Similarly, some people smear camphor powder over the body of a newborn to treat some illnesses. If babys skin absorbs too much of that powder, it may lead to death, he said.Some home remedies meant to treat colds or respiratory problems in a child may instead trigger them. People burn leaves collected from elsewhere and make the child inhale the smoke. This sometimes trigger allergies in the child. There is also a practice of mixing some herbs with pigeon blood and applying the paste on to the childs chest to cure respiratory problems. What they are not aware is that the problem can get aggravated and affect the health, said G Kamal of the Tamil Nadu Aasthma and Allergy Research Foundation.Experts say that parents bring their babies to the hospital only when these home remedies fail or worsen the condition. By then, the condition of the baby may be serious.Neo-nativism and anti-vaccinationA few years ago, a social media campaign against vaccinations, led to a rise in resistance to administration of vaccines in the State. Health department officials struggled to quell the fears among the parents.Recently, there have been campaigns against modern medicines, including child immunization, echoing the sentiments of neo-nativism. Such campaigns have significant implications on preventive health in the State. Tamil Nadu, which otherwise has remarkable records in health indicators, has seen a decline of child immunization. According to the National Family Health Survey, full-immunization coverage in the state stood at 65% in 1992, increased to 81% in 2005 and then declined to 69% in 2015. Beside various other factors, public health personnel argue, these campaigns too contributed to such a decline, A Kalaiyarasan, assistant professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies, said.If all these practices pose risks to a childs health once born, there are also practices that could endanger a child while still in the mothers womb.There is a widespread myth, according to neonatal specialists, that if a pregnant lady eats more food a few weeks before delivery, the baby would gain weight and would necessitate a C-Section instead of a regular delivery. Doctors rubbish this belief as unscientific. On the other hand, some opt for a C-section only to ensure the child is born at an auspicious time. Four years ago, I took a pregnant relative to a private hospital in Kumbakonam after she was referred there by a local doctor for C-section due to some complications. In that hospital, the doctor gave me a calendar and asked me to choose an auspicious time for the surgery. I got upset and I shifted the girl to a different hospital, Rajan of Jayankondam said.Affects prognosisNot just maternal and child health, too often families choose not to seek medical help for relatives experiencing hallucinations or any other mental health issues, partly due to ignorance and partly due to stigma. Instead they take them to some places of worship or local healers, whose efforts often cause harm to the patient. In some cases, families spend lakhs of rupees on pujas to chase evil spirits away from the patient.Experts lament that they turn to medial professionals only as the last resort. The duration of untreated illness is prolonged leading to higher disability scores. Hence, our department is spending more energy on increasing awareness among the people about mental illness and treatment available, said R Karthik Deivanayagam, Pudukkottai District Mental Health Program Officer.Experts believe only increased awareness and scientific temper will improve the States health indicators."

The second on this corridor is Ama Jewels, sandwiched between an antiques store and a Levis outlet. Local residents say the shop is owned by Suraj Patel, who migrated to Antigua in the 1980s. But they also say that Ama Jewels has another, more popular, name  Choksis shop.AdvertisingI dont know whose name it is registered in. But it used to be called Choksis shop. We still call it his shop, says Inspector Benchi Baptiste, from the local police.Baptiste, of course, is referring to absconding businessman Mehul Choksi, an accused in the Punjab National Bank scam who fled to Antigua and Barbuda, and acquired citizenship by depositing a non-refundable sum of US$200,000. Several actors, industrialists and oil barons hold citizenship in the twin islands  from Oprah Winfrey and Giorgio Armani to Silvio Berlusconi and Eric Clapton.At Ama Jewels, the man at the counter is in his early 30s. He introduces himself as Rahul from Surat, and says hes been here for six months. We have the best collection and will give you good discounts. A lot of celebrities have visited our store, Hollywood actors and models, he says, swiping through a collection of photographs on his mobile phone.AdvertisingThe shop, a little crammed, has a collection of what he claims are Tanzanite Diamonds, the best diamond in the world  Tanzanite, in fact, is a rare bright blue gem stone, mined near Mt Kilimanjaro. There are emerald and diamond pendants, sapphire rings and ruby bracelets, too. I will give you a lower price, for your wife or girlfriend, he says, smiling.The warmth, however, disappears when you ask about the owner. I have seen him (Patel) just once. Hes a busy man, has a business in Trinidad and Jamaica. He is always travelling, he says, claiming to have never seen or heard of Choksi. Soon, he cuts short the conversation, says he has lots of work and disappears into a cabin behind the store.However, the woman running Hemingways Cafe, just outside the Quay on the main road says she vividly recollects Choksi. But I havent seen him of late. Last year, he used to frequent the shop. He used to drink a lot of mint and ginger tea. Sometimes, I used to fetch the tea to his store. He was a pleasant man though he never used to talk much. He was always in a rush. I heard hes going through rough weather? asks Mary.Boyce, manager of Piranha Joe, a restaurant in the area, has a darker story. I have seen him talking to shady people, he has a lot of influence in the ministry. I have seen a minister buy stuff from his store. Why do all the crooks come to Antigua? Why are we giving them refuge? he asks, fuming.However, Inspector Baptiste, who is also the former vice-president of the Leeward Island Cricket Association, disagrees. Every foreigner who has become a citizen is carefully watched where hes travelling, what hes doing, or whether hes involved in any illegal activity. So even before we knew Choksi was wanted by India, we used to watch him, because a lot of illegal activities like smuggling are centred around these jewellery shops, he says.Police informers, though, didnt find anything against Choksi, the inspector says. He hasnt taken to the high life, doesnt visit casinos or go on cruises. You dont see him in parties or even cricket games. He hasnt visited Barbuda. Hes mostly at home with his family, thats what I have heard. But with his history, we are keeping a close watch on him, says Baptiste.At an Indian restaurant here, bearer Salim distinctly remembers Choksi. I remember him because he had specifications about food. No salt, less oil, no onions. Never had even beer. He was very choosy. Hes not a regular here, but sometimes orders food home, says Salim.Some say Choksi is staying near Jumpy Bay. Some others claim he has a sea-facing villa in Old Popeshead. However, the headlines surrounding him have added to a swelling paranoia among local residents about foreign investors. Our isolation is their blessing. But we are a young country and we need foreign investments, says Baptiste.At Ama Jewels, meanwhile, Rahul has removed his blazer and is standing in front of the store nervously peering at every passer-by. The carnival season is over and the tourists have dwindled. Its not business as usual."

Abhishek Saha spoke to lawmakers who said they would stand by such victims, as they filed appeals against their exclusion at the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) of the state.Amid heightened tensions over Kashmir, Pakistan has decided to grant consular access on Monday to Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav. New Delhi is studying the offer, The Indian Express has learned. This is the second time that Pakistan has said it is offering consular access to Jadhav, after a previous move in early August which was refused by India.Former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti  who are under detention since August 5  were allowed to meet their family members twice recently. They were allowed to meet after the family members approached the administration for permission, an official told Adil Akhzer.AdvertisingWith the publication of final NRC draft in Assam, political parties, including BJP, have alleged that the exercise is flawed. Instead of blaming the process, political parties need to recognise, perhaps, the flaw that lies in the imagination that produced the NRC. Modern societies are shaped by migration and it may be futile to engage in costly exercises to identify outsiders.Hurricane Dorian, the second strongest Atlantic storm on record, pounded the Bahamas on Sunday and is forecast to move dangerously close to Florida in the next two days.

While the good quality onion is being sold at Rs 40 per kg, the inferior one is priced at Rs 35 per kg. Again, the abrupt rise in onion price is attributed to the short supply from Nashik in Maharashtra.A roadside retailer claimed that with the wholesale price at Rs 35, he is selling onion for Rs 40 per kg as in a bag of 50 kg, at least 10 per cent gets damaged. The prices have continued to go up by Rs 4-5 per kg in every 4-5 days, reaching Rs 40 on date. The city needs around 130-150 quintals of onion daily and majority of the supply is catered from Maharashtra.Apart from onion, the price of potato too has gone up as some retailers were selling it for Rs 20 per kg, a hike of Rs 8 in a fortnight. Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said a meeting with the onion wholesalers will be called and necessary steps would be taken to keep the prices under control.Former president of Rourkela District Congress Committee Biren Senapati, however, alleged the price rise was being abetted by local civil supplies authorities in connivance with unscrupulous traders. The CSO has marketing intelligence personnel to keep track of any abnormal price hike, but they would not act. The delay in taking action is designed to benefit unscrupulous traders, he alleged."

He chaired a meeting of all state food and consumer affairs ministers and secretaries.A consumer affairs ministry official said there is a dire need to change some of the provisions as for almost all offences, there is a jail term - minimum three months and maximum seven years. This is over and above the fines that the offenders need to pay. The Act also has provision for confiscating the stored items and seizing godown and vehicles carrying such stuff. In some cases, even the seized property can be forfeited to the government. The law empowers court to bar a repeat offender from carrying on any business on the particular commodity for at least six months.Most of these are draconian provisions and need to be changed. After getting feedback from states, we will submit it to the Niti Aayog committee under Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , said an official.The panel under Fadnavis was set up in July at Niti Aayog meeting to suggest policy interventions in the agriculture sector including the required changes in the EC Act. Though initially the think tank had mooted the proposal to take out all agriculture produce out of the EC Act, it was felt that the law has proved effective in taming prices of food stuff such as onions, potatoes and pulses on several occasions. The law empowers the Centre to notify any product as essential commodity and can put limits on their storage, transport and distribution. it deals with the stock limit and hoarding of goods.After chairing the first meeting of the committee in August, Fadnavis had said the Act would only be applied in extreme situations like famine and war. He had said that there was a broad consensus that the entire Act should not be repealed. The provisions related to agriculture, which affects the prices of produce, should remain in force, he had said.Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said a meeting has been called on September 9 to find an alternative to the plastic bottles used for sale of packaged drinking water. He said industry representatives, including manufacturers of packaged drinking water, would attend the meeting."

And ahimsa is a fundamental tenet of their religion. They dont eat any of the root vegetables such as onions, potatoes, garlic, etc. as they believe that microorganisms living in the soil get injured when the plant is pulled up! Numbering a little over a lakh in the city, Jains are celebrating Maha Paryushan Parv this week. Jains celebrate their festivals by fasting, as they believe in celebrating the natural qualities of the soul, which is not nourished by over-eating and indulging in merrymaking.Jains are divided into Shwetambar and Digambar. There are sub-categories under Shwetambar like Terapanth, Sthankwasi, Mandirmargi, and in Digambar, Khandelwal, Porwal etc.All for one, one for all:Jain Seva Sangh is an autonomous body of the community, comprising a majority of Shwetambar Jains. Similarly, for Digambars, there is Digambar Jain Sanstha (DJS), which helps maintain their temples and assists in organising festivals and other activities. Whenever a Guru (Maharaj) travels to the city, DJS reportedly that takes care of all the arrangements. Within DJS, there is another group called Yuva Yuvati Mandal (YYM), founded by youngsters.One of the unique aspects of YYM is that there no positions of Secretary, President, etc. in the group. Using a lottery system, a five-member bench is elected every three months, which will carry out the activities. The main agenda of the group is to help youngsters in need. They also donate blood to the needy. There is another body called Jain International Trade Organisation (JITO) which is a worldwide organisation of businessmen, industrialists, knowledge workers and professionals, says DJS PR Lokender Jain.Food fundas:As far as food is concerned, Jains dont eat anything grown under the soil, and believe in preparing all masalas, wheat flour and all other flours at home, apparently due to hygiene concerns. Most Jains are in businesses such as money lending, jewellery, pharmaceuticals, real estate, food grains, etc. In the healthcare sector, Mahavir Hospital in the city is part of a Charitable Trust run by Jain Seva Sangh, which reportedly provides dialysis to patients at nominal prices.Festivals:Paryushan Parv and Mahaveer Jayanti are their big days. Maha Paryushan Parv is observed to put an end to needless desires, unwanted passions and all types of immoral behaviour. This annual event is celebrated for self-purification and upliftment by adhering to ten universal virtues viz. Uttam Kshama (forgiveness), Uttam Mardava (gentleness), Uttam Aarjava (straightforwardness), Uttam Shauch (purity), Uttam Satya (truth), Uttam Sanyam (restraint), Uttam Tap (penance), Uttam Tyaga (sacrifice), Uttam Aakinchanya (giving up possessions) and Uttam Brahmcharya (chastity).The festivals main aim is to help people in understanding the real nature of the soul and to stay away from worldly desires. It cautions against being too involved in material comforts and motivates practitioners to lead a simple and fulfilling life. During the festival, Jains shun fashionable clothes, eating outside food, spending too much time on social media, etc., adds Lokender.While the Paryushan Parv for Shwetambar Jains finished on September 2, the event began on September 3 for Digambar Jains, which continues till September 13."

But some human foods are dangerous for dogs and can harm them like grapes, onions, chocolates and avacado. Even cinnamon, oranges, corn and cherries are not good as these might make your dog sick. Now the question is what can dogs eat and what they cant off your plate? Weve made a list of some human foods you might offer to your pet.Healthy human food choices for your pupBlueberries: Berries make a great snack for your dog. Blueberries especially are packed with antioxidants that reduce inflammation and help the body heal and provide vitamins like Vitamin K and C.Apples: Apples contain a ton of fibre and have a sweet taste that dogs go crazy for. You can even dry apple slices on low heat in the oven for a tasty snack.Carrots: Dogs love carrots. They are packed with vitamins like Vitamin K and beta carotene and contain fibre and antioxidants. Due to its hard structure, dogs eats them very slowly. Eggs: One of the best people food for dogs are eggs. Your dogs system is built to utilise the protein and fats found in animal foods. You can grind up eggshells to add calcium to your dogs diet.Occasional treatsBananas: Bananas are packed with a lot of healthy vitamins and minerals, but also contain a fair amount of sugar, and that makes them one of the foods dogs should not eat much. Potatoes: While cooked potatoes are one of the safest foods for dogs, uncooked potatoes are poisonous for them. Cooked white potatoes can be diced up and given as treats or mashed and mixed with kibble for a special holiday meal.Shrimps: Shrimps contain high levels of Vitamin B12 and niacin, which are important for your dogs gut and metabolic health. They are also high in protein and low in fat which is great for dogs with pancreatitis or other fat-sensitive diseases.Bread: Many dogs love bread. But while bread isnt one of the worst things to feed a dog, it doesnt have a lot of positive health benefits."
2019-09-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-gdp-growth-agriculture-nso-data-straw-worth-clutching-5966859/,A straw that is worth clutching at,"The current economic slowdown began with Bharat. It has to also end with Bharat.AdvertisingAccording to the National Statistical Offices GDP estimates for April-June 2019 released on Friday, Indias agriculture sector  which includes forestry and fishing  grew 2.04% year-on-year during the quarter. But what is significant isnt the real growth (i.e. at constant prices) in gross value added or GVA. More relevant is GVA  the value of output of a good, less the cost of all inputs and raw material used in its production  rising by 7.90% in nominal terms or at current prices. It means farm prices going up by 5.74% in April-June 2019 over April-June 2018.This is, in fact, the highest increase in agricultural produce prices since July-September 2016, the quarter that preceded the demonetisation announcement of November 8, 2016. Since that overnight scrapping of all outstanding high-value currency notes by the Narendra Modi government, there have been some quarters where farm GVA growth has actually been lower in nominal than in real terms. Those quarters (April-June 2017, July-September 2018 and October-December 2018) had, in other words, registered negative inflation or deflation.The last quarters data suggests that farm prices are showing signs of recovery. Many commodities  from maize, bajra (pearl-millet), jowar (sorghum) and cotton, to onion and milk  are fetching good or better rates today compared to a year ago. If sustained in the coming quarters, it can help reignite growth in the broader economy through a revival in rural consumption that comes with higher incomes. The all-round slowdown we are seeing, after all, started with agriculture.AdvertisingTill the first half of 2014-15, agricultural GVA at current prices  a reasonable proxy for income or take home of farmers  was growing annually in double digits quarter after quarter. But a crash in global commodity prices brought this down to single digits. A temporary price recovery took place from 2016-17, partly enabled by the back-to-back droughts of the preceding two years. However, it was cut short by the domestic shock of demonetisation, followed by the goods and services tax.The accompanying table shows that nominal farm sector GVA growth has been in single digits for nine straight quarters now. Remember, doubling of incomes in five years requires annual growth of 14.4%; its 12% even for the six-year doubling target from 2016 to 2022 set by the Modi government.There is a ray of hope, though, from the latest farm produce inflation figure of 5.74% based on the GVA deflator. This straw is definitely worth clutching at, especially in a scenario of decent monsoon rains. After a poor June that recorded 32.8% deficiency, the country as a whole received 4.6% above-average rainfall in July and a surplus of 15.3% in August. As a result, the sowing area deficit in the kharif season, which was 26.7% relative to last years coverage till July 5, had reduced to just 1.7% by August-end.That raises the possibility of a bumper kharif crop, due for harvesting from October. With water levels in Indias 107 major reservoirs reaching 76.2% of their full capacity as on August 29  against the corresponding level of 68.4 % for 2018 and the last 10-years average of 61.1 % for this date  the prospects are even better for the coming rabi season.Theres, indeed, no better time than now to take two big steps that can truly turn things around in the agriculture sector.The first is doing away with all provisions in the Essential Commodities Act and state-level Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) laws that enable governments to impose restrictions on sale, stocking, domestic movement or export of farm produce. This can be done through an omnibus legislation conferring farmers the right to sell any quantity of their produce to anybody, anywhere and at any time, while extending similar freedom to agri-processors, traders and retailers to buy, stock up or export. A simple announcement of intent on the governments part in this regard is enough.Second, exempt traders dealing in farm produce from the 2% TDS (tax deducted at source) levy on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs 1 crore a year, imposed in the 2019-20 Union Budget. Like it or not, produce trading has always been predominantly cash-based. Farmers, too, like to be paid in cash. Demonetisation and assorted curbs discouraging cash payments above Rs 10,000 to any person in a single day  the 2% TDS comes on top of this  have severely impacted both liquidity and sentiment in mandis. The ultimate sufferer has been the farmer, whose time is better spent in the field than in the bank waiting for payment.In todays conditions, where digital is still some distance away in rural areas, there is a case to allow full payment in cash for produce sold by farmers in mandis. The 2% TDS can also be made non-leviable, if the excess cash withdrawn is used solely for transactions in APMC mandis, backed by appropriate gate/entry pass and bhugtan patra (payment slip) records.The above two measures can do much to bring back price sentiment and liquidity in agricultural markets, just when farmers are set to harvest a bumper crop. The most effective and immediate solution to the economys woes as well is to boost the incomes of those who will spend it best."
2019-09-04,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/midday-meal-scheme-has-worked-keep-politics-out/story-C5EfqzjdSTOEjRLoWF1q9J.html,Midday meal scheme has worked: Keep politics out,"analysisUpdated: Sep 04, 2019 19:02 ISTThe midday meal controversy in Uttar Pradesh where a journalist alleged that children were being given substandard meals, and its fall out, whatever the merits or demerits of the case, is one in a long list of controversies which have plagued the scheme since it was universalised in 2001. Tamil Nadu was the one state which had the foresight to have started the scheme earlier with positive results for enrolment and retention in schools.Some years ago, I visited a midday meal kitchen run by the NGO Naandi Foundation in Hyderabad, one of many it ran at that time. The food was steamed cooked in large steel vats, eliminating the need for oil; small additions like fresh soy milk and pickles were included to the menu after the NGO found that the children liked the taste of these. Most of all, the scheme was flexible enough to allow the children to take home bits of leftover food for their younger siblings. Local women were engaged to prepare the raw material for the meals and clean the kitchens. The NGO ensured that the meals were not monotonous, and incorporated different vegetables and dals every day. On the odd occasions, a dessert would be added to the meal. The retention rate in schools which availed of the scheme was spectacular.The midday meal is perhaps the single biggest achievement in the school system in India. Apart from increasing enrolment and retention, it has brought down hunger, and promoted health and cognitive abilities in children. There is simply nothing that anyone can find that is wrong with it, if you leave out the politics.But as with all good schemes, several extraneous considerations come into play. In some states, ostensibly due to religious reasons, eggs were done away with, although this is a vital nutritional addition to the midday meal scheme. Several experts believe that the addition of milk and eggs in the meal is invaluable in a country where many children suffer from stunting as a result of poor nutrition in childhood. But the arguments against eggs and milk have included these food items being difficult to transport  in the case of eggs, it being easily breakable, and in the case of milk, it being prone to spoiling and contamination. It is passing strange that state governments which run the schemes are unwilling to take the responsibility of preventing such spoiling, breakage and contamination. The other foolish argument is that serving eggs would make vegetarian children uncomfortable.Also read: Salt-roti midday meal: Yogi government to examine FIR against journalistThe answer should be simple: they should be given an alternative, but surely no one has a right to object to a food item that some children may wish to eat. A popular NGO which serves midday meals across the country refuses to serve food which includes onions and garlic on religious grounds. It also refuses to include eggs on the menu. But, surely the primary concern must be that the meal served should be tasty and nutritious for the child and not the religious beliefs of the provider. It is here that the state governments should step in and insist that the providers should keep their beliefs aside, and do what is best for the child.Also read: 260 self-help groups barred from supplying midday meal in Mumbai municipal schoolsOther counterproductive tinkering with the system is the proposal to provide the child with uncooked grains and lentils to take home. This cannot guarantee that the child will actually get the food, especially the girl child whose nutritional needs are often overlooked in a patriarchal society. A former minister for women and child development argued long and hard for packaged food on the grounds that it was more hygienic and less prone to any form of contamination. Now, that may well be so, but a hot meal is what a growing child needs, and that too something to suit his or her taste. The success of Tamil Nadu has not been in just implementing the midday meal scheme across the state but in providing food that the child is familiar with.In the case of the Hyderabad NGO I visited, some children had actually started bringing their smaller siblings to the school premises, where they would play in the grounds until the meal was served and get a small portion of the leftover food. This served two purposes: it provided some nutrition to the child who was not yet in school and created a favourable environment for enrolment at home, and it freed up the school-going child from having to stay home to help care for the smaller child.This is one scheme which successive governments ought to be proud of. The endeavour now should be to work to make it even more attractive by incorporating food that children relate to, and ensuring that when it comes to the health and educational progress of children, politics does not become the spoiler.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comFirst Published: Sep 04, 2019 19:02 IST"

Most had nine or less count of hemoglobin against normal range of 12 to 15 grams per deciliter of blood.The poor nutritional index served as a wake up call which set Bhalgamiya along with colleagues K J Jodhani and R D Jivani on a brainstorming session. The trio checked tiffin boxes of students and were not surprised to see almost all had dry snacks like sev-mamra, chevda, chips and fried food which was high on empty calories but poor in nutrition.Balgamiya decided to take the matter into his hands literally. We asked girls to bring just one fistful of pulses including green gram, kidney beans, chickpea, etc which they would soak overnight and sprout by lunchtime the next day, he says. The girls were fed this high-protein dish daily. To appeal to the kids' taste, teachers made a bhel adding lime, chilli, onion, tomato and salt.Over months, the simple solution started showing healthy results. Iron deficiency among girls started disappearing with improvement in their overall health. Encouraged, the school included sprouted beans in midday meal scheme.The initiative was lauded at different fora including educational innovation fair at IIM Ahmedabad . It was also placed in innovation gallery at Rashtrapati Bhavan for other regions to implement. The biggest compliment, however, was when the state government acknowledged the simple intervention to address anaemia and adopted it in the mid-day meal in 2017.A 2018 GR directed inclusion of pulses compulsory to include legumes in mid-day meals offered in all government schools,"" said a top education department official. Recently, Bhalgamiya recently presented the idea to trainee IAS officers and administrators for implementation. Now, we have shifted focus on improving nutritional value of food served to students for helping build stronger society and nation, said Jivani, Bhalgamiyas fellow teacher."

The complainant, Rajkumar Raikwar, offered to give an affidavit to withdraw the FIR, but he has been forced not to do so, police officials privy to the matter said.Superintendent of police, Mahoba, Swami Nath said 23 people were named in the FIR and the remaining 20 were not named. Even those unidentified were referred to as Muslims in the complaint.Police are investigating the case. As of now, (theres) nothing as such that anyone was forced to have biryani or were they tricked into having it, he said.The situation is normal in the village, he said. The case was registered under Sections 153 A (promoting enmity between groups on religious grounds), 420 (cheating), 295 A (malicious acts) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, the police said.The alleged incident took place in Salat village of Mahoba on August 31 during an urs (annual religious congregation) at a local shrine.Pappu Mansoori, caretaker of the shrine, said the urs was being organised for the past many years.Both Hindus and Muslims attend the urs and the faithful organise bhandara (feast) for them. This year, there were two stalls from which puri-sabzi and biryani was given to the people who came from 13 villages in large numbers.One Kalloo Qazi, who was offering thanksgiving on fulfilment of a wish, had distributed chicken biryani and people had it on their own volition; the entire thing was twisted out of context and (it was) rumoured that buffalo meat mixed with rice was served to them, he saidThe issue was settled after a panchayat convened on September 2 decided Kalloo would pay Rs 50,000 as cost of travel to Prayagraj where those who had eaten biryani would bathe in the Sangam to purify themselves, said Braj Gopal Kushwaha, the village head. Thereafter, the police were informed about the decision, he said. Both the parties even had written to the police that it was a non-issue, he said.However, the BJP MLA arrived with his supporters on September 3 and alleged that Hindus devotees were deliberately given rice mixed with buffalo meat without alerting them.Rajput said the Hindus were fed biryani as part of a conspiracy.They were told that it was sweet rice, but when they ate it they found pieces of meat, he alleged.At the panchayat, Kalloo Qazi admitted he had served biryani and agreed to repent by paying Rs 50,000 for shuddikaran (purification) and recital of the Bhagwat Gita, he claimed.The Muslims were clearly deceitful. Among Hindus, prasad (consecrated food) doesnt have even onion and garlic. But here, there was meat to hurt religious sentiments, he said, adding the Muslims from outside the village were involved in the conspiracy.There are only four Muslim families in Salat village and organising urs on such a scale is beyond their capacity, he said.The MLA also said the shrine was of a fakir who never existed and the urs was held only for the last two years.The forest department has found the shrine was built illegally on its land in violation of Supreme Court orders, he alleged.First Published: Sep 06, 2019 11:54 IST"

With Onam nearing, people thronged the stall to buy farm produce. It is one among the many stalls offering farm produce at subsidised rates as part of the governments intervention to control market prices.Onam markets will be organised from Saturday to Tuesday, whereby vegetables will be made available at heavily slashed rates.Two hundred such stalls set up jointly by the Agriculture Department, Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council (VFPCK) are slated to be opened in the city offering vegetables.The prices of farm produce in major vegetable markets in the city are skyrocketing. The sellers are charging triple the prices we are offering. All vegetables will be available at 20 per cent discounted rates at our stalls. If the prices in the markets increase further, then more discount will be provided to keep a check on the rates. The rates will be fixed on a daily basis depending on the prices in the vegetable markets, says Krishna Prasad P K, manager of the outlet in Palayam.All the farm produce necessary to celebrate Onam have arrived at the market in Anayara. These will be up for sale from Saturday at discounted rates, he said.Apart from the Horticorp outlets, several new Onam markets will be set up until Tuesday.The produce sourced from Kerala and those from other states are placed at different counters, thereby making it easier for the public to buy naadan varieties. Some vegetables such as tomatoes, beans, onions, potatoes, beetroot and such are not being cultivated here in large numbers. So we have to procure them from other states. We have stocked up enough to cater to the Onam demand this time, says Krishna Prasad.For people like Jayachandran B who regularly buys vegetables from Horticorp, the special Onam markets are a godsend. Such markets help arrest the prices and we get to buy fresh farm produce. During such festive occasions, retailers hike prices. These interventions help provide farm produce at affordable rates, says Jayachandran, a retired government servant.Anne John also echoes the same sentiment. Apart from arresting the prices, we also get local produce. I always buy from Horticorp and only get the produce made in the state, she says."

Constricted supply to the city has raised prices in the wholesale and retail markets.The prices of vegetables , compared to the same period in 2018, are 20% higher this year.Deepak Patel, secretary of the Ahmedabad Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) said, The heavy rain across the state for the last few days, has affected vegetable production and there is consequently a lower supply to the market. This has raised prices this year by about 20% compared to the same period last year. Vegetable cultivation requires sunny days and cloudy weather hurts it.A senior officer said that the increase in onion prices from mid-August on was expected. Onion acreage this year dipped by an alarming 80% compared to 2018. For the summer crop, onion was sown only on 1,811 hectares in Gujarat, which was 20% of the 9,214 hectares sown in 2018. Onion acreage this year was just 16% of the one-decade average of 11,375 hectares.APMC officials said that the once the weather clears, vegetable supply will increase and prices will fall. APMC officials said they do not have any control over the retail market. In the retail market , prices vary from area to area. If a kilo of onions costs Rs 70 in Satellite, it will cost Rs 35 in areas such as Naroda or Bapunagar."
2019-09-08,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hurricane-dorian-silence-devastation-mark-bahamas-town/article29367425.ece,"Hurricane Dorian: silence, devastation mark Bahamas town","The streets are filled with smashed cars, snapped power cables, shattered trees and deep silence.At the airport and dock, hundreds of people clamour for seats on airplanes and berths on ships arriving with aid and departing with people who lost their homes when deadly Hurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas.Nearly a week after disaster roared in from the sea, the rest of Marsh Harbour on Abaco island felt empty on Saturday. A hot wind whistled through stands of decapitated pine trees and homes that collapsed during the most powerful hurricane in the northwestern Bahamas recorded history.Rescue teams were still trying to reach some Bahamian communities isolated by floodwaters and debris after the disaster that killed at least 43 people. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis says 35 people died on Abaco and eight on Grand Bahama island.The U.S. Coast Guard said it has rescued a total of 290 people in the northern Bahamas following the hurricane. Six MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters and nine cutters are helping in the aid effort, the Coast Guard said.The United Nations said eight tons of food supplies were on the way by ship. Some 14,700 ready-to-eat meals as well as logistical and telecommunications equipment are being delivered, said Herve Verhoosel, spokesman for the U.N. World Food Program.The needs remain enormous, Mr. Verhoosel said.No official figures were available, but much of the population of Marsh Harbour, home to most of the roughly 20,000 residents of Abaco, seemed to have already left. Many were staying with relatives in the capital, Nassau, others with family in Florida and other parts of the United States.In Marsh Harbours Murphy Town neighborhood, on a hill overlooking the azure sea, Jackson Blatch and his son-in-law were already rebuilding. In a blazing midday sun they stripped damaged shingles from Mr. Blatchs roofs and tossed them into his truck, parked below the eaves of a home he built by hand.Like a few other Abaco residents, Mr. Blatch is staying on an island pulverised by nature.Everybody says, Leave. Leave and go where? Mr. Blatch asked. My plan is to rebuild this island. I have a lot to offer.Unlike almost every other home on Abaco, Mr. Blatchs house had little damage. He is a builder who prides himself on quality work. When mixing concrete, he never skimps, always precisely blending the recommended amounts of cement, sand and gravel for floors, columns and ceilings.When he poured his walls and floors, he laced them thick with rebar, constructing a powerful skeleton that resisted the storm.Instead of using the manufacturer-provided clips on his hurricane shutters, he used long screws on as many as possible to fix the shutters tight to the window frame.When Dorian hit, it only managed to rip away the shutters with store-bought clips, and a few sections of shingles, leaving some of the Mr. Blatch familys possessions wet but the structure and furnishings intact.So Mr. Blatch has power from a generator, drinking water, food and the help of his son-in-law, 25-year-old Moses Monestine.I dont have a mortgage. I dont want to go to Nassau, he said. I dont want to go to the United States. I dont want to depend on anyone.Abacoans, as island residents are known, describe themselves as a self-sufficient and resourceful, used to making their living from the sea. Blocks and even entire neighbourhoods are taken up by extended families a cousin next door to a brother next door to a sister-in-law, forming instant support networks that went into action ahead of the storm.Many Abacoans work on ships or docks, others at the second homes that wealthy Americans have built throughout the long, curving island.Brian Russell, 55, is a marine engineer who has lived through three hurricanes on sea and many others on land.In his home in the Dundas Town neighborhood, he has six months of drinking water and four months of water for bathing. He has a generator, and months of food.The destruction doesnt deter him.Ive been around a long time, he said. It doesnt bother me. Anywhere you go, life is what you make of it.Once the water contaminated by the storm is clean, Mr. Russell said, he can live on fishing and gardening. His little garden of onion, tomato and banana plants was destroyed, but he plans to replant, and even add soursop, mango and sugar apple.Others were more stuck than determined.Sterling McKenzie, a 67-year-old retired equipment operator, is living in his sisters house with other relatives whose homes were destroyed. They are surviving on water and food donated by Bahamian officials and aid workers who pass by daily.We might as well stay here and battle it out, he said. I aint got no choice."
2019-09-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-when-farmers-form-a-company-to-procure-from-farmers-5978276/,Maharashtra: When farmers form a company to procure from farmers,"On August 28, Shivaji More and other directors of the Ramling Farmers Producer Company (FPC) in the village of Wadzire in Ahmednagars Parner taluka heaved a sigh of relief as the 113 tonnes of onion they had procured on behalf of the central government left for the Azadpur Mandi in New Delhi. This was the first time their FPC had ventured into government procurement. As a result, their farmers saved on the transport cost  instead of taking their produce to the wholesale market they sold it at the farm gate  and yet received better remuneration.AdvertisingFor a long time, it has been argued that FPCs can improve the returns farmers get for their produce while possibly reducing the prices that consumers pay for the final product. FPCs are village level companies registered under the Companies Act. The central government had announced a five-year tax holiday for FPCs in the 2018-19 Union Budget with the hope that these bodies would allow farmers to earn more. FPCs work on the principle of aggregation and improve the bargaining power of farmers both in the wholesale markets as well as in the market of inputs such as fertilisers and seeds.Ramling FPC is not the only one that has been active this year. Of the 30,000 tonnes of onion that the National Cooperative Agricultural Marketing Federation (Nafed) has been offloading in the past few weeks to cool down onion prices, about 25,000 tonnes has been produced through MahaFPC, the apex body for village level FPCs in the state.The procurement process started on April 4 with 39 FPCs spread across seven districts in Maharashtra. A total of 3,456 farmers sold around 25,000 tonnes of onion with the total purchase value pegged at around Rs 30 crore. Price discovery was done by taking into consideration the nearby mandi prices. Generally our prices were Rs 2- Rs 3 per kg higher than the prevalent prices, and farmers saved on transport costs as well. Thus, the FPCs managed to attract procurement from their members, says Yogesh Thorat, Managing Director of MahaFPC. The processing and handling charges were paid to the FPC and MahaFPC by Nafed.What further saved costs for farmers was the facility to store onions in the fields itself in the dust- and moisture-proof storage structures (popularly known as kanda chawls). Whats more, the sorting and grading of onions is done before they are stored. Further, since the chawls are geo-tagged, once the produce was weighed and stored, the FPC electronically submitted their bills to MahaFPC, which, in turn, forwarded the details to Nafed. Final payments were made directly into the bank accounts of the farmers by the FPCs. Farmers were asked to submit their land, bank and Aadhaar details to streamline the process."
2019-09-09,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/an-onam-with-safe-fresh-vegetables/article29369916.ece,"An Onam with safe, fresh vegetables","The State government has opened 2,000 outlets under the umbrella of the Agriculture Department with the promise of making safe-to-eat, pesticide-free, and locally grown vegetables available this Onam.On Sunday, a steady stream of people thronged the Horticorp outlet at Palayam where Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the Onasamruddhi farm sale a few days ago. By the afternoon, four loads of vegetables had arrived at the outlet, open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. till Tuesday as part of the initiative.Krishnaprasad P.K., stall manager, says vegetables grown by farmers in the State are largely available at the stall, and it is only for produce such as brinjals, beans, ladys finger, and onion that they have to depend on other States.Two categoriesVegetables at the outlet are sold in two categories  those procured locally and those from other States. There is a special counter for cool-clime vegetables from Vattavada and Kanthallur areas.Plantain available at the stall are locally grown. We do not buy plantain other than that supplied by local farmers, Mr. Krishnaprasad says.Farmers in the Peringamala and Vembayam areas are among those who supply vegetables and plantain to the outlet. The supply is also augmented to some extent by farmers who grow vegetables on a small scale and supply whatever excess they have after personal use to the outlet here.Subsidised priceThe subsidised price of vegetables is a good draw, he says.The nendran variety of plantain is being sold for over 75 in the open market, but here it is priced at 47. There is subsidy of 30 to 50% on vegetables.Saji John, CEO of Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK), says as compared to last year, the floods have not caused much of a dent in supply.Vegetables grown locally for Onam are available, and only for those grown outside the State are we dependent on others.The significant aspect this year is that the 2,000 outlets opened have been with the coordination of all agencies such as VFPCK, Horticorp, farmers collectives, and so on. Famers groups and clusters, he says, have put in huge efforts to supply vegetables for Onam.Where the VFPCK farmers are concerned, a lot of planning have gone into ensuring that their produce is adequate to meet the Onam market requirements.Immediately after the floods, farmers have some issues in finding a market for their produce, but now, the sales are good.He highlighted the interventions made in the Vattavada and Kanthallur areas, under the leadership of the Agriculture Minister, to ensure that the produce reached the State markets directly.Krishi BhavansWith the coordination of all agencies, steps were taken to understand how much farmers could grow and supply and their names are registered with Krishi Bhavans so that direct procurement could be done, he says."
2019-09-09,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amid-acute-poverty-saharia-children-battle-malnutrition/article29369050.ece,"Amid acute poverty, M.P.’s Saharia children battle malnutrition","On July 9, when Akki Adiwasi returned home after working in the fields, she found her 18-month-old son lying unusually quiet, with eyes closed. She nudged him  even shook him  but to no avail. By then, Amir Awadesh, his chest shrivelled and cheeks sunken, had died of hunger.He didnt die of hunger. Usse sookhe ki bimari ne cheen liya (the disease of drought snatched him away), quips Akki, a resident of Tiktoli village in Sheopur district.While her husband is away in Gujarat for three months to work as an agricultural labourer for 150 a day, their half-an-acre arid field here lies fallow. Only milk from a few goats, shoring up their one-room ramshackle hut, and wheat given by neighbours, keep Akki, who is pregnant, and her other son, aged three, alive.Loss of livesAcute malnutrition among Saharias, a particularly vulnerable tribal group, due to crushing poverty, delayed breastfeeding, premature pregnancies and seasonal migrations is continuing to take away lives. As a result, every second child under five in the Shivpuri and Sheopur districts of central India is underweight. Even the country, in the 2018 Global Hunger Index, ranked an abysmal 103 out of 119 countries, consistently showing a downward trend on wasting and undernourishment parameters.Mitti Adiwasi, an anganwadi worker in Nonheta Khurd village in the Shivpuri district, breastfed her 10 children, two dead now, for the first time, three days after being delivered of them. Until then, they were fed only jaggery syrup or honey.The first milk is impure. Thats because it is extracted from breasts after nine long months, she says.Chipping in, Danmati Adiwasi, wife of a school teacher who earns 22,000 a month, says, Moreover, women become polluted at the time of a delivery. They need to bathe after three days and only then feed newborns, otherwise the milk would only cause them harm. Right after the birth of her son a few years ago at a hospital, when she was prompted to breastfeed him, she just put his mouth to her breast, and received 1,400 in the name of an institutional delivery.According to the National Family Health Survey 2014-2015, just 43.2% of children under three were breastfed within the first hour of their birth in rural parts of Sheopur district.Seasonal migrationAlmost all the 35 families in the village, taking their children along and leaving behind the elderly, migrate to Rajasthan and Agra to harvest wheat and potatoes every year.When families returned in July this year, the anganwadi workers noticed that more number of children had come back weaker. While three boys and four girls out of 83 children were underweight in April, 15 girls and four boys are in the category this month.Girls are most affected as parents mostly take them along with them to fields where they are neglected, wander under the sun, dont get food, and contract diseases easily during the monsoon, says an anganwadi worker.For each bigha of wheat they harvest in Rajasthan, 6-7 labourers get a quintal in return. And each villager manages to bring back at least two quintals. Individual families have no more than two acres each to themselves, mostly arid, and completely dependant on rain.When we run out of it, we barter PDS (public distribution system) rice,which is unsavoury, in exchange for wheat from a local vendor, says Parmal Adivasi. Married at 15, he lost two infants who were born weak. In the past fortnight, two meals of chappatis with dry onions or chilli chutney is all he and his wife have been eating.We dont have breakfast. A vegetable dish or dal is a luxury. And children dont get to eat until they start howling out of hunger. Toddlers get only a roti each in a day, he says. Seven individuals in the village, including children, suffer from tuberculosis (TB). Ajay Yadav, a social worker who has been working in the area for 18 years, believes higher incidence of tuberculosis among Saharias is linked to the high malnutrition level among them and vice versa. An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study revealed that, among Saharias, TB prevalence is an alarming 1,995 per 1,00,000 persons."

Soon the payments stopped coming in and the dues mounted to Rs 30 lakh. After the farmers filed a police complaint, the cops found nobody at the address provided by the farmers.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mumbais conmen have found a new target: gullible farmers of Nashik.Over the past one year, eight cases have been registered with the police at Pimpalgaon, a town an hours drive from Nashik known for. All eight cases involve farmers growing either onions or grapes and who were cheated by exporters based out of Mumbai and Thane.In all eight cases the exporters offered to buy the farmers produce for rates much higher than what they would get locally. While initial payments were made, cheques began bouncing subsequently.After chasing them for payments for months  making multiple visits to their offices and residences in Mumbai  when the cheated farmers filed police complaints, the businessmen filed counter-complaints of kidnapping, assault and even molestation against them in Mumbai and Nashik.Now the farmers are caught between making round of police stations and courts to recover the lost money on the one hand, and on the other defending themselves against trumped up charges.Some of these farmers dreamt of bettering their lot and floated their own companies. They acquired trading licences and started out on their own, but because they lacked both business expertise and experience, they were sitting ducks for the rogue traders.Ajit Patil, a 46-year-old onion farmer from Deopur village in Nashiks Niphad tehsil, along with his six brothers launched a company named Vrindavan Export around seven years ago. Patil and his brothers initially conducted business without any outside help and did well for themselves. In 2014, four people from Sion Koliwada approached Patil with a deal to sell his produce at good prices abroad. They introduced themselves as executives of a company named Sreenathji Food Agro Pvt Ltd.Over the next four years, Patil not only sent his produce over to Sreenathji Food, he also collected grapes and onions from farmers around Pimpalgaon and handed these over to the company. It was all smooth for a few months, after which the payments stopped. Last year, Patil filed a police complaint against Sreenathji Food saying he hasnt been paid Rs 4.61 crore. Patils company has been shut, hes fallen into debt trap, and worse, the wife of Sreenathji Foods owner has filed a police complaint against him alleging molestation.Im ruined, says Patil, Rajan Munni, who owns Sreenathji Food, is nowhere to be found. My complaint is pending since August last year and I am battling charges of molesting Munnis wife. And I have to answer the creditors.Interestingly, Munni was recently booked by the Bhoiwada police for allegedly cheating a 75-year-old Customs official of Rs 8.17 crore through a Ponzi scheme.Another farmer doing the rounds of a Mumbai police station is 48-yearold Gopi Shaikh from Pimpalgaon, who says a Mumbai exporter owes him Rs 18 lakh. Soon after the cheques issued by the exporter bounced, Shaikh filed a police complaint on August 17. He was in for a shock when he received a call a few days later from the Azad Maidan Police Station, where the exporter filed a cross-complaint saying Shaikh had kidnapped him and forced him to sign on the cheques.Shaikh travels to Mumbai all the way from Pimpalgaon every time the police summons him.Shaikh, an onion farmer, says he rues the day he met the exporter, Maqbool Noor, who runs a firm called Noor Imports and Exports, and who sold him the idea to export his produce to Dubai. Shaikh had secured his trading licence in 2016 in the name of his firm Al-Umar Fruit and Vegetable Suppliers and was keen to expand his business.Noor said that he had contacts in the Middle East and he could help me export my produce there. Between January 2018 and May this year, I supplied 29,000-kg onions, worth Rs 30 lakh, and got paid only Rs 12 lakh, Shaikh says.He says that his is a fledgling company, launched with the help of a partner, and a loss of Rs 18 lakh is a death knell to his business. Because a majority of our business is conducted on trust, I did not insist on documentation. Once the payments stopped coming, I made several trips to his office at Fort but couldnt get a penny out of him because there was nothing on paper, he says.On June 16 at the, the two men had an altercation in full public view which landed at the police station. Noor issued post-dated cheques of Rs 18 lakh in front of the cops at Pimpalgaon. All the cheques bounced and now there is a case against me saying I had kidnapped him and obtained the cheques forcefully, Shaikh says.Noors son Ahmad claims that it was Shaikhs intention to extort from his father. Not only did he threaten my father, he went on to kidnap him during his visit to Pimpalgaon. Hes now playing the victim, but we have filed a case against him at Azad Maidan Police Station, Ahmad says.Officers at both Azad Maidan and Pimpalgaon police stations would only say that all documents have been submitted before the court.Even as the law says that the accused in the cheque-bouncing cases will have to be immediately arrested and produced in court under the Negotiable Instruments Act, the complainant doesnt get the money back immediately. In the cases where the farmers have filed a police complaint, the accused have managed to get bail.The farmers cases are also weakened by the fact that the business of agriculture in Maharashtra is run on trust, and theres rarely anything on paper. Senior Inspector Sanjay Mahajan from Pimpalgaon Police Station stresses on this problem and says the farmers are vulnerable to frauds largely because trust has always been the backbone of the business of agriculture.No agreements exist. The farmers dont even know the names of the companies they are dealing with, leave alone their addresses, he says.Mahajan says the police have launched a drive at all 18 villages near the Pimpalgaon market to make the farmers aware of such frauds. We are stressing on the need to possess legal documents before entering into any deal.Even then, the numbers of those cheated could be much larger than what the police complaints reflect. For instance, several farmers in Pimpalgaon and the nearby villages who have been similarly cheated havent approached the police fearing countercomplaints. They call it a double whammy: pay the lawyers to fight the case filed by them and pay another set of lawyers in Mumbai to defend them in cases filed by the exporters or their kin. Two such examples are onion cultivators Asif Shaikh and Shivaji Deore.Shaikh says hes yet to receive Rs 19 lakh from a Mumbai-based trading company while Deore is waiting for an exporter to clear his dues amounting to Rs 24 lakh. Both havent approached the police; instead they are hoping for some sort of divine intervention or a miracle. In Deores case, he hasnt received money for exports to Pakistan in the wake of the troubles between the two countries.Deore says the rogue exporters know how to bully the farmers. The exporter in Mumbai who has to pay me issued the cheques, but brazenly told me that theyll bounce. He said that I had a choice to wait or battle it out in the court. He says hell pay me once he receives the payments from other parties and Im hoping he sticks to his word, Deore told this newspaper.Another stumbling block for the farmers  and this goes back to the lack of documentation while doing the deal  is they are rarely able to provide the police with the defaulters addresses. In the case of Ajit Patil, all he knew was that Sreenathji Food Agro Pvt Ltd was operating out of a few buildings in Sion Koliwada. When the police reached the address, they found nobody.Similarly, grape cultivator Vaibhav Patil, who along with 20 other farmers was allegedly duped by a Thane-based exporter named Ravi Sharma of Rs 30 lakh, realised the addresses and contact details of Sharma could be fake when he found nobody at the address provided. The police have informed us that the address we provided doesnt exist. There is no sign of the exporter who owes us money, Patil says."
2019-09-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/first-time-in-30-yrs-why-nafed-faces-challenge-j-k-himachal-apples-procurement-5984373/,"First time in 30 years, why NAFED faces challenge","The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) has not bought a single kilogram of apples for the last three decades or more.AdvertisingWe did not have to, as this trade was always in private hands and the government didnt think it necessary for us to intervene, said an official from the nodal agency that procures oilseeds, pulses, copra, onion and cotton to deliver the minimum support price (MSP) declared by the Centre to farmers.But now, NAFED has been tasked with purchasing all the apples that growers bring to sell at mandis in the Valley. A bumper crop, for which there would hardly be any private buyers with all the current movement restrictions, makes it all the more challenging.Explained Driving the economy With production worth Rs 8,000 crore, apple forms a crucial part of Jammu and Kashmirs economy. With a bumper crop, ensuring its marketing and a fair price has become a priority for the government.Jammu & Kashmir accounts for about 18 lakh tonnes (lt) out of Indias total annual apple production of 23-24 lt, which also includes 4.5-5 lt from Himachal Pradesh and 50,000-60,000 tonnes from Uttarakhand. This year, the countrys output is projected to touch 26 lt due to good snowfall, with J&K alone harvesting 20 lt or so.AdvertisingWe have been told to buy whatever is offered to us, though the indicative target is to procure 12 lt from the Valley. There is no MSP for apple. The state government will fix the procurement prices for different grades (A, B and C) and varieties. It is expected that we will pay 5 per cent more than the market price prevailing last year. The total cost of procurement operations is tentatively assessed at Rs 5,000 crore, the NAFED official told The Indian Express.The J&K Directorate of Horticulture, Planning & Marketing would do the actual procurement, with NAFED taking delivery of the apples. The purchases will start from September 12 at four mandis  Shopian, Sopore, Parimpora (Srinagar) and Batango (Anantnag)  and we would add more centres as arrivals pick up, the official said.Apple harvesting is now on mainly in HP, where an estimated 50-60 per cent of the fruit in the main belt of Shimla, Narkanda, Sainj and Rohru are still on the trees. Harvesting in Kashmir will start peaking only towards end-September. There may be some harvesting before that, but growers generally do not bring their crop to the market till it is over in Himachal. Peak harvesting in the Valley happens in October and the apples keep arriving till early December, said a Delhi-based trader.Currently, Royal Delicious apple is fetching an average modal price of Rs 3,300 per quintal in Shimla, as against Rs 7,800-7,900 at this time last year. That has mainly to do with a bigger crop, likely in Kashmir as well.But for NAFED, the real challenge lies in the very short preparation time. We opened our office in Srinagar only late last week, while the order for procurement under the Centres market intervention scheme came to us at 1:30 am on Tuesday. It leaves us with hardly much time to undertake registration of growers, collecting their Aadhaar and bank account details for making direct benefit transfer payment. Ideally, this process should have happened at the time of flowering, but that option simply does not exist now, the official said.NAFED has been asked to complete the entire procurement operation by mid-December. Payment to growers accounts is also supposed to take place within 48 hours of procurement."
2019-09-11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/onion-crop-in-dharwad-district-facing-threat-of-pest-attack/article29387073.ece,Onion crop in Dharwad district facing threat of pest attack,"As the onion crop in Dharwad district is facing the threat of attack by Spodoptera pest, which is nocturnal, scientists from the University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad (UAS-D) have suggested precautionary measures for pest control.A release from Shubha S., Senior Scientist and Head ICAR-Krishi Vigyan Kendra, stated that onion is a major commercial crop of the district and it is grown in large quantities in Navalgund, Hubballi, and Dharwad taluks. However, this pest is active during the night and attacks crops with more severity. The species parasitises plants as the larvaes eating pattern is vigorous; many times leaving the leaves completely destroyed.The effects of the moths are quite disastrous, destroying economically important agricultural crops and decreasing yield in some plants completely.Following heavy rain in the region, the soil is swampy which is very conducive for this pest to multiply.To rescue the onion crop from this pest attack, the scientists at the University of Agricultural Sciences here have embarked upon initiating control measures and protecting the yield.They have formed teams to visit the fields wherein complaints of pest attack have been reported. They have asked farmers to add 0.15 ml clorantra neeliprol, 18.5 sc or 0.12 ml spinosad, 45 sc or 2 ml clorefirifos, 20 ec or 2 ml quinolfas to one litre of water and spray it to the crops. The farmers have to dump field waste and spray this mixture to attract the pest and kill them.They can also use 2 kg of jaggery dissolved in water and mix residual of paddy and add 100 ml monocrotophos, preserve it for 78 hours, and later, sprinkle it in the fields to control the pest menace, according to UAS, the release said."
2019-09-11,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/sep/11/city-institutions-usher-in-onam-2031921.html,City institutions usher in Onam,"By Express News ServiceKOCHI: Festivals are usually occasions of pomp and gaiety but they also give us a chance to reflect on virtues of compassion and benevolence. As Onam fervour reaches a crescendo, heres a roundup of how educational institutions in the city ushered in the festivities with acts of generosity and togetherness.Around 35 patients of the palliative care unit of Ernakulam General Hospital and mentally challenged students of Buds School, Mulavukad, joined the Onam celebrations at St Alberts College recently. I am grateful to everyone who organised this celebration. At a time when senior parents are being abandoned by their children, this is a warm gesture, said Ramachandran, a patient. The college management organised the event to foster a sense of compassion among its students. A dance performance by the students of Buds left the audience in awe. 33 per cent of the funds collected was earmarked for supporting relief activities in the aftermath of floods.The students of the Commerce Department of St Pauls College, Kalamassery, celebrated Onam in a noble way. The fund allotted for procuring flowers for pookalam was instead used to buy vegetables to make the mandala and later donated to an orphanage run by social activist Theruvoram Murugan. There are around 27 to 30 inmates in the orphanage who were rescued from the streets.The orphange sustains itself through contributions. I asked the students to think about doing something different and they came up with the idea of making a design using vegetables, said Jibin Jacob, assistant professor, who mentored the initiative. We used 150 kg of vegetables to make the carpet. The vegetables were selected keeping in mind the needs of the inmates, added Jibin. The carpet comprised of an array of veggies including brinjals, beetroots, tomatoes, onions, drumstick, French beans, pumpkin, elephant foot yam, cucumber, colocasia, banana flower, carrots, ladys finger, ivy gourd, snake gourd, cowpea, potatoes and shallots.Onam celebrations held at Toc H Public School saw students presenting dance and music performances which highlighted various traditions associated with the festival and artforms unique to Kerala. The celebration commenced with toddlers of kindergarten welcoming everyone by reciting the popular song Vannalo vannalo onam vannalo.

The farmers are busy bringing large loads of flowers to the market. They are repacked in containers to be sent to different destinations.Central Kerala receives its share of flowers from Seelyampatty. Onam, the main season for flowers, is getting over though the business here continues as usual.The interiors of the village look like a flower carpet in different hues. But all is not rosy for them.Severe shortage of water and fluctuating prices are pushing the farmers to the brink. Varun, a farmer at Seelayampatty, says the price of jasmine which reached 1,200 a kg has dropped to 800 in a single day. It may fall further in the coming days. Though jasmine is the costliest flower in the market, it is cultivated in a very small area.The price of jamanthi (chrysanthemum) which rose to 300 a kg has dropped to 200 and marigold which fetched 70 prior to Onam is down to 30.You have to harvest the flowers every day and only fresh ones are taken to the market. If damaged or delayed, they cannot be sold. The prices depend solely on the demand and orders from customers, says Lakshmi, another farmer.Mullaperiyar damThe farmers also cultivate small onion as inter-crop along with rose plants. Varun says the small onion is ready for harvest. However, the price is only 20 a kg.The scale of cultivation has dwindled in the floriculture hub over the years. Pandyan has left a portion of his land uncultivated owing to lack of water. The delayed monsoon had an impact on the farms of Seelyampatty. Water from the Mullaperiyar dam was released to the farms only a few days ago. And the cultivation schedule has been disturbed. Plants with dried-up flowers can be seen in large areas in the village.Though the flowers are ready for harvest throughout the year, business is dull during the monsoon months. The wedding season and Sabarimala pilgrimage season are important. The village had received mild rain, that too just two times, this season. With the water in the Mullaperiyar dam not up to the expected level, the farmers are a worried lot. They say the dam used to be in its full capacity by this time of the year."

And why import from Pakistan? Is the Indian farmer a bigger enemy?, asked Raju Shetty, chairman of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana.The MMTC tender, dated September 6, has sought delivery of the imported shipments by November-end. The new crop and the imports will arrive at the same time, thus negating any chances of our farmers getting good rates, said Shetty.Currently, wholesale prices of onion at Lasalgaon in Maharashtras Nashik district are ruling at around Rs 2,300 per quintal, while the bulb is retailing at Rs 39-42/kg in major metros.Also Read | Pakistan formally suspends trade ties with IndiaAdvertisingThe quantity for which the bids have been invited (2,000 tonnes, plus or minus 2 per cent) is not huge, but it will definitely have an impact on sentiment. Farmers who have stocked from the rabi crop will now hasten to liquidate these, bringing down prices, said Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the APMC (agricultural produce market committee) mandi at Lasalgaon.The average modal price of onion in this market, the countrys largest, has risen from Rs 830 per quintal in April to Rs 931 in May, Rs 1,222 in June, Rs 1,252 in July and Rs 1,880 in August. This month, it has so far averaged Rs 2,377 per quintal.In Maharashtra  which produces roughly a third of Indias onions, much of it in Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar and parts of Marathwada  farmers take three crops of the bulb: kharif (sown in June-July and harvested in October-November), late-kharif (sown in August-September and harvested in January-March) and rabi (sown in November-December and harvested after March). Of these, the rabi onion can be stored due to its lower moisture content. Farmers usually stock these onions in kanda chawls (on-field raised structures designed to prevent moisture ingress) and gradually offload them during the summer and monsoon months.Also Read | Maharashtra: When farmers form a company to procure from farmersLast year, prices hardly crossed Rs 1,000 per quintal in the off-season. This time, when farmers are making some money after a long time, a government-owned trading company is being allowed to import from Pakistan. This is sheer hypocrisy, said Shetty.Holkar, too, said there was no need to import when the Centre had created a buffer stock of 56,000 tonnes procured from the rabi crop, of which only about 18,000 tonnes have been sold till now. Onion consumption will anyway come down with the Navratri festival season beginning September-end. And by the time the imports come, the kharif crop would have also arrived in the markets.Deepak Pagar, a farmer from Nampur village in Nashiks Baglan taluka, had stored 680 quintals of rabi onion from his 7-acre holding. Of this, he has sold about 540 quintals at an average rate of Rs 18 per kg. The government never bothers when we get Rs 700-800 per quintal, which does not even cover our cost of production. But they wake up the moment consumers have to pay a little more. Why should they import, he said.On June 11, the Centre had scrapped a 10 per cent subsidy on outbound onion shipments under the Commerce Ministrys merchandise export from India scheme, when retail prices in Delhi touched Rs 20-21 per kg. The move to import now comes even as Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana are headed for Assembly polls later this year."

This is the first time that a MEP has been imposed on onions this year.AdvertisingSimply put, henceforth exports will not be allowed if the consignments are priced below $ 850 per tonne. The steep MEP will, in a way, stop all outbound shipment of onions from India. During the financial year 2018-19, India had exported 21.82 lakh tonnes of the bulb.This move comes days after the state-owned MMTC Ltd had floated a tender for import of onions from Pakistan, Egypt, China, Afghanistan or any other origin, triggering criticism from farmers in Maharashtra. The tender, dated September 6, has sought delivery of the imported shipments by November-end.The MMTC, however, on Friday issued a corrigendum to its tender, excluding Pakistan as the country of origin, thereby making bids from the neighbouring country ineligible. The inclusion of Pakistan in the tender list had evoked extreme criticism from various quarters. Fridays corrigendum issued stated that the country of origin to be read as any country of origin, excluding Pakistan.AdvertisingThe Directorate of Foreign Trade (DoFT) raised the MEP through a notification on Friday. On December 29, 2017, the Centre had imposed a MEP of $ 850 per tonne. It was brought down to $ 700 per tonne on January 19, 2018. On February 19 of the same year, MEP was removed altogether.This would be the third intervention by the government to control onion prices. In June, the Centre had done away with the 10 per cent export subsidy declared on the bulb.While Pasha Patel, the chairman of Maharashtras commission of agricultural pricing, said that the MEP will prevent artificial hoarding, farmers bodies called the move anti-farmer.Prices in mandis of Maharashtra  the largest onion growing state accounting for over 33 per cent of national produce  has been on the rise since April. The average traded price of onion at the Lasalgaon wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka on Friday was Rs 2,950 per quintal, which was the highest such price for the year.Traders and sources in the market said that both the decision to import and the imposition of the MEP are steps taken by the Centre to prevent further rise in prices.In Maharashtra  which produces roughly a third of Indias onions, much of it in Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar and parts of Marathwada  farmers sow three crops of the bulb: kharif (sown in June-July and harvested in October-November), late-kharif (sown in August-September and harvested in January-March) and rabi (sown in November-December and harvested after March).Of these, the rabi onion can be stored due to its lower moisture content. Farmers usually stock these onions in kanda chawls (on-field raised structures designed to prevent moisture ingress) and gradually offload them during the summer and monsoon months.The current price rise is mainly due to a dip in 2018-19 rabi acreage to 2.66 lakh hectares (lh) when compared to the previous years 3.54 lh. Also, kharif sowing in the state has reported a dip.Maintaining that the measures were meant to stop artificial hoarding in the markets, Patel said; There is a dip in onion cultivation area, which will play out in the prices. All these measures are to ensure that middlemen do not take undue advantage of the situation.However, Anil Ghanwat, the president of the farmers union Shetkari Sanghtana, urged farmers not to vote for the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance. The anti-farmer face of the government is being revealed. By trying to control wholesale prices, the government is trying to ensure cheap onions for urban voters at the cost of farmers, he said."

Rajputs alleged links to the seizure were established after the police last week arrested a fifth man wanted in the case.AdvertisingOn September 11, the Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch arrested Wasim Abrehani (44) in Deonar. ANC officials said that the Vasai resident has been exporting rice, coconuts and onions to Dubai for several years. Rajput is believed to be currently staying in Dubai after fleeing India in 2014 after being released on bail in Mumbai.Abrehani met Rajput in Dubai during his trips last year and was instructed to procure 1-Phenethyl-4-Piperidone and arrange for its export to Mexico, where it would be processed into Fentanyl tablets and sent to the USA, said the official.Fentanyl is a painkiller abused by hundreds of thousands of American citizens; its overdose has also been linked to deaths. Accordingly, Abrehani is alleged to have financed arrested Salim Dola to purchase the substance from Rajkot-based pharmaceutical company Sam Fine O Chem. Two other accused, Chandramani Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari, picked up 100 kg of the substance, claimed the ANC.AdvertisingThe men were caught on the Western Express Highway in Vile Parle, close to the airport on December 26, 2018. Both had arrived in a car driven by Ghanshyam Saroj containing the contraband while Dola was waiting for them. Dola has a lengthy criminal history and has been working with international drugs cartels supplying heroin since the early 1990s, the police said.Abrehani is accused of forging documents to create a company named Ortec India Trading House, which exists only on paper, said the ANC. The official added that on their export manifest the accused had mentioned that the contraband was Organic Sacha Inchi Powder, which is in fact extracted from the plant of the same name and is considered extremely rich in protein. The powder was to be sent to a company named Vesuvius Mexico SA de CV, based in Mexico City.The Mexican company manufactures paper products and had no connection with the substance that was to be sent to it, said Special Public Prosecutor Suvidha Patil.Shivdeep Lande, Deputy Commissioner of Police (ANC), said that Abrehani was produced in court on Monday and remanded to police custody for two days. The ANC also informed the court that it was formally investigating Rajputs involvement in the case.Both Abrehani and Rajput were investigated by the Mumbai Police after two men were arrested in Amboli in January 2018 with 13.5 kg of mephedrone valued at Rs 2.28 crore. Rajput is also wanted in connection with the 2017 arrest of Abu Aslam Azmi, the nephew of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi for allegedly attempting to courier 5 kg of the synthetic drug methamphetamine worth Rs 40 crore from Delhi to London. Abu Aslam was later released on bail the same year.The Delhi Police Special Cell had suspected Rajput of putting Azmi in contact with a network of drug distributors and peddlers and of transporting the methamphetamine abroad through them."

2019-09-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/sep/18/a-trove-of--information-2035214.html,A trove of  information,"Shevlin Sebastian ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: A few years ago, G Balagopal, who was a former deputy secretary in the Information and Broadcasting Ministry was standing in line at the airport at Jeddah to gain entrance to Saudi Arabia. All the hand-bags were being checked. Behind him stood Parminder Singh (name changed) from the Ministry of External Affairs. Parminder leaned forward and whispered, I have a scotch whisky bottle in my bag. When Balagopal heard that, he felt an alarm within himself. In front of him, a man was having his bag taken apart, and even the chocolate pieces had been broken to see whether there was any alcoholic content. So, Balagopal knew a major fracas was about to take place.Soon, it was his turn. The security officer opened the zip and took out the contents: There were a shaving kit and a few underwears, apart from shirts and trousers. The officer was not glad to see the undergarments. He twitched his nose and asked Balagopal to pack and close the bag and sent him ahead. When he looked at Parminder, he was probably expecting the same. Instead of checking his bag, Parminder was waved on. It was one of the closest shaves in my life, says Balagopal. I heaved a huge sigh of relief. This anecdote has been recounted in management consultant P Jayaramans Random Explorations, which has been published by Prism Books. It is an eclectic mix. There are long profiles (7,000 words and more) on Dr M V Pylee, the father of management education in Kerala, G Balagopal, former civil servant and C Balagopal, the noted entrepreneur. Then there is a study on power and inequality.Here are some fast facts from the chapter:Indias richest one per cent owned 58 per cent of the countrys wealth.The top 10 per cent earned 80.7 per cent of the total income in the country.India accounts for almost half the worlds poor but the total individual wealth is $5600 billion. Not surprisingly. India is the second-most unequal country in the world. In another chapter titled, Some recent trends in management, Jayarams tips for career success in todays turbulent world are insightful: The word loyalty has been replaced by business contract. You remain in a job as long as you are the best person to execute a role. It has, therefore, become essential for you to learn continuously for your sheer survival. Tenure has been replaced by relevance. Every job is for a limited period. Once a CEO, always a CEO is no longer valid. One should focus on short-term plans in todays rapidly-changing environment. Long-term planning has become impossible and of little value.In another section, he talks about speed. In this age of disruption, only fast learners can survive and flourish, says Jayaraman. Traditionally, people used to treat information as power and hoard it as a method of control. But todays organisations can ill afford to be hoarders. They have to absorb new information every hour, every day. Companies should instil curiosity and experimentation to succeed.The next section is about travel. Thanks to his son, Anand, who is based in Geneva and a daughter, Deepthi, who is living in Nottingham, Jayaraman has travelled to several countries, including Greece, Poland, Croatia, China, Czechoslovakia, Norway and Australia. For each, he has written a history, some of the best places to visit, the archaeological sites, weather, literature, economics, demography, the characteristics of the people, food and beverages.Regarding food in Norway, the most common dish is polse (hot dog) with pancake, which is topped with raw onions and various dressings. In Czechoslovakia, the staple food is pork, beef, birds like duck and pheasant, and carp. In Poland, Jayaraman enjoyed the Placki Ziemniaczane, a pancake filled with potato and topped with a meaty sauce.The last section is about the books he has read. These include Half Lion: How P V Narasimha Rao transformed India by Vinay Sitapati, India Rising: Fresh Hopes, New Fears by Ravi Velloor, and An Era Of Darkness: The British Empire in India by Shashi Tharoor. In Tharoors book, Jayaraman quotes F J Shore, a British civil servant in Bengal who testified in the House of Commons that the fundamental principle of the English has been to make the whole Indian nation subservient in every possible way.In 1600, when the British East India Company was set up, Britain accounted for just 1.8 per cent of the world GDP, while India was contributing 23 per cent. In 1940, Britain accounted for nearly 10 per cent of the world GDP while India was reduced to 3 per cent. All in all, Jayaramans sixth book is a remarkable work, well-researched and sincere. Theres enough food for thought to last a long time.FOOD FOR THOUGHTThe book is an eclectic mix comprising extensive profiles on Keralas prominent personalities including Dr M V Pylee, the father of management education in the state, G Balagopal, former civil servant and C Balagopal, the noted entrepreneur. It also gives a rundown power inequality in the country and provies tips for career success in todays turbulent world"

Is the BJP government now afraid of onions? the NCP chief asked, while addressing his party workers in Nanded district.The NCP patriarch is on a State-wide tour to revive his party cadre in view of a string of high-profile desertions ahead of the Assembly polls.Targeting Mr. Modi, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) Mahajanadesh Yatra in Nashik, Mr. Pawar criticised the BJP governments anti-farmer policies and its alleged policy of importing onions from Pakistan and other countries while refusing to give a fair price to the farmers in Nashik.The Nashik Police Commissioner had issued a notice ahead of the PMs rally that activists of all opposition political parties should stay put else they would be taken into preventive custody. Farmers were prevented from selling their produce in the market, the largest wholesale market for onions in the country, ahead of todays rally  This government talks big against Pakistan, but scrambles to import onions from them, causing losses to Maharashtras farmers and forcing them to commit suicide, Mr. Pawar said.He said when he was the Union agriculture minister, BJP leaders had protested outside Parliament about rising onion prices by wearing onion garlands. At the time, I told the Speaker that if they [the BJP] are getting angry about rising prices of onions, I dont care as the price rise was essential for farmers livelihood. I told those BJP leaders how much does it cost you all to pay a little more for onions? the NCP chief said.Companies shutAccusing the government of being indifferent to the soaring unemployment, he claimed that 54 companies in Nashik had shut down in the past month alone, while 16,000 workers had been laid off. Besides Nashik, manufacturing companies and small industries are shutting down in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Thane and other parts of the State with rampant lay-offs everywhere  this government has done nothing but contribute to tremendous recession in every sector, be it agriculture or industry, Mr. Pawar said, alleging that the ruling government was only interested in giving subsidies to industrialists.The NCP chief said there was no climate for investment in Maharashtra today, and accused Mr. Fadnavis of presenting misleading figures during the the Mahajanadesh Yatra.[Fadnavis] can go on claiming as to which companies have invested in Maharashtra  I urge him to forget these companies and give us instead the true figures of the number of firms that have shut down in the past few months. But as the Chief Minister dare not give these in the face of unprecedented unemployment, he has now taken out this yatra to deceive the public, Mr. Pawar said.He said Mumbai used to be the textile hub with 120 factories employing four lakh workers at one time. Today, 110 of these have shut down with barely 10-11,000 workers still working. The factories have been replaced by high-rises, hesaid."

While in Maharashtra's Nashik, onion was being sold at Rs 50-55.According to traders, the onion prices have gone up due to the fall in its stock which in turn has affected the supply to wholesale markets.Last week, in a bid to control the rising prices of onion, the government reduced the minimum export price of the vegetable to $850 per tonne.Sources believe the government's move has reduced the possibilities of onion export.Rajendra Sharma, a trader of Azadpur Mandi and President of the Onion Merchant Association, said the recent rains in the southern states must have caused damage to the onion crop due to which prices are constantly increasing.""The entire nation is facing shortage of onions. In such a scenario, exporting the vegetable is even more difficult,"" a Nashik-based onion exporter said.He said the stock of onion is quite less in southern states including Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu.Traders said that currently, no wholesale market is receiving more than 1,000-1,500 onion-laden trucks, due to which the prices are going upwards.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

At the end of the days auction, the average wholesale price was Rs 4,500 per quintal.The previous highest average wholesale price was recorded at Rs 4,300 per quintal on September 16, 2015. The all-time high was Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22, 2015.

The bulb is already selling at Rs 50 per kg in Nashiks retail markets as against Rs 35/kg last week. Thursdays price rise is expected to be reflected in retail markets in a day or two.APMC sources said there has been a shortage of onions in areas in the south Indian states where they are grown and, therefore, there is high demand for onions from these states. The fresh kharif crop is still immature and will take some time to be harvested. All this has pushed up wholesale prices, they said.Moreover, the arrival of onions, which was around 15,000 quintals a day last month at Lasalgaon, has fallen to 10,000-12,000 quintals a day due to the rains.There has been a sudden drop in the arrival of onions for the past few days due to continuous rains in the district. Rainwater has got into many farms which have onion storage facilities. On Thursday, just 7,000 quintals of onions were brought to the market, APMC officials said.Sources said the situation is expected to improve after 15-20 days when fresh onions arrive in the south Indian states.Onion trader Manoj Jain said farmers have sold most of the stock in their storage facilities and there is panic in the market. He said this would last for only the next 2-3 weeks, he added."

The economy will be in trouble if the slowdown persists. Investment dynamic has gone wrong,"" Pawar said at a meeting in Nanded.""Prime Minister @narendramodi tells new factories have come in the country.

They say they will waive loans of companies, but not of farmers, as companies give employment. But the one who feeds us doesn't get loan waiver,"" the NCP chief said.In Parbhani, Pawar alleged that workers of opposition parties in Nashik were served notices by police ahead of Modi's rally, while some were even arrested.""I checked with officials (in Nashik) over phone why onions cannot be brought to market. They said the government was afraid onions might be hurled at Prime Minister's vehicle. I asked them why people would hurl onions. They said people have not liked something. I asked what the people did not like? They said import of onions from Pakistan,"" Pawar said.After reports of onion import from Pakistan drew flak, the Union government had clarified that the bulb would not be imported from the neighbouring country."

Stocks available in Karnataka presently is 6-8 months old from Maharashtra. Since quality is good, the prices are also high. The fresh stocks which came from Chitradurga andGadar are not that good, he said. Good quality onion is judged by its deep pink colour, pungent smell and bulb size.Uday Shankar, an onion trader, told TNIE that heavy rain over the last few months has damaged the crops in most parts of Karnataka including Chitradurga, Gadag, Hubballi-Dharwad, Challakere and even Maharashtra.

There is no price correlation or price transmission between the two, he said, adding that there is no holistic picture regarding the present situation of price rise.According to him, the onion crop situation in Karnataka is relatively better than that of Maharashtra and that the supply from Karnataka might compensate for Maharashtra.The State government asked TNAU to forecast the prices of Bellary onion in 2015, when onion prices touched 100 per kg, to provide market advisories. Noting that no such instruction from the government has come yet, Mr. Shivakumar said,It indicates that things are sailing in a proper direction. There is no panic situation in the markets regarding the price rise, he added."

A significant number of onions were spoilt following the rain. This coupled with a lesser yield this year, has led to an increase in its price, which is currently being sold upwards of 60 a kg.Both the consumers and the farmers are disheartened. While the consumers are concerned about the sharp increase in prices, the farmers are worried about the lack of proper infrastructure to store the produce.A farmer told The Hindu that there was an immediate necessity to construct better storage facilities so that the onions were not spoilt. Dampness spoils onions. One spoilt onion has the potential to spoil numerous more, the farmer said.Talking about the increase in prices, former market yard chairman Purushottam Reddy said the prices were expected to be high in the next two months. The crops in Maharashtra were also destroyed due to rain. So, there may be an acute shortage of onions, he added. Moreover, Mr. Reddy claims that there was a chance that the prices could go up to 80 per kg depending on the supply."

With the prices of onions surging in the country, common mans budget has taken a big hit. If the trend continues, news of a truck full of onions getting stolen in Patna may be taken as a sign of times to come.In Punjab, onions are truely acting pricey and have crossed the prices of apples in many parts of the region. The seasonal apple here is selling for Rs 60 per kg, at par with onions. The wholesale price of onions at the vegetables and fruits market in Chandigarh's Sector 26 is between Rs 40 and 41. The retail price ranges between Rs 60 and 70.In Shimla, the hub of apple trade, the fruits prices start from Rs 30 a kilogram and onions are selling at Rs 60 per kg. In Dharamshala, onions are selling for Rs 60 and the top quality apple variety is priced at Rs 90 a kg.General Secretary of the market association, Kanwarpal Singh Dua, said the reason behind the short supply of onions is the heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh and Southern parts of India. Due to rains the stock from Madhya Pradesh was not up to the mark because of moisture. From Southern states also the new crop of onions got ruined due to heavy rainfall. In the Nasik region, from where we get onions of high grading, sowing of the new crop was delayed by a fortnight due to rains. Earlier we used to get this stock well before Diwali but now this crop will arrive well after Diwali as it will be delayed by a month.If that dampens your Diwali spirit, there is some good news coming soon from across the borders. A major stock of onions will be arriving in Amritsar via Pakistan from Afghanistan as the government is getting ready to import onions to fill in the short supply. The stock will arrive via Pakistan in Amritsar in the next few days. Egypt will also supply onions to India and the stock is likely to arrive by October 15.The difference between Afghan onions and the Indian variety is that the latter is of high grading, specially the one from Nasik in Maharashtra. Afghan onions are of lower grading and the packaging is of poor quality while India exceeds in packaging of onions, Dua says.While wholesale prices have come down from Rs 50 earlier to Rs 40-41 now, the retail prices are up. Retailers have to pay market fees while getting the stock from us the wholesalers but some sections are making a profit of the hype created that onions are in short supply, Dua says. The situation will become normal in the next two to three months. Hoarding of onions is not on a large scale to cause alarm, Dua says, adding: Farmers also sold onions at Rs 5 in wholesale and seldom cover their expenses on the crop.Anuj Mahajan, wholesaler, Durga DSeeds, Sector 26 vegetable market, Chandigarh says, Hoarding of onions is adding to the problem. Onions are selling for Rs 15-20 in wholesale rates and reached up to Rs 48.

In Mumbai, the vegetable costs 60 per kg in the retail market. The price has tripled since July 31 this year, when the rate was 1,250 per quintal at Lasalgaon, the countrys largest wholesale market.On Tuesday, the wholesale prices of onion reached 4,000 per quintal. At the same time last year, the price per quintal was 500, said Jaydutt Holkar, chairman, APMC, Lasalgaon. At the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Vashi, wholesale prices dropped by around 2, to 40 per kg, on Tuesday.Experts believe that onion prices will come down only after a month, when fresh crop arrives in the market.Holkar said that there is no shortage of onion in Maharashtra. However, states like Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are facing a shortfall, which has led to the rise of prices.To curb prices, the Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC), a subsidiary of the Centre, has already floated a tender to import onions from China, Afghanistan, and Egypt, with stock expected to arrive by the last week of November. Recently, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) fixed a minimum export price (MEP) of US$850 (around 60,241) for one tonne of onions. The decision was taken following a surge in onion prices.Both the moves are unwarranted, as onion prices will start reducing with the arrival of a fresh crop after a month. The imported onions will come only after November and by that time, the price of local produce will have already come down, Holkar said. Anoop Kumar, principal secretary, state marketing department, said they are still assessing the situation and will then decide on measures to curb onion prices.First Published: Sep 25, 2019 00:22 IST"

The shortlisted colleges will demonstrate the machines on the field.Speaking at the event, Dr Major Singh, director of the Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research, ICAR, Pune, urged participants and the engineering fraternity to bring out an overwhelming change in Indian farming conditions.The production of onion in 2001 was one per cent per annum, and increased to almost 10 per cent in 2019, he said. However, even though India produces over 210 lakh tonnes of onion, due to the way it is harvested, we see fluctuations in its prices. Also, there is no provision to store onions in bulk. But through such crafts, we can.ultimately reduce onion prices. We need to upgrade our machines for transplanting and harvesting, he added.AdvertisingBajrangdas Lohiya, vice-chairman, VIT, said, Such initiatives are very important, as they provide opportunities for students to convey and translate knowledge, and stay connected to the rural sector of the country.

A similar price trend prevails in other parts of the country.""We have taken the best possible measures so far to boost supply and contain onion prices. We have to look at other options like stock limit if the current high price situation continues,"" Paswan told reporters.He said the government ""will think about imposing a stock limit on traders once the buffer stock gets over. We will also take stringent action against hoarders and black marketeers"".The government is doing a ""balancing job"" keeping in mind the interest of both consumers and farmers, he added.The centre has built a buffer stock of 50,000 tonnes of which 15,000 tonnes have been offloaded in the domestic market.Paswan also shared that he was in regular touch with the Maharasthra chief minister on onion issue.Echoing the views at another event, the agriculture minister said, ""Onion situation will improve in the next few days.

Rains in the last week further affected the supply, impacting prices.Stored onion is being sold in most parts of the country now and fresh Kharif (summer) crop will hit the market from November onwards, traders said.Traders further said that there is enough supply of stored onion of the previous year's crop but its transportation has been affected due to heavy rains.The Centre has taken several measures to arrest the prices of onion in Delhi and other parts of the country. It is offloading onion from its buffer stock through agencies like Nafed and National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF).The state governments have been asked to boost the supply by lifting central buffer stock. Some states like Delhi, Tripura and Andhra Pradesh have shown interest so far. In Delhi, around 200 tonnes of onion is being offloaded every day.The Centre has discouraged export of onion by increasing the minimum export price and withdrawing incentives. It is also cracking down on black marketeers.Prices have also picked up on a likely fall in Kharif production owing to the lower planted area under onion after excess rains, according to sources.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Market sources in Nashik fear that the central government might try to reimpose stock limit on the bulb by bringing it under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.AdvertisingWholesale prices of onion have crossed the Rs 4,000 per quintal mark across the major markets of the state. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Niphad taluka of Nashik, the average traded price of the bulb on Monday was Rs 4,200 per quintal  a slight correction from the Rs 4,700 per quintal prices of last week. Delay in arrival of kharif crop in Karnataka and an overall dip in the onion acreage across Maharashtra due to the drought of last year has pushed up the prices.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaons wholesale market, said the central team has inquired about the reasons for price hike in the market. The team wanted to know if the present spike in prices is due to the middle men trying to artificially hike up the prices, he said. Holkar also said the team talked about the storage of onions and whether farmers or traders are holding the produce. At the present rates, traders are unlikely to hold onto their stocks  most of the produce is with the farmers, he said.Market sources, however, say they fear an imposition of stock limit on the bulb. Under the Essential Commodities Act, the central government can impose a stock limit on produces to prevent hoarding. In 2014, a similar stock limit was brought into force for onion, which was lifted in March 2018. Farmers and traders have always protested against the markets imposing a stock limit on onions, claiming that such interventions only bring down prices.AdvertisingEarlier this month, the government had virtually canned all exports by imposing a steep Minimum Export Price (MEP) of $850 per tonne and also floated tenders for import of 2,000 tonnes of onions. The new onion is expected to reach India towards the end of November to coincide with the arrival of the new crop in Maharashtra.Meanwhile, arrival of new onions in Andhra Pradesh has picked up, which has cooled down the prices in the south Indian states. The new crop from Karnataka, which was expected to arrive early in September, was also delayed due to heavy rain, which lashed the state in the first few weeks. Maharashtras new crop is also delayed by a month or so due to the late arrival of the monsoon. The present price range is expected to remain till arrivals do not pick up from the onion growing areas."

Traders believe that until the fresh crops from Maharashtra arrives in the month of late December or early January, there will be no respite for buyers.The reason for the prices to skyrocket is due to various factors, say onion wholesale dealers. Usually, this is the time that the prices of onions rise as there is non-availability of fresh crops. This phase is usually for a brief period but now with the non-availability of Nashik onions which was hit due to floods, all eyes will be on the fresh crops, which are expected during the month of December or January next year, following which the prices are likely to stabilize, said the trader.Abdul Khader, secretary of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, said the price of onions will be determined, based on the availability of the crop.Yesterday, the availability was less and price was on the rise. On Monday, there was a huge availability of Andhra onions at Koyambedu wholesale market, which has low shelf life. Usually, Andhra onions are considered to be cheaper when compared to onions from Karnataka and Maharashtra. It was priced less than `20 a couple of weeks ago. Yesterday, it shot up to `50 per kg. Now the price has come down to `45 per kg due to more trucks coming from Andhra, said Khader.An onion trader told Express that once the Andhra season ends, the traders will depend on Bangalore onions or onions from Maharashtra, which is facing a crisis due to damage of crops during the rain. As a result, the prices are expected to go up further as there will be demand for Bangalore onions, the trader said.He said the cost of Bangalore onions in the North is rising due to infrastructure costs involved in supply of onions. Onions in Delhi are costing above `70. The shelf life of Bangalore onion is also less when compared to Maharashtra onions, that could last for more than a month. Now it all depends on the availability of the crop. Till then, the favourite onion sambar is likely to be a costly affair for Tamilians, he said."

If the government takes hasty actions to impose stock limits, it could be accused of being against farmers interests, Mr Paswan told journalists on Tuesday.Off-loading buffer stockInstead, the Centre hopes that its 50,000 tonne buffer stock will help to calm down prices which have crossed the 70 per kg mark in many of Delhi retail markets. In Hyderabad, the vegetable sold for 100 per kg on Monday  the highest rate among major metros  according to data from the National Horticulture Board.At major wholesale markets across the country, onions have sold at an average maximum price of 29.88 per kg this month. This is a four year high for September  the last time prices touched these levels was in 2015, when the average maximum price was a whopping 45.67 per kg.So far, 15,000 tonnes have been offloaded from the buffer stock. We can think about imposing a stock limit on traders once the buffer is exhausted, said Mr. Paswan. Until then, the government must carry out a balancing job, keeping the interests of both farmers and consumers in mind, he added.The recent floods in the major producing States have affected the storage and transportation of the winter crop which was harvested earlier this year, resulting in supply disruptions to mandis. The onions planted in the summer come to the market by November, but excess rains are likely to hit production. Hoarders are exacerbating the situation and a stock limit would help prevent speculative behaviour by traders, said an official statement.Balancing actAt a separate event on Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated the governments need to consider farmers concerns. Sometimes, consumers have to pay a high price for farm produce, while at other times, farmers get a lower price. Our role is to balance this, he said, adding that the situation would improve as more onions are released from the buffer stock over the next few days.For the past few weeks, central agencies NAFED and NCCF have been selling onions at 22 per kg via fair price shops and mobile vans. At Mother Dairys Safal shops in the NCR, national capital region, onions are available at 24 per kg.We have taken steps to increase the supply in the market, and have urged state government to lift onions from NAFEDs buffer stock as well, said Mr. Paswan. So far, Delhi, Tripura, Haryana, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have taken up the offer. The Centre has also taken steps to disincentivise onion exports, begin importing the vegetable, and to crack down on hoarders and black-marketers.Now we have to wait and watch. We will look at other options like stock limit if the current high price situation continues, he said."

While the consumers feel the pinch in the purse, the traders assign the cause to high cost at the source.The wholesale price of the essential vegetable has gone up to more than `50 from `30 per kg over the past week, while its retail price ranges from `55 to `60. It has forced people to cut down the consumption. Earlier, I used to buy at least one kg of onion twice in a week and now I take maximum half a kg, said Sirish Mohapatra of Raja Bagicha area.We have no other choice but to do away with the vegetable for high cost, said Shradhanjali Patnaik, a housewife in Buxi Bazaar.Traders in Chhatra Bazaar, the biggest wholesale vegetable market of the State, attributed the price rise to higher cost at source points. We have very little to do with the price rise as our procurement cost is going up due to increase in prices at the source-end following shortage of quality onions, said Chhatra Bazaar Byabasayi Sangha (CBBS) secretary Debendra Sahu. Onion stocked in Nashik, the wholesale market from where maximum requirement of Odisha is sourced, has been exhausted and Chhatra Bazaar vegetable mandi now depends on onions from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh where the crop has been damaged due to rains, Sahu said. However, he said, The situation will improve when the new crop reaches Nashik after Diwali.Meanwhile, a special squad of the district Civil Supply Office (CSO) on Monday visited Chhatra Bazaar to take stock of the situation and inspected several onion godowns.We visited as many as six godowns. There were adequate stocks. Besides, two onion-loaded trucks reached Chhatra Bazaar on Monday. However, there were no takers due to price rise, said ACSO Gyana Ranjan Mishra."

This year, we witnessed a heavy rainfall at places where the onion production is more. This has damaged crops and affected the farmers in Maharashtra, Nasik, Uttar Pradesh and we get our stock from there, Bandari said. He added that he did not see many of his customers since it is beyond their budget. However, hotels and restaurants have not compromised. If they need a certain amount of onion, they will buy it irrespective of the price...The rising price of onions has also affected roadside eateries.

On Wednesday, it came down to 1,500.Speaking to The Hindu, Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham district secretary K. Jagannatham blamed the government for announcing that onions would be procured from Nashik in Maharashtra. The announcement stopped the businessmen from purchasing the produce from farmers, he added. He alleged that the announcement was a short-sighted move by the government.Talking about the plight of onion farmers, Mr. Jagannatham said that from four years the farmers had been in heavy losses, and many of them had sold their lands owing to debt.For the first time in four years, the farmers were set to make some profit. But the government quashed it, he added.Moreover, he claimed that the onions in the market yard were exposed to the rain.

As with Goan dishes of Portuguese origin, the dish was a test in patience and muscle-flexing.Shed get down on her haunches to rhythmically maneuver a halved coconut over the spiky metal head of the bulky wooden scraper for a fresh mound of desiccated white flakes speckled with brown. Then roast ingredients in order of their weight: cumin, clove, cinnamon, pepper, ginger and garlic, scraped coconut, onion, red chilies.And coarsely grind these into a wet masala using a pestle (the size of a mini club) over a 2-ft long mortar; the aroma hanging heavy around the house long after.I was kept away from these kitchen aids (imagine the coconut shell accidently slipping off and your hand meeting the scraper). But after many moons of such toiling, shes settled for ready-made grated coconut and masala pastes/powders.Its the story of many households, when consumed by minimalism (sleek, lightweight gadgets) and millennialism (apps over appams  its cooking process crosses 10 hours). The result: the recipes of yore now lack their original punch.Culinary expert in such grueling but delicious recipes is Bengalurus Karavalli restaurant at The Gateway Hotel, under the Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) banner.It specialises in south-west India (Kerala, Karnataka and Goa) cuisine, after its chefs learnt each of its 85 dishes firsthand at the kitchens of, as noted on its website, Mangalorean Bunts and Konkanis, Kodavas from Coorg, Malayalees, Calicut Muslims and Syrian Christians of Travancore, Havyaka Brahmins of Vitla and the Portuguese of Goa.This year, few Delhi restaurants under IHCL marked milestones (Thai Pavilion completed 25 years and House of Ming, 40), where in-house chefs switched places and hosted pop-ups. And now Varq, the premium Indian cuisine restaurant at Taj Mahal Hotel, is celebrating its 11th anniversary and is hosting a pop-up by 29-year-old Karavalli for a few days.Naren Thimmaiah, executive chef at Karavalli, says the pop-up will benefit Delhities, underexposed to the south Indian coastal cuisine. Hes also full of trivia. Like how the one traditional food item thrives under different names in different regions of India.Like the Coorgi staple souring agent kachampuli (Malabar tamarind) is balsamic vinegars doppelganger, look and taste-wise.Keralas rice-noodle dish of idiyappam is called shavige in Mangalore and nooputtu in Coorg, with slight variations to the steaming process, informs chef Thimmaiah.An example of this trivia was the first starter we sampled at the pop-up  Keralas Meen Eleittad (black pomfret fillet shallowed fried with Malabar masala and wrapped in banana leaf). When unopened, its identical to the Parsi Patra-ne-Macchi.But when done so, you find a red masala slapped onto the fillet, which lends it a medium-spicy flavour. Quite unlike the Parsi fish dish steamed in fresh, green coconut chutney. About the juicy Tiger Prawn Roast, it might seem the chef forgot to add the salt till you mix it in its own gravy of spices, vegetables and coconut slivers and then bite in.The Koli Barthad chicken is a good introduction to the tart Coorgi kachampuli. As a light palate cleanser, the Pachakkari Stew (vegetable chunks in coconut milk) works best.The desserts made an impression. The Bebinca was soft, warm, and nearly perfect, but could do with more caramelised layers.The soft, brownish-black banana-jaggery Dodol topped with banana ice-cream was a bite-sized wonder. But the highlight was the creamy Ada Pradhaman  thick mix of rice flakes, coconut milk and jaggery  quite identical to Goas Godshem, only without chana/moong dal the latters made of.Till: September 28At: Varq, Taj Mahal Hotel, One Mansingh Road"

Usual retail rates of ~25-30 a kg have gone up to ~60-80 a kg, according to market data.The main summer crop, sown in May-June and harvested in October-November, accounts for just 15% of the countrys annual output. Yet, this crop is critical because it replenishes markets, which generally run out stocks from the previous harvest around this time of the year.This lean period is usually made good by onion stocks specifically set aside to tide over seasonal shortages, known as stored onions, but when the wait for new harvests gets longer, as is currently the case, prices rise.A poor start to the monsoon pushed back sowing in the largest onion growing state, Maharashtra, along with states such as Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Skewed rainfall  first scanty, then excess  upended sowing patterns, officials said.The June-September monsoon was 33% deficient in June, but ended up being 4% excess by mid-September, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).In Maharashtra, sowing was delayed due to drought. Then floods (happened). Summer output is likely to be less by 10-15%. Thats the feedback we have given to the Centre, said Shirish Jamdade, the joint director of the states Pune-headquartered horticulture department.A central government team from New Delhi last week visited key onion-trading sites, including Lasalgoan in Nashik district, which is Asias largest onion wholesale market.Jamdade said a 10-15% smaller crop would proportionately reduce output.The good thing is we are definitely going to see a robust winter crop because late rains have increased groundwater levels, an official of the state-run National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation said on condition of anonymity.Onion harvests in southern states such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are also running behind schedule, bringing Maharashtras stocks under pressure, said Narendra Wadhwane, the secretary of the Lasalgaon agricultural market committee, which oversees the largest volumes of onion trade in the country.Onion, like rice, is first grown in smaller, dense plots, known as nursery beds, before saplings are transplanted onto large fields. Drought conditions hit these operations during June and July.Theres more bad news.We have received reports of damage to onion stocks stored from the winter harvest, said Sudin Tarle, another official of the Lasalgaon wholesale market.A majority of Indias onion crop, accounting for 70-80% of total production, is grown during winter. It is sown during December -January and harvested in April-May.The summer or kharif onion crop, now delayed, is followed by a smaller late summer crop, sown during August-September and harvested in January-February.By September 15, the harvests should have started arriving in good quantities, Jagdade said.The Centre has said there are sufficient stocks of stored onions in Maharashtra.Onions suffer from classic seasonal volatility and face supply swings every other year, mainly due to inadequate storage and untimely rains.According to the farm ministry data, Indias total onion output was around 23.48 million tonne in 2018-19, slightly higher than the previous years production. Data for the current season is still being compiled.The Union government imposed a minimum export price (MEP) on onion of $850 (about ~65,000) a tonne on September 13. An MEP is a policy tool designed to discourage exports by making Indian produce expensive for foreign buyers, ramping up domestic supplies. It has also offered states onions from federally held reserves of 32,000 tonnes, a statement from the consumer affairs ministry said. The government has also called for bids to import onion and shipments are expected by November.By November we will anyway see domestic supplies go up. Then there could be a glut. Still, the government should have planned much in advance, said Raju Shetti, a former MP and leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana, a farm organisation.First Published: Sep 25, 2019 23:53 IST"

At the Capitals retail markets, the kitchen staple is selling 70-80 per kg, the truck is selling the vegetable for just 22 per kg.The truck has been here for at least two weeks. I have been coming almost every day. But many people have only joined the queue today as the price has gone up over the last few days, said Parveen Kaushal, a retired social worker. Several hundred people turned up on Tuesday morning, and even after the truck closed for lunch, more than 50 people stayed in line, awaiting the afternoon session. I saw the price was 70 in my local market and so I thought I should use my lunch break to buy onions from here, said Sunita, who works in a Krishi Bhavan office.Now, even these people sitting in their air-conditioned offices are willing to come to sweat it out with us, said Seema, who works as a gardener in the nearby Shastri Bhavan compound. But it is not just onions. All vegetables are very costly these days. How will the poor eat?Central agencies  NAFED and NCCF  have been drawing from central buffer stock to sell onions at 22 per kg over the past few weeks in fair price shops and mobile vans. Mother Dairys Safal shops sell the vegetable for 23.90 per kg. About 200 tonnes of onions are being offloaded from the central buffer into the citys markets daily. I have tried the Safal onions but they are very poor quality. You have to throw out half of what you buy. This truck sells better quality, said Ms. Kaushal.On Monday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal promised that the government would begin selling the vegetable at 24 per kg. Kiran Sood, a housewife from the nearby slum, is dismissive of that promise. When Modi sarkar is already selling for 22 per kg, why would anyone buy at a higher rate from Delhi sarkar? she asked."

Even the wholesale price in the Gurugram market has gone up to 45/kg from 25/kg. We are keeping a watch on the market to neutralise the price, which has spiked in the last 10 days, said Virendra Yadav, secretary, district agriculture marketing board.Heavy rains in onion-producing states, such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and other southern states have damaged crops, due to which cities, such as Delhi, Kolkata and Patna, have witnessed a price surge over the last few days.Affirming that the supply is being augmented, Yadav said, Traders and farmers in other states stock onions, waiting for the apt time to sell their produce at the optimum price. Onion comes under non-perishable items, but farmers and traders are now looking to clear their stocks. Therefore, going by the data (see the box), the offloading of onions has increased to 1,500 -2,000 quintals from 700-800 quintals.Yadav said, Before the price increase, 1,000-1,500 quintals of onion from Nashik and Indore were offloaded in the mandi daily. Due to floods and heavy rainfall in the onion-producing states, the overall yield has come down. Traders are currently selling the old stock. By mid-October, the new stock will also arrive in the market and the price will decrease further, said Yadav.According to him, there are 50 onion traders in the city dealing with traders in Nashik and Indore. Yadav and his team monitor free and fair trade, and keep the prices in check, as the product changes hands from middlemen, wholesalers, traders and commission agents to retailers.The marketing board functions under the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961, and Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets (General) Rules, 1962. Its task is to regulate the purchase, sale, storage and processing of agricultural produce, including fruits and vegetables.The price mechanism of fruits and vegetables cannot be regulated like crops, but the market fluctuation of non-perishable items, such as onions and potatoes, has to be prevented by not allowing unnecessary stockpiling by traders, he said, adding there is no cartel system in Gurugram, as mandis are not huge.Narendra, an onion trader at the Badshahpur mandi, said, Stock holding is being done by traders in big mandis, which affects the overall price. The government is currently keeping a strict vigil, due to which there is no chance of onion prices soaring further.Ravi, a wholesaler, said that the prices cannot be controlled in Gurugram. Considering heavy rainfall and floods in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, farmers have little produce to sell in the market.Haryana is among the five states that have demanded onion from the Centres stock. The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) manages the onion reserves at the Central level. NAFED might be releasing its stock, but Gurugram has not received any, so far, said Yadav.First Published: Sep 25, 2019 22:21 IST"

This election should happen on the back of campaigns and debates centred on issues that Mumbai faces, where opposition parties demand accountability from the government and offer alternatives. None of these are visible in Mumbai at this time.As in the rest of Maharashtra, so in Mumbai, the election is increasingly one without a contest. The ruling BJP-Shiv Sena is sitting smug while the Congress-NCP and other parties are in disarray or dis-spirited.Whether the BJP and Shiv Sena contest as an alliance or independent of each other, BJPs top leaders  party president Amit Shah and Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, who held high-visibility events in the last few days  have declared that Mumbai will elect all 36 of its MLAs from the saffron parties. Nothing could be worse.In 2014, 29 of 36 MLAs were from these two parties  15 BJP, 14 Shiv Sena  making it a near-dominance of their ideologies and policies. The Congress had only five, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the AIMIM, one each. Reports on their performance in the Assembly have been mixed as per independent policy organisations. They have been more accessible to citizens but the quality of questions they raised in the Assembly have been fewer than in the 2009-14 period. More of them have been charge-sheeted in criminal cases but public perception is that they are less corrupt than their predecessors.The two previous Assembly compositions were more democratic. In 2009, Congress-NCP had 20 MLAs, BJP-Sena had nine, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had six, and SP, one. In 2004 when Mumbai elected 34 MLAs, Congress-NCP had 19, BJP-Sena 14. This meant that ruling party MLAs were held to account by the then opposition BJP-Sena. Citizens issues were articulated and turned into street agitations. The Congress-NCP could not breathe easy. In the Fadnavis-government era, it isnt merely that the BJP-Sena enjoyed dominance; the problem is that Congress-NCP gave them an easy pass on Mumbais issues.Across the city, the Congress has been in decline. Its organisational strength has reduced; its leaders pull in different directions on petty grounds, its narrative is non-cohesive. The NCP hardly registers its presence. The SP, AIMIM, and Dalit parties talk to and about their committed voters; the Aam Aadmi Party gamely tries to speak. Who demands answers of the government? Who agitates on behalf of Mumbaiites?Crumbling infrastructure and poor flood management, collapse of bridges, pathetic condition of roads, haphazard construction of Metro lines including using Aarey Colony for a car shed, should have been the cause for massive agitations in the last few years. Now, in election season, the ruination of a cooperative bank and rising prices of onions should have brought opposition parties out in full strength. They barely issued statements. With non-articulation of issues and lack of agitations, they left Mumbais political space vacant over the years.In the absence of well-articulated campaigns around voters concerns, the BJP, which is in permanent election campaign mode, has made the reading down of Article 370 and its version of nationalism into election issues in Maharashtra.Amit Shah knows well that this election is about Mumbai and Maharashtra, not a parliamentary one, but he is only too happy to fill in the vacant space with his agenda. Congress and NCP reacted to Shah when they should have been pro-active.The gradual disintegration of opposition parties has meant that not only does the contrarian or challenger voice not get reflected in the Assembly but that it is not heard on the streets either. Unipolar politics may be great for the party in power, but it spells bad news for a pluralistic and diverse city.First Published: Sep 26, 2019 00:48 IST"

At 8 p.m., and when the rain subsided, the IMD station at Begumpet recorded 4.8 cm of rain.Heavy water logging was reported from areas including Paradise, Malakpet, Santhosh Nagar, Musheerabad, Vanasthalipuram, Kavadiguda, Ramnagar, Khairatabad, Begumpet, Punjagutta, Ameerpet, Secunderabad, R.P. Road, Hi-Tech City, Rajendra Nagar, Charminar and others. At Osmangunj, streets turned virtual streams for the second consecutive day, with no outlet for water.Punjagutta flyover experienced water logging on one side, as the vents provided to drain water could not catch up with the bounty being received. A traffic cop was seen manning the stream of vehicles standing in knee-deep water. Traffic situation turned from bad to worse on several stretches, including Nagarjuna Circle at Punjagutta, where a traffic gridlock was experienced forcing Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan to come down and monitor the situation.Commuters opting for Metro Rail for safer transport resulted in jam-packed metro stations in the Miyapur-L.B. Nagar corridor, causing delay in evacuation of passengers. Further, as a measure of caution in view of rains, the trains were run in manual mode, which increased the time lag, resulting in cascading effect of stranded passengers.Cab aggregators had a field day, charging over 300 for distances less than a kilometre in the name of surge pricing. Food delivery apps completely shut down their services due to logistical issues. As per the data available from automatic weather stations across the city at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, localities including Srinagar Colony, Khairatabad, Vijayanagar Colony, Begumpet, Kavadiguda, Sardar Mahal, Red Hills and Balanagr recorded the highest rainfall of over 5 cm.Dabeerpura, Gachibowli, Fatehnagar, Rein Bazar, Nampally, Jagadgirigutta, Gudimalkapur, Rajendranagar, Yousufguda, Banjara Hills, Secunderabad, Abids, Lingampally, Kukatpally, Madhapur, Borabanda, and Begum Bazar received over four centimetres of rainfall.The ongoing spell of torrential rains would continue for two more days in the city, Met officials said.Senior meteorologist B. Raja Rao from Hyderabad Meteorological Centre attributed the incessant rains to active monsoons encouraged by an upper air cyclonic circulation in Rayalaseema, Telangana and parts of Karnataka. Also, an upper air trough has formed over Telangana, Jharkhand and Vidarbha, which is causing heavy rains. Meanwhile, the Tuesdays cloudburst which began at about 5.30 p.m. and continued without interruption up to 2 a.m. on Wednesday, has given a bounty of 7.5 cm of rainfall to Hyderabad city, as recorded at the IMD station. As per the data from the automatic weather stations, the highest rainfall in the city was over 12 cm, recorded at Trimulgherry and Uppal, and the lowest was 7.6 cm at Madhapur.The downpour left a trail of destruction behind, with residential areas in the eastern part experiencing heavy inundation. East Anandbagh in Malkajgiri, Satyasai Nagar in Jillelaguda, and Swaroop Nagar and New Bharat Nagar in Uppal, besides Patny Nagar in Secunderabad were inundated on Wednesday.Rain water entered the Lalaguda Railway Hospitals emergency ward and also Nacharam police station, both which were cleared by Wednesday morning. Osmangunj market experienced heavy inundation, drenching the onion supplies completely. Tedious outages marked power supply across the city, and traffic jams were witnessed everywhere."

Wooden board panelling and warm fairy lights combined with the toasty scent of freshly baked bread check off all the right boxes in the first impressions department. A basket on the counter displays a variety of breads  garlic, basil, oats and flax seed loaves sit in between orange and chocolate-swirl buns, and I learn that they are batches made to order. After I sufficiently graze the plump loaves in the basket and the menu with my eyes, I zero in on the focaccia and the bao.The focaccia arrives as a six-inch sandwich, with a filling of sliced cucumber and cherry tomatoes in a generous drizzle of pesto sauce and cheese. The first bite into it is a gentle rush of flavours, and the sumptuously hydrated bread has me going in for the next bite within seconds. At odds with its hard appearance, the texture of the focaccia is so easy that I make record time devouring a sandwich. The bread clearly plays lead singer while the pesto quietly takes on the role of supporting chorus, striking the right balance.Two compact baos on a plate come out next. Off-white and mustard coloured pockets, with a smattering of green, they present a pretty sight. The bread is supple, but the Sichuan sauce in the filling blatantly overpowers the cabbage, spring onion and Sichuan mayonnaise. Where the focaccia stands out in its fresh and authentic flavour, the bao fails to hold ground.Determined to mask the lingering Sichuan flavour from the bao experiment, I opt for the vada pav and the pita. A palm-sized pocket, the falafel in the pita is a tad dry and could definitely do better with a bigger dollop of hummus. It leaves me wanting more, after just a cursory encounter with my taste buds.The Bread Bar Swaad Nation, 13, Barnaby Road, KilpaukHits: Focaccia and bread boxFocaccia and bread box Misses: Bao and pitaBao and pita meal for two: 240240 9884692997I am glad I saved the vada pav for the end. The garlic chutney with the slightly crunchy vada creates a burst of flavours that few vada pavs on the East coast manage to do. With three pieces to a plate, this vada pav is best relished with company, unless you plan to make a meal of it. And if you are part of a group that cannot agree, the chefs platter (an array of all their breads) on the weekend menu is the ideal pick.Manisha Khumbat, one of the proprietors and the chef here, recommends the bread box before I leave. Though I am stuffed, the sight of warm gooey cheese coaxes me into one final indulgence. The bread box is a cheese fondue with croutons in a carved-out loaf of wheat bread. As I slowly polish off the cheese, the bread crumbles into it, making the dish a fulfilling experience in itself. Before I roll out of the doors, I make a mental note to nip in again for the cheese fondue."

Since onion is a root vegetable and susceptible to damage during monsoon, farmers often resort to distress sale of the bulb in the absence of Government support.Pradhan called upon the Government to make efforts to encourage onion cultivation in the State by ensuring proper returns for farmers and strengthening storage facilities.Assistant Professor of Faculty of Agri-Business Management, Sambalpur University Sumant Kerketta said farmers can be encouraged to develop storehouses under a cooperative management system.If the Government arranges farmers into small groups at block level and they are given financial assistance for construction of warehouses, each group can set up its own warehouse and maintain it. This will help in maintaining buffer stock, he said.As per records of the horticulture department, in 2016-17, 28,196 tonne of onion was harvested in the district. But, in 2017-18 it came down to 15,884 tonne.At present, the district has only one warehouse with a storage capacity of 25 tonne. The farmers willing to store their produce in the warehouse need to apply to the Horticulture department.This apart, the Government offers subsidy of 50 per cent to farmers who wish to set up their own warehouses. But, no one in the district has yet availed the scheme in the district due to lack to awareness."

He pointed out how the government had first floated tenders to import onion and then went on to stop exports by imposing a steep Minimum Export Price (MEP) of $850 per tonne. If this was not enough, there was indirect pressure on the market to reduce prices. The combination of all this has worked and prices have collapsed, he said.Markets have indicated that the price rise was due to shortage of onion following a dip in sowing of summer onions in Maharashtra and late arrival of kharif onions from Karnataka.Last week, a team of senior officials from the Department of Consumer Affairs and Ministry of Agriculture visited Nashik and Pune to assess the situation. While speaking to The Indian Express, the members had indicated that they felt the price rise was mostly due to speculation by traders."

We have reduced the use of onions in our day-to-day cooking unable to bear the exorbitant price of the vegetable, said N Rama Devi, a resident of Ramesh Reddy Nagar.As onions were not available at Fathekhan Peta Rythu Bazaar, people were forced to purchase onions at retail shops at a high price. Taking advantage of the gap between demand and supply of onions, some traders are trying to hoard stocks. Prices of onions are likely to go up further to Rs 70, said Sk Rafi, a trader.Now, consumers in the city are rushing to retail shops to purchase onions as they are expecting a further rise in the price of vegetable.Due to heavy rainfall in Kurnool district, imports of onions have decreased, compared to last month.The current rise in onion prices is a result of last years drought and a delayed monsoon this year. The situation is compounded by excessive rainfall in onion-growing areas, which has delayed the harvesting period, said another trader."

Urban consumers are unhappy to pay more for onions, which have become scarce and expensive, thanks to late sowing and rains disrupting supply chains. Political parties and governments have rushed in to both, exploit and assuage this anger. Exports have been banned, and the government is planning to offload its stocks. Such steps will bring down prices to some extent. What about farmers, though? This was their opportunity to make some windfall gains. Do remember that tepid food prices have been the biggest reason for low inflation in the last few years. Food buyers have gained at the cost of food sellers. And this has put a severe squeeze on farm incomes. Even if left unattended, the onion price rally would have reversed in some time. After all, this is not the first time onion prices have risen.It is difficult to take sides in this debate. A large number of Indians spend almost half of their incomes on buying food items. Most of them work in the informal sector and have no price indexation for their wages. This means that many Indians are hurt badly by high food inflation. Farmers, on the other hand, are almost perpetually distressed in this country. Although often seen as unskilled and unwanted in the larger economy, they perform the crucial function of ensuring food security for the nation. It is their collective effort, despite worsening viability of farming, which has kept India immune from price volatility in international markets for most food items.There are ways to resolve the contradiction. If farmers are denied a windfall gain by the government to keep inflation under check, then there should also be a provision to ensure that there are no windfall losses at the time of a glut. Bumper harvests are more unfair to vegetable farmers because middlemen squeeze price paid to farmers, without passing on the entire gains to consumers. Whats essential, however, is that the politics of it is discussed first. Any political party which doesnt want to champion the idea that high food inflation is as bad as a crash in food prices is being disingenuous while making claims that it is pro-farmer.First Published: Sep 26, 2019 21:29 IST"

With some vendors selling it for Rs 60 per kg, the absence of a mechanism to check the price of onion is quite apparent in the city.Two months back, onion was abundantly available in the market for Rs 15 per kg. However, by September 2, the price went up to Rs 35-40 per kg depending on quality and size.A retailer Basu Barik said the wholesale price of onion is Rs 45-46 per kg and he sells it for Rs 50 as around five to 10 kg in a sack of 50 kg is discarded as waste.On September 2, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer A Barik said he had written to Rourkela ADM and Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) to call a meeting of the onion wholesalers and find ways to keep the price of bulb in check.The bulk of onion is procured from Nashik in Maharashtra and the rise in its price is being attributed to shortage of the bulb at the source."

There is a demand-supply problem but no one should be allowed to take advantage of the situation.KOLKATA: Onion prices , which have soared to Rs 60-Rs 70 a kg in the past few days, are likely to remain so till early November, when fresh stock from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka is expected to arrive. Because of the untimely rain and flood-like situation in Maharastra, which have wreaked havoc on onion production in Nashik, the vegetable has been burning holes in Kolkatans pockets. The sorted onion, packed in plastic bags, is selling at Rs75-Rs 80 per kg now.Sources at the agriculture marketing department have assured they will bring in subsidized onion  at Rs 42 per kg  to markets. However, that is too little to meet the demand. Bengal requires 8.5 lakh tonnes of onion a year. Though it produces 5.5 lakh tonnes, it is the deficit of 3 lakh tonnes that has determined the prices.Around this time, Bengal is dependent on Nashik for onion. But because of the untimely rain, the Nashik onion is trickling through city markets and this scarcity is making onion pricey, said Kamal Dey, president of West Bengal Vegetable Vendors Association.With the price rising almost 30% in two days to touch the highest since September 2015, traders fear the government will move to ban export. Measures like levying of the minimum export price and permission for duty-free import have failed to curb the price rise, said Dey.The onion price in Nashik rose to Rs 42-Rs 45 a kg, which took the price in Kolkata to Rs 70 a kg in the third week of September. However, when the Nashik price dipped to Rs 35-Rs 38 a week later, there was no change here. The Bengal government has gone into agreement with NAFED on the supply of 200bn tonnes of onion, but NAFED could not keep their word. This is why the gap between the domestic supply and demand is yawning, said an official."

The price of onion in the national capital has been skyrocketing with the government setting a retail transaction limit at five kilo per individual.The announcement to sell subsidized onions comes 15 days after the Centre directed the Delhi government to take the key kitchen staple from its buffer stock and sell at a maximum retail price of Rs 23.90 per kilo, through its civil supplies department and ration shops.The Centre pegged Delhis average onion requirement at 350 tonnes per day. But, senior government officials said, transportation had turned out to be an issue and tenders were floated last week.Price of onion has touched Rs 60-80 in most retail markets in the city, depending on the quality and location. We are trying to ensure that onions do not end up burning holes in the pockets of residents, said Kejriwal in a press conference. He further said, Onions will be sold in selected fair price shops and mobile vans between 10am and 5pm.Kejriwal added that the government will continue selling onions at the same price till the market rates stabilise. More fair price shops and mobile vans will be added in the list if the situation does not improve.The CM said adequate measures will be taken to keep check on potential hoarding and potential re-selling of subsidised onions.For the first five days, Delhi government has placed five orders for procuring 1 lakh kilos of onions per day from the Centres buffer stock, that will be loaded from Nasik in Maharashtra where the government has sent two officials for quality check, Kejriwal said.Size of future orders will be ascertained on the basis of changes observed in the market in the first five days and the potential drop in demand during Navratri [which begins on September 29], said Kejriwal.ONION POLITICSBharatiya Janata Partys Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari on Friday accused the Delhi government of making profits from onion sale.The Centre is providing onions for Rs 15.90 per kg and the Delhi government is selling it at Rs 23 per kg. It is shameful that they are making profit out of a crisis, said Tiwari, who is a Lok Sabha MP from North-East Delhi.Responding to the allegation, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said, An MP is expected to know basic facts Both procurement and selling rates have been set by the Centre and we will be happy if he could help in reducing them further.Elaborating on the rates, Kejriwal said in the press conference that onions will be procured from the Centres buffer stock at Rs 15.60 per kg and the difference between the selling price and procurement price will provide for a commission of Rs 4 per kg for the fair price shop and mobile van shop owners for expected normal loss and cost of transportation.(ends)First Published: Sep 27, 2019 21:12 IST"

This comes as a huge surprise. I dont know why the state government is not doing anything to help the people and depriving them of buying the crop at a subsidised price, he told mediapersons at Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata, where he spoke about the Centres recent reduction in corporate tax rates and other reliefs.On Thursday, Union Minister of Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan had said that the Centre has adequate stock of onion and is ready to provide it to states as per their requirements.AdvertisingCentre has adequate stock of onion and asked state governments to take as much onion they want. So far we have released 1,850 million tonnes (MT) to Tripura, 2,000 MT to Haryana and 960 MT to Andhra governments at the rate of Rs 15.59 per kg. States will provide it to public at maximum Rs 23.90 per kg, he had said.Meanwhile, the Union minister for environment said the Centre is seriously considering using electric vehicles for government employees and ministers.The government is thinking about using electric vehicles for government employees and ministers. But, we have to do it phase by phase. We cannot do it at once, he said.Supriyo also urged Banerjee not to make political statements, while inaugurating Durga Puja.Yesterday (Thursday), I made a mistake of confusing between (Ishwar Chandra) Vidyasagar and Raja Ram Mohan Roy.

Boman Kohinoor, the man behind Britannia & Co passed away. And for a mere restaurateur, an unprecedented amount of ink was poured in tribute. Which in itself goes to show that Kohinoor, wasnt mere at all. He was part of the fabric of Mumbai that is now slowly being frayed and is turning threadbare. In him, we have lost one of the few remaining symbols of a city that represented another more gentle and upright age.I must have first visited Britannia when I was a kid. In those days, driving to the heritage precincts of Ballard Estate was no great thing. We did not give even a second glance to those grand buildings of this European-style business district designed in the Indo Saracenic style. We just drove past the Mint and took a left at the tall Port Trust World War I memorial and hopped off right outside Britannia. The streets were thinly populated, hardly anyone owned cars and finding parking wasnt even a glimmer of a problem.In those days, the signboard above the restaurant read Britannia & Co High Class Restaurant. On the sides of the worn tin signage were two advertisements for Dukes Mangola and Lemonade. Remnants of crystal chandeliers with tiny golden globe lights, high ceilings and arched doorways hinted at a time when Britannia was indeed a high-class restaurant. It catered only to British Officers and served only European food. Like many prime properties in Mumbai at the time, Britannia too was acquired by the army to house soldiers during World War II. When the war was over, Britannia was handed back to the owners, but all the officers and Europeans had gone and the ground floor of Neville House, on Currimbhoy Road was never the same. But the Iranis and the Kohinoor brothers were not going to take things lying down.Come Independence, the restaurant was back with nationalistic vigour, with a spicy mainly Parsi menu and dishes based on recipes from the Kohinoor home.We were young, and Boman Kohinoor by that logic was a much younger man. When we all trooped into the restaurant as children, running around deciding on which table to grab, the bright green checkered table linen beckoning us, a large red rooster with a black plumed tail, and a ruddy Kohinoor who both sat majestically, one on top of and the other behind the cash counter greeted us. If he ever spotted you struggle with the large menu cards tucked under the glass that covered the tables, he would spring into action to help.The usual order was the Mutton Berry Pulao. That was the single most important dish at Britannia. The Britannia Berry Pulao comes closest to the Irani Zereshk Polow as it can to a Persian dish. Zereshk Polow is a simple steamed rice dish flavoured with saffron, sprinkled with sour barberries (berry) and served with chello kabab, kibbeh or chunks of meat. Some Persian homes cook the meat and rice together and then finish it off with saffron and the berries. Britannia, added fried onions and tomatoes, Parsi spices, potato and served it as a robust pulao. It came flavoured with Parsi garam masala, saffron and sprinkled with nuts and berries imported from Iran.Kohinoor would come to the table, greet you, the bottles of Raspberry would appear as hed explain the menu, snap at a waiter, order your choice and then regale you with his sentiments about British RoyaltyWe would sit under those creaky fans hanging a mile above our heads and sweat with joy eating Berry Pulao with Britannias dark, thick, loaded masala dhansak dal, like it was our last meal. (Their dhansak which nobody ever talks about, is also incredible) Of course it wasnt our last meal. Along with the pulao, there was always an order of Britannias eminent Sali Kheema (mutton) that we wiped back with soft large rotlis, and deep fried lacy mutton cutlets  soft mince spicy patty dipped in crumbs and egg and fried. During the right season, they served fried bombils and Patra ni Macchi as specials but I never ventured there.Kohinoor would come to the table, greet you, the bottles of Raspberry would appear as hed explain the menu, snap at a waiter, order your choice and then regale you with his sentiments about British Royalty. Hed insist you try the queen of desserts, the caramel custard. Originally a classic French dessert, called Crme Caramel, its been completely claimed by Irani cafs and Parsi housewives. Chilled wobbly custard with sweet and bitter burnt caramel on top. In the old days youd get jelly too. But I cannot fathom when such a quintessential Irani place added Bengali mishti doi to its menu, which Id always prefer over the custard, much to Kohinoors vexation.Mind you, though the walls were unpainted and the plaster was peeling, the meal wasnt cheap. It did set you back a bit. But then, whats a few extra rupees for a trip to another time, place and dimension. A few years ago the rooster left his roost and now hangs on the wall as a photo in frame. Sadly the next time we go there, so will Boman Kohinoor. My only prayer is that while he will be sorely missed by his many patrons, may his legacy live on for a long time in Britannias Mutton Berry Pulao.First Published: Sep 27, 2019 21:46 IST"

2019-09-28,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/sep/28/a-sumptuous-thaal-for-all-2040144.html,A sumptuous thaal for all,"Sudeshna Dutta ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Home, friends, and good food  is what, we believe, is an ideal combination for a get-together. Add a little uniqueness to this, and it becomes an unforgettable experience.Said to have migrated from Yemen to Gujarat many years ago, the Bohra community is a small sect of Shia Ismaili Muslims who follow the custom of the Bohri thaal. It is the practice of eating together from the same plate.Groups of eight people usually sit on the floor, eat from the huge plate, and make sure none of the food is wasted. This practice is more prevalent in Mumbai, and now, the owners of Bohra Bohra Cafe, Koramangala, have opened doors of their house for guests to experience the unique way of relishing home-cooked food.On a Saturday evening, we sit down for the thaal in three groups, and were asked to wash our hands in the chelamchi lota (a type of jug and basin), which is carried around by the one who will be serving food. On the large plate kept in front of us, we see Bohri-style masala aloo in a bowl, which is an accompaniment in their term. After a refreshing glass of Gol Paani (Jaggery water drink), Rehanna Nagaria and Arpitha Rai  our hosts for the evening  asked us to start the seven-course meal with a pinch of salt  a custom followed in the Bohri community. We dug into the aloo, which had a tangy, spicy flavour that tantalised our taste buds and prepared us for what was coming next.Along came Smoked Chicken Kheema Samosas with green and red chutney. There was another sweet chutney which Nagaria prepared with her own ingredients, and the flavour of the hot samosa became more prominent with all the chutneys.We fell in love with the White-sauce Chicken Cutlets, a dish close to Nagarias heart as she follows her grandmothers recipe for this. They were soft, succulent and left a delicious after-taste after each bite.Next, we had the Mutton Shami Kabab, which is minced mutton carefully stuffed with ingredients, rolled, egg-washed and deep-fried.As we came to the end of the starters (yes, these were all starters!), the much-awaited Raan arrived, looking appealing as ever. Slow-cooked for nine hours, the Raan (mutton leg) in red masala was the star of the evening. The meat was so soft that a slight pull made it easy for us to finish the whole piece in a few minutes. A bit similar to butter masala, the thick gravy had a lot of flavours and all of us enjoyed itto bits.Coming to the main course, the classic mutton biryani and raita left us fully satisfied. Seasoned with caramalised onions, differently flavoured rice and soft mutton pieces kept us engaged till the platter was empty.The Bohri thaal is more of a mixed cultural influence from the Middle East and the Parsi community. In all the dishes that we had, the spices dont really hit you at once, its more seasoned to give a soothing taste. In between the food items, we were asked to have small bites of Anjeer halwa in order to cleanse the palate, a ritual followed during the thaal.Vegetarians can also be a part of the Bohri thaal as there are ample choices like charcoal grilled dal samosa, Kari Masala with stuffed capsicum, Parr roti and more. The next thaal will be held on September 29, 12-2.30pm. Those interested can contact Nagaria and Rai through their Facebook page, The Bohra Bohra Thaal, to book a slot.Price: Non-vegetarian is Rs 1,200 per person and vegetarian is Rs 800 per person."

Sharadhya Navratri is around the corner and preparations are in full swing, right from cleaning every nook and corner of the house to decorating the house and preparing good food, the festive spirit has started sinking in and enthusiasm can be felt in the air!Well, In India festivals are more about the happiness and togetherness, which reflects our harmony in diversity. In fact, every festival in India is celebrated with a lot of zeal, but what makes them vary is the difference in the culture, traditions and rituals, but despite all these it is pretty interesting to feel the happiness and unity.Another amazing thing about Indian festivals is that they are simply incomplete without good food. Especially, when it comes to Navratri, it is all about fasting as well as feasting as good food adds soul to festivals and occasions.However, the 9-day long fast can seem tough as there are a lot of restrictions on the foods you can eat. This is simply because of the abstinence of anything thats tamasik. During this time, it is suggested to eat satvik food and refrain from several things such as onion, garlic, grains, alcohol, spices etc. The best part about fasting during Navratri is that you can eat one meal a day. Moreover, you can eat several foods made with healthy substitutes of grains and pulses.Water chestnut flour also known as Singhare ka atta is one of the most popular ingredients used to prepare delicacies during Navratri. Since ages, this ingredient has been used to prepare delicacies to offer as a naivedya to the deity. Heres is a simple barfi recipe you can make at home without putting in much efforts.1 cup singhare ka atta (water chestnut flour)1 cup khoya1 cup sugar4 Tbsp ghee1 cup water1 tsp green cardamom powderTake a pan over low flame and add some ghee. Stir till flour turns brown in colour. Turn off the flame and scorch the flour.Take a vessel add some khoya, let it turn little brown but dont fry it. Apart from that, allow the khoya to attain a thick consistency. Then add the flour mixture, along with a hint of cardamom powder.Then take some and add some sugar and heat this blend over low flame, till it attains a two-string consistency.Turn off the flame and mix khoya and sugar syrup and mix all these ingredients well. Grease the tray with some ghee and transfer the blend. Allow it cool on normal room temperature and cut into desired shapes and your barfi is ready."
2019-09-28,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-taste-of-old-delhi-in-mayur-vihar-market/article29541695.ece,A taste of Old Delhi in Mayur Vihar market,"A nice aroma of fried onions and spices tickled my nostrils when I was walking through the little market square in my neighbourhood one day. I stopped  as one does when embraced by the fragrance of food  and looked around. I found that next to a meat shop (where you also get good kababs), a small eatery had sprung up. The gentleman in charge saw my interest and came up to me. ""Whats cooking,"" I asked him. Biryani, korma and nihari, he said  and offered me a spoonful of both the gravy dishes. And I was left smacking my lips, for it tasted quite like the meat dishes that you get in Old Delhi.This little eatery is in the Vardhman Plaza market in Mayur Vihar Phase 2  the untidy arcade that hits you when you enter Phase 2 from the highway. The shop  called Delicious Mughlai Food  is at the back of the market (Phone numbers: 8800131231 and 9599413191). The cooks, I was told, have learnt the trade from bawarchis in Old Delhi. They only serve chicken dishes, and if and when they are in the mood, they add chicken ishtu to the menu.I liked the taste of the gravy so much that I called some friends over. And I asked for some nihari and korma, and khameeri rotis (15 each). The friends who were invited were a motley crowd  some who love meat, some who cant have heavy food and a few vegetarians. So our table had quite a mix of cuisines, too.I must say I enjoyed the local korma and nihari. Both were rich, but the masalas had been fried well with the chicken  the way it should be  giving both the dishes a nice flavour. The dishes were not hot, and the spices were just right  not too much, nor too little. What was also nice was the consistency of the gravy  the korma was thick, and the nihari just a little thin and glutinous.My friends who were there said they enjoyed the food, and the fact that the chicken had been cooked just right. It wasnt falling off the bone, but wasnt too chewy or hard. My friend Amar, who is a good cook (apart from a great academic), said what he liked about the two dishes was that it had the predominant fragrance of cardamom and clove. What also added to the taste was the fact the chicken had been slow cooked, and possibly fried in some thick, hydrogenated oil.The food, the eatery owner (Ravinder) tells me, is cooked in Kala Mahal near the Tiraha Bahram Khan area in Daryaganj. It is supposed to be open for lunch and dinner, but on two occasions, I found that the food had not reached until well after 1.30 p.m. But it is open till late evening  or as long as the food lasts -- and is closed on Tuesdays. Every dish there (barring the roti) costs the same  125 for half a plate, and 250 for full.Visitors who drop by at night are now going to be fed korma and nihari, Purani Dilli style. I must say I am happy to find a little corner of old Delhi in my own neck of the woods.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Altogether, 70 mobile vans and 400 fair price shops have been arranged to sell onions in the city.CM Arvind Kejriwal flagged off the mobile vans from the Delhi secretariat gate on Saturday. Besides the vans, onions are also being sold at 400 fair price shops. Kejriwal said that after first five days, the procurement of the onion stock will be reviewed as per the requirement.One person can get a maximum of five kilograms of onions in a day. The sale of onions will be held from 10 am to 5 pm. No identification proofs are required to purchase onions from the FPSs. Kejriwal urged the common people to be honest and avoid black-marketing.While flagging off the mobile vans, Kejriwal said, ""Onions are being sold at Rs 70-80 kg in retails markets in Delhi. We do not want people of Delhi to suffer from these eye-watering prices of onions. So, we have decided to sell onions at Rs 23.90 per kg. One mobile van each will be taken by the MLAs to their respective constituencies to cover all the 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi.""CM said the government is directly putting into the market whatever has been procured. ""Two Delhi government officials will visit Nagpur to examine the quality of onions and to ensure supply of good quality onions to Delhi,"" he said.The government is also keeping an eye on the hoarders and legal action will be taken against them. Kejriwal said based on the demand of onions per constituency, the government will consider the requirement of commissioning more fair price shops and mobile vans in the city.Onions are currently available at Rs 60-80 per kg in the retail market in Delhi. The wholesale price of onion at Azadpur Mandi in Delhi has gone up to Rs 60 per kg, the highest since 2015.The government is expecting the onion prices to come down soon."

One person will be able to buy a maximum of 5kg.The CM said that currently onions are being sold at Rs 60-80 per kg. No ID card will be required for purchasing onion from these points. I hope that people will be honest and purchase onions only for consumption, the CM added.The government had earlier planned to sell onions at the controlled rate from October 3. However, with the consumers already feeling the pinch of the skyrocketed prices, the government decided to sell it at lower prices without any delay.Over the next five days, Delhi government will procure one lakh kg of onions from the Centre. To bring onion prices under control, Delhi government has decided to procure onions from Central Buffer Stock Exchange through NAFED and sell it at Rs 23.9 per kg, the CM said, adding that further requisition would be assessed on the basis of the sale and consumption of onions in these five days. We will continue with this move till the prices stabilise, Kejriwal said.Delhi government will procure onions at Rs 15.6 per kilogram from the central government. Both the prices have been fixed by the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Kejriwal said.A team of two officials would be sent to Nashik in Maharashtra soon to conduct a pre-dispatch inspection of stocks and ensure that good quality onions are supplied to Delhi. Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain and the price stabilisation fund committee under the chairmanship of the chief secretary will supervise the implementation of the move.Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Delhi government was trying to earn a profit from the sale of onions. The Centre is selling onions at Rs 22 per kg and supplying it to Delhi government for Rs 15.9 to ensure there is no scarcity. By selling it at Rs 23.9 a kilo, Delhi government is trying to earn profits, BJP claimed."

2019-09-28,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/sep/28/kodagu-on-a-plate-2040142.html,Kodagu on a plate,"Muneef Khan ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Kodagu is known for its climate, coffee and cuisine. The Restaurant - Coorg, Indiranagar, has maintained the authenticity of Kodagu cuisine and stays true to the flavours of the land.The restaurant was started by KC Aiyappa in 2009, with his wife, Priya Aiyappa, donning the role of executive chef. Situated on the rooftop of a house, the interiors are quaint with a calm ambience.We started the buffet with the Coorgi Chicken Curry, which we paired with Nuputtu (string hopper). The chicken was cooked in a coconut milk-based curry and we were amazed at the creamy delight that complemented the fluffy and soft serving of Nuputtu. The coconut had enhanced the flavour and we were surprised with the consistency.My companion tried the Pandi Curry (Pork Curry) and Chilly Pork, which he described as marvels on a plate. The chunks of pork were marinated in Kachampali (fruit-based vinegar) and pepper, which added to the dark texture and juicy fat, while the chilly pork was fried with peppers, paired along with Kadamputtu.A clear winner on the menu.From the vegetarian section, we tried the Kummu Curry, which is fresh oyster mushrooms with sauteed onions and grounded coconut. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and paired with a fragrant serving of Ghee Rice. The star was the Bolari Fry (Cucumber Stir Fry) which had a zing of red-chilli and a soothing aftertaste of grated coconut. The bamboo shoot pickle, tamarind pickle and cucumber raita added to a burst of flavours.For dessert, we tried the caramel custard and coconut souffle. The former melted in our mouths whereas the latter was a perfect balance of coconut and milk. Its safe to say, we left satisfied."
2019-09-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/apple-orchards-kashmir-fruit-mandi-6037412/,A bite of the apple,"An olive-green mine-proof Caspir vehicle of the Army stands in front of a long, tin-roofed platform in Sopores fruit mandi. At Asias second-largest apple market, these should be bustling days. But its all quiet, the mandis stalls empty. As the clampdown in Kashmir continues, for the first time, the apple has become a target in the Valleys three-decade-old conflict.AdvertisingRealising how central the fruit was to its attempts to restore normalcy in Kashmir, the Central government had announced on September 5 that NAFED (the National Agricultural Produce Marketing Federation) would procure apples in the Valley  a first for the central agency. Earlier, nearly a month ago, the government had said trucks of fruits, including apples, were moving out of Kashmir, like always. On September 25, the Army released aerial pictures from Jammu and Kashmir as well as a video captioned loading of apples people moving on with life.But, with militants threatening growers against complying with government plans, figures released by the states Horticulture Marketing and Planning Corporation (HMPC) show that till September 25, only 10,861 apple boxes (approximately 184 metric tonnes) had been procured by the authorities  a worrying fraction given the states average annual production of nearly 20 lakh metric tonnes. The HMPC is the states nodal agency for the procurement of apples.In other words, as the harvest season slips away, 75 per cent of Indias total apple production faces danger of being lost.***AdvertisingJune to December are the busiest months at the Sopore fruit mandi, spread over 50 acres just outside town, with 15 auction platforms parallel to each other. This time of the year, the mandi normally employs around 5,000 people, doing the bulk of its annual business of up to Rs 2,500 crore.The sellers reach the mandi by dawn, and after a day of transactions, truckloads of apples leave for destinations like New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and even Bangladesh and Nepal.Explained Neglected trade feels pain ITS BEEN a long-standing demand of apple growers that their trade be given industry status, given its importance to the states economy  a treatment they see as step-motherly compared to the tourism industry, which invites most of the talk and attention. The latest blow may add to the trust deficit.These days though, its main iron gate half-shut, the mandi is deserted. Outside, a long row of shops, mostly of fruit traders, are shuttered. The only sign of life inside is at the office of the HMPC.In orchards in most of Sopore, ripe apples are still hanging from trees  with every day past the harvest time of third week of September ominous for growers. The situation is the same in other areas of north Kashmir and in Pulwama, south Kashmir. Some growers are carrying out plucking, but discreetly, and take the fruit home, to wait it out. I will see how and when I can send it to the market, says a grower.In Shopian, the Valleys second-biggest apple-growing area, the panic hasnt set in yet. Grown at a higher altitude than other fruit areas of the valley, the Shopian apples ripen later, and most varieties are harvested in the first week of October.It is not the first time that the Valleys fruit season has coincided with a shutdown. However, through the Amarnath land row agitation of 2008 and the violent protests following militant commander Burhan Wanis killing in 2016, there was an unwritten understanding that the fruit would not be touched  while the government had taken measures in 2016 to stop night travel of apples, it was essentially done to make growers keep the Sopore mandi open during the day to break a militant-enforced shutdown.This unwritten code was broken in the first week of September, nearly a month into the clampdown, which had been imposed ahead of the Centres decision to abrogate Article 370. First, on August 24, while talking about normalcy returning to Kashmir, J&K government spokesman Rohit Kansal said at a press briefing that fruit consignments are being sent to outside markets, adding, As against 89,000 metric tonnes last year, around 1.20 lakh metric tonnes have been transported out in the corresponding period.Then, early September, the authorities, including the police and Army, asked fruit growers to keep the Sopore mandi open during the day amidst an otherwise near-total shutdown. On September 5, the Centre announced a Market Intervention Scheme to procure apples in the Valley through NAFED, so as to ensure good remunerative prices.A day later, militants barged into the house of a prominent apple grower in Sopore, opened fire and left four wounded, including a five-year-old, and warned the family against going to the mandi.In the three weeks since, posters bearing names of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have surfaced in Sopore and Shopian, asking people not to send their fruit to the markets of Delhi this year. In a statement, the J&K Police had confirmed that militants had put up the threatening posters in Sopore, naming some Lashkar men.Few fruit growers are willing to talk about the militant threat. While Nazir Ahmad, from Nowpora in Sopore, does, he also blames the government. It is for the first time that militants have interfered in the fruit business. They have been angered by the government trying to project it as a sign of normalcy. In the worst of times, like 2016 or 2010, they (militants) let us open the mandi in the morning and evening. Now they are firm that no fruit must leave.A fruit grower from Sopore, who refuses to be named, says that this time too, they initially tried to have the same arrangement. But then the posters surfaced, he adds, also blaming the government.DGP Dilbagh Singh denies forcing anyone. We are only facilitators and our job is to ensure that if they want to do business, they can without a sense of fear, he says.***Still, there is little doubt that, for the government, apples in Kashmir are not business as usual.Before the NAFED announcement, the Centre had organised a meeting in Delhi for fruit growers from the Valley with the federation and top government officers. Confirming this, a senior government officer in Srinagar, who refused to be named, said the scheme might have gone down better if officials on the ground had been kept in the loop. Now a scheme launched purely to benefit growers looks politicised.In its statement announcing the NAFED scheme, a J&K government release hinted that preparations had been on for some time. Already a NAFED team has arrived to finalise modalities of the procurement, it said.Fulfilling the promise is anyway a tall task for NAFED, that has never been procured apples, and opened an office in Srinagar only days before the announcement. The nodal agency usually procures oilseeds, pulses, copra, onion and cotton at minimum support prices declared by the Centre.Speaking to The Indian Express earlier, an NAFED official had said, We have been told to buy whatever is offered to us, though the indicative target is to procure 12 lakh metric tonnes. The state government will fix the prices. The total cost of operations is tentatively assessed at Rs 5,000 crore.The procurement was to start from September 12, and the entire process finished by mid-December.Ghulam Mohammad Dar, who has been given additional charge of HMPC (the agency handling the procurement at the state level), hopes things will get better. Ultimately it is up to the people to sell to us or not. The response is not up to expectations but we are really hopeful it will improve, he says. Dar was brought in after HMPC Director Shahnawaz Bikhari was shifted out last week, a move that has done little to reassure growers.In Shopian, the district administration has publicised the NAFED scheme through fliers in Urdu, and TV and radio advertisements. People have started coming to us to reserve their spots for auctions. Many people have established business relations but some are coming to us as well, Deputy Commissioner, Shopian, Choudhary Mohammad Yasin told The Sunday Express.Irrespective of the militant threats though, growers say, they had other doubts about selling to NAFED. Says Shahnawaz Ahmad, an orchadist from Shopian, It is none of the governments business (whom we sell to). The industry has a set procedure. We are bound by a contract, and get advance money from the big fruit dealers in Delhi and Kashmir on the promise that we will sell our produce to them. They even arrange the pesticides for us.Farooq Wani, an apple grower from Shopian, also argues the same, saying they will not sell to the government. We have long-standing relationships with partners in different parts of the country, we borrow money from them. How can we not deliver?Another grower, Ishaq Ahmad, says that for some varieties, the government offer is better, but we cannot tell traders who help us when we need money that we cannot get produce to them. For us, it would be better if transportation could be allowed.A report prepared by the government after the militant threats shows that fruit dealers from outside Kashmir, mostly from the Azadpur fruit market in Delhi, have given more than Rs 4,000 crore as advance to Valley growers. M R Kriplani, the President of the Azadpur Fruit Merchants Association, says they have given anything betweenRs 1,000 and Rs 1,200 crore as advance. Though we are receiving some fruit from Sopore belt, no fruit has come from Shopian so far, he adds. It is far less than what we used to receive It has an impact.In Shopian, for example, as per the district administration, about 40 per cent of the produce and in neighbouring Pulwama, only about 10 per cent, comes to mandis for auction. The rest travels through established channels to traders as far as Bengaluru.Meanwhile, as they struggle to contact their buyers outside the Valley amidst the information blackout, the growers say rates being offered are down by more than 30 per cent, as dealers sense their desperation. In the past, we would call our dealer in Delhi five times a day and if we felt the prices were not competitive, ask them not to sell. We would even store the fruit in cold storage and take out when rates increased, says Abdul Qayoom, a fruit grower from Pulwama. With no communication, our dealers are selling the fruit at prices of their choice. We come to know four or five days later.Denying this, Kriplani says they set the price purely as per the colour of the produce. As the rains have been low in Kashmir this season, the apple has not coloured well.***NAFED has set up four procurement centres  at Sopore fruit mandi, Aglar fruit mandi in Shopian, Parimpora fruit mandi in Srinagar and Botengo fruit mandi in Anantnag. Official figures reveal that only 1,303 fruit boxes have been procured by the government in Sopore while the process is yet to begin in Shopian.A member of the Sopore Fruit Association, who doesnt want to be named, says the idea of setting up procurement centres at the mandi itself was wrong. Our problem is harvesting the fruit, packaging it and then transporting it to the mandi. If we can get it to the mandi, we can send it outside as well, and for prices far better than the governments. In these circumstances, what and where is the positive role of NAFED?From the orchards to the mandi is generally a process spread over several days. The plucked fruit is spread over a tarpaulin at the orchard, apples of different sizes and colours separated, graded A (the best quality), B or C accordingly, with bigger size and deeper colour fetching better prices, and then packed in boxes. Given militant threats, the process now must be carried out discreetly.Some growers complain that the governments grading process for apples is flawed as it focuses only on colour. There are other factors like size, how free the fruit is from diseases, says Mohammad Qayim, a fruit grower from Pattan in north Kashmir.The highest price the government is offering is Rs 52 per kg, for the A grade apples of Delicious variety  a sweet apple, it is the most sought after. The other most-popular varieties are American and Maharaji, which have longer shelf lives.Last year, the A grade apple of Kulu variety, the first to get to the markets in the Valley, went for Rs 64 per kg on an average.***J&Ks total apple economy is estimated at Rs 8,000 crore (roughly 8.2 per cent of its GDP, concentrated almost entirely in Kashmir). In comparison, tourism comprised 6.89 per cent of its GDP (92 per cent of that earned by the Vaishno Devi Shrine in Jammu alone) as per the 2017 Economic Survey.The survey put the number of people directly or indirectly associated with horticulture in the state  a major part of which comprises apples  at seven lakh families, or 33 lakh people. The latest official figures put the number at close to 50 lakh people.The Economic Survey put the total apple production in the state for 2016-17 at 17.26 lakh metric tonnes, which last year, as per government figures, had risen to 18 lakh metric tonnes. Apart from this, as the Survey pointed out, 5.18 lakh metric tonnes of apple on an average are culled or fall off before harvest and are used for preparing juice and jams.Official data shows over 1.45 lakh hectares of land in the Valley is under apple cultivation. North Kashmirs Baramulla district, which includes Sopore, has the highest area under apples, over 25,000 hectares, followed by Shopian in South Kashmir where apples are grown on 21,000 hectares.As the imbroglio continues, the growers are hoping their apples wont go the way of the Valleys pears, which almost completely went waste this year. A fruit with a small shelf life, pear ripens in August and the growers have only a fortnight to harvest and transport the fruit to markets, including outside the Valley. Most couldnt manage it this year once the clampdown set in, while others who did, saw rates plummet. A box of pear (on an average 17 kg) would fetch us around Rs 500-600, says Irshad-ul-Haq, a fruit grower from Sopore. This time, we got barely Rs 300 a box, just covering our cost.Also counting their losses are truckers like Manjit Singh, from Haryana, who has been waiting outside the Sopore mandi for 17 days, without any means of contacting families back home. We wait the whole year for the fruit season to begin. September-November are our most profitable months. But this time, we are facing huge losses, he says, adding how even 2016 wasnt this bad.Trying to put up a brave face, the owner of a cold storage plant who did not want to be identified, says they realise this time is different. The issue is also constitutional as well as sentimental, and even if we suffer losses this year, we will be fine.Adds a fruit grower from Pulwama, We are ready for the loss of this seasons crop, if it helps in some sort of resolution of the Kashmir issue.The more realistic hope is that militant pressure will ease now, after the United Nations General Assembly session, where they had hoped to put the Indian government under pressure over Kashmir.AdvertisingShould that happen, the apples would fly. Less than 100 metres from the desolate Sopore fruit market, stand hundreds of trucks, mostly from outside the state, waiting to take the fruit to all corners of the country.(with inputs from Naveed Iqbal)"

While the western and northern parts of India gears up for Navratri, the east celebrated Durga Puja. Although both the festivals are celebrated for a period of nine days, rituals differ from each other.Key differences between Durga Puja and Navratra:1. Navratri is celebrated for a period of nine days, followed by Dussehra. On the other hand, Durga Puja is celebrated for a period of 10 days.2. Navratri revolves around worshipping Goddess Durga in her nine forms and it ends with a celebration of Lord Rams victory over Ravana. Durga Puja celebrates the victory of Goddess Durga over the demon Mahishasur.3. While Navrati is a period of fasting where devotees do not consume eggs, meat, onion and garlic during the nine-days, Durga Puja is a time when Bengalis indulge in a plethora of non-vegetarian delicacies. Celebrated by Bengalis at large, Durga Puja is the time to enjoy, laugh and have authentic Bengali cuisine.4. The first day of Durga Puja is Mahalaya, a day when the battle between Durga and Mahishasura begins. On the other hand, Navratri begins with worshipping Shailputri, the first avatar of Goddess Durga.5. Durga Puja ends with Sindoor Khela (vermillion game), where married women put sindoor on each other, before the immersion of idol. After immersion of idols, people wish Vijayadashami to one another. On the other hand, Navratri ends with Dussehra, which marks the end of Ramlila and recalls Lord Rams victory over Ravan.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

If the opinions of farmers and wholesale traders are anything to go by, it is a seasonal issue that crops up every year during festive season and the retail prices of the kitchen staple would soon be back to normal.AdvertisingThey, however, accused the government of failing to check this annual phenomenon. In retail market, the onions are being sold in the range of Rs 70-80 per kg.Amarvir Singh, president, Wholesale Vegetable and Fruit Sellers Association, said, The Ludhiana mandi, on an average used to get some 40 trucks of onions every day. Now not more than eight truck are reaching the mandi, hence the wholesale rates of onions have jumped from Rs 25-28 per kg to Rs 40-45 per kg. Lesser number of trucks are reaching the mandi due to rain in the onion growing areas like Nasik, Gujarat, Rajasthan. This is a seasonal issue.He further said that onion prices would be back to normal in a fortnight and hence consumer should not panic. The trend has been witnessed over past several years, he said.AdvertisingAmarjeet Singh, a Ferozepur-based vegetable grower and member of Punjab Vegetable and Fruit Growers Association, too said the proces of onion sky rocket every year during the festive season.But no government has taken steps to check this trend and find out as to why onion prices shoot up every year ahead of Diwali.He said that farmers never get the benefit of the high prices as the profit is pocketed by the stockists and wholesale traders. Moreover, every year workshop are held on processing of onions, but hardly any farmer attends it. Not many farmers are keen on processing onions.While Punjab government is yet to take any initiative to control the onion prices, the AAP government in Delhi has announced to procure one lakh kilogram of the kitchen staple from the Centre over the next five days and sell it to consumers at Rs 23.90 per kg. The onions will be sold through 70 mobile vans that were flagged off Saturday and at 400 ration shops across the national capital.Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator V P Singh Badnore, however, earlier this week directed the Union Territorys administration to sell onions on no profit no loss basis. People will get some relief from this initiative of the administration, he said and asked the officials to continue the arrangement till the prices of onions come down. He also appealed to the public to avoid panic buying and storing onionsAs retail prices of onion continue to hover between Rs 70-80 per kilogram, several online as well as brick and mortar stores have come up with innovative offers. While most of the online grocery stores are offering onions at discounted rates, especially of one buys in bulk, a superstore in Ludhiana is offering the kitchen staple at flat Rs 20 per kg on purchase of grocery worth Rs 1000 and above.

However, there are smart households that sit back and continue to relish the condiment without worrying about any dent to the monthly budget. It is not because they do not mind shelling out the extra money.They had stocked onions for the entire year when the time was ripe. Most households store grains for the entire year, but doing the same for onions is less heard of. However, there are onion lovers who purchase it in bulk when it is in season and the quality is good. Additionally, they get it at very low rates.While they admit that it takes efforts to prevent onions from rotting, the efforts are worth the satisfaction they get through the year. The practice is further justified during times like these, when others shell out Rs 70-80 for a kg, which they had purchased for as low as Rs 8-9.Navrangpura resident Mohammad Mansuris family has a long tradition of storing onions for the whole year. Stocking onions has been a practice in our family for past seven decades. It is not about saving the money but getting the best quality of onions when the season is on. I drive to Brahmanwada village near Unja (North Gujarat) in my car in May every year and buy around 200 kg of onion. I get export quality onion for Rs 8 to 10 per kg. If I go for another quality, I can get it for Rs 5 inbut that does not taste good.Asked about methods to keep onions fresh through the year, Mansuri said: Proper air circulation is the key, so we store them in airy jute bags. We also keep them in plastic crates and steel vessels which have considerable space for air circulation. Onion is hot in nature so there must be sufficient air circulation around it to make it fresh. If I buy it during the season, I am assured of two things. One I get them at a reasonable rate, which will give me immunity from price rise later. Secondly, I will get the best quality. You can also keep them in the open if you have extra space in your house.Kalupur resident Nizam Master stores onions in a different manner. There are four members in my family. I bought 60 kg onion of the best quality. My wife cut them and fried them. We keep these fried onions throughout the year and add them to curries in place of onions. This form of storage is useful because we live in a small house of walled city where there is no space of keeping onions. So we fry it (known as birista) and store it in small containers.Shamimbanu Siddiqui stores around 300 kg onions every year at her home in Jamalpur. We are a joint family. So as per the requirement of my family, I buy around 300 kg onion from APMC, Vasna, which trades only in potato and onion. I buy it around May-June before the onset of, when the season is in full swing. I buy it for Rs 9-10 per kg and spread the stock on the floor of the room. Then I keep rotating the onions. This ensures they dont get spoilt. We store onions just for the best quality, which is available during the season. But, when prices go up it also feels good that your budget does not get disturbed because of it."

They also took feedback on kharif onion plantation, the official said.The team members directed the traders to refrain from hoarding onions and told the APMC authorities to see to it that there is no hoarding of the commodity.According to some traders, the visit of central teams in Nashik in quick succession is a pointer to the fact that the Union government is keen to arrest the rising onion prices.The average wholesale prices of onion at Lasalgaon, countrys biggest wholesale market, shot up in the recent past leading to the increase of prices in the retail market.The average wholesale onion price recorded four-year high at Rs 4,500 per quintal on September 19 with a rise of Rs 1,000 per quintal in a single day as against Rs 3,500 per quintal on September 18."

Marginal farmers, who cultivate onion in less than one-hectare land, do not qualify to receive this benefit.Sources in the Directorate of Horticulture said only 187 storage facilities have been set up by the farmers under the mission in the last three years.There are few takers for the storage houses as farmers have to first invest to complete the structure and be eligible for subsidy later. If banks come forward and finance the stores, more farmers can take the benefit of the mission, he said.In the absence of credible data, it is assumed that onion crop was grown in about 35,000-40,000 hectare across the state.However, the area under cultivation is fast declining as the farmers are not keen to take up the crop on commercial basis due to lack of support price.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the state government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, official sources said.As the state did not wish to take the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, the farmers were forced to sell their harvest to private traders from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh at throwaway prices in the last rabi season."

2019-09-29,https://ahmedabadmirror.indiatimes.com/ahmedabad/others/no-tears-families-stock-onions-when-the-sun-shines/articleshow/71355162.cms,No tears: Families stock onions when sun shines,"onionAhmedabad(Left )birista ; Onions spread on the floor of Shamimabanus housepeak seasonmonsoonThe soaring prices ofhave been making people shed tears across the country. However, there are smart households that sit back and continue to relish the condiment without worrying about any dent to the monthly budget. It is not because they do not mind shelling out the extra money.They had stocked onions for the entire year when the time was ripe. Most households store grains for the entire year, but doing the same for onions is less heard of. However, there are onion lovers who purchase it in bulk when it is in season and the quality is good. Additionally, they get it at very low rates.While they admit that it takes efforts to prevent onions from rotting, the efforts are worth the satisfaction they get through the year. The practice is further justified during times like these, when others shell out Rs 70-80 for a kg, which they had purchased for as low as Rs 8-9.Navrangpura resident Mohammad Mansuris family has a long tradition of storing onions for the whole year. Stocking onions has been a practice in our family for past seven decades. It is not about saving the money but getting the best quality of onions when the season is on. I drive to Brahmanwada village near Unja (North Gujarat) in my car in May every year and buy around 200 kg of onion. I get export quality onion for Rs 8 to 10 per kg. If I go for another quality, I can get it for Rs 5 inbut that does not taste good.Asked about methods to keep onions fresh through the year, Mansuri said: Proper air circulation is the key, so we store them in airy jute bags. We also keep them in plastic crates and steel vessels which have considerable space for air circulation. Onion is hot in nature so there must be sufficient air circulation around it to make it fresh. If I buy it during the season, I am assured of two things. One I get them at a reasonable rate, which will give me immunity from price rise later. Secondly, I will get the best quality. You can also keep them in the open if you have extra space in your house.Kalupur resident Nizam Master stores onions in a different manner. There are four members in my family. I bought 60 kg onion of the best quality. My wife cut them and fried them. We keep these fried onions throughout the year and add them to curries in place of onions. This form of storage is useful because we live in a small house of walled city where there is no space of keeping onions. So we fry it (known as birista) and store it in small containers.Shamimbanu Siddiqui stores around 300 kg onions every year at her home in Jamalpur. We are a joint family. So as per the requirement of my family, I buy around 300 kg onion from APMC, Vasna, which trades only in potato and onion. I buy it around May-June before the onset of, when the season is in full swing. I buy it for Rs 9-10 per kg and spread the stock on the floor of the room. Then I keep rotating the onions. This ensures they dont get spoilt. We store onions just for the best quality, which is available during the season. But, when prices go up it also feels good that your budget does not get disturbed because of it."

The state governments have also been asked to boost the supply by lifting central buffer stock. Some states like Delhi, Tripura and Andhra Pradesh have shown interest so far.Meanwhile Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand on Thursday assured that prices would fall when fresh kharif crops hit the markets in mid-November.To meet demands, onions are also being imported from Afghanistan and Egypt, and the stock will likely arrive by October 15.The surge in prices also drove several to desperation, reports of theft of the crop revealed. A farmer in Maharashtra's Nashik complained that his stock of the kitchen staple worth at least Rs 1 lakh was stolen.Heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh and southern parts of India have been cited as the reasons for short supply and subsequent rise in prices of onions.

The directorate deals with exports and import-related issues.The reported export below minimum export price (MEP) to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will be immediately stopped and strict action will be initiated against those who are found to be violating this decision of the central government, the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution said, according to news agency ANI.Earlier this month, DGFT had imposed a $850/tonne MEP to curb its shipments and check rising domestic prices.The minimum export price refers to a floor price set for exports and no Indian onion exporter can export below this price level. This is a policy tool designed to curb exports by making Indian commodities expensive for foreign buyers in the hope that domestic supplies will improve.The government has also attempted to bring down prices by releasing more onions from federal buffer stocks, prices have remained fairly high.Retail onion prices have touched Rs 60-80 per kg in Delhi and some other parts of the country due to the disruption in its supply from flood-affected growing states like Maharashtra.Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Tripura and Odisha have demanded onions from the Centres stocks. All states have been requested to specify their onion demand which could be met from the Centres stocks, an official said.The Centre had said on Tuesday that the current stocks of onions are sufficient to tide over a lean seasonThe NAFED, the Centres food-trading arm, is responsible for managing the Centres onion buffer reserves.

2019-09-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/imd-weather-forecast-monsoon-withdrawal-india-farmers-crop-6039367/,Monsoon bounty,"Every monsoon is different. This ones been even more so. In June, the country registered an average area-weighted rainfall deficiency of 32.8 per cent and it seemed this season would conform to the textbook case of an El Nino year, similar to 2002, 2004, 2009, 2015 and 2016. All those years had witnessed the abnormal warming of the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean waters, known to impact rains in India during the monsoon season from June to September. With most global weather models predicting El Nino conditions, which had set in from roughly September 2018, to last at least till the first half of this monsoon season, a drought looked inevitable. And coming on top of an extended dry spell right from October through an excruciatingly hot summer, the return of food inflation appeared to present the re-elected Narendra Modi government with its first major challenge.AdvertisingThen the tide turned. In July, the rainfall was 4.6 per cent higher than the historical long-period average. In August, the surplus was even higher at 15.3 per cent. And in the current month, not only has rainfall been a whopping 44.6 per cent above normal so far, but it may also end up being the wettest September in 102 years! The Meteorological Department, which had forecast a just-about normal monsoon while suggesting a 47 per cent probability of below normal/deficient rainfall even as late as on May 31, is now saying that its withdrawal phase may commence only in the second week of October. Meanwhile, there are reports about large-scale damage to the standing kharif crop that is in late-maturity stage, if not ready for harvesting. Farmers, in other words, are suffering this time from too much rain. Worse, they arent stopping when clear skies are what farmers would want at present. In all likelihood, the kharif harvest will be a less than a bumper one.The big consolation, however, is the excess rains have helped substantially recharge the groundwater table and aquifers. Moreover, water levels in the countrys 107 important reservoirs are 86.6 per cent of their full capacities, as against their 10-year average of 71.80 per cent at this time. So, even assuming some setback during kharif, a bumper winter-spring rabi crop is definitely in the offing. That would be great news, especially when there are indications of a price recovery in many crops from their lows. One hopes the government does not do things to artificially suppress prices, like the recent onion exports ban. Rather, this is the time to dismantle all controls on marketing, movement, stocking and exports of farm produce that are an anathema to liberalisation. Theres no better antidote to the economic slowdown today than higher farm incomes."

2019-09-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/how-maharashtras-farmer-field-schools-are-teaching-prosperity-6039581/,How Maharashtra’s Farmer Field Schools are teaching prosperity,"Like other farmers in Karate, a village in the Baramati taluka of Pune, Vijay Salunkhe was mildly surprised when the agricultural assistant of his area talked about a Farmer Field School and asked him to attend it. Salunkhe, who grows mainly maize, and partly onion and bajra, in his 2.5 acres, is thankful that he agreed because these lessons in the school helped him to take preventive measures against the dreaded Fall Army Worm (FAW) for his maize crop. During the school which is held every Sunday, the agricultural assistant talked about the new pest and how to identify it. He also provided the package of practices to save ones crop, Salunkhe says. It was this knowledge that alerted Salunkhe to press the alarm bottom during the early growth stages of his crop after he realised that like other fields his too had fallen prey to the FAW. He quickly applied his learnings from the school to fight the pest and save his crop. Salunkhe admits that without this hands-on knowledge he would not have been able to either identify or save his crop.AdvertisingAt the start of the Kharif season, FAW had presented a serious challenge. First identified in India in 2018, this pest, which feeds on over 80 different kinds of crops, is responsible for the dip in the maize production last year. Worldwide FAW has caused havoc in countries with the pest being seen as a threat to food security in some African countries.Salunkhe is not alone. Vinayak Jadhav, who grows maize over 2.5 acres of his total 5 acres of land in the same village, too benefited. Maize is an important crop for Jadhav as it provides the fodder necessary for maintaining his herd of 15 animals and maintain his daily milk production of around 200 litres. Jadhav has managed to control the infestation on around 70 per cent of his crop with the help of measures like mass trapping of male FAW moths, erecting bird perches and application of other biological control measures.Explained What are Farmer Field Schools? These schools were developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization as an alternative to the top-down way of providing extension under the Green revolution. This has been in practice for a few decades in Southeast Asia. It involves giving focused guidance to small groups of farmers in their fields by way of learning-by-doing exercises.While FAW infestation has been reported on 2.67 lakh hectares of the total 8.60 lakh hectares of maize area, most farmers have reported success in controlling the infestation to a great degree. Agriculture Commissioner Suhas Diwase says the government decided to launch a multi-pronged approach to combat FAW. This included a massive farmers education programme. Along with posters, information kiosks etc., we also decided to start this unique concept of Farmer Field School (called Shetishala in Marathi) as means of reaching out to the farmers, he says. Held right at the farms, this school has officers and staff of the agriculture department get farmers together on a fixed day to discuss issues related to their crops and fields. Unlike bigger seminars or workshops, these schools are held much more regularly and with much smaller groups of farmers. For example, in Karate, every Sunday morning around 10 farmers religiously come to school.AdvertisingThe topics discussed vary depending on the local conditions. Thus, the schools in Baramati had mainly focused on ways to control pests for maize and sugarcane  the crops most commonly cultivated here. In districts of Marathwada, on the other hand, such schools are providing guidance for crops such as cotton, tur, and moong etc. And the success against FAW in Maize is replicated in other crops as well such as cotton which attracts the dreaded pink bollworm. Information dissemination to farmers through various channels including that of the Farmer Field School is to be credited for better pest control.While pest control might be a major thrust area of the schools at present, they also focus on better agricultural practices to help farmers improve their yields. For example, in Baramati, the schools guide farmers towards scientifically preserving the fodder to help them tide over periods of scarcity. Similarly in Kolhapur, farmers are guided on reducing the usage of chemical fertilizers for their cane crop and better management of the crop to increase yield."

The owner declined him with a smile, and said he could have the roll for free instead of asking for more onion slices.Soaring prices of onion has prompted small eateries and restaurants to cut down on the use of the vegetable. So, the plate of vegetable salad now has fewer slices of onion and the onion pakoda has been taken off the menu. Homemakers, too, are preparing dishes that require less amount of the vegetable.In Noida, onions are selling at Rs 70-80 a kg in the retail market. In Ghaziabad, it is around Rs 60 a kg. Prices in Delhi are a little on the higher side  between Rs 60-80 a kg.Residents who have Mother Dairy outlets near their houses are, however, heaving a sigh of relief. The rate of onions at these outlets across Delhi-NCR is Rs 23.90 a kg, but one can only buy 5kg of the vegetable a day.For those observing Navratri, onions will anyway remain off the menu for a few days. But for those who arent, the essential kitchen commodity has been burning a hole in the pocket. Traders blamed the floods in Maharashtra for the soaring prices, and said the rates are expected to remain so for the next one month. We expect a turnaround in a month. Traditionally, this is the time of the year when yield is low, but the floods in Maharashtra have hit the supply chain. For those who owning big restaurants, this doesnt matter much because they usually have a flat rate agreement with vendors all the year round. It is the domestic and small consumers who are affected by this steep price , said Sushil Kumar Jain, convenor of the Confederation of All India Traders in Delhi-NCR.Mother Dairy outlets are keeping a close watch on the sale of onions. Our supply and stocks are closely monitored. If we are found guilty of supplying it to other vendors, we have to pay hefty fines. So, until further notice from the government, onions will be available with all outlets at this rate (Rs 23.90), said Devender Singh, a Mother Dairy vendor at Sector 28.But it is the local vegetable vendor who has had to take the hardest blow. With soaring prices, people have been buying onions in lesser quantities.Our earnings have gone down considerably. There is a possibility price may rise further in the coming days, said Bhola, a vegetable seller in Raj Nagar Extension.According to wholesale market dealers, the prices are likely to come down during Diwali, towards the end of October.

On an average, the daily arrival of stocks is reported at 300 to 360 tonnes.Coming to the retail and vegetable markets, the tomato prices have come to unnerve the consumers, selling at 60 a kg for the first variety, 25 for the second grade and 20 for the scrap variety. Consumers, who are already burdened with onions selling at 60 a kg, are a worried lot with the sudden increase in tomato prices.Advantage farmersFormer chairman of Madanapalle agriculture market and expert in tomato trading, Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu told The Hindu that for the first time, farmers of Madanapalle division were reaping the benefits from their fields in September.The tomato belt from Madanapalle towards Palamaner and Punganur, Royalpadu and Kandlamadugu received scanty rainfall this season. This has proved to be a boon to farmers. The other regions of the division like Vayalpadu, Piler and Bhakarapeta received heavy rain, damaging standing crops, which in turn resulted in slump in arrivals at the market. The farmers in a radius of 20 km from Madanapalle are a happy lot with sudden spurt in prices, Mr. Naidu said.The traders at Madanapalle observed that the first variety of tomato could find good takers in cities of Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad owing to poor production elsewhere in Karnataka, Telangana and other southern States, coupled with copious rains there.ConsumptionIt is observed that generally, the consumption of tomato in households would plummet from September onwards.However, the dry weather which still continues has become an advantage to farmers. With the start of Purattasi month, the consumption vegetables has touched its peak in Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka, and this is becoming a plus point to tomato growers.Subramanyam, a farmer at Punganur, said the present boom might continue till October-end. The present climatic conditions are good enough to reap rich harvest for the next few weeks. The prospect of future crops from January next year would naturally depend on the groundwater table, he said."
2019-10-01,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/oct/01/onions-that-bring-smiles-2041433.html,Onions that bring smiles,"KV Navya ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: As onions get dearer with the prices hitting `50 per kg, Communitree, is conducting a donation drive to collect onions and distribute it to old-age and destitute homes.We have been organising the Gift an Onion donation drive annually since 2016 for a week every year. We ask schools, colleges and corporate offices if each employee/student can donate one onion. Usually, each person gets two or three and we end up with a sack full of onions from each institution that we donate to old-age and destitute homes, said Hafiz Khan, founder, Communitree. The donation drive will be conducted from October 2 to October 8. Khan said they were initially doing this because onions have a longer shelf life compared to other vegetables, but this year the drive is more relevant given the current situation and as most Indian dishes are incomplete without onions.Talking about the genesis of the idea, Hafiz said, Usually when people think of donation, the first idea they get is to donate money. But while donating money, a person becomes really conscious if what he/she is giving is really sufficient. And also when money is involved, people tend to form judgements. For example, if he/she drives a car, they are expected to donate more. So, I came up with this idea  because this does not leave room for judgement and in turn it sparks conversations at homes on what a small donation can really do. Maybe someday they will want to start a similar drive.While in the first year, they collected only a few sacks of onion, the volunteers of Communitree managed donations of 800 kg in 2017 and a whopping 1.5 tonnes in 2018. This year, they expect the quantity to be more than two tonnes.This year, we are expecting apartment complexes to donate too. With at least 500-600 houses in each complex, the donations will be great. Also, till now our greatest contributor has been the IT sector. Last year, we got a mini van full of onions from an IT company, said Hafiz.Communitree members plan to take students of schools which donate, to destitute home where the onions will be donated, to give them an end-to-end understanding of their contribution.For details, call: 9840575555CollectionThey are operating on the East Coast Road, Old Mahabalipuram Road and Tambaram. However, they can collect onions from all over the city if willing contributors are available."

Accordingly, around 78 traders across Andhra Pradesh were raided from September 23 to September 27 in which 34 traders were found guilty of illegally hoarding onion stock and dodging Agricultural Market Fee (AMF).The officials have also seized about 3,398 quintals of onions worth Rs 1.65 crore which has been handed over to the concerned marketing department officials for further action. In Guntur district , the highest amount of hoarded onions - 1,871 quintals worth Rs 61 lakh were seizedThe marketing officials filed cases against the 28 of the 34 traders under section 17 of AP Agricultural Produce & Livestock Markets Act, 1966 for illegal hoarding of onions without having valid licenses.As the rest of the six traders had appropriate licenses, they had to pay AMF dues with a penalty. In this too, Guntur district stands on top for the number of AMF evasions as officials collected Rs 1.2 lakh in the form of penalty from the traders.The traders are not maintaining stock registers, sale bills and evading payment of Agriculture Market Cess. These traders mostly purchase onions from Kurnool and Maharashtra, KV Rajendranath Reddy stated.Currently, the onion prices have shot up to Rs 60-70 per kg in Vijayawada in wake of excess rains. The wholesale price of onion has touched Rs 4,000 per quintal. Experts explain that the hoarding in the state stands rampant as traders are hoping to capitalize on the rising price during the festive season."
2019-10-01,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurgaon-unlikely-to-get-relief-in-onion-prices-before-diwali/articleshow/71382906.cms,Gurugram unlikely to get relief in onion prices before Diwali,"Representative imageGURUGRAM: The city may have to wait it out until Diwali for a substantial correction in onion prices A few weeks ago, onion prices had touched Rs 70-80 per kg. By now, wholesale price for produce from Nashik has come down to Rs 40-45 per kg and retail price to Rs 55-60 per kg. The Rajasthan variety is cheaper  Rs 35 per kg at the wholesale market and Rs 45-50 per kg for consumers.Imports from Afghanistan and curbs on exports could stabilise prices at Rs 40-60 per kg which is still higher than pre-August rates. It is only after Diwali, when the next batch of onions is expected, that the prices can be expected to come down further.At best, a price correction of Rs 5-10 per kg is possible. Nothing beyond that. The crisis was long coming; the government refused to address the problem despite protests by farmers and traders. We are in no position to bring down prices, not until Diwali, said Manish, a Gurugram-based onion trader.As the market bleeds, the strategy, for now, is qualitative segregation.The Nashik produce has a pungent taste and looks fresh. That is being sold in posh localities. The Rajasthan variety tastes sweeter and looks scruffy. It is being sold in low-income areas, Manish added.But there is a cap on how much Nashik onion can be stored. Besides, ration shops stock cheaper onions for BPL families and those covered under the Food Security Act. This could force traders to bring down prices to match the NAFED rate.The NAFED rate is, however, Rs 4 higher than vegetable and fruit retail stores like Safal, which sells them at Rs 23.90 per kg. The government had no response on the price difference. Traders attribute it to the dirt-cheap prices at which big retailers procure onions, which remain unaffected by fluctuations in demand and supply.The spiralling prices have been attributed to three things  non-implementation of minimum support price (as recommended by the MS Swaminathan committee) because of which farmers cut down on production, no storage provisions for surplus produce and excess rainfall in major onion-producing states.Most small and medium farmers are not getting a share of these high prices. In fact, many are now selling their produce in local markets directly to offset losses. Dileep, a 32-year-old migrant from Uttar Pradesh, said his family used to sell onions at Rs 3 per kg, well below the MSP.Our input cost (Rs 8-9 per kg) is higher than the price at which we sell onions to traders, wholesalers and the government (Rs 3-5 per kg). To cover these losses, I have now moved to Gurugram , where I procure onions from wholesalers and try to make a profit of about Rs 5 per kg, he said. This has happened because the government did not introduce minimum support price. Farmers across the country were upset and cut down on the harvest to register their protest. Onion stocks in markets went down by the end of July as the Rabi crop, which accounts for 80% of the total supply of onions in the country, was exhausted. Prices had to go up, he added.The dramatic price fluctuations could be controlled by addressing policy gaps on mandi laws and procurement rates. Farmers are dying and no one bats an eyelid unless consumer prices shoot up. The government then steps forward for damage control, but these measures are stop-gap. In mandis, distributors and traders procure vegetables at regrettably low prices and then hoard the produce, hoping for a lean period when prices shoot up or diverting their produce to other countries, said Karnal-based academic Ramji Lal.The solution is simple enough: A public refrigerated warehouse for farmers. It is a long-pending demand that no government has ever considered, Lal added.In the absence of storage provisions, any change in the expected supply flow disrupts the price graph. Onion supply went from surplus to deficit in a matter of weeks because of excess rain in onion-producing states like Maharashtra and Bihar. Poor infrastructure meant many roads in these states were inundated for weeks and supply to markets was cut immediately. Big traders could divert their surplus to exports. But what would small traders do? said another trader who deals in Nashik onions."

In her letter, the MP has said the decision has caused great discontentment among farmers in Maharashtra.AdvertisingOn Sunday, the central government completely banned the export of onions and also defined limits to the stock that wholesale and retail traders can hold. These decisions were taken to cool down the prices of the bulb. Due to lesser production of onion in the in Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of onion had spiked. While in majority of the wholesale markets, onion was trading above Rs 3,500 per quintal in most, cities retail customers were buying onion at Rs 60-70 per kg.Pawar, whose constituency encompasses the onion growing belt of Nashik pointed out how this decision of export ban would affect all onion growers in the country.Maharashtra alone accounts for 33 per cent of the onions produced in the country. This decision has caused great discontentment among them, she said.AdvertisingThe decision taken by the government in terms of onion prices comes even as Maharashtra and Haryana go to polls in the next 20 days.The BJP-Shiv Sena combine had swept the onion belt of Maharashtra in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and they hope to do the same during the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections. The governments decision has not gone down well with onion growers who had protested on Monday in Nashik."

In fact, in terms of the area under cultivation, India's onion acreage is higher than China's and constitutes almost 27% of the global acreage for onion cultivation. The US, which is not even in the top 10 onion producers, has a yield that's nearly four times that of India's.There are three sowing seasons for the onion crop in India  kharif, which is done between July-August with harvesting in October-December; late kharif, which is done between October-November with harvesting in January-March; and rabi, which is done between December-January, with harvesting between end of March-May. 65% of the onion production happens during the rabi sowing season and overall, 30% of the produce comes from Maharashtra.According to the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), it's the rabi crop which sustains the country's requirements from the time it's harvested till the festive season, in October-November, before the kharif and late kharif harvest kicks in. Being a semi-perishable crop, ""30-40% of the crop gets lost during the storage"" with losses going over 40% during natural calamities.As per the department of agriculture, cooperation and farmers welfare, India's current cold storage capacity for its total onion crop is a measly 2% of its total production  leaving 98% of its produce open to the vagaries of the elements.Between the price at which it's delivered at the wholesale market and the price at which it reaches the kitchen, the average Indian household ends up paying double or even more than double the wholesale price. In Delhi, for instance, which on Monday received 221 tonnes of onions, the retail price was hovering at Rs 60 per kg against the wholesale price of Rs 25 per kg while in Mumbai, which received more than 6,000 tonnes of onions on Monday, the wholesale and retail prices were Rs 32 per kg and Rs 60 per kg, respectively.Last year, a glut of onions caused prices to crash to Re 1 per kg in the wholesale market, with some farmers dumping the crop on roads in protest.The political fallout of rising onion prices has forced the government to adopt knee-jerk reactions  such as banning onion exports like it did this time. It did it earlier too, such as in 2010, 2014 and 2017. That however, puts at risk India's dependability as a reliable supplier of onions, especially considering that it was the largest exporter of onions in 2018, selling over 9.24 million tonnes."

And there won't be any meaningful drop in prices before summer-sown crops start to hit the market, said Ajit Shah, president of the Mumbai-based Onion Exporters' Association.That's not expected until mid-November, meaning the export ban isn't going away in the near term.""India could resume exports once prices drop, but it will take time,"" said Shah. ""Until India resumes exports, supplies will remain limited in Asia.""For now, consumers like Kathmandu shopper Pokharel are having to change habits across Asia.""I went to buy 5 kilogrammes of onions for our five-member family but ended up buying only 3 kilogrammes due to higher prices,"" said Afroza Mimi, a Dhaka housewife on a shopping expedition the day after India imposed the export ban.""They (traders) are selling old stock nearly at double the price.

The traders said that it was high time for the government to intervene in the retail market to bring the onion price down.Even on Tuesday, the price of onion ranged from Rs 60 to Rs 70 a kg in the retail market, while in the wholesale market the price ranged between Rs 37.5 a kg to Rs 40 a kg. Even two days ago, the onion prices in the wholesale market ranged between Rs 42.5 a kg and Rs 45 a kg.In the crisis, the retailers, an onion trade sources said, managed to maximise the profit. There is no reason that price of onion cannot be brought down to Rs 50 a kg and further below.

Our target is to import in the shortest possible time, said TCB spokesman Humayun Kabir.But the shipments from elsewhere  Iran and Turkey are also potential suppliers  that authorities in countries across the region are investigating will all take time.It takes one month when it comes from Egypt and about 25 days from China, while it takes only a few days from India, said Dhaka trader Idris.The need for alternative imports is so severe, though, that countries like Sri Lanka have already placed orders with Egypt and China, said G Rajendran, president of the Essential Food Commodities, Importers and Traders Association.Onion prices in Sri Lanka have risen by 50% in a week, to 280-300 Sri Lankan rupees ($1.7) per kilogramme.DOUBLE THE PRICEFor other countries, there may be little option but to sit tight and hope for the best.Malaysia, the second-biggest buyer of Indian onions, expects the ban to be temporary and sees no reason to panic, said Sim Tze Tzin, deputy minister of agriculture.But even India has been importing onions from Egypt in an effort to calm prices. And there wont be any meaningful drop in prices before summer-sown crops start to hit the market, said Ajit Shah, president of the Mumbai-based Onion Exporters Association.Thats not expected until mid-November, meaning the export ban isnt going away in the near term.India could resume exports once prices drop, but it will take time, said Shah. Until India resumes exports, supplies will remain limited in Asia.For now, consumers like Kathmandu shopper Pokharel are having to change habits across Asia.I went to buy 5 kilogrammes of onions for our five-member family but ended up buying only 3 kilogrammes due to higher prices, said Afroza Mimi, a Dhaka housewife on a shopping expedition the day after India imposed the export ban.AdvertisingThey (traders) are selling old stock nearly at double the price. This is crazy."

On Wednesday, the district administration raided shops in the city where onion was reportedly being hoarded. Three sellers were found guilty and fined a total of Rs 86,500.Acting on district magistrate BN Singhs orders, three shops at Harola Market in Sector 5 were raided by city magistrate Shailendra Kumar Mishra, members of the district mandi samiti and police. They were hoarding onions and were fined Rs 86,500, Mishra said. Two of the three shopkeepers were identified as Kaluram and Gaurav Kumar. Because of low supply, some centres are illegally stocking up on onions, which is aggravating the problem further, Mishra added.On the same day, the administration also fixed a fair price for onions, Rs 38 per kg, at six centres  Gautam Budh Nagar, Sector 88 and Ambedkar Nagar in Greater Noida , and Sector 45, Sector 11 and Bhangel in Noida. This was done after discussions with members of the district mandi samiti in Sector 88, the district administration fixed Rs 38 as the rate of onions per kg and Rs 3,800 per quintal for wholesalers. We had received a government order from UP Rajya Utpadan department, asking the district administration to take steps to control onion prices. Today, we took action on the basis of ground reports about hoarding, Mishra said.By Wednesday evening, prices in some areas came down further, to Rs 36 per kg. We managed to get prices down, with a rate of Rs 3,600 per quintal fixed in the mandi. We aim to bring prices down to a reasonable Rs 30 per kg soon, said Santosh Yadav, secretary of the district mandi parisar in Noida.Till September 22-23, prices had been below Rs 40 per kg. But over the past few days, onion prices have increased by Rs 30-40 per kg across the country."

This move was preceded by increased Minimum Export Price and introduction of stock limits on onions. A dip in production in the major onion growing states, Maharashtra and Karnataka, is said to be the cause of the price hike. In a press release, Anil Dhanwat, president of the Sanghatana, said the measures taken by the government have caused the wholesale rates of onion to crash from Rs 50 per kg to Rs 25 per kg.Since Maharashtra has prescribed a stock limit of 500 quintal for wholesale traders while the Uttar Pradesh government has prescribed a stock limit of 100 quintal, trucks sent from Maharashtra are impounded in Uttar Pradesh for no fault of theirs, the press release stated."

The data also shows that a sudden increase in prices does temporarily impact a retailers margins, but they soon adjust, though a fall in wholesale prices is transferred to the consumers after a considerable lag.TOI analysed daily wholesale and retail prices data collated by the Union consumer affairs department for September 2019. Between September 1 and September 5, the wholesale price of onions fell from Rs 20.75 to Rs 18 per kg in Delhi. During this time, the lowest price range for the month, Delhi retail prices ranged from 102% to 117% over the wholesale price.The mark-up was between 17% and 80% in Hyderabad, 20-70% in Chennai and 45-48% in Mumbai. For Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune and Bengaluru, it was under 30%.So what happens during a price surge? Between September 15 and 16, wholesale prices in Delhi increased by Rs 8.5 per kg. The average retail price for the first 15 days in September was Rs 40 per kg while the average retail mark-up over the wholesale price for this period was Rs 20 per kg. Because of the sudden increase in wholesale price, the retail mark-up fell to Rs 14 per kg for September 16 and 17. In two days, the increase in wholesale prices was transferred to consumers and the retail price went up to Rs 52 on September 18 from Rs 43 on September 15. For the next 13 days, the retail price averaged Rs 58 per kg, the mark-up averaging Rs 23 a kg, higher than in the period when prices were not this high.In Mumbai, the price surge happened between September 19 and September 21, when the wholesale price increased from Rs 33.5 to Rs 44.5 per kg. For the 13 days till September 21, for which both retail and wholesale price data is available for Mumbai, the retail price averaged Rs 41 per kg while the average retail markup was Rs 11.6 per kg. For the six days since then for which data is available, the average retail price was Rs 58 per kg and the mark-up was up to an average of Rs 18.5 per kg.Similarly, in Pune, the surge happened between September 19 and September 23, when wholesale prices reached Rs 36.33 from Rs 25 a kg. In the 19 days prior to and during the surge, the average retail price of onion was Rs 24.8 a kg and the mark-up averaged Rs 1.6 per kg. For the seven days after the surge for which data is available, the average price was up to Rs 38 a kg and the mark-up rose to an average of Rs 7.7 per kg.The other metros also exhibit a similar pattern. In Bengaluru, the wholesale price reached Rs 44 a kg on September 23 and fell to Rs 40 on September25. The retail price was reported at Rs 48 on September 21 and hasnt fallen since. Similarly, in Chennai, the wholesale price went up to Rs 35 on September 24 and has fallen to Rs 24 since September 26. The retail price on the other hand stabilised at Rs 37, which is higher than the pre-surge days. Hyderabad and Kolkata also had similar trends.Ahmedabad is the only metro where retail mark-ups have stayed at Rs 2 per kg throughout the month even as wholesale prices have risen. Whether this is linked to the citys relatively lower consumption of onion is a moot question.In Video: Delhi: Onions selling at double the wholesale rate"

This, according to the traders, will prevent hoarding of onions.The onion sold here mainly comes from Maharashtra. The Nagar onions from Maharashtra have a longer shelf life and are preferred by retailers here. However, the suppliers were not able to send adequate quantity to Kerala, citing that the flood in Maharashtra had affected onion production. The shortage in supply naturally resulted in a price hike, said Ernakulam Market Stall Owners president KK Ashraf.Monday, Wednesday and Friday are considered the market days in Ernakulam. Earlier, four big loads of onions used to reach Ernakulam on market days. However, the supply was reduced to two loads due to the shortage. As a result, the wholesale price of onion rose to Rs 53 per kg last week, while the retail price ranged between Rs 58 and Rs 60 per kg, he said.However, in the wake of the curbs, the wholesalers are now hesitant to stock the commodity. It will help prevent the hoarding of onion and check price hike. The low demand has now brought down the price. On Monday, the wholesale price of onion at Ernakulam Market was Rs 46, while the retail price was Rs 50, said Ashraf.Traders said they were buying a kilogram of onion for Rs 40 from Maharashtra. We have to pay an additional 8 per cent per kg as commission to brokers and as market fee. The transportation charge will come to around Rs 3,500 per tonne. As a result, we will be able to sell a kilogram of onion to wholesaler delears here for a minimum of Rs 46.20 only, said Nazeer, of National Traders, Ernakulam.He said another issue faced by the traders is the loss incurred due to the damage caused to the commodity during transportation. However, we believe the price of onion is likely to remain stable in the coming weeks, he said."

I say Rogan Josh.I have been to Kashmir several times, but the first was in 1970. We were too young to even realise that there was any sort of strife in the valley. Kashmir was this snow-clad land of plenty, with lakes, chinars, shikaras, house boats and rosy-cheeked people. The folks were all wrapped in warm woollen gowns called pherans and they all tucked away a kangri (an ember filled, earthen pot, encased in a small wicker basket with a handle) inside the layers of clothes to keep themselves toasty.In Srinagar, the Dal Lake shimmered in the early morning sunlight as wed wake up and huddle on the intricately carved wooden balcony of a houseboat, drinking steaming cups of kahwa (green tea infused in boiling water, with saffron, cinnamon, cardamom and Kashmiri rose petals), as ducks and drakes would float by looking for a peck. It was a land of apples and walnuts and slopes, which were ideal for skiing or singing a Shammi Kapoor song.Wed go back nearly every other year, visiting Pahalgam, which had carved wood houses, deep valleys, and clear water rivers. Gulmarg, nearly 4,000 metres above sea level, had knee deep snow throughout the year. Sonmarg was inaccessible in winter, otherwise called, Jannat. But then the 90s happened and we never went back.In early 2000, I did return to Srinagar and drove up to the border on the Baramulla Srinagar Bandipura Road, along the Jhelum River, all the way up to Gurez. When I returned to Srinagar after a couple of days, famished after having driven all night, I hit pay dirt. As my driver drove me into Srinagars Aali Kadal area of the old town area, a small queue had already started to form in the early hours of the morning outside what looked like a small house. It was foggy and freezing and the air was filled with the aromas of spices and cooking meat. This is where Ijaz Ahmed Bhat cooks what his forefathers have been cooking every morning for the last 150 years. Harrisa, or mutton kheema, slow cooked until it turns soft and pasty. The meat, along with a concentration of rice and spices, has been cooking for hours in a hole in the ground. It is served with a splash of flaming hot oil and Kashmiri rotis. For a meat lover this is like reaching the Promised Land. The meat is smoky and just melts in the mouth, and on its way around your palate leaves behind hints of saffron, garlic and saunf, with a piece of hot, finger indented, girda and noon chai (salt tea). Its a breakfast you come alive with.Harissa meals prepared by a cook and served in plates in Srinagar in 2018. ( Waseem Andrabi / Hindustan Times )Much has been said about the Kashmiri wazwan, which is a thaal full of meat. Cooked by a specialist cook called a Waza, this is an array of 36 dishes, including the valleys most exalted foods like rista (meatballs in an oily red Kashmir chilly gravy), lahabi kabab (mutton kababs cooked in yogurt), waza kokur (halved chicken, deep fried and cooked in saffron gravy), daeni phoul (mutton shank), doudha ras (mutton cooked in sweet milk) and rogan josh (mutton cooked in spices till the oil floats on top). There are several places in Srinagar which serve a decent Wazwan, but try finding good Kashmiri Pandit food. That proves quite a task.I was lucky to eat at the home of a friend, Uday Kaul and taste his mothers cooking. It was a simple meal in a simple house, one of the few remaining in the older parts of Srinagar. Sitting on a divan right in the middle of Udays mothers kitchen, we chatted while she cooked and spoke at the same time. The Kashmiri Pandits, like the Gaud Saraswats, are one of the few Brahmins who eat meat. The food is cooked without onion and garlic; these condiments are replaced by asafoetida to compensate. Paneer and curd also form a major part of their cooking.A hot flavourful Kashmiri kahwa is the classic way to unwind in the bitter cold. ( HT FILE )They say that the Pandits introduced the use of yoghurt, asafoetida and turmeric powder to Indian cuisine. If so, the meal was full of it. Like veth chaman. Chaman, meaning paneer in Kashmiri, is cooked in curd and with spices like saunth (dry ginger) and saunf (fennel). Or chaman qalian (a creamy paneer dish flavoured with cardamom and fennel), nadru yakhni (lotus stem in yogurt sauce), nadru palak (in spinach) and chok wagun (brinjal cooked in sour and spicy gravy with tamarind). And the piece de resistance: dum aloo. Nothing like the dum aloo you get in a restaurant in Mumbai. This is a dark red preparation, with whole baby double-fried potatoes. Theyre deep fried and then cooked in oil with dry ginger powder, aniseed powder, asafoetida and Kashmiri red chilli powder until the scarlet oil permeates the potatoes.We ate that whole meal sitting on the divan in the kitchen, the bright sunlight streaming in through the curtains on a chilly winter afternoon. After that meal, I spread myself across the mattress and stretched out to sleep. I lay there feeling satisfied, content and at peace. I hope the Kashmir too can someday soon descend into satisfaction, contentment and peace.First Published: Oct 04, 2019 21:56 IST"

Question is by how much?: Decision guide,"businessUpdated: Oct 04, 2019 08:17 ISTThe Reserve Bank of India is set to deliver a fifth straight interest rate cut Friday, although economists are unsure of the quantum following an unconventional 35 basis-point easing last time.While all 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect a reduction, their forecasts range from 20 basis points to 40 basis points. The RBI has lowered borrowing costs to a nine-year low of 5.4% through 110 basis points of easing so far in 2019.The meeting of the six-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Shaktikanta Das comes amid growing concerns about Indias banking and financial sector, and just weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi eased fiscal levers by announcing a surprise $20 billion tax break for companies.The policy decision will be announced at 11:45 a.m. in Mumbai, followed by a press conference 15 minutes later by Das. Heres a look at what else to watch out for:GrowthThe RBI has lowered its growth forecast for the current fiscal year three times already, with the latest revision in August pegging growth at 6.9%. Data since has shown gross domestic product expansion slowing to 5% in the June quarter, the weakest pace in six years. That may prompt the central bank to revisit the numbers once again.The latest growth numbers look much worse, Das said recently, referring to RBIs projection of 5.8% expansion in the April-June period. There is a slowdown, which was evident and at the last MPC we very clearly said that growth seems to be losing traction and therefore, growth is a matter of highest priority.InflationA recent spike in onion prices notwithstanding, headline inflation has stayed below the RBIs 4% medium-term target for 13 straight months.Food and beverage prices, which account for about half of the consumer price basket, have climbed on the back of a surge in urban food inflation. Das has said gains in food inflation are cyclical and there wont be much pressure on prices, given monsoon rains appear to be normal.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, has been decelerating amid subdued demand. That will give the central bank ample space to keep policy accommodative in the coming months.Financial StabilityIn the past few weeks, concerns about the financial sector have taken center-stage and the press conference is likely to be dominated by questions about the health of some lenders.The RBI recently imposed withdrawal curbs on a small bank and lending restrictions on another lender. That adds to the yearlong trouble brewing in Indias shadow banking sector where a default by a systemically important lender led to loan curbs and affected consumer spending.First Published: Oct 04, 2019 08:11 IST"

So I told my cook not to use onion in food. Prior notice of such decisions would help. Suddenly, you stopped and it became a difficulty for us. In future, if you are taking such a decision, prior information would help,"" she said.She was addressing the India-Bangladesh Business Forum here, which was organised by industry chambers, including CII and Assocham.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal was also present at the event.Last Sunday, India banned exports of onion to increase availability of the commodity in the domestic market and contain spiralling prices.The Centre has also imposed stock limits on both retail and wholesale traders for onion.Further talking to enhancing trade and investments between the two countries, she said huge potential exists in Bangladesh for the Indian business community in different sectors.She said that Bangladesh has the most liberal investment policy in South Asia, and it includes protection of foreign investment by law; generous tax holiday; concessionary duty on import of machinery; unrestricted exit policy; full repatriation of dividend and capital on exit, to name a few.""We are in the process of establishing 100 Special Economic Zones. About a dozen of them are ready with four allotments to three countries. Bangladesh has offered three zones for Indian investors at Mongla, Bheramara and Mirsarai.Substantial investment from Indian investors in these three Indian Economic Zones in Bangladesh would help broaden our exportable base.""We also want to see trade and investment together where Indian big investors can set up industries in Bangladesh and export the products to the north-eastern states of India and to South-east Asian countries taking advantage of the improved connectivity between us,"" Hasina said.The prime minister said that the strategic location of Bangladesh provides tremendous potential for being the economic hub of the region.With India on the west, China on the north and Southeast Asia on the east, Bangladesh is in the middle of a combined market of 4 billion people, she said, adding the volume of bilateral trade has steadily grown during the past years.""The balance of trade, however, is still largely in India's favour. The volume of trade between the two countries is nearly USD 10 billion. In 2018, Bangladesh was India's eighth largest export destination with USD 8. 8 billion export and our export to India also crossed USD 1 billion mark for the first time last year. So, the progress is visible, but there is a lot of scope for further deepening our relations in the area of trade and investment,"" she said.Goyal said that India businesses should grab opportunities in the neighbouring country.""There are so many areas where businesses of both the countries can increase cooperation. Grab the opportunity that Bangladesh offers,"" he said.Further, he said that a lot of potential exists in railways also and India is ready to share its expertise in the development of this sector in Bangladesh.India is looking to increase the frequency of three trains between the two countries, he added.Bandhan Express, which runs between Kolkata and Khulna once a week, would be increased to twice a week and later four days a week.Similarly, frequency of Maitree Express, which runs between Kolkata and Dhaka, would be increased to five days a week from the current four days a week and ""my effort will be to make it daily,"" he said.""We are looking at making entire railways between the countries a seamless movement for goods and people,"" he added.Commenting on the economic relations between the two countries, SAARC Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCI) Vikramjit Singh Sahney said that both the countries have huge potential to increase trade and investments.He said that the line of credit extended by India to Bangladesh should include fertiliser plants also and ""there is a need to open more chek posts and skill training centres to enhance capacity building""."

Give appam, shall eat, is my new mantra. Thats why, when I heard that a south Indian restaurant had opened up in Hauz Khas, my ears perked up. So last Sunday, I landed up there with family.Thalaivar, as the restaurant is called, is in the Hauz Khas Market. It was there earlier, on the first floor of the market, but has recently moved to its grand new premises on the ground floor of the small market. The chef is from Bengaluru, and his wife cheerfully helps diners navigate the menu. I could tell that some of the patrons that afternoon were regulars, while a few were walk-ins, who needed hand-holding.I knew what I wanted, of course: Appam, with Pepper Chicken (325). Along with that, we asked for Parottas and Roast Mutton (355), Mutton Keema Dosa (220) and Prawn Roast (325). The food is cooked fresh once ordered, so we knew we had to wait a bit for the mains to arrive. Meanwhile we had the prawns, which were crunchy and delicious. The masala  with curry leaves and chillies  was nice and spicy.Then came the main dishes. I concentrated on the appam, which I had with some of the Mutton Roast. The roast, in a thick curry, was delicious; the curry was wonderfully fragrant and had just the right balance of spices, and the meat was truly melt-in-mouth. I savoured the flavour of the pepper in the gravy, and the mild sweetness of fried onions. I then tried out half a parotta with the Pepper Chicken. The chicken, which was essentially small boneless pieces in mildly hot gravy  was tender, and the gravy went well with the crispy and flaky Parottas. I ended my meal with a last bite of the Appam and the Mutton Roast, wiping the last of the gravy with a piece of the soft appam, and popping it happily into my mouth.The Keema Dosa, I am sorry to say, left us all cold. The keema was alright  cooked as it should have been  but somehow the batter of the dosa was a bit too sweet, which didnt work well with the minced meat.But the other dishes were simply superb. For breakfast (the place opens at 11 a.m.), it offers a host of dishes including Egg Appam (110) and Masala Ham Egg Appam (150). Then they have Idlis with Kori Ghassi (265) and Mysore Masala Dosa (160). The helpings are good, and our table of four had a nice meal. Did I say four? Sorry, one among us was on a Navratri fast, and merely had some cold coffee.Thalaivar is a pleasant and sunny place, with a helpful and smiling staff. The walls are covered with some cheerful portraits of Thalaivar  aka Rajinikanth. We had a good time  uncle, aunt, niece and nephew. Fast notwithstanding.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Apart from this, half the members of market committees will be women.The process of their appointment will be completed by the end of October. The State government has provided 50 per cent reservation to SC, ST, and OBCs in the market committees.The Chief Minister also decided to constitute a committee to look into the losses in district co-operative banks and undertake a study by a prestigious organisation on the ways of strengthening the banks.He instructed officials to digitize primary agriculture co-operative committees records and complete the task within a specified deadline.Jagan Mohan Reddy, during a review of marketing and cooperative departments, said, The cooperative banks should be able to decide the prices during cultivation of crops.On the issue of remunerative prices to lentils, pulses, tomato and cotton crops, he said that farmers should not be compelled to sell their produce to middlemen.Ensure that the middlemen system is eradicated completely, the Chief Minister instructed the officials.The government is also planning to announce prices of those crops that have no minimum support price (MSP). The prices will be notified at village secretariats and farmers can complain to agricultural assistants for necessary action if they fail to get MSP, Agriculture Minister K Kanna Babu told reporters after the meeting.Calling for the transformation of Rayalaseema region into a millet hub, the Chief Minister asked the officials concerned to set up a millet board by the end of October.The proposed board will take care of marketing and devise agricultural practices to be adopted by farmers for higher millet productivity in the region.Jagan Mohan Reddy enquired about onion stocks in the State in view of spiralling prices.Officials told the Chief Minister that till now 660 metric tonnes of onions have been imported from other States. This helped in bringing down the onion price to `32 per kg, they said.The Chief Minister also told the officials to help tomato farmers get remunerative price for their produce through market intervention and creating awareness among ryots about marketing opportunities in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu."

Maine cook ko bol diya ab se khana mein pyaaz bandh kardo (I do not know why you stopped exporting onions to us, I have instructed my cook to stop using the vegetable in our cooking),"" Hasina said at an investor summit here, with a wry smile.The barb was meant for Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal who was present at the function and had in a knee jerk reaction to rising domestic prices, banned exports.""Pyaaz mein thoda dikkat ho gaya hamare liye. (Onions have created a problem for us),"" the Prime Minister said, with an understated humour.India, the world's biggest seller of the tuber, banned export of onion last week after an extended monsoon delayed harvests leading to shriveled supplies and runaway prices. India sold some 2.2 million tones of onions in the international market in 2018.The result of India's ban was that prices of onions have shot up from Taka 30 (Rs 25.16) a kg to more than Taka 100 (Rs 83.86) a kg in Dhaka.Bangladesh has frantically tried to ship in onion supplies from Egypt and China but delivery will take three weeks to one month, a Bangladeshi diplomat complained.Also Read: Cabbage, potato all set to replace onions, say hoteliers in KovaiOnion is a politically sensitive vegetable in the entire sub-continent. While India's export ban was meant to check rising prices at home, it has also created a political headache for its neighbor.""Some notice (about the ban) would have been nice,"" Hasina said, adding with a smile, ""It was stopped so suddenly that it has become difficult. The next time you decide to do something like this... some advance notice would be nice.""Indian exporters say that Malaysia another importer of Indian onions is facing a similar problem.""In international trade such bans create problems, as our market is taken away by others as buyers see us as unreliable. The better way out would have been to fix a minimum export price to discourage excessive exports,"" said Vikram Sahney, a commodities trader."

Rings of soldiers and police guarded the presidential palace in downtown Quito, where another march was planned for later on Friday.By Friday morning, 350 people had been arrested, mainly in Quito and Guayaquil, the Interior Ministry said. Looting was reported in Guayaquil.Authorities say 28 police officers have been hurt, a dozen police cars destroyed, and a local government building attacked.Truck drivers leader Luis Vizcaino called for dialogue with the government. All Ecuadors transport sectors are in crisis  We have to reach a halfway measure, he said. Taxi union leader Jorge Calderon was among those detained.Diesel prices have risen from $1.03 to $2.30 per gallon, while gasoline went from $1.85 to $2.39.Moreno said he was open to talks but there was no possibility of restoring fuel subsidies that he said had damaged the economy and cost state coffers $60 billion over the years.There will be mechanisms to ease the impact on some sectors, he said. But listen clearly: I am not going to change the measure, the subsidy is finished, no more loafing.Food prices riseEcuador hopes to save about $1.5 billion a year from ending fuel subsidies. Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27 billion.The government has also been laying off some state workers.It wants to reduce the fiscal deficit from an estimated $3.6 billion this year to under $1 billion in 2020.Ecuador also plans to leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2020 to pump more oil and raise revenue.National debt grew under Correa, who endorsed Moreno in 2017 but now calls him a traitor.Morenos government has improved relations with the West and reached its three-year, $4.2 billion loan deal with the IMF in February, dependent on structural measures including raising tax revenue and bolstering central bank independence.The deal allowed Ecuador to receive an immediate disbursement of $652 million and paved the way for an additional $6 billion in loans from other multilateral institutions.But skepticism of the IMF runs strong throughout Latin America, where many blame its conditions for personal hardships.Shopkeepers lamented the disruption to business from the protests, while prices were creeping up in markets.AdvertisingPotatoes and onions are more expensive. The authorities need to sort this out, people are taking advantage of the situation, said housewife Matilde Ordoez, 43, in Guayaquil."

Vendors attribute the price rise to low inflow of onions to Koraput markets in the last one month.Demand for non-vegetarian items are usually high during festive days and last year, the demand was 50 per cent more than normal days. However, this time people are reluctant to buy meat and fish due to price rise of onions. Almost all non-vegetarian preparations require onions. While a kg of fish is available for `120, onions are selling at `60. So instead of one kg of fish, I am purchasing only half kg, said Anil Patnaik, a local.Vendors are worried about the low sale as business is going to further decline during the month of Kartika."

The reason: this festive season, a kg of garlic costs Rs 232, while peeled garlic costs Rs 267 per kg. Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HoPComs) officials said that while good quality garlic is usually quite expensive, now, even low-quality garlic is no less than Rs 120 per kg.B N Prasad, MD, HOPCOMS, told TNIE the price of garlic has been steadily increasing in the last one-and-a-half months. Even the price of onion did not rise this much. Earlier, in Bengaluru, the price never crossed Rs 80 in the retail market, he said.The costs of some kitchen staples, such as onion, garlic and ginger, have been on the higher side of late. However, the prices of both potatoes and tomatoes are stable now. According to HOPCOMS, a kg of onion costs Rs 54, potato Rs 29, ginger Rs 200 and tomato Rs 34.Prasad said that garlic is not grown much in Karnataka, and is imported from Madhya Pradesh. He also added that the price of onions, which was high till the end of September, has now started to drop. This is because onions are grown in Karnataka, and the price will only drop further in the coming days. To ensure that potato prices are stable, potatoes coming in from Agra are being stored in cold storage units, and its the Hassan crops that are being released in the market.In the case of other vegetables, HOPCOMS said that in general, prices are on the higher side for the last two weeks or so, and have not come down yet. Officials maintained that the price rise has nothing to do with the festival season, as it is assumed, but actually due to continuous rainfall.Unprecedented rainfall in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and in the outskirts of Bengaluru (Ramanagara, Anekal, Chikkaballapur, Doddaballapur and other areas) is the reason behind the price rise, Prasad said.Ashraf U F, a vegetable vendor in Indiranagar, said that during festival season, vendors tend to make a little more profit.Vegetables are a daily necessity, and during festive season, prices hike by about Rs 5 or Rs 10. Though it is not a big amount, it is sufficient for us, he said.Beulah amma, another vegetable vendor at Halasuru market, said that she has been getting 30-50 customers per day for the past one week, and has been able to make enough money to get through the festival season.We make a profit of Rs 100-Rs 200 per day during the festival season, unlike other days. However, this year, since it has been raining, we have also lost a few customers, as they prefer to shop in big retail shops, she said."

Thousands come for goddess Durga standing majestically in her beautiful avatar.With the population of four lakh Bengalis in the city, different communities and groups come forward to put in their efforts to bring the best idols created at Kumartuli, West Bengal which are then given final touch by the local artisans after they are brought in to Hyderabad. Thats how Hyderabad Bengalee Samity (HBS) in its 78th year of Durga Puja is continuing its legacy of being the oldest puja in the city bringing magnificent deities to the pandal erected at Domalguda in the premises of Ramakrishna Math. Says the general secretary Sumit Sen, We have been getting the best artisans to get the idol done. This year we havent kept any special theme for the decor. But theres an array of interesting cultural programmes in the evening by women and children.Bangiya Sanskritik Sangha (BSS) which hosts the grand Durga Puja at Keyes High School, Secunderabad is in its 54th year. The decor of the goddess is created from shola, a milk-white cork spongy wood, which grows in the marshy areas of west Bengal, informs Atin Chaudhuri of BSS. The spacious grounds of the school has food stalls selling delights not just from Bengal from kulfi from Ajmer as well which goes really well after a plate of fish cutlets with mustard sauce or the famous Calcutta Kathi Kebab rolls with crunchy rings of onion, green chillies, grilled chicken chunks with a dash of lime and pepper wrapped in paratha which opens layer by layer. At Attapur Bengali Association (ABA) the devi wears a large shola crown with intricate paisley work and around her the trimmings of the alcove is almost lace-like in the same white shola.At the same time Bengalis In Hyderabad (BIH) are all set today for Pujo Parikrama in the city ready with three buses.

A government source said this would give a touch of prasada to the food.The previous Congress government implemented Indira Canteen project with the aim of providing affordable food to the poor. But following complaints of corruption, quality issues and lack of transparency in audit, the current BJP government ordered a probe.Now, the government is contemplating entrusting management of these canteens to organisations linked to Dharmasthala, Horanadu (Annaporneshwari) temple, or ISKCON, among other options. With this, more people will consume Indira Canteen food as they will think it is prasada from temple. Now, because of its low quality, not many people are availing its benefits and cooked food is being wasted, a source said.Interestingly, while the Indira Canteen project was in the planning stage, there was a proposal to entrust it to ISKCON. However, this did not come to pass and one of the reasons was that ISKCON did not use onion or garlic in its food on the basis that they were not satwik ingredients."
2019-10-06,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/sheikh-hasina-modi-meeting-delhi-dhaka-6056781/,Good going,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas visit to Delhi over the weekend highlights the deepening bilateral relationship with Dhaka and also its important structural consequence  growing interdependence with Bangladesh. Indias foreign policy can claim great success for the former  relations with Bangladesh have never been as good as they are today. They are also the best when viewed in comparison with our other neighbours. But Indias economic policy makers can be rather insensitive to the logic of interdependence. Hasinas visit saw agreements on expanding connectivity and transit, easing travel across the border, strengthening trade and investment ties, boosting development cooperation, putting the fledgling defence cooperation on a firmer basis and promoting regional cooperation. Even as Delhi celebrates the golden age in the relationship with Dhaka, however, it must heed some important warning signs.AdvertisingThat Hasina publicly complained, albeit in a light hearted manner, about the impact of Indias recent move to ban onion exports on her kitchen, underlines the headaches in the neighbourhood that Delhis economic decisions generate. Hasina was not objecting to the decision itself that has produced immediate onion shortages in Bangladesh. She was pointing to its sudden and unilateral nature. If Delhi had informed Dhaka in advance, Hasina said, her government could have made alternative arrangements for onion import. The problem goes deeper and reveals a lingering autarkic and anti-market orientation in Delhis economic policy even as Indias national strategy calls for regional integration. For example, governments in Delhi, both Congress and BJP-led ones, have long resisted export of cattle to Bangladesh where beef is a staple. In doing so, Delhi has created an incentive for cattle-smuggling across the border. Few in government had anticipated that the demonetisation of the Indian rupee at the end of 2016 might have consequences for Nepal and Bhutan that are so tied into the Indian economy. As India rises and integrates with Bangladesh, that is now one of the worlds fastest growing economies, Delhi must get its economic bureaucrats to integrate the regional dimension into their national policy thinking.Beyond onions, Hasina was also channeling growing anxiety in Bangladesh at Indias implementation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam and the threats at the highest level about throwing foreigners (read Bengali Muslims) from the state. Given the deep political trust between PM Hasina and PM Narendra Modi, the problem appears to be under control. But the situation could easily get out of hand, become a major controversy in Dhakas domestic politics, severely constraining Hasinas positive approach to India. The problem in Assam is part of the tragic legacy of the Subcontinents partition in 1947 and the movement of people across the new frontiers in the east since then. As two strong leaders focused on problem-solving, Modi and Hasina must try and develop a long-term joint strategy that will facilitate national identification and generate a system of work-permits for legitimate movement of labour. Todays digital technologies offer solutions to difficult political problems that Delhi and Dhaka have inherited from the past. The markets demand it."
2019-10-07,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centres-steps-help-to-cool-off-onion-prices/article29612144.ece,Centre’s steps help to cool off onion prices,"Onion prices in Delhi have dropped below the 60 a kg mark in the retail market for the first time in two weeks, as the Central governments measures, imposing stock limits and banning exports, took effect, cooling off the prices in most parts of the country.Onion producers, however, have called an agitation from on October 7, with one farmers group threatening a strike if the export ban is not lifted. Maharashtra, a major producer, is heading to the Assembly election this month.According to data from the National Horticultural Board, retail prices for the vegetable in the capital dropped to 55 a kg over the weekend, the first dip since September, when it rose to 65 a kg. In fact, many Delhi consumers were buying onions for 80 a kg in late September, while the price shot up to 100 in Hyderabad.Caused by floodsThe spike was the result of floods in several producer States, causing supply disruptions, exacerbated by hoarding and blackmarketeering.Central government agencies injected cheaper onions into the market from a 50,000-tonne buffer stock and encouraged States to do so. When the prices continued to rise, the Centre imposed stock limits on traders and slapped a ban on exports last Sunday, despite concerns about the repercussions for farmers.The Shetkari Sanghatana has called a strike by onion farmers from Monday, complaining that wholesale prices have crashed since the governments decision. The bigger worry, however, is about the impact on the crop that is yet to be harvested.Right now, no one has onions to sell anyway. They are selling the last of the winter crop, said Maharashtra farmer leader and former MP Raju Shetti. But in 15 days, the kharif [summer] crop will come in. Then if you dont allow export, it will have to be sold in the local market, which will get flooded with cheap onions. Farmers will face huge losses. Why should they be penalised? he said, noting that an inconsistent export policy could also have long-term consequences, disrupting relations with foreign buyers."
2019-10-07,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-switch-in-time/article29614462.ece,A switch in time,"A university canteen where plastic glasses have given way to paper ones; a majority of customers bringing cloth bags to a local vegetable market; a garden where people are standing outside and eating their namkeen in plastic packets before entering  these are scenes from different parts of Delhi where single-use plastic (SUP) has been banned. There is another thread that connects them all: the demand for viable alternatives.The Hindu visited Jamia Millia Islamia in south Delhi, the vegetable market of Tagore Garden, Dilli Haat at INA and Garden of Five Senses in South Delhi, where the SUP ban has been imposed in varying degrees by different authorities.Interestingly, almost all of the two dozen people interviewed, from daily wage workers to academics said that plastic should be banned, for reasons varying from the protection of cows to preventing urban flooding.Despite the demand for alternatives, people and traders were adapting to the changing scenario. Experts said that the government should work on alternatives as the current ones are expensive and not affordable for people from low-income groups.Tagore Garden marketOn an October afternoon, as Rajat Gupta, 50, a vegetable seller, handed over onions in a brown paper bag to a customer, the thin bag broke and the onions fell on the ground and rolled off.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on September 23 had declared Tagore Gardens fruit and vegetable market plastic-free and the vendors in the market are not allowed to use plastic bags. None of the 15-odd shops in the market were found handing customers items in plastic bags. Multiple vendors said that about 50% customers were now bringing their own cloth bags, but there are implementation problems.Showing a white non-woven bag, Gupta said, There are many problems. I got these bags instead of plastic ones, but the officials are now saying that we cannot use this as they also contain plastic.He said he charges 20 for a cloth bag, but few people buy them. The bags Gupta showed, which is commonly used as an alternative for plastic bags, though resembling cloth bags, is made of polypropylene.Consumers mistake it for an alternative to plastic, but it is made from polypropylene. It is non-recyclable and should be banned, said Swati Singh Sambyal, programme manager at Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi.Loan a bagBalbir Singh, 55, a resident of Vishnu Garden, was on his way back after giving his car for servicing when he saw the market and remembered that he had to buy vegetables. But there was one problem: he did not have a cloth bag with him. When I told the shopkeeper that I dont have a bag, he said that I can take a cloth bag for 20 and when I return it, he will give me the money back, Mr. Singh said.The shopkeeper, Vinod Kumar, 31, from Bihar, was selling two alternatives for plastic bags, a large cloth bag for 40 and a smaller one for 15. But if someone shows up without a bag, Kumar loans them the bags for 50 and 20.I sell about 20 of these bags in a day and about 10 of them come back, he said.The shopkeepers said that the government had distributed free cloth bags for just two days to customers when the ban started and said that such initiatives should continue.We had distributed bags sponsored by local businessmen for free, but do not plan to distribute more. We have helped the vendors procure bags at a cheap rate, said Rajiv Jain, superintending engineer of SDMC.The market is not free of plastic as some customers are still coming with plastic bags. The SDMC has declared eight such markets as plastic-free.Cloth bags for 2Meanwhile, the North Delhi Municipal Council has opened Saksham Eco Mart at Kautilya Marg, where cloth bags are sold for as low as 5. Also, if you give your old clothes at the outlet, our workers will stitch cloth bags for you at 2-3, said R.P. Gupta, Director (Education) of North DMC.The outlet near Chanakyapuri police station also sells kulhad (earthenware) and will soon have alternatives for plastic cutlery at lower than market prices.Jamia Millia IslamiaFrom October 2, the university has banned single-use plastic items such as bottles, cups, glasses, polythene bags, plastic cutlery, straws, and items made from styrofoam among others and imposed a fine of 500 on violators. At the canteen, plastic cups have been replaced by paper cups and no one was found using plastic bags. But students were found using plastic bottles and it was available in the canteen too.Students said they support the ban. Asif Raham, an engineering student at JMI, said, We dont have much plastic pollution here in Jamia. It is good that the ban has been imposed finally. Plastic contains chemicals that can cause cancer.But not everyone is happy. Thirty-two-year old Mohammad Faraz Khan, owner of Castro Canteen, said that he immediately threw all his older stock of single-use plastics like straw and glasses when the university administration announced the ban on plastic items. We faced the brunt of this decision as we had a huge stock of single-use plastic glasses, spoons and straws. I dumped the whole stock, said Mr. Khan.They didnt provide alternatives. We are arranging on our own. We now have to think of alternatives but they will be costlier. This sudden ban will create a new industry for paper and jute, but it will take time to produce huge quantities of glasses and straws. There should have been proper planning. It doesnt work like this, where you wake up and realise that a ban has been imposed on a certain product, he said. It takes time to find alternatives and strike new deals, he added.Another canteen owner, on the condition of anonymity, said that plastic still exists on campus. The ban is only on bottles below 200 ml. Water bottles and soft drinks above 200 ml can be used and sold to students and the staff. Also, plastic packaging materials were found lying around in at least three canteens.Other placesOn October 2, the Delhi government had banned single-use plastic at all three Dilli Haats and the Garden of Five Senses in Saket. At the Dilli Haat and Garden of Five Senses, people were not allowed to carry even chips or biscuits that came in plastic wrappers, but they were not provided paper bags to carry them.Though at the Dilli Haats there was a cupboard which doubled up as a cloak room in which visitors could leave their plastic water bottles, there was no such facility at the garden  people were allowed to carry water bottles by October 2 afternoon as there were no alternatives.Ready for the ban?The bans in Delhi are a welcome step, but we are not at the stage for a countrywide ban. We need to do a lot of homework before it, said Ms. Sambyal.First, we need to have a clear definition for SUP, things that are found at dump sites, drains and that create problems. And then we have to create a plan to phase them out, she added.She said that there are currently no viable alternatives for some SUP. We can clearly get rid of styrofoam and plastic cutlery, but there is no viable alternative for plastic packaging material.The expert also stressed on the need for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).Producers should be held responsible for picking up and management of plastic waste. Currently we dont have a proper EPR for plastic. EPR guidelines are needed.Meanwhile, the Delhi government is in the process of notifying bylaws under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. These entail fines for not disposing of SUP properly, but theres no ban on them, officials said."

2019-10-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/maharashtra-dip-in-kharif-acreage-likely-to-bring-up-onion-prices-again-6056960/,Maharashtra: Dip in kharif acreage likely to bring up onion prices again,"A dip in kharif acreage of onion may result in another spell of price rise in the days to come. Agriculture department officials said that late onset of monsoon has resulted in reduced sowing, which would be difficult to bridge over given the hawkish attitude of the government towards higher onion prices.AdvertisingBy the end of August, Maharashtra had reported sowing over 41,005.95 hectares for kharif onions, which is way below the target area of 70,000 hectares. Last year, farmers in Maharashtra had reported sowing over 97,221 hectares. Similarly, late kharif sowing this year till date is around 15,039 hectares. Depending on the time of transplantation and harvest, onion growers in the state classify their crop as kharif (May- July transplant and harvesting in October- November), late kharif (September- November transplant and harvest post January) and rabi (December- January transplant and harvest post April). These three crops feed the market round the year.Onion prices have sky rocketed across the country right at the start of the election season in Maharashtra and Haryana. A dip in the rabi production in Maharashtra and other parts of the country, especially Karnataka, has resulted in the price rise, which had seen the central government taking a slew of measures. Post increase of the Minimum Export Price (MEP), and bringing about a stock limit for the bulb for both retail and wholesale traders  the government had also banned exports of onion. All these measures were taken to check the price rise in the wholesale markets.At Lasalagons wholesale market, average traded price of the onion, which had peaked at Rs 4,700 per quintal, has come down by around Rs 2,000 per quintal. This has caused much resentment among farmers, who are quick to point out how they were plagued by low prices over the last year or so.AdvertisingThe ban on exports had seen over 200 trucks carrying onions to Bangladesh being held up at the border. Dr Bharti Pawar, BJP MP from Dindori in Nashik, had issued a press statement saying the trucks were released after the intervention of Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.Onion prices might be down, but market sources do not rule out a further price rise in the days to come. Besides the delayed monsoon, in parts of Nashik, the transplanted crop was lost due to heavy rain that lashed the area in the past two months. These two factors, sources said, would result in another shortage in the day to come. At present, majority of the onions that are coming in the market are the stored rabi crop."

One man died in central Azuay province when roadblocks blocked an ambulance from reaching him after he was hit by a car, authorities said. Local media identified him as a protester, but that could not be confirmed.AdvertisingEcuadoreans complain consumer prices have risen sharply as a knock-on effect of Morenos abolition of fuel subsidies, which has also triggered the nations worst unrest in more than a decade. Everyones raising prices with the excuse of the gasoline price rise, disgruntled pensioner Camilo Salazar, 65, said at a food market in the coastal city of Guayaquil, where prices have risen by up to a third in just a few days.The government said 20 people were detained over the weekend for over-charging for products including corn, onions, carrots and potatoes, which are all subject to price controls. There is no justification for raising the prices, Interior Minister Maria Romo said in a statement.Ecuadors dollarized economy had inflation of just 0.27 percent in 2018. After a two-day strike by transport unions, indigenous groups have taken the lead in demonstrations against Morenos economic measures. They barricaded roads in various places again on Sunday with burning tires, branches and rocks.AdvertisingSome protesters threw stones at security forces, who responded with tear gas. The CONAIE umbrella indigenous group published a video showing spear-wielding inhabitants blocking a road and shouting Down with the government! The 66-year-old Moreno won the 2017 election and has set the oil-producing nation on a centrist track after years of socialist rule under predecessor Rafael Correa.STATE OF EMERGENCYMoreno has declared a two-month state of emergency. Though he enjoys the support of businessmen and the military, Morenos popularity has sunk to under 30%  compared with 70% after his election  and Ecuador has a volatile history.Indigenous-led protests toppled three presidents in the decade before Correa took power in 2007. Witnesses said that in Lasso, south of the capital Quito, indigenous groups captured and took away several soldiers after violent confrontations. Struggling with a large foreign debt and fiscal deficit, Quito this year reached a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund that requires belt-tightening economic reforms.As well as ending fuel subsidies, the government is reducing the state workforce and planning some privatizations. Moreno says the fuel subsidies, in place for four decades, had distorted the economy and cost $60 billion. Though transport unions stopped their action after being allowed to raise fares, other sectors have called a national strike for Wednesday.Moreno, who uses a wheelchair after a 1998 shooting during a robbery that left him paraplegic, has refused to overturn the fuel measure but said the government will increase benefits for the poor to compensate its impact.Ecuador hopes to save about $1.5 billion a year from ending fuel subsidies. Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27 billion annually.Correa, who lives in Belgium, calls Moreno, his one-time protg and vice-president, a traitor."

Already onions are selling for Rs 50. The normal average cost of each is Rs 20-25.Prices are expected to remain high till November 3-4, engulfing the state's assembly election which is due October 21.Traders blame excess, unseasonal rainfall in Maharashtra for short supply. Meanwhile, households are struggling to pay Rs 120-140 for a kilo of both staple items. Most are purchasing small quantities in the hope that rates will reduce shortly.In Matunga , one of the costliest markets in Mumbai, tomato was sold for an exorbitant Rs 70-80 per kg on Tuesday. Two vendors, Manoj Vegetables and Rahul Chopde, blamed short supply for the increase. In Pali Market, Bandra, Lallu's vegetable shop sold it for Rs 80 and the same rate was levied in Byculla Market. Opera House sellers charged Rs 75. In Andheri Lokhandwala the rate was Rs 50-60 while Khar Market, Walkeshwar and Mulund sold tomato for Rs 60.Wholesaler Mangal Gupta of APMC Vashi said, ""Monday's wholesale price was Rs 650 for 20 kg (or Rs 32. 50 per kilo). Fifteen days ago, tomato was reasonably priced, in fact rates were low, but due to unseasonal heavy rain in growing areas, the crop has been affected. Also a rise in demand due to the festive season has caused prices to increase. Rates will reduce by 25% next week and will normalise a week after Diwali .""This implies that Mumbaikars will have to endure high rates for approximately another month since Diwali falls October 27.Households are constrained from preparing gravy items, most of which require onion and tomato. ""Whichever political party forms the government, it seems unable to control this periodic rise. Even after onion export has been banned, it continues to cost Rs 50. We are again experimenting curd recipes for gravies or settling for dry vegetables with dal,"" said Kamaljeet Kaur, a resident of Manish Nagar, Andheri.Kaur's husband has deposited all his money in the neighbouring PMC Bank which is under lockdown. This price rise has constrained their budget further.Families which cook meat on a routine basis find themselves hemmed in on either side. In Byculla, Naseem Shaikh purchased a half kilo ""to get buy for two days"". ""Non-vegetarian preparations require both onion and tomato. Through the past two months we were burdened by the price of onions, now since four days tomato is also getting out of hand. We cannot possibly find a substitute for two staple ingredients."""

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal directed that at least one mobile van should be provided in each ward and that the food and civil supplies department should intensify enforcement activities by making regular field inspections to check instances of hoarding, black-marketing, and profiteering.According to the government, enforcement teams will also check the implementation of stock limits prescribed for onions, and violators may be strictly proceeded against as per the provisions of law.Since September 28, 2019, after the government stepped in to supply subsidised onions, prices of onion in the retail and wholesale markets have remained under check.Increase in the prices of onion has become a political issue in the national capital, and the BJP has been attacking the AAP government for not taking any action against people who, according to the saffron party, are hoarding onions and are allegedly close to the current establishment. According to the government, 400 shops are selling onions, which currently cost Rs 60-70 per kg."

We also, like other people, buy them from the vegetable market only as we don't require much stock and sell these further. What do the residents expect?

2019-10-09,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2019/oct/09/whats-trending-this-diwali-2045023.html,What’s trending this Diwali,"By Express News ServiceDussehra is over and now its time for Diwali. This festival of lights usually establishes the trends that dominate the festive season. To help us decipher whats in vogue, we ask few prominent fashion designers.Veerali Raveshia believes that versatile separates is the seasons trend; that can be dressed up or down to suit the occasion. Its like buying multiple dresses in one. Also, classic sari is a good investment since it can be worn in multiple ways. Have fun with the drape over a lehenga, high-waist pants or team it up with a well-structured blouse, the designer advises.For her, the perfect ensemble is a combination of a beautiful Bandhani or handwoven Banarasi dupatta in classic colours, over a staple ivory, beige or red kurta.Echoing Raveshia is Gautam Gupta, who believes that a nice elegant sari and a smart blouse can complete any festive season. Also, kurtas with dhotis, pleated lower and skirts are also in great demand. The wardrobe essentials include Banarasi saris, Bandhani kurtas, golden skirts, and a golden blouse along with a full-length Anarkali, adds Gupta, who recommends munga georgette, organza, silk, Matka slik, chanderi silk and linen silk in sea green, mint green, lemon yellow, maroon red, sliver mink, metallic grey and onion pink.For Vandana Malhotra, its a neon-hued outfits, jewellery or footwear. Brides(to be) have started coming to me with lots of requirement for their bridal trousseau with heaving neon touch lehenga, embroidery on lighter base, beads with neon colours.For the ones who enjoy a little twist, Vidhi Verma suggests power shoulders and exaggerated sleeves. They are going to do magic this festive season. Fabrics like crushed lycra, sheer shimmer, fabric surfacing with patchwork and hand paint are floating this season. Colours like grey, black, yellow gold, emerald, lilac champagne and ivory are totally in.Ashima Sharma of Ashima S Couture suggests a mix of western and traditional wear. One can opt for crop tops or buttoned western blouse with lehenga skirt. Its often seen that people also wear a buttoned blouse of the western style to pair and make it a proper fusion wear. Women have made style statements with ruffles over time and the latest innovation is the ruffled lehenga skirt with a matching blouse is a head-turner style statement, concludes Sharma."

We are also supporting it. We demand the government withdraw both, said Hansraj Wadghule, a local leader of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana.The supply situation has changed quite a bit. There is very little onion left with farmers from the previous harvesting season. Excess rainfall and an extended monsoon have led to massive crop damage, said Jaydatta Holkar, Chairman, Agricultural Produced Market Committee (APMC), Lasalgaon.He also stated that the crop quality arriving in the market was poor, hence onion prices are going up. There is very little opportunity for further price hike from the current level.Meanwhile, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, while addressing a poll rally at Balapur near the east Maharashtra city of Akola, accused the BJP-led Central and Maharashtra governments of not being concerned about the plight of farmers, whom he appealed to defeat the ruling party in the October 21 Assembly elections.Pawar noted that the agrarian crisis had deepened in the state during the past five years. He alleged only 31 per cent farmers benefited from the state governments farm loan waiver scheme.He also said that he had taken bold decisions for the benefit of farmers while in power.We had decided against import of Onions even while the prices in retain markets soared. The then opposition leaders came to us with garlands of onion. But, we didnt budge. We acted in favour of farmers, Pawar said."
2019-10-09,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/oct/09/the-crying-of-a-dog-was-an-omen-2044827.html,‘The crying of a dog was an omen’,"By Express News ServiceBENGALURU: The dog continued to sit with its head turned towards the sky; its eerie moaning cut across the wind, now for three days on...time and again. Its howl was a complaint to both God and Allah. Umabens head began a rapid tattoo. She knew the crying of a dog was an omen for bad things, but how much worse could things possibly be? For the last three days, an earthquake had unsettled Umabens entire spirit, shaken her flesh and bones. She knew it was impossible to escape the pain of that.She got up to open the box of rotis. A small stale piece of bhakri was left. She took it in her palm, crossed the otla and pushed the heavy wooden door to reach the street. She advanced towards Kalu, the dog who sat right in the centre of the street. All around, the road was strewn with stones and bricks, shards of glass, iron rods, bicycle chains. On the left, slightly far away, Fakirbhais bandhej shop still spouted a thin thread of smoke. By the footpath, three wooden carts had overturned their wares: apples, bananas, radish, tomatoes and cucumbers were lying scattered on the street.Tabrezs cart, from which he sold besan fritters, was upturned too: a group of flies hummed over a stash of rotting onions and chillies coated with flour. All around, burnt and putrefying smells made their way upwards. The smell of dried blood mingled with them and created invisible ropeways to hell. Umaben felt nausea grip her throat at the overpowering odour. Her three- day empty stomach churned in revulsion. She had stepped out of her home after three long days.Slowly, she tiptoed through the debris strewn on the road, picking her way with care. Kalu was sitting at the crossing. Umaben called out as she waved the bhakri at him. Kalu looked at her and turned away. Umaben moved forward and said: Roti, jomle baap. Eat the bread. But the dog showed no interest. She noticed some pieces of bread strewn about the road; some others must have tried to dissuade the creature from howling. Umaben looked at the dog: its head on the ground, Kalu lay supine, ignoring her. A sigh escaped her throat: Ha Bhagwan! Oh my God!On her left, a small group of people talked in a murmur. A few policemen stood nearby, looking at her. One of them waved his hand, gesturing at her to leave. Kalu began crying again. Umabens heart leapt up win fear. Day before yesterday, the men had poured petrol over Fakirbhai and had burnt him alive. There was not a soul in the neighbourhood who had dared to intervene. Fakirbhai used to tell her, Ben, even God is afraid of the poor and the naked.He was fearless about his poverty, but he did not know that someone who was feared by God could become a target for Satan. Umaben turned away from the crossing and walked like a robot to the small shop that was once owned by Fakirbhai. It had no signboard now. She pushed open the door to the small room. Kalu came running and stopped in front of the open door.It then turned back once again to go back to its old place. Umaben went in with slow steps; the floor was covered in rush mats. On it lay a piece of white silk cloth. Numerous threads were tied on it and on the other side were marks of a design made with pencil. Nearby stood three big aluminum pans filled with blackish water. Umaben suddenly had the sensation of someone standing at her back. She turned and saw that a policeman had entered the room.Excerpted from the short story Bandhni by Sunanda Bhattacharya, from the book Womens Writings from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, edited by Rakhshanda Jalil and Debjani Sengupta, with permission from Bloomsbury India."

The soaring prices of tomatoes come just weeks after the retail cost of onions shot up to 60-80 per kg.According to traders at the Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, tomatoes have become costlier in the last few days as supplies have been impacted. Some southern states such as Karnataka and Telangana as well as some hilly states witnessed unexpected rains. This damaged the crops and as a result created a supply disruption, said a trader and a member of the Azadpur Tomato Merchants Association on condition of anonymity.At Mother Dairys Safal outlets, tomatoes are being sold at 58 per kg, while local vendors are selling between 60 and 80 per kg on Wednesday, depending on the quality and locality.As per the central government data, the average retail price of tomato in Delhi increased to 54 per kg on Wednesday from 45 per kg on November 1.Meanwhile, price of onions in retail markets in Delhi has come down to below 60 per kg due to increase in supply of the bulb by the central government through cooperatives Nafed, NCCF and Mother Dairy. These cooperatives are selling onions at a cheaper rate of 23.90 per kg. These agencies are selling onions from the buffer stock maintained by the central government.Out of 56,700 tonnes of onion stored as buffer stock, 18,000 tonnes have been offloaded in different markets, including Delhi.However, the price is still on the higher side in the retail market, retailers said.First Published: Oct 09, 2019 23:46 IST"
2019-10-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-fear-of-action-on-violation-of-stock-limit-hikes-onion-prices-6061973/,Maharashtra: Fear of action on violation of stock limit hikes onion prices,"Not withstanding the slew of measures to control it, onion prices across wholesale markets in Maharashtra are on the rise. Average trading prices, which dipped by over Rs 1,000 per quintal, have since bounced back in the last fortnight. Trade sources said this price rise was mostly due to reduced purchase by traders, who fear action if they violated the 500-quintal-per-day stock limit put on them.AdvertisingOn Wednesday, the average traded price of the bulb at Lasalgaons wholesale market in Niphad taluka of Nashik district was Rs 3,551 per quintal with only 2,850 quintals of the bulb arriving in the market.Prices have jumped by over Rs 850 per quintal from the level of Rs 2,700 recorded in this market on October 3. Trade sources did not rule out further price escalation.Since September, onion prices have followed a sinusoidal pattern with prices dipping in view of repeated government intervention. At Lasalgaon market, the average traded prices had touched the years high of Rs 4,500 per quintal on September 19, as the effects of drought resulted in lower arrivals in Maharashtra and Karnataka.AdvertisingAlarmed over the spike in prices just on the eve of the Assembly election, the central government had swung into action to control the prices. When measures such as importing 2,000 tonnes of onions and slapping a steep minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne did not seem to have the desired effect, the central government on September 29 took the unusual decision to completely ban exports.Explained: Economics and politics  why govt has banned export of onionsAlso, the government prescribed the limits of onions that traders, wholesale as well as retail, can hold. Wholesalers were allowed to hold 500 quintals while retail traders were expected to hold 100 quintals  all measures to stop hoarding.While prices have come down a day or two after the measures were announced, a steady increase is being noticed that government officials said was a direct backlash of the stock limit imposed.Traders have stopped buying fearing action  this message has percolated down to farmers, who are not bringing in their stored produce, said a senior government official, on the condition of anonymity.Traders, said the official, normally bought in bulk in anticipation of demand and sent the produce to different markets in the country.Normally, it takes around two days for onions procured from wholesale markets to leave the traders premises after operations such as sorting, packing among others. At present, most traders are playing it safe and have substantially reduced their buying spree to avoid any violation of stock limits.The dip in arrivals is also a clear indication that the stock limit has failed to have its desired effected. At Lasalgaon market, arrivals have dipped from the average levels of 10,00 quintals per day before the imposition of stock limit to levels of 1,000 to 2,000 quintals per day.Also read | India banned onion exports.

And that was exactly what entrepreneur Mohammed Faiz had in mind when he opened a restaurant in the city.I have a large gang of friends and we always missed the ambience of the iconic Indian Coffee House (ICH) next to University College, where we used to meet for nourishment for body and soul. After ICH was demolished, we didnt have another place like that to hang out and meet friends over a cuppa, says Faiz.Keen on opening such a place that would cater to all age groups and serve wholesome food, the self-taught chef and gourmand conceptualised Buttons and Brews. Initially, it opened with a takeaway counter with an interesting mix of ethnic eats and short eats such as pazham pori, vada, vettu cake, different kinds of cutlets, spring rolls and teas. In addition to the ubiquitous milky tea, lime tea and kattan are much in demand. Soon, stone benches scattered around the tiny garden around the takeaway was filled with students from colleges and coaching classes in the neighbourhood.Buttons & Brews | Photo Credit: S MahinshaEach snack here is made by us. We dont outsource anything and no leftovers are refrigerated for the next day, says Dubai-based Noorja Sayam, Faizs sister, who supervises the kitchen in his absence. She explains that the recipes for everything served at their place was perfected by Faiz. But the cakes, chocolate-layered cake and saffron milk cake, are all mine and I bake them myself, she adds.Buttons & Brews Location: Opposite AKG Centre, Palayam-Airport RoadHits: The teas, King fish grill, saffron cakeMisses: Fish cutlets at the takeaway, cookiesMeal for two: Costs about  1,000 with tea, grills and dessert. The teas cost between 100 and 350.0471-2470047Showing the open kitchen next to the takeaway, she says all are welcome to step into the kitchen to check out whats cooking. While the takeaway became a popular haunt, the interiors of the vintage bungalow was renovated by Shiraz Bava N. In September, the aesthetically done-up tea lounge and boutique opened its doors. Pristine white walls have a dash of green with plants placed on the walls in wooden planters while pen-and-ink drawings of familiar buildings such as the Secretariat, Napiers Museum and Public Library capture vignettes of the city.Cutlets at Buttons & Brews | Photo Credit: S MahinshaA chance meeting with a Sri Lankan tea estate owner motivated me to open the tea lounge, perhaps the first in the city known for its ardent fans of tea in many avatars. But this one will serve a different cup of tea altogether with its range of prime flavoured teas and curated menu. Although most Malayalis enjoy tea with milk, most of the teas served here are green teas and the flavour would be killed if we were to add milk, says Faiz.A fruit tea served in a French press has a lovely aroma of fruits, flowers and, of course, the welcoming fragrance of tea! A tiny sand clock with coloured sand is kept on the table to indicate the time to filter the tea into your cup. A plate of cookies comes with the tea. Although the cookies somehow miss the mark with its floury taste, the tea is a heart-warming brew to savour.On the menu are jasmine tea, lemon-orange tea, hibiscus tea, herbal teas, fruit-based teas, premium white and gold teas. A retail space for prime tea has a staggering range of the flavoured teas. However, that is not functional yet.While I am sipping the fruity treat, two plump chunks of king fish coated with sesame seeds arrive on the table. My recipe, says Faiz. Cooked to perfection, the king fish comes with a white sauce, freshly-made salsa and a mound of mildly spiced fragrant rice. As I take time to relish every bit of the fish, Faiz insists on giving us a taste of the coconut infused cassava (a.k.a kappa) served with onion chutney and the salsa. Buttery soft and cooked in coconut milk, the cassava is a treat that should not be overlooked for the more exotic items on the menu.Grilled chicken at Buttons & Brews | Photo Credit: S MahinshaWhile the availability of fish will decide the seafood served at the lounge, the rest of the dishes such as chicken grill, chicken omelettes, salads, soups, and chicken and fish cutlets will be constants. Breakfast has appams and stews, vegetarian and non-vegetarian on the menu. Buttons and Brews also takes up catering and their biriyani, according to Noorja, is much in demand.I round off the meal with a generous slice of saffron milk cake that is suffused with the goodness of saffron. As I step out into the dusk, the takeaway is filled with legislators, activists and students, their conversation fuelled by glasses of tea and pazham pori.It is open from 8 am to 10 pm."
2019-10-11,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-polls-will-vidarbha-support-bjp-sena-again/story-e7zxwmNPcfbluLDoykipnN.html,Maharashtra Assembly Election 2019: Will dry Vidarbha again support BJP-Shiv Se...,"assembly-electionsUpdated: Oct 11, 2019 08:55 ISTIn the 2014 Assembly elections, Vidarbha played an important role in making the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) the single-largest party, with 44 of the total seats 62 seats from the region. Its resurgence was attributed to the resentment among farmers, anti-incumbency against the Congress-NCP government, irrigation scam, caste combination and statehood for Vidarbha.In return, the party gave heavy representation to the region, with six ministers, including chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. The subsequent local polls also saw the party doing well here.The BJP-Sena alliance, however, could not repeat the clean sweep of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in the 2019 general polls. BJP heavyweight and Union minister Hansraj Ahir lost to Congresss Suresh Dhanorkar by a margin of 11,000 votes in Chandrapur. Sena MP Anandrao Adsul lost to Congress-NCP supported candidate Navneet Rana in Amravati. Is this an indication that all is not well for the saffron combine in Vidarbha?GROUND REALITYAfter five years of the BJP-Sena rule in Maharashtra, people in Vidarbha are not excited about the ruling parties. Farmers are grappling with agrarian crisis, with drought aggravating it. Farm loan waiver should have brought relief to farmers, but they are not happy with the implementation. Non-repayment of farm loans has made a large number of farmers ineligible for more borrowing. There have been questions over implementation of the Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver scheme, as thousands of farmers could not get its benefit. The agrarian community is still not getting proper remuneration for their produce. The probe into the irrigation scam is yet to be completed. There has not been significant improvement in the industries and employment.Vijay Jawandhia, Vidarbha-based agriculture expert, said farmers are more disappointed with the BJP government, as their hopes were really high in 2014.At least 80% of the agricultural land in the region comes under rainfed areas and the crop production was badly impacted owing to drought and deficient rainfall. The government has done nothing to mitigate it. The help from the loan waiver scheme launched in 2017 is yet to reach farmers. Now, the banks are asking for two years interest on the loan amount, making farmers ineligible for fresh loans, Jawandhia said.Chandrakant Wankhede, another agriculture expert from the region, said the rising number of farmer suicides in the past five years is a clear indication that farmers are frustrated and disheartened.They have not got 50% more than the cost of production. The government hasnt stopped the rising input cost. In contrast, whenever there is any rise in commodity prices such as sugar and onion, the government intervenes and adopts certain measures, he said.This year till August, the state has recorded 1,799 cases of farmer suicides. Of them, 822 are from Vidarbha alone. Last year till August end, 1,715 cases of farmer suicides were registered across the state. Of them, 808 were from Vidarbha region.Vidarbha is also known for rampant caste politics. In many of its constituencies, it is caste and not merit, which plays major role in deciding a candidates fate. The outcome of many seats in the region will be decided by how Kunbi-Maratha, Teli and some other communities vote. The minority community, too, can influence the outcome. Nagpur, the capital of the region, also happens to be the home turf of the chief minister. The headquarters of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideologue of the BJP, is also situated there.THE CONTESTWill the Opposition take advantage of this?Senior BJP leader and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar insisted they have done more than the erstwhile Congress and NCP in 15 years.People can see the development in the past five years. From building new roads to completing long-pending irrigation projects such as Bhembla in Yavatmal district, we have changed the reality of Vidarbha. In education sector, we have succeeded in bringing Symbiosis Institute, a law university and Indian Institute of Information Technology in Nagpur. Special subsidy in power tariff to industries in Vidarbha has helped the sector grow, he said.He also said the BJP-Sena alliance will do better than 2014. This time, the BJP is contesting 50 seats and Shiv Sena 12 seats in the region.On the other hand, the Congress and NCP have also joined hands to contest the Assembly elections and are fighting as a joint force.In 2014, both the parties contested on their own, which led to drubbing in the Assembly elections that cost them 17 seats. Both the parties could win a meagre 11 seats (Congress 10 and NCP 1).The Congress had considerable presence in Vidarbha and was enjoying good support of the people a decade ago. In 2009, it was considered as an emerging force as the Congress won 24 seats (three more than 2004), but in 2014, the party strength came down to 10 seats. (NCP has won four seats in 2009).In this election, the Congress is contesting 47 seats and NCP 14 seats, whereas in one seat  Aheri of Gadchiroli district  both the parties are contesting against each other. The Congress has fielded former MLA Deepak Atram and NCP has pitted former minister Dharmarao Atram. Both are contesting against sitting BJP MLA and former minister Ambarishraje Atram, who is also Dharmaraos nephew.Although the Congress is hoping for a revival in its old bastion, it has already lost an MLA Gopaldas Agrawal, who defected to BJP in the run-up to the polls. He was a three-term MLA from Gondia.Senior Congress leaders said the Fadnavis government fell flat on its poll promises. Starting from separate Vidarbha to double income for farmers, the BJP failed to bring change in the lives of people despite being in government both in the state and at Centre, said Manikrao Thakre, former state Congress president, who hails from Yavatmal district of the region.Raising the issue of Article 370 in Maharashtra polls clearly indicates the government has nothing to show, Thakre said, adding, The economy of Vidarbha is based on agriculture, but farmers here are in big trouble. There is unrest against this government especially in rural areas.With their drastic moves such as demonetisation and GST, industries in the region too have been hit. Many industries in the MIDC area have shut down in the past five years. Now, recession has doubled their trouble, people are losing jobs leading to more unemployment. They are also not talking about separate Vidarbha, he said.In response, Mungantiwar said they have never left the statehood issue and are waiting for an appropriate time. Our stand is always clear. The day we get majority in the state Assembly, we will come out with a proposal for separate Vidarbha, he said.CHANGE IN PERCEPTION?Vidarbha was considered neglected during the erstwhile Congress-NCP government owing to irrigation backlog, providing less funds for completing pending irrigation projects compared to other regions of the state, especially western Maharashtra, load shedding and poor infrastructure.Has the BJP government succeeded in doing away with the perception?Political experts say the state BJP government could have done better to resolve major issues of the region.The government would have performed better than what it has done so far. It could have done extraordinary work on issues such as farmer suicide, irrigation potential or Maoism. It has failed to bring any significant change, said Shailesh Pande, editor of a Marathi daily.However, this time, the BJP will contest the elections on Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a national hero and development. In contrast, the Congress and NCP have no plank. The Congress and NCP leaders are already labelled as non-performers, as they didnt do anything in the past 15 years. They have also failed to create a narrative which can be used to counter the aggressive propaganda of the government and BJP, he said.First Published: Oct 11, 2019 00:19 IST"

The success of these crops is largely determined by the June-September monsoon, which delivers about 70% of the country's annual rainfall.The monsoon is also critical for the wider economy. Farming makes up about 15% of the $2.5 trillion economy and employs more than half of the country's 1.3 billion people.While crops in the ground have been damaged by the monsoon, the rains have replenished reservoirs and ground water reserves, which augurs well for India's rural economy in 2020.What went wrong with this monsoon?A prolonged dry spell resulted in significantly below-average rainfall at the start of the season, prompting farmers to delay the sowing of summer crops and leaving others wilting.By the end of July, rainfall was so heavy that rivers flooded and crops were damaged.The combination of a prolonged dry spell followed by heavy rainfall increased pest infestation and disease, forcing farmers to spend more on pesticides.Which crops are affected?Soybean, rice, cotton, sugarcane, pulses and vegetables have been hardest hit.Soybean, India's main summer-sown oilseed, was particularly damaged as Madhya Pradesh - India's top grower of the crop - received rainfall 44% above average. The heavy rains stunted the flowering of the plant, which in turn reduced the pods it yielded.Sugarcane in many districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka - the second- and third-biggest producers in India, respectively - were flooded in the first week of August. This is expected to result in India's lowest sugar output in three years, industry officials say.Maturing cotton in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the country's top producers, was damaged by heavy rains in September.Rice was affected by excessive rains in southern and western India, as well as low rainfall in the top producing eastern state of West Bengal.Vegetables such as tomatoes and onions went rotten due to heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.How could erratic rainfall affect India's trade of farm commodities?Given the damage to the soybean crop, the world's biggest importer of edible oils could be forced to increase imports of palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil in 2019/20 marketing year starting from November 1.Cotton supplies from new season crops are likely to be delayed by two to three weeks, in turn delaying exports.Imports of pulses, especially pigeon peas, green and black gram, are likely to rise due to lower production.The dry spell helped the spread of the fall armyworm pest, which damaged corn and will potentially push New Delhi to import the grain to contain pressure on local prices.India, the world's biggest onion exporter, has banned overseas sales, forcing prices in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka to double.What are the prospects for winter-sown crops?Above-average monsoon rain has brightened the prospects for winter crops like wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas.For years, millions of farmers have been unable to plant winter crops because weak rainfall had reduced moisture levels in the ground.But following the heavy rains in September, moisture levels are adequate, and most reservoir levels are well-above their 10-year averages.India could harvest a record wheat crop in 2020 and production from winter-sown rice is expected to jump, analysts said. But that could also create excess rice and wheat supplies at a time when India has been struggling to encourage exports because local prices are higher than global benchmarks.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

And Ive often wondered how the story of butter chicken is always connected with the story of Partition Whether you delve into the history of Partition survivor Kundan Lal Gujral and Moti Mahal, who have a strong claim that butter chicken was their invention, or read about buddies Iqbal Singh Ghai and Purshottam Lal Lamba, who, soon after Partition started the Kwality chain of restaurants, and popularised their version of murg makhanwalla, from Kolkata to London. Or Gaylord, which further refined the taste of this smoky chicken with tomato and cream gravy at from 1946 to 1957, when there was a Gaylord Indian Restaurant in Delhi, Bombay, London, Japan, Chicago and New York. Or later on, in 1972, when yet another migrant from Pakistan, JK Kapur decided to invite superstar Dilip Kumar to inaugurate his new restaurant venture Copper Chimney at Worli, serving amongst other delicacies a real robust chicken makhanwala.Back in the day, going to Copper Chimney was an occasion. Copper Chimney was a posh, carpeted eatery, with circular, brick-lined windows (an architectural feature of the Happy Home building, where it was housed) and old copper vessels hanging on the walls. The tables were clustered under a canopied ceiling, and covered in crisply starched tablecloths, German silver cutlery and huge metal goblets for water. I still get a sense memory of ice-cold water in those metal goblets, which got instantly chilled, the pickled onion and achaar on the table and, of course the taste of their butter chicken.The restaurant had an iconic feature, the show window, through which you could watch the choreography of their chefs. Behind the glass, smoke rising as rumali rotis were tossed, naans were patted and kababs were fired on long skewers by tall-hatted Ustaads. The word copper was highlighted by the huge copper tandoors that were in plain sight behind the glass. Today so familiar is the show kitchen that no Copper Chimney outlet can be designed without it.It wasnt easy to get a table at Copper Chimney; even then, in the late 70s and 80s, there was always a queue outside of eager customers waiting for previous diners to relinquish their tables. You entered Copper Chimney and the aroma of tandoori food was unmistakable. The restaurant buzzed, conversations were loud, laughter resounded and the clink of metal and china was the sound of people having a jolly good time. Later on the 90s, the restaurant shifted a couple of buildings away to a newly built property, iconic in its own right because the Lotus Cinema Theatre had once stood right by there. By now of course Copper Chimney had opened an outlet at Kala Ghoda and another one at Bandra, revised its menu, and kept up with life. But the Worli branch always remained special.The Balochistan-influenced kalmi kababs (drumsticks of chicken marinated for over six hours in cream and aromatic spices and then gently cooked in the tandoor) are among the classics that made Copper Chimney famous.I dined there a few days ago. That place too has been renovated and the menu had been rejigged. But to my surprise, they had reprised some dishes from the past that only people from my vintage will remember. I plunged into ordering some of the food that I grew up eating at the original Copper Chimney in the late 70s and 80s. Starting with the Balochistan-influenced kalmi kababs. Drumsticks of chicken marinated for over six hours in cream and aromatic spices and then gently cooked in the tandoor. Along with that, a portion of the mutton burrah chop, three ribs of mutton, with a chunk of meat at the end, in a dark red/brown masala, well charred over coal. The earthy tasting, murg achaari tikka, soft and tender pieces of chicken marinated in Punjabi pickle spices and then placed in the tandoor. Lahore-influenced bagani bahar, chargrilled chicken legs in a mint and yogurt marinade. All this with an oversized Kabuli naan. As the word suggests, the naan comes sprinkled with every conceivable dry-fruit, maraschino and nut. Its a sweet and smoky bread that goes so well with spicy gravies.For mains, soft and silken paneer masala and Benaras malai kofta, balls of cottage cheese and cream with nuts cooked in an exquisite sauce. Chicken Patiala, a truly Anglo-Indian dish. Boneless chicken cooked in white smooth-silken gravy, subtly flavoured with spices and garnished with slices of boiled egg and cheese. Then we ordered some mushroom kheema. I dont think anyone had put mushrooms, kheema, chopped vegetables and spices together before. Add to that ghost badami and Kabuli ghost, mild gravies, one cooked in almond paste and the other in Afghan spices. And finally the mutton chello kabab. Chunks of smoky meat, laid on a bed of the creamiest rice with yoghurt. A super hit item from the saga of Copper Chimney. But how could I not order the chicken makhanwala. A dish I have consumed gallons of over the last 30-odd years and whose taste remained steadfast till today.First Published: Oct 11, 2019 21:37 IST"

The two-day event will be held on Friday and Saturday. The entire coastal town has been decked up to receive the dignitaries and heavy security has been deployed.Roads leading to the town have been renovated, new sign boards erected, and overgrown tree branches trimmed.

The empty overhead water tank installed at the entrance of Mamallapuram has also been painted.Schools, offices closedSome schools and colleges along the route  city airport to Mamallapuram  have declared holiday or half day on Friday, owing to traffic diversions. A matriculation school at Kotturpuram has informed parents to pick up their wards after the first half of the day, while a private school near Guduvanchery has declared Friday as holiday. Offices located on the OMR have issued special advisories to their employees in view of the summit. Many companies, especially the ones located in Sholinganallur, Tidel Park and Ramanujan IT Park, have given their employees an option of working from home.Lower courts adjournedBased on a request from the city police, lower courts in Chennai have adjourned cases till Saturday, as policemen arent available to escort remand prisoners to court. However, where extension of remand is necessary, prison superintendent has been told to conduct the proceedings through video-conferencing.Security tightenedA Chinese national and two students from Ladakh and Arunachal were picked up by the city police on Thursday. They were released later after obtaining written statements. A 27-year-old man from China, who got down from a private bus near Rohini theatre was secured by police personnel on patrol. He was taken to the CMBT police station.Inquiries revealed that he reached Bengaluru from Guangdong in China and came to Chennai for his professional work, said a police officer.No facilities for copsPersonnel deployed on security duty had to make do with limited amenities available. Cops have been given accommodation at community and marriage halls, and at private colleges. But they do not have access to proper toilet facilities, causing hardship.What will Xi eat?The Chinese premier is bringing with him a team of personal chefs, according to sources at the ITC Grand Chola, where he will be staying. The details, for security reasons, are fairly hush-hush. All ingredients for the Presidents meals during his stay will be brought by the team from China.ALSO WATCH | Modi-Xi summit: Mahabalipuram gets a makeover but not everyone is thrilledIts, hence, unlikely that he will be indulging in South Indian delicacies such as dosa or filter coffee.

A standard meal of the President looks like this: Pork and onion buns, stewed pork liver and a generous serving of greens. This was the presidents exact order at a local restaurant, much to the delight of staff and fellow diners, when he stepped out unannounced for a meal last year"

But for some powerful inmates, Bengalurus Parappana Agrahara jail is no prison! It is just another den where they lead a life of luxury and run their outside operations with ease, revealed police officers who have frequently raided prisons only to findthings unchanged.According to confirmed sources, a mafia of sorts operates inside the prison with each department having a boss who sells or supplies mobile phones, ganja, beer, whiskey, SIM cards, knives etc. Most of the luxury items are supplied inside the prisons definitely with the nexus of prison staff. Nothing can happen without their knowledge, said a retired prison officer.There are various ways of sneaking in stuff into the prisons. A former convict told TNIE that mobile phones have repeatedly come through vegetable and meat-carrying vehicles and also through inmates who go to court in the escort vehicle.There is an understanding among the staff who come for escort duties and also those under-trial prisoners who go to court regularly. Mobile phones are given to the convicts who will be in-charge near the gates. They in turn pass it on to the boss, a former prisoner told TNIE on condition of anonymity.Code wordsIt is interesting to know that every transaction that happens has a code word, said the convict who spoke to TNIE. Reportedly there are several signals provided when the maal (stuff) is scheduled to enter the prisons. At every step there are people assigned for the same. Once the job is done, each department boss hands over the cash to the convict who did the job, he said.According to sources, the code word for mobile phone is box; liquor is water or neeru; knife is onion or eerulli; ganja is hoge (smoke).Recently, after repeated reporting of incidents of smuggling of mobile phones and drugs into the prison using vegetable and meat carrying vehicles, entry of all vehicles carrying daily food supplies was banned.The vehicles were stopped at the entrance and small trolleys were used to collect goods and transfer it to their factories and store rooms inside. However, that doesnt work, said a retired prison official.According to the officer, bosses inside the prison make more money each time there is a raid.There are designated places and people whose job is only to ensure that their maal is safe. Of them are even senior jail staff. Transactions runs in lakhs too at times, said sources. ""If there is really a decent raid, then officers will definitely find cash of at least Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh with the prisoners,"" said an official.According to the ex-convict, the cash is usually kept in the library, kitchen, soap factory etc.. After the so-called raids, the rates of cigarattes increases from Rs 25 to Rs 200-Rs 300 for one cigarette. One beedi then becomes Rs 100, the ex-convict said. The ganja which comes from Kerala costs up to Rs 6,000.There is a huge finance operations too. There are people who lend money for an interest of Rs 200 per week for an amount of Rs 1,000."

And taking centre stage is Beed district from where Rural Development Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pankaja Munde is set for a close contest against her uncles son Dhananjay Munde from Parli Assembly constituency. In 2014, Ms. Munde, eldest daughter of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, had defeated her estranged cousin by almost 26,000 votes.While in Parli seat, the fight pits cousins, in neighbouring Beed an uncle is set to take on his nephew. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has fielded Sandeep Kshirsagar against his uncle and State Minister for Employment Guarantee Jaydutt Kshirsagar, who is an import into the Shiv Sena from the NCP.This contest too, like several others, is a battle to decide who will carry forward the family legacy, said Aniruddha Joshi, a local social worker whose work is focussed on water conservation and agriculture.The voters here have become used to a herd mentality, observed Mr. Joshi. They follow a family for generations. It is from an unknown fear that new candidates do not come forward to fight the elections here. Therefore, tickets are distributed usually between the same families for years on end. It is the worst form of dynastic politics, he opined.In neighbouring Gevrai, the BJPs Laxman Pawar is now pitted against Amarsinh Pandit, whose uncle Badam Rao was defeated by Mr. Pawar in 2014. Mr. Amarsinh and Mr. Pawar too are distant cousins. I voted for lotus [the BJPs symbol] last time around and would repeat the same sign irrespective of the water shortage and lack of infrastructure in this region, said local onion vendor Sheikh Mohammad. I cannot trust a new candidate, he adds.Latur district too is witnessing a family fight with the Congress fielding Ashok Nilangekar, who is locked in a close contest with his late brother Dilip Nilangekars son and BJP candidate Sambhajirao Patil-Nilangekar.Both Beed and Latur districts have been the worst affected by drought in the past decade. While Beed has been receiving water through private tankers, Latur is importing water from across the States border by rail. Experts have even warned of desertification of the parched Marathwada region in the near future.The severity of the drought notwithstanding, Mr. Munde said local election campaigning did tend to bank on emotions related to family ties. If our fathers and forefathers have been great leaders of this land, what is the harm if we invoke them every now and then. We have to respect their legacy, and peoples sentiments towards them, he added."

A Bloomberg survey ahead of a report due later Monday showed consumer prices probably rose 3.8% in September from a year ago -- the highest since July 2018.Prices of onions, as well as tomatoes, soared in September after heavy monsoon rains damaged crops and reduced supplies. With high prices of the kitchen staples known to have contributed to bringing down past governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modis administration banned onion exports and cracked down on hoarding to keep a lid on costs.Economists see no such threat to the central banks accommodative monetary policy stance, which paved the way for 135 basis points of easing so far this year, given persisting weakness in the economy. Data Friday showed factory output declined for the first time in more than two years in August amid waning demand overall.Wholesale price inflation in September eased to 0.33%, the weakest pace in more than three years, data showed Monday. While prices of manufactured products and fuel and lighting declined, food inflation was at 7.47%. Wholesale onion prices more than doubled, according to data.Surplus rainfall suggests a record summer harvest is likely, and that should keep food inflation low in the year ahead, according to Bloomberg Economics Abhishek Gupta.Cost of onions rose to as high as 80 rupees ($1.13) a kilogram in September from 20 rupees to 25 rupees the previous two months. Tomato prices in New Delhi have more than doubled to 60 rupees to 70 rupees per kilogram in the past weeks.Consequently, we expect the spike in onion prices to contribute about 30 basis points to headline inflation, said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai.Food Inflation to Rise Sharply in SeptemberOnions have a weight of 0.6% in the overall inflation basket and contribute about 10% to the vegetable basket.The inflation-targeting Reserve Bank of India expects food prices to stabilize while forecasting headline inflation to stay well below its medium-term target of 4% for the rest of the fiscal year through March.Besides, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, is likely to show that demand pressures are still rather weak. That should keep alive expectations of more rate cuts by the RBI in the coming months.Bloomberg Economicss Gupta expects core inflation to ease for a number of reasons.These include companies reducing prices to pass on the benefit of recent tax cuts to consumers, lower tax rates on consumer goods and services, an increase in the supply of affordable housing, a wider output gap, a sharp drop in crude oil prices, and strong favourable base effects during the October-to-December months, he said."

Congress","MUMBAI: The Congress on Monday hit out at the BJP for harping on scrapping of Article 370 in poll rallies, saying the ruling party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were deflecting attention from issues concerning common people like economic slowdown, price rise and unemployment.Top BJP leaders, including Modi and party president Amit Shah , have been repeatedly speaking about abrogation of provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in their rallies in poll-bound Maharashtra and Haryana.Modi has challenged the Congress to publicly state it will restore the controversial constitutional provision, which granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir, if voted to power.Addressing a press meet here, AICC spokesman Jaiveer Shergill said instead of asking the Congress whether it will restore the now scrapped Article 370, Modi should talk about reducing the prices of petrol, diesel, onion and tomato whose rate has crossed Rs 70 a kg in retail market.Shergill said the prime minister should come to the rescue of harried depositors of scam-hit PMC Bank and also took a jibe at Modi over his 56-inch chest remark.""The Congress will speak about Article 370 during the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.""But, if the prime minister really has a 56-inch chest, he should work to reduce the prices of petrol, diesel, onion and tomato, and also hand over the money of lakhs of depositors of PMC Bank,"" he said.The Congress spokesman accused the prime minister of always being in campaign mode instead of focusing on governance.Speaking at the press meet, AICC general secretary R P N Singh said for the government to find solutions to the economic slowdown and growing unemployment, it has to first acknowledge these problems.""Accept the problem before you find solutions. Instead a senior minister like Ravishankar Prasad says three Hindi movies had become blockbusters and hence there was no recession,"" he said.Singh said industrial output, manufacturing growth rate and investment have seen a decline while unemployment was at all-time high.In BJP-ruled Maharashtra, between 2014 and 2018-19, 220 factories had shutdown. Thousands of industrial units in Pune, an automobile hub, were on verge of closure, the former Congress minister said.But, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Modi have no answers to these problems, Singh said.""PMC Bank directors have BJP links and hence Fadnavis has not uttered a word about the bank's collapse. If the Modi government can take Rs 1.76 lakh crore from RBI (reserves) using its majority, can't it ask the RBI to return money to PMC Bank depositors?"" the Congress leader asked.Singh said the BJP governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra have weakened Mumbai's position as the economic capital by shifting the proposed International Finance Centre, conceived by the UPA government, to another state.""Similarly, there was no progress on the Shivaji and Ambedkar memorial projects (in Mumbai),"" he said."

The high retail inflation could limit the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) ability to further cut policy rates.Data separately released by the industry department on Monday, however, showed that wholesale price inflation decelerated to a three-year low at 0.33% in September compared with 1.08% a month ago, as prices of manufactured items entered the deflationary territory, signalling the lack of pricing power of producers in the current economic downturn.Inflation for manufactured items stood at -0.42% in September as against 0% a month ago. The WPI inflation rate declined in September despite onion prices rising 122% from a year ago. The government has banned exports of onions and put stock limits on traders to cool prices.The spike in retail inflation is a blip and should correct going ahead, said Crisil Ltds chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi. Overall, food inflation could remain high this year even as core inflation declines. That should improve terms of trade for the farmers, he said.However, many economists said the rise in retail inflation may impact the rate cut cycle of RBI. The decline in core inflation provides some comfort, but the unexpectedly sharp jump in the September CPI inflation has pushed up the likelihood of a pause in the next MPC review, unless the headline retail inflation recedes sharply in this month, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra Ltd.The question is whether food prices will continue to rise as onions and tomatoes continue to cause concern, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.Monetary policy has to be cautious and while it had decidedly targeted growth in the earlier policies, it has to consider CPI inflation over which rates have no control... he said.First Published: Oct 15, 2019 04:57 IST"

Says Ramakrishna Achanta, founder-partner of C3 a food venture who oversees the operations of the new outlet, Food innovation is what our guests love and Green Chilli Halwa is bound to be a hit. Its made of green chillies soaked in cold water for a few hours before it is cooked in ghee and sugar, adds Manoj Chandrasekhar, partner. This one is like Lauki Ka Halwa except that leaves a spicy aftertaste in your throat, like a tequila shot.Known for their traditional bhojanam served on a banana leaf, Babai Bhojanam also has delicacies such as Gongura Mirapakaya Bajji with a filling of the ground tangy leafy vegetable and onion garnish. We also have Karivepaku Kodi made using curry leaf paste. Same ingredients. Different tastes, he adds.The other fusion food specialty is Paneer Nuvvula Pullalu, which is like an Indian version of a satay, except that is bland and soft inside with paneer finger with crunchy sesame coating. It comes with a sweet tamarind dip and is something the Gen Z will dig into.We used to have cheese in Ulli Bomb, but our patrons suggested we replace cheese with paneer. We are always open for changes, Manoj adds. The Secunderabad outlet which opens to public on Monday also prides itself in specialities like Prawns Biryani, Ulavacharu Jeedipappu Biryani and Aloogadda Jeedipappu Biryani, all with the touch of Babai.

Tomato prices in New Delhi have more than doubled to 60 rupees to 70 rupees per kilogram in the past weeks.Consequently, we expect the spike in onion prices to contribute about 30 basis points to headline inflation, said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai.Food Inflation to Rise Sharply in SeptemberOnions have a weight of 0.6% in the overall inflation basket and contribute about 10% to the vegetable basket.The inflation-targeting Reserve Bank of India expects food prices to stabilize while forecasting headline inflation to stay well below its medium-term target of 4% for the rest of the fiscal year through March.Besides, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, is likely to show that demand pressures are still rather weak. That should keep alive expectations of more rate cuts by the RBI in the coming months.Bloomberg Economicss Gupta expects core inflation to ease for a number of reasons.These include companies reducing prices to pass on the benefit of recent tax cuts to consumers, lower tax rates on consumer goods and services, an increase in the supply of affordable housing, a wider output gap, a sharp drop in crude oil prices, and strong favourable base effects during the October-to-December months, he said."

Businesses, big and small, admit to being dependent on onion farmers for their incomes. Farmers bring their produce in tractors and trucks ferry onions across the country. At a time when the spike in onion prices has been making national headlines, one would expect exuberance in local markets. That is not the case. Lasalgaon is not an aberration. Hindustan Times also visited Pimplegaon, another big onion market 30 km away. Farmers have been getting Rs 28-30 per kilogram for their onions in both these markets. This is much more than what they normally get. So what explains the tepid sentiment? A conversation at the hair salon next to the onion and vegetable market makes things clear.It emerges that not everybody gained from the onion price rally. Prices went up in the first place because rains destroyed a lot of produce. So, most farmers did not have any onions to sell when prices went up. Sure, some have gained. But it takes a mass jump in earnings to boost overall spending. When the produce was good last year, everybody lost out. And the government killed the current rally by banning exports, we are told.Unlike what many people like to believe, stakeholders in Lasalgaons onion economy, both farmers and other businessmen understand the vagaries which Indias horticulture market subjects them to.They are worried that most farmers will increase their onion cultivation next year in the hope of getting good prices. This is bound to create a glut and bring down prices. Only if the farmers could co-ordinate among themselves and limit production, will prices always be good, they lament.Given the lack of an organisation or external mechanism to control cultivation, thousands of farmers reducing production to keep prices higher is a problem game theorists in economics would love. After all, any voluntary individual effort to curb production to keep prices high can backfire if others produce more and extract a bigger premium, which has come at a collective cost.Then, there is another dilemma. Better seeds, pesticides, water sprinklers for irrigation etc. have all helped increase production. But they have also added a lot to costs. This was not the case earlier, a farmer in his sixties tells us. A small bottle of pesticide comes for Rs 500. The farmer has to spend an entire day spraying it in the farms. He cant even come home for a meal, lest all the pests on his body infect his home. You dont use these inputs and the yield suffers. There is also the labour cost of cultivation. The younger generation does not want to work in the fields. Onion cultivation is a labour intensive process unlike cereals such as wheat, where machines can take care of a lot of things. None of these  labour or material  can be adjusted for fall in prices. It is the farmer who is sole risk bearer.But doesnt everyone gain when prices of edibles are low? This is exactly what Girish Plave, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president of Nashik town told us when we asked him whether or not the governments efforts to control onion prices have robbed farmers a chance at earning more? If prices go up, it is people in just one district who gain, whereas low prices are in national interest, he said.The proprietor of the salon disagrees with Palves reasoning. If a farmer earns Rs 1 lakh in a year, he will actually spend Rs 1.2 lakh. This is because he borrows the extra Rs 20,000. When a trader earns the same amount, hell put Rs 50,000 in his bank account, he adds. Farmers have not been getting food prices for years now. This has squeezed their spending and therefore everyones businesses, he explains.Without any formal training in economics, this man is describing one of the basic concepts in macroeconomics. It is known as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). MPC can be roughly defined as increase in consumption spending for every one rupee increase in income. It is a known fact that MPC declines with rise in income levels, as most basic needs are met and people tend to save for a rainy day. The salon owner is actually claiming that MPC for farmers actually exceeds one, basically suggesting perpetual debt financed consumption.This is not very surprising. Most farmers in India are never able to fulfil what can be described as basic needs. This is not surprising. According to a National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report, average incomes for agricultural households  those who derived majority of their incomes from farming  was just Rs 77,112 in 2012-13. The fact that the first Narendra Modi government announced an income transfer of Rs 6000 per year for farmers and expected to gain from it politically, speaks volumes about the financial status of Indias farmers.So, what is to be done? The government ought to control input prices, one of the farmers tells us. What can we do, no one raises these problems in politics, another farmer chips in. Farmers should not be greedy and reduce cultivation, a commission agent in Pimplegaon says.Will all this impact the elections? Lasalgaon is part of the Yelva assembly constituency (AC), which elected Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) heavyweight and former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, Chagan Bhujbal with a comfortable majority, both in 2009 and 2014. Most people, including those who support the BJP, believe that he should sail through comfortably. He has done a lot for the area, we are told.

The opposition, especially its important leaders have been facing it too, both from the BJP organisation and investigative wings of the state government.

Congress attacks Centre","By PTIMUMBAI: The Congress on Monday hit out at the BJP for harping on scrapping of Article 370 in poll rallies, saying the ruling party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were deflecting attention from issues concerning common people like economic slowdown, price rise and unemployment.Top BJP leaders, including Modi and party president Amit Shah, have been repeatedly speaking about the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in their rallies in poll-bound Maharashtra and Haryana.Modi has challenged the Congress to publicly state it will restore the controversial constitutional provision, which granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir if voted to power.Addressing a press meet here, AICC spokesman Jaiveer Shergill said instead of asking the Congress whether it will restore the now-scrapped Article 370, Modi should talk about reducing the prices of petrol, diesel, onion and tomato whose rate has crossed Rs 70 a kg in the retail market.Shergill said the prime minister should come to the rescue of harried depositors of scam-hit PMC Bank and also took a jibe at Modi over his 56-inch chest remark.""The Congress will speak about Article 370 during the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.""ALSO READ | Rahul calls Modi a 'loudspeaker' of rich businessmen, attacks Khattar in first Haryana poll rally""But, if the prime minister really has a 56-inch chest, he should work to reduce the prices of petrol, diesel, onion and tomato, and also hand over the money of lakhs of depositors of PMC Bank,"" he said.The Congress spokesman accused the prime minister of always being in campaign mode instead of focusing on governance.Speaking at the press meet, AICC general secretary R P N Singh said for the government to find solutions to the economic slowdown and growing unemployment, it has to first acknowledge these problems.""Accept the problem before you find solutions. Instead, a senior minister like Ravishankar Prasad says three Hindi movies had become blockbusters and hence there was no recession,"" he said.Singh said industrial output, manufacturing growth rate and investment have seen a decline while unemployment was at an all-time high.In BJP-ruled Maharashtra, between 2014 and 2018-19, 220 factories had a shutdown.Thousands of industrial units in Pune, an automobile hub, were on verge of closure, the former Congress minister said.But, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Modi have no answers to these problems, Singh said.""PMC Bank directors have BJP links and hence Fadnavis has not uttered a word about the bank's collapse. If the Modi government can take Rs 1. 76 lakh crore from RBI (reserves) using its majority, can't it ask the RBI to return money to PMC Bank depositors?"" the Congress leader asked.Singh said the BJP governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra have weakened Mumbai's position as the economic capital by shifting the proposed International Finance Centre, conceived by the UPA government, to another state.""Similarly, there was no progress on the Shivaji and Ambedkar memorial projects (in Mumbai),"" he said."
2019-10-15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/onion-prices-dip-by-21-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/71591924.cms,Onion prices dip by 21% at Lasalgaon,"Representative imageNASHIK: The average wholesale price of onions at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Lasalgaon, nosedived by Rs 750 per quintal in the last four days, registering a 21% drop.From Rs 3,550 per quintal on Wednesday, the average wholesale price at the country's largest wholesale onion market was recorded at Rs 2,800 per quintal on Monday. Since Wednesday, the average wholesale onion price , which was Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,000 per quintal on Thursday and Friday respectively, has been significantly dropping till Monday.On Monday, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 1,201 and Rs 3,263 per quintal respectively. Around 4,800 quintal of onions were auctioned.Lasalgaon APMC have attributed the drop in the wholesale prices of onions to the ban on export and restrictions on storage for traders. Officials in the Lasalgaon APMC shot a letter to Union minister of commerce and industries Piyush Goyal on Monday, seeking withdrawal of stock limit on onion traders to avoid further drop in wholesale prices.In a bid to stabilise onion prices, the Centre had banned export and imposed stock limit of 100 quintal for retailers and 500 quintal for wholesalers on September 29.Sources in the APMC said, ""Traders have reduced purchase of onions due to the stock limit. It takes around three days for dispatching onions after procurement of the produce. Unlike other districts, where onions are sold in gunny sacks, here loose onions are auctioned to the traders in quintals. Then, the traders have to sort out the onions as per their quality and size and package the produce before transporting it. Hence, traders cannot purchase more onions before the previous stock is dispatched.""Presently, onions arriving at the wholesale markets are of the summer variety harvested in March and April. The shelf life of summer onions is around five months. Farmers prefer storing onions with a hope of getting a better price.Arrival of fresh kharif onions will not begin until mid-October. The summer onions stored by farmers cater to the market until arrival of fresh kharif onions."

He spoke to Hindustan Times about the challenges the opposition alliance faces amid the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)s focus on national issues. Edited excerpts:How would you react to those who say this is a one-sided fight?I do not understand that if it is a one-sided fight, why is the Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] addressing nine public meetings here? Why is the Union home minister [Amit Shah] addressing 20 meetings...? Why are they spending so much time here? The BJP leadership from across India; their members of Parliament are here and visiting every corner of the state. It shows the situation is not favourable for them. What we saw in [2019] Lok Sabha elections and what we are seeing in the Vidhan Sabha [assembly polls], there is a vast difference. Just like in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, in Lok Sabha the BJP won the states but in Vidhan Sabha elections [the results] were different. A similar situation is very much here in Maharashtra, and those who do not have enough knowledge about the ground realities are saying [it will be a one-sided fight].The Congress barely got a majority of seats in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the 2018 polls.There were BJP governments there [previously]. So the public at large has thrown those BJP governments [out] ...a majority is a majority.Do you feel you have a weak alliance partner? The Congress has faced a lot of infighting. People like Sanjay Nirupam and Milind Deora have been attacking each other.I do not think so. In Maharashtra, if you go to any village, there is a certain percentage of the population committed to the Congress. They do not see who the candidate is, they just vote for the Congress. That type of base is there. [For] the SCs [Scheduled Caste] and minorities, their party is the Congress. This is a strong base. The names you have mentioned are not the real Congress leaders of the state. They in the team but they are not the grassroot leaders.The BJP is bringing up nationalism and the revoking of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. What impact will that have?You have to see the main issues in the election. There is a crisis for agricultural communities... 16,000 farmers have committed suicide. If there are some situations where they are getting good prices, immediately the government interferes. Take the case of onion farmers. When they started getting [good] prices, the government banned onion exports... All these policies are affecting agriculture. There is no control over the prices of fertilisers and seeds.Secondly, all of us for a number of years, took a conscious decision to develop Maharashtra as an industrial state. Thats why from [first state chief minister] YB Chavans days, we have devised policies and industrial areas like Nagpur, Aurangabad. Thousands of people were working in all these areas. With the policies which have been introduced by BJP government today, more than 50% industrial units are closed... Sick industries are a major issue in the state.Third, unemployment of the younger generation. In Pune, you will find 30-40 engineering colleges, but a lot of people who are graduating are not getting jobs.All these issues are election issues... To divert attention from them, [the BJP] is again and again bringing up Article 370. The prime minister is saying, Mr Pawar should make his position clear about it in the manifesto. Firstly, our manifesto has been released. And when [Article] 370 has been removed, what can we say now? I made a public statement that it is a good thing, it has been removed. In Parliament, too, nobody has opposed it. [Article] 370 is not an issue today. I ask at every public meeting, who wants to go get land there [in J&K] and start agriculture and nobody says they want to go. What about [Article 371]? If I have to buy land in Nagaland, Sikkim, I cannot in any part of the northeast. These are not issues of the public at large.There is an impression that you have a good equation with Modi.I have. I do not believe in many of his policies and I discuss with him when I get an opportunity. Recently, I have not met him as I have not been to Delhi and he is also out of India most of the time. I never keep personal hatred. I am all for maintaining good personal equations... Personal equation is one thing and political approach is another. The political approach has been threatened by the highest of leaders of this country.We do not know what the outcome will be of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)s case against you, your nephew, Ajit Pawar, and NCP leader, Praful Patel. But politics is about perception...What is the case against me? There is a state cooperative bank with 50 directors. They lend money to industries and district banks, not individuals. There is an allegation against all directors, who belong to the BJP, Shiv Sena, Congress, and NCP. The complainant says that most of the directors Mr Pawar knows. Yes, I know them as they are important people. But if I know somebody, is that why I am a criminal? I am not a director of the bank and I am not in any decision-making body. On this basis, if you are making cases, why only mention the name of Ajit Pawar? Why not the BJP and Shiv Sena leaders who are also directors?So the case against former union minister Praful Patel is also made on these sort of allegations?The case against Praful Patel is most unfortunate. Those who know him know he is a businessman. His father had 80,000 people working for his business so why should he do this? I am sure he will explain all this.What about Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi, bringing up the Rafale jet deal issue again? It did not work in the Lok Sabha polls.I do not know what Mr Gandhi has said but we are raising the issues of farmer distress, suicides, and sick industries. Why should we raise issues like Rafale and Article 370? What does it have to do with the Maharashtra election?Do you think the desertions that the NCP has faced will prove to be a disadvantage for you?About seven or eight MLAs [members of legislative assembly] have left. But many have shown me notices that they have got from the investigating agencies. If they are going to use agencies like the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] and I-T [income tax department] and ED, those who are not able to take [the pressure], they succumb. Some [MLAs] feel that they have been in the Opposition for too long.You are doing so many rallies and you are almost 80. Would you be willing to be the CM again?Absolutely not. That is totally ruled out... I take strong objection to your question that I am nearing 80. You may be tired, but I am not. I still spend five days a week travelling and meeting people.You were the only person who Rahul Gandhi met after he resigned as the Congress chief? What did you tell him?Unfortunately today, particularly in media, the attack on Rahul Gandhi is not fair...If you ask me about his resignation, I told him that I understand that the election results were not favourable. It is the responsibility of the leader to act so that the cadre are not demoralised. If the chief of staff is going to resign, it impacts the entire force. So I requested him to take responsibility... he should not take the entire blame and leave the battle. He should fight.First Published: Oct 16, 2019 03:36 IST"

The soaring prices of these vegetables apparently have a lot to do with the theft.The man targeted was Pappu Chaurasia, a vegetable vendor in Manas Enclave in Indira Nagar area in Lukcnow.On Monday night, Chaurasia wrapped up his business and shut his wayside shop by putting tarpaulin on the vegetables.When he returned the next morning, he was aghast to see his vegetable strewn around and found that the bags of onions, garlic and tomatoes kept under the wooden planks were missing.Chaurasia informed his friends and they made inquiries all around.Finally, on Tuesday night, Chaurasia lodged a formal complaint with the Ghazipur police station.I have suffered a loss of about Rs 10-12,000. It is surprising that the thieves did not touch other vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage. Another thing is certain that the thieves were more than one and they had a vehicle to take away the bags of onions, tomatoes and garlic, he said.Tomato is presently selling at Rs 70 per kg in Lucknow while the onion is priced at Rs 45 per kg. Garlic is selling at Rs 200 per kg.Meanwhile, Ghazipur Circle Officer Deepak Kumar Singh, meanwhile said that the police was investigating the case  the first of its kind.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-10-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/discover-bengal-inspired-food-at-puducherrys-coromandel-cafe/article29699681.ece,When paturi gets a makeover,"In the French quarter of Puducherry, a British chef is using local produce to create Bengal-inspired food.I wouldnt call it Bengali, says Chef Jay Adams, with a nervous laugh. I would get into trouble... But it is an exciting project, using those flavours with locally grown ingredients. It is something different for Pondy, and is drawing a fresh audience to the caf.It all began when home cook and food consultant, Kolkata-based Iti Misra, collaborated with the team to create a menu for Durga Puja, in early October.At Coromandel Cafe, amidst the cheery buzz, weekend-trippers in shorts and suntans are scarfing down Itis spicy fish rolls dipped in kasundi, along with Jays signature pink tagliatelle.Iti, who has a graceful energy that fits in comfortably with the restaurants elegant setting, discusses the challenges of creating a Bengali pop-up in a European caf ambience, over large butterflied prawn fritters served with a tangy pomelo and cucumber salad. Instead of an elaborate course-by-course menu, Iti says they decided to create a short, versatile set of dishes that work for lunch, dinner and cocktail evenings.The result: reinterpretations of languorous Bengali meals, each thoughtfully curated, often with modern tweaks. I picked dishes that were typically Bengali, but also could be interpreted for this more Westernised space, says Iti. So she avoided fish with bones and highly spiced curries, for example, focussing instead on highlighting the intricacies of traditional flavours and juxtaposing them with local produce, to create a modern menu with an authentic Bengali heart.The spinach luchis, for example, came with a rich cholar dal, spicy baby potatoes, fried eggplant and a tamarind glaze. More traditional dishes included a prawn malai curry served with saffron pulao. And kosha mangsho with flaky parathas.Of course, there was Kolkatas favourite fish paturi, wrapped in a banana leaf, and served with crisp okra. And to snack on, banana flower rissoles with a powerfully fragrant smoked eggplant pure infused with mustard oil.Now that the pop-up is over, Jay and her team are reworking some of these dishes to fit them into the regular menu. It helps that Jay is a fan of the cuisine. I worked with Bengali chefs in the Andamans and immediately loved their food. Even something as simple as aubergines in mustard oil... I had never seen mustard oil before. It is such a unique flavour, she says, adding that kasundi is another favourite.Homage to pinkItis kosha mangsho stays on the menu, unaltered. The okra is now a Japanese-style crispy fried bhindi with beet pickled onions. There is a light cornflour batter to emphasise crispness, and a cheeky thread of pink running through the menu.The colour, a homage to the pink bungalow that Coromandel Cafe is housed in, is Jays signature and it resurfaces in the hot pink puris, bright with beetroot and served with spiced cauliflower. Itis sweet lime salad is now plated up like a garden, with green papaya, goat cheese and a hibiscus-lavender dressing topped with spicy lotus seeds.There are fish rolls filled with creamy, lemony mousse. And poppy seed aloo chops with sweet-and-sour beet pure, tinted with red wine.In the kitchen, the restaurants Bengali cooks were both delighted and surprised to see dishes from home being celebrated in their Pondy-style caf, known more for its banana French toast, steaks and fettuccine. They were really happy and proud, and I loved seeing that, says Jay. They definitely took charge with this menu, and I got to take a slight back seat, which was nice. While continental food is a bit alien, this is from their roots.Though the Bengali chefs did cook intuitively, because they knew just how these dishes should taste, Iti says that they still required coaching. Remember, these are the dishes that their mothers and aunts cook, she says, adding, Though they work in professional kitchens, they do not spend a lot of time in their own kitchens at home.Perhaps that will change. The enthusiastic response underlines the fact that Indian diners have a powerful, visceral response to food that is familiar, no matter which State it comes from. Good news for Indias many colourful, inventive micro cuisines.Coromandel Cafe is at La Maison Rose, 8 Romain Rolland Street, White Town, Puducherry. Items from the new menu start rolling out from this weekend. Call 0413 2221100 for details."

The soaring prices of these vegetables apparently have a lot to do with the theft.The man targeted was Pappu Chaurasia, a vegetable vendor in Manas Enclave in Indira Nagar area here.On Monday night, Chaurasia wrapped up his business and shut his wayside shop by putting tarpaulin on the vegetables.ALSO READ | Sizzling onion prices unlikely to alter easy rate cycleWhen he returned the next morning, he was aghast to see his vegetable strewn around and found that the bags of onions, garlic and tomatoes kept under the wooden planks were missing.Chaurasia informed his friends and they made inquiries all around.Finally, on Tuesday night, Chaurasia lodged a formal complaint with the Ghazipur police station.""I have suffered a loss of about Rs 10-12,000. It is surprising that the thieves did not touch other vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage. Another thing is certain that the thieves were more than one and they had a vehicle to take away the bags of onions, tomatoes and garlic,"" he said.ALSO READ | Three UP women hospitalised after fist-fight over onionsTomato is presently selling at Rs 70 per kg in Lucknow while onion is priced at Rs 45 per kg.

2019-10-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ncp-leaders-have-defected-under-pressure/article29720189.ece,‘NCP leaders have defected under pressure’,"Veteran Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal believes the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is being used as a political weapon, but people have now started to understand the governments pressure tactics. Mr. Bhujbal was speaking exclusively to The Hindu on the ED witchhunt, defections from the NCP and his role in the Maharashtra Sadan case. Excerpts:The NCP seems to be the stronger of the two parties in the alliance. Should it have got more seats?It was too late to discuss our allies seats. After giving the seats to smaller parties, our numbers have reduced. Who gets the higher number, is not important for me. We should have such a figure that together, we should be able to form the government.Why are so many NCP leaders deserting the party to join the ruling alliance?People have mostly defected under pressure.Is it not because they are winning and they perceive the BJP to be the winning party?They think that if they are part of the ruling party, they may get a seat or some post. But even if they get nothing, they think, At least, there will be no trouble.When the ED named Sharad Pawar, did you fear that he may have to face a similar fate as you?I dont think so. Because at the time I was named, it was the beginning of the ruling government using the ED as a political weapon. So naturally, people were thinking, Something must be wrong. Unlike other laws, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the person has to prove that they are not guilty, and that too from jail. It is a draconian act that is being thoroughly misused. I think people have now understood that this is too much. Thats why agitations have started all over Maharashtra. Even now, people are angry, particularly in rural areas. They have started talking about these tactics and see this as nothing but dictatorship.When he was named, did you speak with him?I was with him for two to three days after he was named. They (ED) had not served a notice, but leaked it to the press. He said, I want to go there and ask them why I had been named. When news got out, there were widespread protests and we decided for the larger good not to visit the office. It still doesnt mean his name is cleared. There is still a sword hanging on his head; only his visiting the ED office has been stopped. God knows what ED will do in future. So many people have the sword hanging over their head, like (Narayan) Rane. Thats why they immediately defect. They are using it as a political weapon, which people understand.Do you think for people who have defected from the NCP under pressure, there is a place back in the party in future?I dont want to respond to hypothetical questions. Well see it when it happens.What do you have to say about the Anti Corruption Bureau recently adding sections in the Maharashtra Sadan case, which carry life imprisonment sentences?They are pressure tactics, nothing else. The sections were removed before the charge sheet was filed. The court went through the charge sheet and included some more sections, but not these ones. Its their (the governments) way of saying, Dont create problems for us during the elections.Do you think you will ever be cleared of charges in the case?It is a court process. But if I keep talking, they will keep filing more cases. They can file some other cases as well. Or it may well happen that the court dismisses the whole thing, like the 2G case. Anything can happen.Under your government, Ajit Pawar was accused of a major irrigation scam. Do you think people will still accuse your government for the water crisis in areas like Marathwada?The Bharatiya Janata Party are experts at spreading wrong information. From the time the State was formed till date, 70,000 crore has not been given to that (irrigation) department. How can you say that there is a scam of that amount? This was done just to discredit the NCP. They alleged it, people wrote about it, and they got publicity.One of the governments flagship projects, the Jalyukt Shivar, aims to solve the water scarcity issue in Marathwada. Your views?Schemes like Jalyukt Shivar are useful, when you get good rain. Then it can be stored in various places and used through the year. When there is no absolutely no rain, what are you going to do with these projects? If you want 100% supply, you need to get it from the areas where I have got it from for the Manjarpada project.What are your thoughts on the Damanganga project?Our stand is, Dont sign the agreement with the Gujarat government to give Maharashtras water. In the Manjarapada project, the water was not under any agreement and was in a sense unaccountable. It was either going into the sea or to Gujarat. However, if we do an agreement, we will be giving up our rights to Gujarat.You won the election in 2014 amidst a saffron wave. Do you think it will be tougher this time in the backdrop of your jail term and the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance?The reason we got elected here in 2014 was development. Last time, I won by some 50,000 votes; this time I am sure it will go up to one lakh. There will be no effect of any sort of their alliance in this constituency. People are angry with this government for several reasons. Loss of jobs is a major one. On the one hand, the government keeps promising more jobs but the reality is that people who have jobs are becoming jobless.How has the rise in onion prices affected farmers in Nashik?The whole belt is badly affected, especially small and poor farmers, and the governments action (banning exports) has resulted in a great deal of anger and resentment. You (the government) stop them from making profits, but when they are making losses you dont come forward to help them. This is injustice.You have spent nearly 30 years with the NCP, but there are rumours that you will be returning to the Sena. What is the basis for that?All the Sena leaders were junior to me. So naturally when they meet, they touch my feet. We sit together and catch up. It is a result of 25 years of association with that party and that too during its formative years. So when mediapersons see me with Sena leaders, they conclude that I am going back to the Sena, since others are defecting and it is the season for joining other parties. But rumours are rumours. I have said many times that there is no basis for this. But what can I do?"

The last lot that we received  over 10 kg of tomatoes  was ruined by the time it got here due to rain, says Sushma N, a vendor at Gudimalkapur vegetable market. We have to increase prices for a reason. Demand is still the same, but there is not enough in supply, she said.Chillies are almost on the verge of disappearing from markets in the city. The prices of green chillies have sky-rocketed to Rs 70 in the last 15 days and there is shortage in the market because farmers are not able to reach us with contracts due to transportation strike,"" said Zahir, vendor. Officials of Ryuthu Bazar opined that if the strikes and rains persist, the prices are expected to increase continuously till the end of the month. With the kind of gap we are observing in the demand and supply of the vegetables in the market, the prices of onions and tomatoes are easily expected to touch Rs 100 per kg, said Ganesh Kumar, official Ryuthu Bazaar.Due to rains, a lot of vegetables have been destroyed in farms.

2019-10-17,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/oct/17/deliciousness-delivered-2048928.html,Deliciousness Delivered,"Ayesha Singh ByExpress News ServiceIn a happy coincidence, our quest for food on a lazy weekend ended with an order from a recently launched takeaway and delivery place called 1900 AD  A Kitchen Love Story. On that day, judging a book by its cover turned out to be the best thing. If it wasnt for the unusual ring to its name, we probably wouldnt have made it past the first page of the menu.The executive chef, Sanjeev Dogra, from Gaggal Himachal Pradesh, has bought the quintessential culinary style of slow cooking from the mountain tops to citys hurried gourmands. He cooks most things in clay posts and smokes them on charcoal till his olfactors give a nod of approval.Our short-listed selections included Dum Chicken Curry, Chefs Special Paneer, Daal 1900, and the thing that we were most excited about, The Khatta Mutton, a signature Himachali dish, also the only regional dish on the menu. That was a disappointment since the chefs indigenous knowledge could have been tapped into to display Himachali cuisine that is anyway a niche in Delhi. Also, there is no sweet section in the menu, a big letdown if youre looking for dessert.The food arrived 10 minutes before the requested time setting a good first impression. It came in well-tied cardboard boxes labelled accurately and neatly. There was no leakage or spillage, and every preparation inside had a seal. An accompaniment of vinegared ring onions, mint chutney and tissues came intact.All mains were in earthen handis sealed with dough. Each carried a printed label. The pot was received hot and it remained so for 20 minutes until we all sat down for a meal that was to become a treasured one for a long time.We dug into The Khatta Mutton curry right away. This is traditionally a staple of the Dogri community of Himachal Pradesh and Chef Dogra has used the best of his understanding to make this. No improvisations or innovations its prepared the way it was cooked traditionally in his family.The dish is not khatta (tangy) in the way you imagine it to be but was well laced with amchur spice (mango powder) that lends it a subtle pungency. The meat was tender and the gravy accompanying it filled the air with a satisfying aroma that could only come from pot roasting.The Dum Chicken Curry oozes out whiffs of ginger and garlic adorned with fresh minty flavours. The balance of spices has been achieved skillfully and chilli is thrown in moderately.Both conventional orders but also house specials, the Chefs Special Paneer and Daal 1900, were predictably good. The former had thick, rich tomato gravy with large chunks of paneer and a generous dollop of butter submerged under it. The piquancy of these dishes is best enjoyed with a simple naan or roti accompaniment to ensure the robustness is balanced with the neutrality of the bread.The menu comes with a large selection of other popular North Indian food options from Mutton Chaap, Makhmali Seekh Kebab, Allo Nazakat, Soya Chaam Masala to biryanis, all of which is prepared with the minimal use of machines. The most used implement is the motor and pestle which has replaced grinders, and mud pots have substituted a lot of the steel ware.The food is cooked in desi ghee, mustard oil and rock salt and each is simmered in pots to keep the moisture circulating evenly. And the result is right in front of us. A dexterous curation is rarely found in takeaway/delivery services. Try it."

Whenever the onion farmers start fetching good prices, the Centre imposes restrictions to bring down the wholesale rates, said Pawar while addressing rallies in Baglan, Pimplegaon and Nandgaon in Nashik district on Thursday.The NCP chief targeted the NDA government on the onion price issue as onion growers are spread across many constituencies in rural Nashik, and they could affect electoral destinies.Pawar recalled that when he was the Union agriculture minister in the UPA government, he had ensured that all restrictions imposed on onions were rolled back so that the farmers could benefit.He pointed out that the Centre had stepped in to save the PSU banks that incurred losses of Rs 80,000 crore  because some big businessmen had defaulted on their dues. But the Centre is not helping the farmers who are unable to repay bank loans. This government is anti-farmer, the NCP chief added.Criticising the BJP government for its decision of promote tourism in forts, Pawar said: The forts are steeped in the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji. Promoting tourism will bring hotels, restaurants and bars, and make forts liquor dens.He added that the BJP government is raising the Article 370 issue to divert attention from core problems. Pawar also accused the BJP government of abusing power to silence the opposition. The BJP government raided Congress headquarters in Delhi. It also tried to have an ED enquiry against me. But this government got frightened when I decided to go to ED office on my own, he said. Pawar also talked about the agitation by the HAL workers."

2019-10-18,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/what-can-india-do-to-overcome-the-global-slowdown/article29728359.ece,What can India do to overcome the global slowdown?,"The IMF expects global economic growth to be just 3% this year, the lowest since the 2008 global financial crisis. Unlike in 2008, when India was insulated from a global economic meltdown, the economy now is on the ebb, with growth in the first quarter of 2019-20 hitting a six-year low of 5% and growth projections being slashed by agencies for the rest of FY20. What reforms can India pursue at this stage to align its manufacturing and trading activity with global demand patterns and protect itself from the worlds growth pangs? In a conversation moderated by Vikas Dhoot, Nagesh Kumar and N.R. Bhanumurthy look at the challenges and the road ahead. Edited excerpts:What has changed in the global economy in the last two years which has turned the headwinds Indias way?Nagesh Kumar: The latest IMF World Economic Outlook says there is a synchronised global economic slowdown. The trigger was probably the trade slowdown. Recently, the WTO also indicated that world trade growth would be 1.2% , down from 3%. So, a very anaemic or even a flat growth rate in trade is pulling down the economy. And because this is the age of global integration, all economies get affected. The trigger also lies in the protectionist tendencies of world economies and the U.S.-China trade war. India is also affected by this and other domestic issues.N.R. Bhanumurthy: The global slowdown seems to have started in early 2018 largely because of the premature withdrawal of the stimulus that the global economy was introduced to in the post-2008 crisis. Added to that, emerging market economies started showing some weaknesses. Brazil and South Africa have already got into the recessionary stage. A big country like China started slowing down although there are many who say it is deliberate to reduce the overheating the economy was facing. U.S. and China trade policies have worsened the global situation. The most unfortunate consequence of this for India is that compared to 2008, we are not immune to global slowdown. In fact, in 2008 we were growing faster. That is the main worry for us.Unfortunately, we seem to have realised only now that there is a slowdown. Some of us have argued it started in the second quarter of 2018 when we saw the pressure the domestic economy was facing. I would say that the global slowdown should take away almost 1.5 percentage points off the growth rate. The rest is domestically driven slowdown, with some cyclical and structural factors.I was looking at some of the numbers from the RBI. One scary number from April 2019 to right now: the net change in non-food credit to the commercial sector actually declined by 18,870 crore compared to the accretion of credit by 3.5 lakh crore a year ago. That shows the extent of the slowdown. In my view, it is becoming deeper now although the government has taken some measures in this period. My guess is we will be in the 6% growth rate (zone) for some more time.We thought Indias economy was largely insulated because of a large domestic market. Is there something that has changed in the last two years?NK: As the Indian economy has gradually opened up since 1991, the global economic situation has had spillovers in India. Between 2003 and 2008, the Indian economy was averaging between 8% and 9% growth. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it came down to 6.2%, but we were very solid. There is always a spillover of global headwinds on the Indian economy. Not only through trade, but through capital inflows which have been affected. What has also precipitated this, this time, is the Non-Banking Financial Companies [NBFC] crisis which has affected the flow of credit to capital goods. The demand for capital goods is down, as is car sales. Real estate is in trouble. The flow of credit to some of these sectors, which were an important determinant of sales, has been affected. This has resulted in a spillover in the rest of the economy.Also Read How should India tackle the global slowdown? | The Hindu Parley podcastThis is the time we have to worry about fiscal stimulus, not fiscal consolidation. There is a slump in demand. Public investment is very critical. Then there should be some kind of social spending which affects people in need with a high propensity to consume. Any cash reaching the poor will find its way into the market quickly. The reduction of corporate tax will have only a medium-term impact. In the short term, we need to get the money in the hands of the poor which pushes them to the market so aggregate demand gets generated and, in the process, we also address the inequalities in recent times.NRB: If you look at the global context, there are issues about how the U.S.-China trade war should have helped India. We should have done things differently. We started introducing import tariffs when we should have done the reverse. The reduction of corporate tax rates should have been done at the time of introducing the Budget. I am hoping that tariff duties will be reduced by the government.Indias exports have not been able to keep pace with expectations, especially in labour-intensive sectors like textiles, where Vietnam and Bangladesh have surged ahead. Is there something India can do to meet the challenges in the global landscape?NK: The dynamism in world trade is in the Eastern side. The Western markets are really flat. There is also a rise in protectionism. In such a situation, we need to tap the Asian markets. In that context, RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership] is an important initiative. It gives us a possibility to integrate the Indian economy and production with the value chains in east-Asian countries.However, you could be part of a trade agreement and not make use of it. And this is precisely the story of Indian industry. We have failed to make use of the preferential market access that was made available through various trade agreements. Indian industry has grown with the comfort of having a large domestic market. We need to nudge industry to look at global and regional markets, especially for labour-intensive goods.I think that one very important critical factor is the competitiveness of the exchange rate. We need to avoid the appreciation of the rupee if we are to strengthen the domestic manufacturing industry. Any appreciation of the rupee facilitates more imports and less exports, adversely affecting domestic production.NRB: I am apprehensive of India joining RCEP. I have found that even the government is not sure what the outcomes of various trade agreements have been. In RCEP, how are we going to manage countries like China? Do we have that kind of expertise? We need some kind of a strategic assessment of sectors where India can benefit, both as an exporter and importer. Im not sure if we have that kind of data.Does India need to change its outlook towards import and export tariffs? For instance, when onion prices shoot up, exports are banned below a particular price. How badly does this dent Indias credibility as a global supplier?NK: Consistency in policies and visibility in the market are very important. You need to be seen as a reliable source of what youre exporting. But agricultural commodities are more volatile than industrial ones. Crop failures happen, and you need to sometimes go out of the market. It does affect your reliability as an exporter, but in the agricultural commodities market, this is understood as it may be unavoidable sometimes. But there is always a possibility of managing our affairs better by having reserves or surpluses.NRB: Going back to what Dr. Kumar said about RCEP, if you look at Bangladesh and Vietnam, some companies from India have gone to those places. This is not to say that we are not entirely competitive  we are in the textile sector  but some domestic policies have pushed industries outside the country. We need to set our house right and be clear about our priorities before jumping onto the big wagon called RCEP.NK: There was a lot of pressure from some countries in the grouping to exclude India. Now that India has got in, this opportunity will not come back. We do not have the luxury of getting our house first in order and then rejoining.What Dr. Kumar is saying gels well with what former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said a few years ago in Singapore. Tracing Chinese economic history, he had said the country prospered whenever it was open to the world, and slipped back in the global economy whenever it closed its doors. If you want to get rid of poverty and develop, you have no option but to open up, he had said. Perhaps, thats the spirit in which RCEP and other trade agreements should be viewed?NRB: China was extremely competitive on the manufacturing side. They could bulldoze their commodities across the world. Are we in a position to do similar things? We did so with the service sector. But on the manufacturing and industry front  and RCEP is relevant to this  given our current level of productivity and social capital, are we in a position to compete in the next 10-15 years? That is my apprehension. As Dr. Kumar said, trade always improves the welfare of the people. But we need to see who will benefit less and who will benefit more.In this respect, the government will have to improve regulations for businesses so that they dont have handicaps vis-a-vis global competitors.NK: Even on the manufacturing side, it is not that we are not competitive in the entire sector. We do have a fair bit of exports in the pharmaceutical sector. Even in auto components, India is a major exporter. It is not a story which is uniformly bad, but we can do better.NRB: One analytical chapter of the IMF report talks about policy measures needed to revive growth in emerging market economies. I found two of the five measures interesting: increase domestic finance and improve governance mechanisms. We need to do well in these areas. I am not sure if measures like merging banks are the best idea. We dont need fewer banks; we need more banks and more financial instruments to go forward. If we look at the cost of doing business, it is very high compared to countries in East Asia for reasons such as governance. We should definitely join RCEP, but we need to improve on various indicators to make use of the membership."

Sources said Delhi barely gets three trucks of the kitchen staple from the central agency every day.Delhi government gets onion from NAFED at the rate of Rs 15.6 per kilo and sells it through around 250 mobile vans across the city at a subsidised rate of Rs 23.9 per kg. Rates of both the procurement and selling have been fixed by the Centre. The price of onions in the local markets has been keeping in the range of Rs 60-80 per kg for more than a month now due to massive shortage of supply owing to inclement weather in certain states."

We will be able to supply the required quantity till the fresh crop arrives, said an official. The arrival of fresh onion stock has begun from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and it is expected that prices will show a downward trend in the coming week especially after Diwali , the ministry said.As far as tomato is concerned, the ministry said there has hardly been any damage to the crop in Andhra Pradesh which is a major producer.Horticulture commissioner has been asked to write to Andhra Pradesh government asking to dispatch the fresh tomatoes immediately for augmenting supplies in major demand centres including Delhi and its suburbs.It directed Mother Dairy to sell tomatoes at Rs 55 per kg or less through its Safal retail outlets across the national capital region (NCR) to provide relief to consumers.The ministry claimed that tomato rates have normalised in most states. The arrivals from Madhya Pradesh have begun which will have an immediate easing impact on prices. The tomato crop in Karnataka has begun arriving in the mandis and this will have an immediate impact on prices especially in the southern region, the government said.Meanwhile, the horticulture commissioner has been asked to consider the proposal to explore the possibility of cultivation of more tomatoes and onions in north India.In case of pulses, the panel decided that the existing stock should be offloaded in the market through Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and NCCF in smaller packs of half and one kgs."

From the industrialised and cash crop rich region of Nashik-Aurangabad to the arid district of Beed, and even the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) stronghold of Baramati and former Congress chief minister Prithviraj Chavans seat Karad, hardly anybody has a doubt about the electoral outcome at the state level. This, in itself, is not a big deal. The BJP-Sena alliance will not be the first political entity in India to recapture power in a state. Yet, the Maharashtra elections signify the dawn of a new age in the states politics, perhaps even in the countrys polity.It is the beginning of electoral contests under a new national political hegemon, the BJP led by Narendra Modi. The biggest change under this new political regime is the lack of a macro challenge to the BJP and Modi. At least, this is biggest sense HT could draw from touring large parts of Marathwada and western Maharashtra including Nashik, Aurangabad, Beed, Baramati, Pune and Kolhapur.The micro pictureThere is definitely uncertainty about how many seats the BJP-Sena alliance will get. There is talk about possible sabotage of each other within the alliance.A common refrain is that the BJP wants to get a majority on its own. The Sena, aware of this fact, is focusing on maximising its numbers, we are told. Bandkhors, or rebel candidates, are a big headache for the BJP-Sena alliance in many places. In fact, theres a rebellion right at the heart of the Shiv Sena.Bandra East assembly constituency (AC), where the Thackerays live, has the current Shiv Sena legislator Tripti Sawant contesting as an independent after being denied a ticket. Her late husband, a Sena veteran, had won this seat by defeating a BJP candidate in the 2014 elections. She was elected in a by-poll after his death. To be sure, the BJP and Shiv Sena are not the only ones facing this problem. In Kolhapur, the previous district president of the Congress is contesting as an independent on one of the assembly constituencies (AC) after it went to the NCP as part of the alliance agreement.Jaydattji Sonajirao Kshirsager, an NCP heavyweight and a former minister, has switched sides to the Shiv Sena and is seeking re-election in Beed. These factors will probably affect electoral outcome in many ACs in the state.Yet, the Opposition does not seem to stand a chance at forming a government. One reason could be that the Opposition is fighting a seat-by-seat battle, while the BJP has made it a narrative-driven campaign endorsed by the Sena.At Karad, everybody shows deference to Chavan. Prithviraj Baba has done a lot for us, He will definitely win, is the response we get from many people. However, there are multiple groups of BJP campaigners, men and women, doing their work. The push by the BJP means that Chavan cannot be complacent. This is why he has been largely confined to campaigning in his constituency. At a time when the Congress has been mired in in-fighting and the cadre is demoralised after the Lok Sabha defeat, a senior leader not being able to campaign in the state makes matters even worse. Chavan is not alone. In fact, the only Opposition leader whos been touring extensively is NCP chief Sharad Pawar. But the respect that Pawar commands is largely a product of his legacy, not necessarily a sign for the future.Signs of discontentIn certain pockets, in fact, it is a liability for the Congress-NCP alliance. At Prayag Chikhli, a village on the outskirts of Kolhapur, we met a bunch of old farmers. The village suffered badly in this years floods. Their sugar cane crop was destroyed, and fields are still waterlogged. This place is very close to Hatkanangale, which elected farmer leader Raju Shetty to the Lok Sabha in 2009 and 2014. In 2019, he switched to the Congress-NCP alliance and lost badly. What happened, we asked the villagers? Shetty should have been the voice of sugarcane farmers, and he joined hands with the sugar mill lobby betraying us, they respond. The sugar mill lobby is a veiled reference to Pawar, who is seen as a big leader of the sugar industry in western Maharashtra.To be sure, Pawar has his strengths. At Baramati, two friends in their late 50s, a lawyer and a doctor, talk to us at a tea shop. The doctor is pro-NCP while the lawyer is a BJP supporter. I completely support the abrogation of Article 370 by Modi, but that is not an issue for Maharashtra, the doctor tells us. Article 370 not being an issue in Maharashtra is exactly what Sharad Pawar has been saying in his campaign, while the BJP is trying to pitch voting choice as a referendum on Article 370. The NCP cadre, even in its Baramati office, does not want to talk about the issue. For the BJP-Sena cadre, its the ultimate vote-confirmation tool.Article 370 is not the only issue where the BJP has been left scot-free by the Opposition. Almost everybody in Maharashtra agrees about mandi or recession. But everyone attributes a different reason to it. In the cash-crop dominated or industrial areas, its low farm prices and Goods and Services Tax (GST). In flood and drought affected regions such as Kolhapur and Beed, its rainfall. Yet, there is no palpable anger vis--vis the BJP.Close to a hundred factories have shut down in just Aurangabad, we are told. Thousands have lost their jobs. Placements are bleak for engineering graduates this year, a couple of professors at one of Nashiks biggest private engineering colleges tell us. But whats striking is the fact that no political mobilisation has been undertaken to protest against the state of affairs. So people are relying on different solutions  from bringing petrol-diesel under GST (to reduce prices) to farmers sowing less onions for better prices and interlinking of rivers to tackle water scarcity in Beed. The BJP could not have been happier, given the fact that its welfare schemes have bought it some degree of insurance among the poor.Big picture problemIts not just potential benefit that the Congress-NCP alliance is losing because of its inability to raise issues at the macro level. Even existing supporters might be jumping ship. Malegaon Central, a Muslim majority AC, is one such example. The incumbent Congress MLA, Aasif Shaikh, is facing possible defeat at the hands of Mufti Ismail Kasmi, who contested in 2014 from the NCP but has jumped to All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM). His supporters cite the walkout by Congress and NCP over the voting on Triple Talaq Bill in Rajya Sabha as a betrayal of Muslims. The MIM has a different rhetoric in Aurangabad, where it has won the Lok Sabha seat this time.It would be a mistake to generalise that the MIM can draw away all Muslims from the Congress-NCP, especially where Muslims are not in a majority. But at Khuldabad from Gangapur AC, a bunch of Muslim men in their 60s spill the beans. We would have happily voted for the BJP candidate, but for his party, they tell us. Why has the Congress become so weak, we asked? Manmohan Singh, who is himself a religious minority, was made the Prime Minister for 10 years, but he never spoke much. Look at Modi, even if he does little, he ensures that the BJP gets all political benefits. Why does the Congress not campaign like him, they tell us.Rights of religious minorities are not the only issue which the Congress could have championed. At a ramshackle tea shop in Beed, we met Rakhmaji Gavhane, a young man who runs an automobile part shop. He had a tablet with him. I cannot support a Brahmin (Devendra Fadnavis) as chief minister, as a Maratha. The BJP has done nothing for us. The government should take concrete steps to address unemployment. Instead of going to colleges and learning useless things, young students should be taught English along with vocational training. Look at what China has done, he says. Gavhane is the local leader the Congress-NCP would have done well to enrol. He is not willing to defend the baggage of existing leaders of the Opposition. He has a vision for the future and a concrete action plan to develop one of the poorest regions in the state. And none of this prevents him from articulating a subaltern assertion against the upper caste chief minister the BJP has pinned its hopes on.This is the real story of the political contest in Maharashtra.While the BJP is seeking re-election to win an endorsement of the national transformation PM Narendra Modi is bringing, the Opposition has been reduced to a bunch of local actors who are at best hopeful of winning their own seats.First Published: Oct 19, 2019 00:07 IST"

From the creators of one of the most popular Indian cuisine restaurants, Not Just Paranthas, a place that specialised in more than 150 different paranthas, Varun and Supra Agarwal is back with a new concept. Borrowing from the Spanish Tapas, they have brought regional Indian Tapas to the food stage. Of the many places represented through its menu map, we highlight the five you dont want to miss.RAJASTHANI KHOBA ROTIHow a regular roti can be transformed into a piece of culinary wonder is a thing to be testified through this preparation. The name khoba signifies the shape of the roti which has indentations or cavities. This originated from the villages in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and is a thick dough roti with bishops weed and other spices. At the restaurant, its served with Panchmel Daal Tadka or Daal Keema.DAKAI PAROTA FROM BENGALA street favourite from the region, Dakai Parota is a kind of layered paratha which can be roasted on a flat skillet or deep-fried. Like you have puris in Delhi, kachodis in Rajasthan and Luchis in Bengal, this dish is similar but of course, far from same. it is crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. A whole is made on the top following which, a filling of Kosha Mangsho Aloo or Lamb is filled, he says.BHOPALI BHUTE KE KHEESAnywhere you go in Bhopal youll see mashed corn on the roadside being prepared into a snack. At Maachis it becomes a palak patta crisp with Mascarpone quenelle and a tangy tamatar salsa added to complete the twist.FISH POLICHATTU-MOLIKATU FROM ANDHRA PRADESHTwo of the star preparations of the Andhra region, are fish preparations. Polichattu is a delicate kokum scented spicy tilapia, wrapped in plantain leaves and seared on a griddle. It uses a regional paste heavy of curry leaves, onion and coconut. Its spicy but not hot. It is pungent. Molikatu, on the other hand, is lightly flavoured. All spices and herbs are from India, says Varun, who is also the chef.SHILLONG SHAPALEThe place of origin for this pie dish is Tibet. The meat (non-vegetarian version) or corn (vegetarian version) is minced with hands, following which burnt chilli tomato chutney is added to it. We source a variety of Himalayan smoked cheese from a local vendor and incorporate it into the dish. The warm gooeyness adds a distinct nutty flavour and the lemongrass gives a very unusual ring, says Varun.Maachis, Ardee Mall, Sector 52, Gurgaon"

Also, the garlic prices have caused the housewives' expenses to double.According to official data, the inflation rate of vegetable soared to 15 per cent in September and vegetable prices at retail shops doubled.Despite the government's attempts to control onion and tomato prices, in big cities, onion is available at more than Rs 50 per kg while tomato is touching the Rs 60-80 per kg level. Garlic prices are Rs 250-300 per kg, while those of green vegetables are also getting costly.

The towns aspirations, however, are dampened by a lack of basic civic infrastructure, a concern that is expected to be on peoples mind when they cast their votes on October 21.The constituency will witness a five-way battle among the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) Sanjay Singh, Congress Shamsuddin, Jannayak Janata Partys (JJP) Rohtash Khatana, Indian National Lok Dals (INLD) Rohtash Singh and Bahujan Samaj Partys (BSP) Javed Ahmad. In the 2014 polls, the BJP had emerged as the front-runner from the constituency while the INLD candidate stood second.Ahead of the polling day, HT visited different parts of the constituency to assess the various issues that concerned residents. At the Sohna bus terminal, people sit huddled together as they wait for the next roadways bus and talk about the poor connectivity in the region. The service of roadways is very poor. One has to wait for hours to get a bus during the day, while there is hardly any bus after 5pm, said Hitesh Bhardwaj, 18, who is a first-year BA student at Dronacharya Government College, Gurugram.Bhardwaj said that the lack of bus service prevented him from attending extra classes in the evening. There is no bus for us to return from the city in the evening. The only other option is to take shared tempos. We have to change three tempos to reach home, he said.Raj Dabas, 32, said that poor connectivity is a major impediment since most students travelled to other districts for college and there is no university in the area. There is no university in the jurisdiction. There are a few semi-government colleges and most of them are affiliated to MDU. There is no separate college for women either, said Dabas, adding that the BJP had nothing for the constituency in the past five years.He plans to vote for the JJP candidate in the fray, and said that both BJP and Congress candidates are outsiders who had been parachuted only for the elections. How can we expect these people to work for us when they dont even understand the area? JJP candidate Rohtash Khatana is a strong candidate since he is a local, said Dabas.His views were echoed by others, who said that most people are not familiar with the BJP and Congress candidates. It is difficult to predict the outcome, but the BJP and Congress are on a weak footing. The BSPs and JJPs candidates have contested from here in the past. They have an edge over others, said 62-year-old Brahm Prakash, while discussing the prospects of the candidates with his friends outside a tea shop in Chungi no-1 area.He added that BSP candidate could benefit from the Muslim votes in the region, where both Meos and Gujjars are dominant groups. Prakash is yet to decide on his candidate but said that he would vote for development.Sher Singh, 52, concurred that Sohna had not seen any development. There is no good college, hospital or industry in the area. Road infrastructure is also poor. We have been seeking the widening of the Sohna-Tauru road but to no avail, he said. Expansion of the Sohna-Tauru road is a concern shared by many residents. The road sees heavy traffic and frequent collisions take place on the stretch.Singh said that unemployment is possibly the biggest concern in the region, eliciting an agreement from others who surrounded him. The BJP says it will be 75 paar. I agree with them. The rates of onion, tomato, petrol, all have touched 75 paar, he said, while others nodded in agreement.First Published: Oct 19, 2019 20:08 IST"

The farmers who brought their yield to Pathikonda, Aspari and Aluru wholesale markets, have dumped their produce on the roads as the price is highly unremunerative and they would not get even the transportation costs. Cattle are feasting on the dumped tomato produce at market yards. Some farmers have stopped engaging workers to pluck tomatoes as paying their wages has become burdensome for them due to slump in prices.It is alleged that commission agents are exploiting the farmers, dashing their hopes of reaping good profits due to bumper yield this year. Traders are offering a pittance to the farmers for a kg of tomatoes and commission agents hand in it is amply evident.As their protest from Thursday to Friday afternoon demanding remunerative price has not yielded any result, the hapless farmers dumped their produce on the road cursing the indifference of marketing officials to their plight.B Sayanna, a farmer from Tekmal village in Devanakonda Mandal, said he raised tomato crop in four acres by investing Rs 1.2 lakh. I brought the produce to Pathikonda market by hiring tractors. Here, the traders (middlemen) are offering just Rs 10 per basket (one basket contains 10 kg of tomatoes). I cant get back the investment leave alone profits. How can I repay the loan taken for raising the crop? he rued.K Hulthenna from Chinnahulthi in Pathikonda Mandal said, I cultivated tomato in 10 acres. The crop yield is good this season compared to last year. But the market prices are not satisfactory. We invested Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 per acre, excluding transportation charges.Though the district authorities directed the market yard officials to hold auction of tomatoes inside the yard, the commission agents, who colluded with traders, are not ready for it and exerting pressure on farmers to negotiate the price outside the yard premises, which resulted in steep fall in the prices.Assistant Director of Horticulture Raghunatha Reddy said the tomato prices are not satisfactory only at Pathikonda market where a basket is being sold at Rs 30. Tomatoes are priced at Rs 350 a basket at Billekal and Rs 300 at Pyapili.This is the start of the season and there should be good demand for tomatoes. Farmers cultivated tomato crop in nearly 5,000 hectares in the district. The peak season for tomatoes is November and December. The market prices of tomatoes will certainly go up in the coming days, he added.BJP Pathikonda incharge E Ranga Goud said, This is not the first time that tomato farmers are incurring losses due to lack of remunerative prices. It has become an annual ritual. Despite many agitations, the government has turned a blind eye to the issue. It is not taking any measures for market intervention to stabilise the prices of tomato and onion when they are on the downward trend, to rescue farmers.Farmers in precarious situationIf tomato crop is not cultivated, the prices will skyrocket, if cultivated, the prices will slumpTomato crop requires an investment of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 per acreTomato is 10 month long crop.The first four harvests get good price of Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg in wholesale marketThe prices start declining from fifth to eighth harvests of the cropThe arrival of crop in large quantities results in slump in pricesSetting up of tomato processing units will be helpful to farmers, which will ensure support price to farmers as the vegetable is highly perishableTomatoes are exported to Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra from Chittoor, Kadapa and Kurnool districts"

Our manifesto needs a budget allocation of Rs 32,000 crore that can be easily meted out through state funds,"" he told the media.ALSO READ: Rahul Gandhi steps in to address mother Sonia's rally in Harayana, Hooda ignores him yet againHe said his government would give benefits to farmers in the form of better prices for their produce. The BJP manifesto makes no promise of loan waiver but there is a promise to compensate the farmers for damage to the crops due to natural calamities.Khattar believes the manifesto is in line with the principles of creating a Ram Rajya, meaning an honest government with zero tolerance to corruption and transparency.However, political observers say unemployment, deteriorating law and order, mounting debt and poor remunerative crop prices are major roadblocks in Khattar's smooth sail for his second consecutive stint.Swaraj India President Yogendra Yadav said state's total liabilities were Rs 76,263 crore in 2013-14. At that time the BJP government promised to free the state of this debt. ""Now the liabilities stand at Rs 179,744 crore,"" he mocked.Quoting a report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy for May to August, Yadav said the number of unemployed in the state has crossed 20 lakh, adding out of these 4.5 lakh are either graduate or have a higher degree.Hooda, who is seeking votes on the basis of his 10-year stint (2004 to 2014) as the Chief Minister, describes the Khattar dispensation as a ""government of scams"", which promotes ""divisive politics"".The state has burnt thrice with Khattar at its helm, state Congress president Kumari Selja said in an apparent reference to the violence during incidents related to self-styled godmen Rampal and Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and the Jat agitation.She said the crime rate in the state was 36 per cent and there was a substantial increase in rape cases.Taking a dig at Khattar's slogan of '75 plus' seats, Hooda said it (the BJP) would not cross the 75-mark, but onions and diesel had crossed the (Rs) 75-mark.Khattar's slogan 'Mission 75' got louder after the BJP's stellar performance in the Lok Sabha polls by winning all 10 seats.In the 2014 Haryana Assembly polls, the BJP won 47 seats, while the INLD and the Congress got 19 and 15 seats, respectively.BJP's ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BSP won one seat each and Independents five seats.The state will go to the polls on October 21 and results will be declared on October 24."
2019-10-20,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/minister-refutes-centres-allegations-on-onions/article29747592.ece,Minister refutes Centre’s allegations on onions,"Delhi Food and Supplies Minister Imran Hussain on Saturday wrote to Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, refuting media reports, attributed to the Union Ministry, that the Delhi government had rejected onion trucks certified by officials in Nashik, Maharashtra.Mr. Hussain said that till now, only five onion trucks had been rejected as the produce was wet, rotten, and not fit for human consumption.This claim is strongly refuted being not based on true facts. Firstly, no consignment certified by Delhi government officials has been rejected. Secondly, till date only five such trucks have been rejected... onions of two out of these five trucks have not been lifted by NAFED so far, he said in the letter.Mr. Hussain wrote that the Delhi government is obliged to provide quality onions at affordable prices to its residents and any lot unfit for human consumption cannot be distributed.The Minister pointed out that the Delhi government has demanded 90 onion trucks since September 28, but NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd) has so far been able to supply only 33 trucks.Earlier this week, Mr. Hussain had requested the Union Ministry to ask NAFED to provide 10 trucks of onions every day for 10 days to Delhi to normalise price of onions."

Stubble burning only contributes to 10% of pollution. It is the internal causes which need to be addressed to mitigate pollution levels in the Capital, Mr. Goel alleged.AAPs responseReacting to Mr. Goels comments, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said, in a recent 2019 report released by World Economic Forum, out of the top 10 most polluted cities in the world, seven are in India. Interestingly, Delhi does not figure in the list but all other seven cities under the BJP-ruled State governments find place in it.Mr. Vijay Goel should question BJP CM of UP and Haryana for pollution in Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, Gaziabad and Lucknow.Onion priceMeanwhile, the BJP also accused the Delhi government of conniving with (onion) hoarders.Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijender Gupta said: The Centre had proposed to supply onions to Delhi government at the rate of 15.90 per kilogram. But Kejriwal government had cancelled the order given by it previously. This exposes the double standards of the Kejriwal government... onion is beyond the reach of common man because it is sold at the rate of 60-80 per kg.He said the State unit of the BJP would gherao Chief Ministers residence over the issue next week."

Food, I tell myself (during these brief moments), is not just about eating; its also about delving deep into history. There are some people who do the digging for us  and I am always thankful to them for all that they bring to the table: not just food, but the stories behind it.One tireless researcher is my friend Pritha Sen. When I first met her, many moons ago, I had heard that she was a good cook. But in the last many years, she has been going into the roots of food. One of her passions is the food served in the Goalondo Steamer.The steamer connected parts of what was then undivided Bengal to Goalondo, where the Padma meets the Brahmaputra. Legend has it that the food on the steamer was superb. I remember my mother, who was from Faridpur in what is now Bangladesh, talking about the delicious curries that she had while travelling on the steamer. She may have been referring to the Goalondo fowl curry.This curry  along with a host of other mouth-watering dishes  figures on Prithas menu that she has curated for a special festival at threesixyone, at The Oberoi, Gurugram (on till October 20; about 3,000 per person). She oversees the cooking with the help of the Kolkata-based chef, Surojit Raut, and chef Manish of the hotel. And the menu includes some long-lost dishes or ingredients.Fowl Curry | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementTake the starters. We had something called Batabi Lebu Makha  pomelo salad, with the fruit tossed in mustard oil, rock salt and green chillies. Then we had a small portion of black rice and bamboo rice, mixed with hung curd and kasundi, a wonderfully heady mustard sauce. I loved the crunchiness of the rice, and the mildly tart taste. The bamboo plant flowered once in 12 years, and the villagers preserved the seeds for their nutritional value and had them during times of shortages.Pan-fried Stuffed Teasel Gourd (kakrul in Bengali) followed, and then a small chop of black sesame seeds and steamed and spiced spinach puree on a coin-sized paratha. I was more interested in the non-vegetarian fare, and loved the Chonga Kebab, minced meat cooked in a hollowed bamboo section, a method that is followed in many parts of the northeast but has mostly disappeared from Bengal. There was Murgi Pora, a spiced piece of chicken wrapped and cooked in banana leaf. Pritha points out that the original recipe used goat meat. Even the Goalando fowl curry, now cooked with chicken, would have been prepared with something like duck or perhaps game birds once.Aam Adaa Gondhoraj Sharbat | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThe curry, by the way, was delicious  light, yet well-spiced, with an appetising red gravy. I enjoyed the lightly cooked Hussaini Kalia, too. This was lamb cooked on bamboo skewers with pearl onions and ginger, and dated back to the Hussain Shah Dynasty of the 15th and 16th century.There was much more  sweet and sour baby brinjal, tawa roasted cabbage with mustard paste and coconut, a wonderfully light and tasty dish called Moricher Jhol (gourd stalks in a mildly tempered curry), pointed gourd cooked with a spice called radhuni, duck cooked with bamboo shoot and prawns in a gravy flavoured with coconut, cumin, pippali (a kind of pepper), mustard paste and tamarind. The bhetki flavored with fenugreek, coriander and garlic was outstanding  the curry was mild, and fish had soaked in the flavours of the gravy.As always, Prithas food was more than just a meal: The table came laden with flavours and legends.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Many parts of Kadur and Tarikere taluks received heavy rains on Sunday night, affecting normal life.Vast tracts of areca plantations were inundated, roads been cut off and bridges damaged. Almost all waterbodies in the area are in spate.Connectivity lostA bridge connecting Mugali and Thammatakal was damaged, cutting off connectivity. Another bridge collapsed near Nandipura in Tarikere taluk. Farmers, who were expecting good returns from onion fields, are worried as their crops have been submerged in water. Several houses at A. Rangapura village in Tarikere taluk have been flooded after a tank breached.In Shivamogga, rain water entered more than 50 houses and two houses collapsed. Overflowing water from the Navule tank entered the cricket stadium there. The tanks in Basavanagangur and Saidara Kallahalli villages were breached resulting in flooding of agricultural crop in their command areas. The Bhadra was flowing near danger mark in Bhadravati city.The catchment areas of Linganamakki reservoir also received heavy rains in the past 24 hours owing to which inflow, which was at the rate of 8,755 cusecs on Sunday, enhanced to 9,838 cusecs on Monday."

I dont know if it is psychological but in my mind, Paris is the worlds most expensive city. Everything costs a lot. The taxis can be even more expensive than Londons and they are harder to find. Good restaurants can cost a fortune. The labour laws make it expensive to run a high-quality establishment so, despite sky-high prices, most three-star restaurants dont make much money ---- they are relieved if they can break even.I wondered, as I sat down to write this, if Paris hotels are really as expensive as I imagined. So, I did an internet search for rates on Monday 21 October. The Bristol, one of nicest hotels in Paris, offered its cheapest room at Rs 1.07 lakh. The Royal Monceau (with rooms designed by Philippe Starck) started at Rs. 88,000 and went up. In contrast, The Ritz in London offered rooms at Rs. 49,000 per night while the Paris Ritz (different owners and a marginally grander property) sold its cheapest room at Rs 87,000. Even within the big chains, there were variations. The Park Hyatt in Paris was at least 10 per cent more expensive than New Yorks much grander Park Hyatt, the groups flagship property.There are cheaper hotels, of course. The four-star Hilton Opera will cost Rs. 25,358. The Westin will set you back Rs 30,000. But even these are hardly inexpensive. And so, I try and steer clear of Paris and its hotels.As is true of many European cities, rooms can be tiny. When my son was small, I took him to Disneyland Paris. On our way there we stopped overnight at the Meridien Etoile (Rs. 21,000 on Monday ) and the room was so small that there was room for either us or for our suitcases.Its always hard to find a decent room in Paris at a reasonable price. I have stayed in a good-sized room (but not much service) at the four-star Hotel Banke (Rs 30,000) near the big department stores, which is a conversion of an old bank. (Hence the name.)And this time I was intrigued to stay at the one-year-old Hotel Brach, a small but central hotel (just 55 rooms) designed by Philippe Starck. I was not sure what to expect because while Starck made his reputation in the 1980s with New Yorks Royalton, his next hotel for the same company (Morgans run by Ian Schrager) went for a different look.Starck invented the design style of todays modern hip hotels, all dim lighting, dark colours, designer lobbies, bespoke furniture etc. His style has been copied and adapted so often (most famously by Jacques Garcia at Pariss Hotel Costes) that it is hard to tell whether a hotel has been designed by Starck or an imitator.Post-New York, Starck has changed track. The Royal Monceau (run by Raffles) in Paris is as idiosyncratic a design as, say, the Royalton (there are acoustic guitars in the suites!) but it is much cheerier. So when I heard that Starck had designed Brach, as a small intimate space at lower room rates than his usual properties, I was intrigued. (Brach costs Rs 30,000 or so. The Royal Monceau is around Rs 80-85,000.)As it turned out, I was hugely impressed, both by the hotel and by Starcks new aesthetic. Black is out. Bright is in. The rooms have lots of light, both from the sun (during the day) and from the numerous fittings. The furniture is comfortable and there are no awkward elements: no light switches you cant find, no fiddly shower settings, etc.I liked the little touches. The minibars were full, not just with the usual drinks but with small bottles of pre-mixed cocktails and loads of food from protein bars to unusual crisps to chocolates. Near the top of each wall was a rack packed out with pictures, art objects etc.It was a significant departure from the style that made Starck famous and I imagine it will also be as widely copied as the original.I liked the public spaces too. The restaurant was always full of Paris trendies but it had a relaxed, unhurried air to it with soft furnishings and shelves full of books. The lobby (on the first floor) opened out to a large terrace with armchairs and tables where you could get service. And most spectacular of all was a terrace garden with terrific views of Paris where they also grew vegetables. I saw a chicken coop near the tomato trees so I imagine that they have no difficulty in making a good coq au vin.Most surprising of all was the service: friendly, warm, efficient and gracious. This is not something you associate with hip hotels. If you are in the hospitality business, you should check out Brach. It is at least ten years ahead of anything we have in India.I ate twice at the Brach restaurant (they kept tables for hotel guests though it was always packed). The food comes from a trendy open kitchen, is North African-influenced and can be hit and miss. For instance, it was never clear to me why they destroyed a perfectly good Morrocan-style tenderloin tartare by dousing it in truffle oil. Surely truffle oil is not an essential ingredient in North African cuisine?Because I had time for only two proper meals in Paris, I thought I would go to the oldest and the newest restaurants I could find.The oldest was easy. Bofinger is a 134-year-old brasserie in the Marais district and claims to be the oldest continuously-running brasserie in the world. It has three different areas including the main room with a magnificent dome and though it is huge, it seems to be always full.Most foodie destinations in Paris are full of camera-phone wielding Chinese and other tourists but because Bofinger is outside the centre (in the Marais district), few foreign tourists venture there, despite its fame. At least  of the guests were French and some seemed to be regulars. (Its not family-run or anything, though. Since 1996, Bofinger has been owned by Jean-Paul Bucher who has also bought La Coupole and many other historic Paris restaurants.)Bofinger has some specialities. Regulars order the onion soup and so did I. But I found it kind of pheeka and a huge cheese-heavy crouton unbalanced the soup. The Alsatian choucroute is famous. The dish consists of sausages and other kinds of pork products on a bed of cabbage and the Bofinger version is pretty much a classic. My dessert, another brasserie standby, the Floating Island, was also made in the classic style to a very high standard.Bofinger is a Paris experience. But going once is enough.The newest significant restaurant in Paris was harder to find. Yannick Alleno is one of Frances most celebrated chefs. He has had three stars since 2007 when he was at the Hotel Meurice. In 2014, he took over Ledoyen, a famous Paris institution in the gardens off the Champs-lyses and Michelin gave him three stars again. In 2018, he opened a small sushi counter in the Ledoyen building and within six months, that got a Michelin star too.On October 7, he opened Pavyllon, a counter-seating restaurant in the same Ledoyen building. When French chefs have experimented with counter-seating (as many of them did after Joel Robuchon opened his first LAtelier), they have generally treated the counter outlets as places for simple food. (Though LAtelier in Hong Kong mysteriously has three stars: the one time I went there, it was one-star food at best.)Allenos place is more ambitious. He uses the chefs from his main restaurants and the service staff are told to conform to the standards of the main Ledoyen. Prices can be low (the cheap lunch is under 100 euro) or they can be high (a sprinkling of white-truffles on your cheese souffl can cost 94 euro); it is really up to you.I had no idea that the restaurant was opening when I asked my friend Bruce Palling, the British-Australian food and travel expert, to recommend a place for lunch in Paris. Bruce suggested Ledoyen and connected me to Allenos assistant. She wrote back to say that though the main restaurant was not open for lunch on the one day when I was free, they were about to open Pavyllon. Would I like to eat there instead?I said yes and so, a week after the restaurant opened and before the reviews had appeared, I found myself at the counter. There had been little publicity, only word of mouth and the other guests were largely French people who were regulars at Ledoyen.From the very beginning, the service was clearly patterned on the main three-star restaurant. I had a glass of champagne as an aperitif and the sommelier came to the table with a bowl of small kalamata olives and an empty plate. He had found, he said, that this champagne (Pierre Peters, Blanc de Blancs) went well with Parmigiano and olives. He then brought over a huge block of cheese and, with a sharp knife, scraped layers of Parmigiano on to the plate. (Yes, it was a perfect combination.)I ordered one of the set menus (in France, this is usually better value than a la carte) with the wine pairing. The sommelier re-appeared and said that there was no set pairing. He spoke to each guest and then chose the wines. What kind of wine did I like? I explained that when I talk to sommeliers at his level, I dont waste time showing off and discussing my taste in wines. I always put myself in the sommeliers hands and ask him to surprise me with wines I dont know.He did just that and served several unfamiliar wines (a sweet wine from Cyprus, a dry wine from the Tokai region of Hungary which is better known for sweet wine, a wine made in tiny quantities by Chapoutier in the Rhone valley for Alleno etc.) all of which he discussed in detail.The food was outstanding. Intensely flavoured pigeon, fresh mullet, a delicate salmon tart, a warm Comte cheese souffl with cubes of foie gras, a brilliant pistachio dessert and more. Throughout the meal, they kept up a steady stream of vegetable tempura (made with different kinds of mushroom, artichokes etc.) that were crisp and delicious.Later, at the end of the meal, when I chatted with Alleno, he said he was pleased with the tempura idea (his own, I presume) because it was important to have vegetables in the meal but he did not want to do them as side dishes. As for the food, well, he had tried to simplify his cuisine, but...I loved the experience. In any case, I love sitting at a counter in front of an open kitchen. I liked it when Allenos chefs came up and explained each dish. (Though many of them did not speak English so the French guests were at an advantage.)Will the food remain this good? At present, it is better than one star and near two stars in quality. But this is the opening team. Alleno was there himself. The chef from the Japanese restaurant was at the pass and so was one of Allenos most senior chefs who had formerly run his Dubai restaurant. The desserts were overseen by the groups Corporate Pastry Chef. The real test will come when the big guns move on.But one star is assured in the next Michelin. And as the food stabilises, another should follow.Its a breakthrough for counter dining in France.To read more on The Taste With Vir, click hereFollow more stories on Facebook and TwitterFirst Published: Oct 22, 2019 10:50 IST"

This is the only reason that the Turkish cuisine is fast making its name on the worldwide culinary platform.An important aspect of Turkish cuisine is whether a dish has meat in it or not. When a dish is cooked without any meat then its called zeytin yal which means cooked with olive oil, and are mostly served cold.The highlights of Turkish vegetarian and vegan cuisine are dolma and sarma, in which just about everything can be stuffed. The cuisine tends to be olive oil-based, giving an extra light flavour to so many delicious fresh veggies.Here are five delicious Turkish vegan dishes that you should surely savour Mucver just means fritters in general, and these are zucchini fritters with feta cheese, onion, and dill. The zucchini is either shredded or finely chopped and then fried in olive oil, typically with a touch of red pepper flakes sprinkled on top to give it just the slightest hint of a kick to it.

2019-10-22,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-commerce-minister-appeals-india-to-lift-onion-export-ban/articleshow/71708064.cms,Bangladesh commerce minister appeals India to lift onion export ban,"GUWAHATI: Bangladesh commerce minister Tipu Munshi on Tuesday appealed to India to lift the ban on onion export as people in his country is suffering because of escalating prices of the vegetable and are virtually cooking food without it.The ban on exporting onion to Bangladesh by India was sudden and without any prior intimation. As a commerce minister, I have to face relentless queries of people almost every day. If we had any prior information about the move, we would have made alternative arrangements, Munshi said at the inaugural session of the two-day India-Bangladesh Stakeholders Meet here on Tuesday.He added that Bangladesh has an onion deficit of about six lakh tons and 80% of his countrys onion demand is met from Indian export.Prior to the ban, there was a sudden increase in the export price of onion. After a few days, there was a ban on its export. I think the ban was imposed about one-and-half months back. Prior notice would have helped us to do something to tide over the crisis, Munshi said.The Bangladesh minister added that his country has started sourcing the vegetable from Egypt, Turkey and Myanmar . Its not the matter of cost that affects us in getting onion from other sources. The fact is that we are heavily dependent on Indias supply and suddenly when it stops, the hardship and the gap remain, said Munshi.He added that his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal had earlier told him that after the Maharashtra election, he would take up the matter of resuming onion supply. Now that the election is over, we are hopeful India will lift the ban soon, said Munshi.India had to stop onion export to Bangladesh after the extended monsoon affected the harvest. Export had to be banned to make onion available in the domestic market and check the spiraling prices."
2019-10-23,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/interview-about-chittoor-cuisine-with-home-chef-rajeshwarisivaprasad-puthalapattu/article29775594.ece,Let’s chat about Chittoor cuisine with home chef Rajeshwarisivaprasad Puthalapattu,"Those who keep up with television cooking programmes will know Rajeshwarisivaprasad Puthalapattu, her soft-spoken manner and tempting dishes; so it was only right that the micro-cuisine shes best known for is brought to the plates of the city at Rayalaseema Ruchulu.Rajeshwaris family has been celebrating Chittoor cuisine for many generations now and she explains its a necessity to keep the traditions going. If we keep celebrating Italian or Chinese food, why not the cuisines of the different regions just as much? the 39-year-old points out. Shes been very vocal about the domination of unhealthy milkshakes and popcorn taking over many snacking routines.Ask her whats so different about the Chittoor culinary techniques and she responds, One of the first things is that we dont use a lot of spice... nor do we use a lot of oil. In fact, there are some people who prefer non-vegetarian dishes with more oil, but that isnt part of the Chittoor approach. Rajeshwari was so particular about the cooking, that she even brought over her familys blend of ingredients to share with the diners.The Chittoor cuisine dates as far back as 100 years and its uniqueness lies in that there are Tamil influences in the dishes: low amounts of chilli and extremely subtle dashes in coconut. The best part of this type of cooking is theres a feast for both non-vegetarians and vegetarians, alike. There are even idli and dosa components here.Crab curry at Rayalaseema RuchuluSoups are an important part of Chittoors meals; the crab soup comes recommended for its health benefits, says Rajeshwari. We tend to use mud crabs as their shells are especially rich in minerals such as calcium. Crab is also beneficial to heart health for its high volumes of omega-3 fatty acids, and Ive seen a lot of people enjoy the detoxing effect before the main meal starts. Those with a less fishy-palate can opt for the tomato soup, which Rajeshwari has prepped as a rasam.The venchpam pappu is the dal Rajeshwari finalised as she says it captures the spirit of Chittoor and its agriculture the best. There are 15 pappus in the Chittoor cuisine alone, she explains, but it was easy to decide upon the venchpam pappu for its slight bitter aftertaste which is actually pleasant.She recommends the pappu to be mixed with hot white rice and ghee, and enjoyed as is. When you think rice and Rayalaseema, the immediate reference is ragi but Rajeshwari says takalipandu annam (tomato rice) and marval kodi pulao (chicken pulao) are integral to the meal.Marval kodi pulao (chicken pulao, home-style) at Rayalaseema Ruchulu, HyderabadThe sabzis are worth a second helping, purely because we dont see produce such as gorchikkudu (cluster beans) or items such as sundelu (boiled pulses) at a food festival. But authenticity is what Rajeshwari wanted here.For the meat eaters, there are dishes many would rather eat in the privacy of their own homes but Rajeshwari doesnt want diners to shy away: boti nanchu (lamb gizzard), nethili pakodi (fried anchovies) and kaalla pulusu (paya curry).Nethili pakodi (fried anchovies) at Rayalaseema Ruchulu, HyderabadSome like it hotFor those missing the fire in their bellies, Rajeshwari brings out a special karam chutney with ground onions; it packs quite a punch at the smallest pinch but the aftertaste will keep you going. To keep things balanced, the home chef offers nannari sherbath for that cooling effect while encouraging better digestion. In the hot and often arid Rayalaseema region, nannari is favoured.At the end, gulp down some rosemilk, a favourite for those in the Rajahmundry areas.After perusing all these dishes and their verbose names, ask Rajeshwari what her daily meal spread at home is like, and its not too different. I want my family to have meals comprising different flavours and textures, she explains proudly. We are, after all, the ambassadors of this cuisine so it should reflect every day.The Aha! Rayalaseema Food Festival is on till November 10 at Rayalseema Ruchulu in Jubilee Hills. Call 8688686886 for details"
2019-10-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bottoming-out-a-recovery-finally-far-produce-price-monsoon-6084732/,"Bottoming out: A recovery, finally?","Last week, the market research firm Nielsen released data that showed annual sales growth for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in rural India at 5% during July-September, down from 20% in the same quarter of 2018 and 10% in April-June 2019. Moreover, for the first time in seven years, rural FMCG growth, which typically used to be 1.5 times that of urban India, fell below the latters 8% for the latest reported quarter.AdvertisingBut amidst this overall dismal picture, some early signs of green shoots are visible.To start with, we have inflation numbers based on the consumer price index (CPI). For 36 months running, from September 2016 to August 2019, consumer food inflation trailed general CPI inflation. This extended period of low food price increases  an average of 1.38% year-on-year, unprecedented in India  has seemingly ended. For September 2019, CPI food inflation stood at 5.11%, as against 3.99% for overall consumer inflation.The improved price sentiment for farm produce is also borne out by the rates for kharif crops that are arriving in wholesale mandis of the country. In most cases, these, even while ruling below the minimum support prices declared by the Narendra Modi government for the 2019-20 season, are more than what they were at this time last year. The turnaround, as the accompanying table reveals, is most significant in pulses and soyabean. Only for cotton are prices lower relative to last year.AdvertisingHowever, it is not only the MSP crops. Onion in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market is trading at an average of Rs 3,500 per quintal, compared to Rs 1,550 a year ago. Farmers in the state are also receiving Rs 28-29 for a litre of cow milk containing 3.5% fat and 8.5% solids-not-fat, which is better than the corresponding last years levels of Rs 23-24. Prices of red chilli (the high-pungency Teja variety) in Gunturs Mirchi Yard are today around Rs 16,000 per quintal, up from Rs 9,000-10,000 one year back.One reason for prices looking up is heavy rains across central, western and southern India through September and the current month. The monsoons late withdrawal has caused damage to the kharif crop that was at maturity stage (especially soyabean in Madhya Pradesh) and also led to delayed harvesting of urad (black gram), moong (green gram), onion and assorted vegetables. In maize, yields have been impacted by infestation of the fall armyworm insect pest, apart from drought conditions in Maharashtra and Karnataka till late-July. Many farmers in Maharashtra are reported to have diverted their maize crop for fodder well before it had reached grain formation stage.Another reason for price recovery is supply pressures. These, in turn, are a result of sustained low prices in the recent past. In milk, for instance, not getting good prices over the last four years or more has led to farmers gradually reducing herd sizes or underfeeding their animals. The effects of that are being felt now, with dairies having to pay higher procurement prices. They are being forced to do so also because of the drought-induced fodder and feed shortages, which should ease in the coming months with the monsoons spectacular recovery after July.The above firming up of prices is, perhaps, the only heartening piece of news for the Indian economy buffeted by a consumption slowdown on top of a prolonged investment slump. Moreover, the country has recorded its best southwest monsoon since 1994. The excess rains have not only helped substantially recharge the groundwater table and aquifers, but also resulted in water levels in 120 major reservoirs being filled to 89.1% of their full capacities, as against the last 10-years average storage of 71.6% at this time. The positive effect of this will be seen in the upcoming rabi season.The best case scenario will be if the present price uptrend  actually, a recovery from lows  holds and, together with a bumper rabi crop, would deliver the much-needed boost to farm incomes after April. That will, to a great deal, depend on policymakers tolerance to price increases, even of an episodic nature.The Modi governments first term was marked by general hawkishness, reflected in the frequent resort to export restrictions, duty-free imports and imposition of stocking restrictions on farm produce at the slightest hint of inflationary pressures. In its present term, this approach has been witnessed so far only vis--vis onions, where both export ban and stock limits on the trade are in place.It remains to be seen whether the Modi government will be emboldened to look beyond temporary supply disruptions to take the next big reform step  of dismantling all controls on marketing, movement, stocking and export of agricultural produce. The timing cannot be better than now, when farm prices have bottomed out and production prospects for the rabi season seem particularly bright on the back of probably the best monsoon in quarter of a century. This is something that FMCG companies and two-wheeler makers, too, would certainly look forward to."

Cocooned in our corner, eavesdropping on the cheery table of Korean businessmen beside us, we sip a refreshing blend of kiwi muddled with soju, and topped with litchi juice.In keeping with the restaurants name, Kabuki, which is a classical form of Japanese theatre, a waiter enters ceremoniously carrying a large pot filled with simmering dashi broth. He is followed by another bearing a tray with artfully-arranged Chinese cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, celery, tofu and thinly-sliced pork, jiggly with flavour-packed fat.As the pot begins to bubble, the waiter carefully puts in each ingredient, leaving it to gently simmer together. The result is an elegant, nuanced and fairly healthy dish, ideal for a group of friends: After all, chasing mushrooms in a bowl with chopsticks forces you to be companionable.There is more drama with flaming sushi, where a chef attacks a plate of sushi with a blow torch, then apologetically dabs it with soy. Great for Instagram stories, perhaps, but the result is a weak chaos of fish, soy and BBQ: the very opposite of the pleasingly austere clarity of flavour that classic Japanese cuisine represents.Unlike many traditional sushi restaurants, Kabuki does not embrace minimalism. This is not a bad thing: Chennai has enough competent, straight-laced Japanese restaurants.Kabuki @ 54, Valluvar Kottam High Road, NungambakkamHits: Kakiage, mizutakiKakiage, mizutaki Misses: Flaming sushiFlaming sushi Meal for two: 1,5001,500 43562299Instead, Kabukis team, lead by Chef Yasuyuki Tsuruyama, who hails from Akita, has chosen sections of Japanese cuisine that will appeal to a young, local audience hankering for a post-work space to kick back, Thirsty Crow style. Hence, expect fried prawn noodles, bowls of spicy chicken mince ramen and burnt garlic fried rice. We try the tuna teriyaki, featuring delicate slices of tuna framed in crisp skin, and served with a rich, sweet and salty sauce.This is followed by seafood kakiage, an unsteady tower of julienned carrots, zucchini, capsicum and caramelised onions, interspersed with prawns and squid. It is unpretentious, and addictive in the way that only deftly deep-fried food can be, with crunchy corners, fluffy interiors and interlaced flavours held together by crisp tempura batter.Refreshingly, in an age when food is tediously high brow, with chefs vying with each other to aspire for authenticity, Kabuki has decided to focus on crowd pleasers. Whether it is the music, which is defiantly all Ed Sheeran and John Legend, or the fruity cocktails, or the abundance of rice bowls, tempura and ramen.Sushi is a demanding dish, and sourcing ingredients for it is both difficult and expensive. Retaining good chefs is every restaurateurs biggest challenge, and gets tougher for speciality restaurants like this, where the pool of talent is smaller. In this setting, simple Japanese cooking that appeals to a wider range of people is a practical way to go.When you visit, though the menu is exhaustive, pick simple, seasonal dishes. And remember, everything is better with sake. Or rather, Korean soju, which is much easier to source in Chennai. For Kabuki is practical, right down to its cocktails."

Cue all-white omelettes, boiled-whites in salad, and a yolkless life.Youre missing out. Egg yolks are not the enemy. The yellow bit makes up 34% of the weight and contains half the protein. The albumen or white portion is merely less fatty, which is why it fits into formal ideas of what to eat.If you eat the egg with the yolk, heres what you get: more calcium, copper, iron, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc. And Vitamins D, B6, B12 and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.Dr Zubeda Tumbi, clinical nutritionist, says the best way to cook eggs is to boil, poach or scramble them or add lots of vegetables. Think of a Spanish omelette with the works - tomato, capsicum, bell peppers, coriander, mint, spring onions, mushrooms and spinach.Just avoid going overboard. Yolks are said to be a source of dietary cholesterol associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke, says Dr Tambi. Still you wont get those from yolks alone. Your disease resistance will depend on your hormones, other dietary components, lifestyle, and family history, says Dr Tumbi.First Published: Oct 26, 2019 19:23 IST"
2019-10-26,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/oct/26/family-feasts-and-firecrackers-2052966.html,"Family, feasts and firecrackers","Vaishali Vijaykumar ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Early morning oil bath, boxes of multi-coloured crackers from Sivakasi, brass tins filled with syrupy jangiris and bonding with family. Diwali is a gala event at TD Sadasivams home. A week before Diwali, the house starts buzzing with festive preparation. The retired businessmans two brothers, seven sisters, and their extended family gather to share goodies, gossip and gifts, and burst crackers at the crack of dawn.My father TS Duraiswami was a respected and well-known eye surgeon in town. He maintained a good relationship with north Indians who were his patients. They consider Diwali to be an auspicious day to open new accounts for their businesses. Every year on the evening of Diwali, hed take my sisters to their houses. Theyd end up bringing sweet boxes in abundance that we used to relish for weeks, reminisces Sadasivam, who continues to live in their 84-year-old ancestral house on Madley Road in T Nagar.Of jangiris and nadaswaramLike in most south Indian homes, Diwali mornings at the Sadasivam house too began with an oil bath. The mothers in the family oiled their childrens hair. The bath was followed by gulping down balls of Diwali legiyam. A Mangalorean home chef used to come home to prepare seer bakshanam. Those days, there were not many sweet shops. The chef who came to our house was an expert in making jangiri. He used to effortlessly make 600-700 jangiris that was emptied in three days, mostly by me. Fearing that I would bring many friends and finish off the sweets, the boxes used to be locked up. With time, tins were replaced by aluminium vessels from Karaikudi. The size of the vessels came down and so did the consumption. The chef does not come anymore. We mostly buy from reputed shops, and my wife makes ukkarai, a heirloom sweet, he says.A private nadaswaram recital is a Diwali ritual in the Sadasivam house. Many nadaswaram families reside in the same neighbourhood as ours. Theyve been playing for several generations now. Even today, the day is not complete until we hear them play their hearts out. The sound from the instrument lifts our festive mood and brings forth an auspicious feeling, he says.Diwali drapesShopping was a major affair at Sadasivams house. The children of the house wore new clothes and sought blessings from grandparents and elders, and received money as a form of blessing. There was always excessive clothing for the siblings to pick from. Pant-and-shirt or white dhotis were conventional attire for men, which were bought from Bombay General Stores in the erstwhile China Bazaar on NSC Bose Road. His mother shopped for the women of the house. Nallis is a family favourite. Sometimes, saris were even delivered to their house.Mehendi green was a newly introduced colour around 40 years back. I was fond of double-shade saris and double-sided border. During bigger occasions like weddings and family functions, we used to call the weavers home and select together. Earlier, we used to shop for our house help too. Nowadays theyve also become choosy, so we prefer giving them money. This is a shocking contrast compared to our days where the smallest of gifts were appreciated, says Sadasivams wife, Prema.Cracking crackersSadasivam and his brothers used to spend all day bursting crackers. But equally aware of the lack around them, they shared their crackers with the underprivileged kids of the area. His son and daughter  TS Maheshwar and Aiyshwarya Ravishankar  share a similar fondness for bursting crackers.As kids, we used to either get it from a factory in Sivakasi or go to Parrys and buy from Standard and wholesale markets. Spending `1,000 on crackers, 30 years back, was a big deal.With that money, you will hardly get two boxes now. We were cracker fanatics, says Maheshwar. They used to buy so many crackers that it would last for Karthigai Deepam and even for next Diwali. Bursting with friends and family gave us an adrenaline rush. Parachute and rockets are our favourites. The whole family comes and watches it go up in the air and explode into colours. The best ones like a 10,000 wala or 20,000 wala is reserved for the last. We used to burst good quality crackers. Thats not the case anymore, be it the cost or quality, he says adding that his list of new crackers to buy this year is ready.Cooking up a stormDiwali is the only festival where the feast begins the previous night. Idli and onion sambhar is staple breakfast on the day of the festival. A day-long process of wheat halwa preparation used to begin at home the previous evening while I was growing up. My aunt and my mother prepared the delicacies earlier so that we could take fresh, hot bites. Now the number of sweets has gone down. Were relying so much on shops that the authenticity is lost.Earlier, there was a homely touch. We used to order only from selective shops 10 days before the festival since there was so much demand. Now, every nook-and-corner has varieties, says Aiyshwarya whose husband R Ravishankar works in Ethiopia. They have a son and daughter  Skanda and Jayani Ravishankar.Last-minute shoppingYears have passed, generations have changed, but Maheshwar says there is one constant. Women have more choices than men, he laughs. As a child, I used to make a sad face since the only options we had were a shirt and pant or a t-shirt and trouser. To compensate for that Id get a couple of more dresses than my sister.Keeping up with their family-made tradition, the members always leave shopping till the day before Diwali. Those days, Nallis used to be open 24 hours on the day before Diwali. My brother used to go at midnight, and mom and I would go at around 3 am to buy our clothes. There was no crowd then. Silk pattu pavadai was mandatory, says Aiyshwarya.The whole town used to be in a frenzy. We used to go to Pondy Bazaar only to see the lights. Shopping for Diwali was special. Nine yards had so many varieties and salwar kameez was just coming into vogue in the city. Our parents also used to explain the privilege of having money to buy what we wanted. These were simple values that we imbibed even from casual conversations. Wed also make it a point to celebrate the evening at our grandparents houses, says Harypriya, Maheswars wife. The couple has a daughter, Narayani Maheshwar.Changing timesGone are those days when a few things were available only for Diwali. People have the money to splurge whenever they want. Those days, families had to rely on bonuses. Weve all become materialistic. The sense of togetherness and bonding is missing. Neighbours used to look forward to Diwali for sweets from our home but now we buy and give it from shops. The significance and value for things have gone down, she says.Gadgets, festive film releases and partying with friends  Diwali celebrations might have changed with time, but few traditions continue to keep the lights sparkling."
2019-10-27,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/an-all-new-midday-meal-menu-for-students/article29808569.ece,An all-new midday meal menu for students,"Children across the State can look forward to a new menu for their midday meal. The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has revised the fare to include more vegetables and greens, with the aim of ensuring that the food served is more nutritious. It will be introduced on November 1 to all students in government schools.The revamp of the menu comes in the backdrop of criticism from various quarters, including nutritionists and the State Food Commission. Non-governmental organisations, who are part of the midday meal programme, will also have to adhere to the same menu, department officials said.Department officials have been told to conduct regular inspection to ensure that the new menu is adhered to. According to the norms by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the midday meal should have at least 450 calories and 12 grams protein for students from classes 1 to 5, while students from classes 6 to 10 should have 700 calories and 20 gm of protein.N. Krishnamurthy, chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Food, said the new menu appeared to be promising and was designed as a wholesome meal. Earlier, on several days of the week, students would get rice and sambar and this was monotonous. Large quantities of food were wasted and we also found during our visits to schools that many students brought their own lunch boxes.Question of eggsVarious activists have also been batting for eggs to be included in the noon meals, but it has not been approved. There is no doubt of the nutritive value and the high protein content in eggs. The government should provide this in school immediately. It is also important to note that at no point will kids be compelled to eat eggs; a fruit will be given to students if they do not consume eggs, said Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher, who is part of the Right to Food Campaign and Jan Swasthya Abhiyan campaignsThe quality of food served to children is a matter of concern as malnutrition is prevalent in the State. According to the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS) data for Karnataka (2015-16), 36.2% of the children below the age of five are stunted, while 26.1% are wasted. The same survey also reveals that 10.5% of the children were severely wasted, while 35.2% are underweight.In Karnataka, 8.6 lakh of the total 53.47 lakh students are served midday meals provided by NGOs. Other students are served food cooked by midday meal workers in the kitchen located in their school. Ingredients are procured locally. In fact 8,923 schools across Karnataka have kitchen gardens and the vegetables and greens grown on the campus go directly into the meals cooked.Govt. wants onion to be includedLike in the old menu, the new one, too, specifies that onions need to be included in all meals. However, one of the NGOs, Akshaya Patra Foundation, which has a contract for midday meals, does not serve onions or garlic. Although the department had initially refused to sign a contract with them, it later relented. Officials pointed out that they were forced to relent as they did not find an alternative to supply these meals.When contacted, a spokesperson for Akshaya Patra Foundation said that they had not seen the revised menu and could therefore not comment on it. Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher, who is part of the Right to Food Campaign and Jan Swasthya Abhiyan campaigns, said, No matter what menu the government chalks out, some organisations do what they want and the government should now be in control and ensure the implementation."

Experts suggest easy ways to shed the calories,"No festival feels complete without indulging in sweets and fried savouries  so much so that at times most of us lose control and end up overeating. However there are still some people who practice restrain and are able to stop themselves from going overboard, others tend to gain weight in the process and then end up spending hours at the gym trying to shed those additional calories. Trust us, its a constant struggle, much like Union Minister Smriti Irani recently pointed out in her Instagram post.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Smriti Irani (@smritiiraniofficial) on Oct 26, 2019 at 3:12am PDTWe couldnt agree more. Surrounded by sweets like barfis, laddoos, soan papdi, kaju katli and rosogullas and variety of snacks, binge eating becomes a common phenomenon. By the time the festival season is over, it leaves us feeling bloated, unwell and not in prime shape.ALSO READ | What is the Fast 800 diet?AdvertisingIn case you too have eaten more than you should have during the week-long festivities and are now looking to shed those extra calories by eating healthy, here is what experts have to say.Neha Pathania, chief nutritionist, Paras Hospital recommends a detox regimen after a calorie-high festival week. During Diwali, its hard to be virtuous about your diet when youre surrounded by mounds of laddoos, barfi and namkeen treats. Follow a detox regimen to get back to your healthy self. Detoxifying helps you cleanse your system of all the toxins imbibed from all the calorie-laden foods youve been eating. It also helps in speeding up metabolism and enhancing overall health due to the presence of antioxidants, she tells indianexpress.com.View this post on Instagram A post shared by    (@camera_bondi_golpo) on Oct 28, 2019 at 2:28am PDTSo, what should you have? Think of green vegetables, fruits, and whole ingredients. Detox foods include spinach, red and green peppers, tomatoes, and fruits like grapes, oranges, melons, apples, and bananas. Add cinnamon, ginger and grated garlic in your dishes. This would reduce the inflammatory chemicals your body has been producing because of too many mithais, shares Avni Kaul, nutritionist, wellness coach, and certified diabetic educator, founder, NutriActivania.However, experts point out that it is always better to take small steps to achieve a bigger goal. Detoxifying can be done by just changing your diet, such as eating more fresh salads, advises Kaul. Consume raw vegetables and fruits like cucumber, carrots, radish, onions, tomatoes, oranges, papaya, apples before every meal. Raw foods will make you feel amazing and are known for eradicating toxins and healing your body quickly, she says.AdvertisingSince Diwali sweets are mostly made of milk and milk products, maida and sugar in high amounts, it is good to keep a check on consumption of refined products after the festivities are over, advises Dr Pramod Tripathi, founder, Freedom from Diabetes. Since milk contains IGF factor (insulin-like growth factor) which does not allow insulin to work properly, it should be avoided by diabetics. It is also recommended that refined products like sugar and maida be avoided. All these products not only raise your sugar levels but also hamper your system, he points out.Dietician Shikha Mahajan, holistic nutritionist, Diet Podium, says that the ideal way to start with a healthy eating plan is to cut all carbs from your diet, except some light fruits. This will help cut out the retained water and get you rid of bloating. She adds that no intake of salt can help flush out excess water and toxins in the body.ALSO READ | National Nutrition Week 2019: Why rainbow diet matters?However, if one chooses to detox for more than a day, its important to consume more protein, advises Mahajan. If you do a detox for longer than a day, you must make sure that you get two portions of lean protein like chicken, fish, egg white or tofu every day. This will make your detox sustainable and help you follow through, she explains.The thumb rule is to drink more water, which is often not the case. There is no point in doing a detox if you will forget to hydrate. Detox can be extremely dehydrating if you dont have enough water. Also, the toxins can only be flushed out with water. Add lemon to warm water and drink it three-four times a day, states Mahajan.Remember these easy tips for a detoxDrink lukewarm water with lemonTake a glass of warm water with half a lemon squeezed in. Have it on empty stomach; you can also sip that with cucumber cut into your water bottle throughout the day. Drinking lemon water in the morning helps flush out toxins and sugar from the body, which is good for weight loss. It also helps relieve problems like acidity, bloating, burping and heartburn.Cut down sugar intakePost Diwali your body is still coping with all the excesses, so try to cut down on your sugar intake, fats and processed carbohydrates. If you drink tea or coffee everyday, then avoid putting sugar into it. No matter how much you are craving for leftover sweets, try to have a slice of fruit instead. Eliminate all fried foods from your diet. Also, limit your intake of chapattis or rice and carbohydrates. Cut back on the portions of your food and try dividing your meals into 5-6 portions rather than three large meals a day. Consume more raw, steamed or sauted vegetables.Take out time for exerciseDont bother to join a gym or invest in fancy equipment to burn some calories. Walk for 30-45 minutes daily. Try taking the stairs instead of the lift. Do what you enjoy the most! If you enjoy dancing, get up and groove. The key is to do something daily which helps burn calories at a steady pace.Eat only home-cooked mealsRestaurant and street food may be tasty but are loaded with oil, salt, starch and sugar. If you cook at home, you have control over the ingredients and cooking methods. You can easily prepare a nourishing meal like khichdi and chaach rather than ordering food from outside.Include healthy fatsHealthy fats like nuts, seeds, egg yolk, avocado, coconut and ghee will enhance the results of your detox. These are especially helpful for those who are showing toxicity in their skin, hair, under-eye, etc, as they rejuvenate the dullest of skin.SleepGet at least seven hours of sleep per night so the body can recoup the damage and start healing from within."

The initial estimation of procurement was 10-12 lakh tons in the period between September 15 and December 15 this year, but there has been poor response due to the prevailing situation, said a NAFED official. He said restrictions on mobile and Internet services as well as transportation challenges hindered procurement.There is no target (for procurement). We have been asked to buy from the mandis.

Suresh Kumar on Monday said that he would visit schools in order to get their input on the midday meals.Speaking at a press conference, the Minister said he would like to get first-hand information from the students on whether they liked the midday meals or not. If he found that students were carrying tiffin boxes from home, he would ask them whether they disliked the noon meals in school. Mr. Suresh Kumar was responding to a controversy over one of the non-governmental organisations, Akshaya Patra Foundation (APF), which supplies midday meals to students without using onion or garlic. The new menu specifies that onions need to be included in all meals. Although the department had initially refused to sign a contract with them prior to this academic year, it later relented. In Bengaluru alone, APF provides meals to 1.83 lakh students in 1,212 schools.However, S.R. Umashankar, Principal Secretary of the department, defended the foundation saying that they had found that the food served by APF to students meets nutritional norms. They are adding other ingredients to replace onion and garlic, he said."

Vast tracts of agriculture and horticulture fields were inundated.According to the Horticulture Department, onion was cultivated on 5,306 ha of Tarikere and 806 ha of Kadur taluks. Of that, the crop in 2,561 ha was lost in the rains. The extent of loss in Tarikere was the highest as crop cultivated on 2,500 ha was affected.Rangaswamy, a resident of Hanne village (Attimagge panchayat) in Tarikere taluk, said many in his village lost their onion crop. Many fields are flooded. We were expecting at least 100 bags of onions from an acre. Even if a 50-kg bag sold at 1,000, we would have got 1 lakh per acre. But, now it has become difficult to harvest the yield, forget selling it in the market, he said.Given the rates prevailing in the open market, they were all expecting up to 50 a kg. Now they are not sure of even recovering what they spent on seeds, fertilizers, and labour.A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu that around 50% to 60% of the farmers had harvested the crop, but those who hadnt have suffered loss.We have rough figures on the loss based on preliminary reports. The survey to assess the actual loss has begun. We will submit the report to the State government once the survey is complete, he said.

In the case of hill states, such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the Centres share of funding is higher at 90%.Onion prices more than doubled in many cities since August. They have since settled at around Rs 50-55 a kg in retail markets. During times of normal supply, retail prices usually range between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg.Heavy rains during August-September in Maharashtra, the biggest onion producing state, as well in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, disrupted onion shipments to northern India as well as other parts of country. Unseasonal rains could have damaged nearly 30% of the onion crop in Maharashtra, said Shirish Jamdade, an official in the states horticulture department.The main summer onion crop  sown during May-June and harvested in October-November  accounts for just 15% of the countrys annual output. Yet, this crop is critical because it replenishes markets at a time when they generally run out stocks from previous harvests.Traders who rely on stocked onions they set aside for such seasonal shortages then up prices, leading to inflationary spells.According to data from the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation, rain-led disruptions caused onion arrivals at wholesale markets in September to slump to 3.5 million quintals until September 25, from about 6 million quintals in the previous year.Higher production in northern states can ease supply shocks in eastern states such as Bihar, West Bengal and the north-east, an official with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.During the price spiral last month, metros such as Mumbai and Delhi were the worst hit, and retail onion and tomato prices soared to Rs 75-80/kg.Sowing of the countrys main summer onion crop was delayed by over a month in Maharashtra due to a sluggish start to this years monsoon in June, which pushed back harvests in what is a lean season, another reason for the price spike.On September 13, the Union government curbed exports by raising the minimum export price (MEP) of onion to $850 a tonne (about Rs 62,000). Imposition of MEP makes an Indian-origin commodity expensive for foreign buyers, thereby discouraging shipments abroad.As prices failed to cool, the government then imposed a ban on export of onions on September 29 to augment domestic supply and cool prices.The horticulture mission, under which onion output is sought to be raised in northern states, will aim at productivity increases through improved varieties, quality seeds and planting materials, the official cited above said. The mission also aims to promote subsidised greenhouse cultivation and horticulture mechanisation.If implemented properly, the proposal for higher production within northern states can fulfil demand during the lean phase. But the scheme may need to offer some form of subsidy and be also backed by higher procurement of onions, said Alok Kumar, a former horticulture scientist at the Indian Council of Agriculture Research. The government usually buys onions from farmers to build a buffer stock; this stood at 44,205 tonnes in June 2019.Price spikes in onions increases overall food inflation, potentially upsetting the Reserve Banks inflation target. Higher inflation can cut economic growth and affect businesses by making borrowing expensive.Onions are the second most consumed vegetable in the country after potatoes. An average Indian household spends 13% of its total vegetable bill on onions alone, according to HTs calculations from the 2011-12 (latest available figures) Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) conducted by the National Sample Survey Office. CES is the most authoritative source of consumption data in India. To be sure, spending on vegetables was just 10% and 9% of total food spending in rural and urban India in 2011-12. Cereals, milk, and milk products had the biggest share in food consumption in India.Onions have an overall weightage of 1.7% in the food inflation basket. According to a calculation of Kotak Institutional Equities Ltd, assuming a 50% rise in onion prices on an annual basis, wholesale food inflation would swing up by 80 basis points. That translates to a rise of 30 basis points in retail food inflation. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.First Published: Oct 31, 2019 00:23 IST"

It was the first formal test of support for the impeachment probe and showed that Democrats have enough backing in the House to later bring formal charges, known as articles of impeachment, against Trump if they feel they have enough evidence.House Democrats say Trump has abused his office for personal gain and jeopardized national security by asking Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to investigate Trumps Democratic political rival Joe Biden, a former U.S. vice president, and his son Hunter, who had served as a director for Ukrainian energy company Burisma.Biden is a leading candidate in the Democratic presidential nomination race to face Trump in the November 2020 election. Its a sad day. No one comes to Congress to impeach a president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the vote.AdvertisingRepublicans have largely stuck by Trump, blasting the effort as a partisan exercise that has given them little input. This is Soviet-style rules, said Representative Steve Scalise, the chambers No. 2 Republican, as he stood next to a poster depicting the famous onion domes of Moscows St. Basils Cathedral.The vote largely broke along party lines. Only two Democrats voted against and no Republicans backed it. Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the inquiry a sham.If the House eventually votes to impeach Trump, that would set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump would not be removed from office unless votes to convict him by a two-thirds margin."

It might be the food trend of 2020,"It looks like India will trend like a turmeric latte, in 2020. Granted, that is high praise mainly for an avocado toast-eating, moringa-quaffing demographic. However, it is undeniably interesting that the first official set of food predictions for next year  released by Amazon Whole Foods  has many ideas that are already integral to desi kitchens.Flour powerThis will be a year of alternative flours, which Whole Foods says are entering the market, making baking more inclusive and adventurous. The report states that 2020 will bring more interesting fruit and vegetable flours into home pantries... They predict that packaged goods will start using tigernut flour (a root vegetable that grows in Northern Africa) in snack foods, and pastries will be made with seed flour blends.While India just has to look towards its villages to relearn how to make bajra rotis, ragi dosas and amaranth parathas. There has also been an interest in alternative flours here, as people look for healthier options to replace a wheat and rice-dominant diet. Green jackfruit flour has been gaining ground, used to make everything from porridge to samosas. Also look out for green banana flour, which surfaced last year in cafs. As for seed flour pastry: kaju katli anyone?Out-of-the-Box, Into-the-Fridge SnackingIn 2020, forecasters expect to see refrigerators stocked with the kind of wholesome, fresh snacks typically prepared and portioned in advance at home: hard-boiled eggs with savoury toppings, pickled vegetables, drinkable soups...With consumers asking more questions about what ingredients go into their food, manufacturers are vying with each other to create clean snacks.Think of every tiffin box your grandmother and mother have ever packed. Indians cornered the market on freshly made, Out-of-the-Box, Into-the-Fridge snacks decades ago, which is not unusual. After all, before the flood of heavily processed packaged food, children everywhere had no option but to eat a banana when they were hungry between meals.However, Indian households are not that different today  even in a food culture swamped by nachos. Not convinced? Try telling your parents you are planning to buy hard-boiled eggs with savoury toppings from the supermarket. And brace for an onslaught of dabbas filled with paneer burji, sesame laddoos or still warm mooli parathas.Rethinking the kids menuBy 2026, 80% of millennials will have children. This is the generation growing up on sushi lunches, prosciutto-punctuated European holidays and tempeh burgers. Brace yourself. These mini-gourmands will be correcting your pronunciation and pesto with equal lan soon.Also on the list Regenerative Agriculture: Farmers, academics, Government agencies and retailers are joining hands, looking at land and animal management practices to improve soil health, encourage biodiversity and address climate change.Foods from West Africa: Brands are looking to West Africa for superfoods like moringa and tamarind, as well as cereals such as sorghum, fonio, teff and millet.Plant-Based, Beyond Soy: In 2020, the trendiest brands are slowing down on soy, replacing it instead with innovative blends (like grains and mung beans) to mimic the creamy textures of yoghurts and other dairy products.Everything Butters and Spreads: Expect to see watermelon seed butter, chickpea butter and creamy vegan spreads touted as paleo- and keto-friendly.Zero-Proof Drinks: Unique non-alcoholic options are popping up everywhere. Recreate classic cocktail flavours using distilling methods typically reserved for alcohol. Alt-gin for gin and tonics and botanical-infused faux spirits for a faux martini, for example.According to the report, restaurants are taking sophisticated young palates into consideration, creating menus that include more food that is fermented, spiced or rich in umami flavours.The Indian angle? Traditionally, we never really believed in childrens menus anyway. Children were always encouraged to eat what their parents ate, thus developing a taste for a wide range of flavours and textures, whether it is a bitter gourd fry, fermented kanji or healthy stir fries made with local varieties of spinach. It helps that we have a food culture that is so diverse, you never really run out of meal options, especially if you swap recipes with friends and relatives around the country.Not-So-Simple SugarsFirst there was sugar. Then came a rush of substitutes. Then, they were replaced by stevia, honey and maple syrup.Next year, expect syrupy reductions from fruit sources like monk fruit, pomegranate, coconut and dates, says the report, adding they will contribute concentrated, unique flavours into recipes for desserts, meat glazes and marinades. They also expect to see syrups made from starches like sorghum and sweet potato.Meanwhile, back home, jaggery still reigns supreme. Most often used for traditional desserts like payasams, chikkis and halwas, it is increasingly replacing white sugar in even more westernised recipes, like granola, cakes and cookies.Check out your local market and organic stores to shop a wide variety, in different forms from bricks to syrups. In winter, source Kolkatas delicious nolen gur, made from the date palm. Another option: Locally made, high-quality coconut sugar.Meat-plant blendsWhats new? Homemade, fridge-stored food; nut butters; fruit-based flours are some trends predicted by Amazon Whole FoodsButchers and meat brands will get on board the plant-based craze, according to the Whole Foods report. But they are not going vegetarian. The report quotes James Beard Foundations Blended Burger Project, a movement to make burgers healthier, more environment friendly and economical by blending in fresh mushrooms.The Indian kitchen has always been frugal with meat, finding practical ways to make it go further  motivated more by economics than health, to be honest. Which is why fish and meat cutlets are made with potato, and heavily flavoured with onions, chillies and garam masala.There are also many dishes that cleverly combine nutritious vegetables with meat to create more balanced meals, like the Bengali prawn and pumpkin curry, or Naga galho, a soupy blend of rice, seasonal greens and smoked pork."

She works in a kitchen that is open on all sides. It spills into a caf on the right, where an intern lines up boxes heavy with freshly harvested herbs for the community. As the cook shouts out that breakfast is ready, pouring steamy tea into a row of steel tumblers, farm workers slowly meander in for breakfast.In the centre of it all, is Englishman-turned-Aurovillian Krishna Mckenzie, in a turban and lungi, giving his team precise, rapid-fire instructions in fluent Tamil. He spoons steaming varagu (kodo millet) into his bowl, topping it with a ladle of vegetable curry, between urging everyone to pause for breakfast. Then, he eats quickly, checking his cracked, clearly hard-working phone between spoonfuls.There is a lot going on at Solitude these days. The cafs organic lunches are gaining popularity, as are the farm visits Krishna hosts on Saturdays. Their fruit and vegetable baskets go out three times a week to subscribers in Auroville and Puducherry. In a mission to educate people on the benefits of locally grown food, Solitude has also started hosting cooking classes, as well as workshops on permaculture.Taking a break, Krishna stretches out under the trees with a glass of tart soursop juice. Looking around his six-acre farm, vibrant with about 140 varieties of local herbs and vegetables, he explains how Solitude, which started in 1996, thrives on do-nothing farming, inspired by Japanese zen master and farmer Masanobu Fukuoka. (A proponent of natural farming, Masanobu is the author of the influential The One-Straw Revolution.)Teenage beginningsI was 19 when I came here, says Krishna, adding that India felt like home right from the beginning, perhaps because he studied at the J Krishnamurti School, Brockwood Park, in Hampshire, UK.When I first came to Auroville, in January 1993, we had no mobiles or Internet. We used to meet and plant trees, he states, adding that his interest in farming was cemented by a chance encounter in 2003, when he was visiting Vandana Shivas farm in Dehradun.Masanobu was there, in a white beard and indigo robes... He explained how we cannot improve Nature. Instead by observing her natural processes and systems, we can achieve very high yields. His techniques were defined by his region, bioregion and topography...Krishna springs up and dives into the farm, ducking through water sprinklers. He scoops up a handful of rich, moist soil wriggly with earthworms. We need to honour soil. Healthy soil results in nutritional diversity.Pivoting around, he says, There is incredible variety here, and we did not even plant many of our indigenous greens. They spring up when you nurture the soil. We have Malabar spinach, amaranth and roselle, in addition to a range of keerais: kori keerai (waterleaf), agathi keerai, moringa, manathakkali, ponnanganni... We have medicinal herbs, like mudakathan (balloon vine), thoothuvalai (solanum) and guduchi (giloy)... They do not need a lot of water to grow, and thrive in this climate.Krishnas mission now is to convince people to expand their culinary horizons. Subscribers get what is in season, he says, rifling through a basket. This week, there is spring onion, bottle gourd, green papaya, ridge gourd... He holds up a bunch of greens, punctuated with bright blue flowers. This is the juice kit: soursop, tulsi, hibiscus and clitoria ternatea flower. (Also known as the butterfly pea, the flower, in demand at trendy cafs around the globe, grows wild at Solitude.)When we adopt the principles of permaculture, plants start emerging everywhere. Where did this sundakkai (turkey berry) come from? asks Krishna, pointing at a hardy plant. I have no idea, he shrugs. We planted about 24 fruit trees, then added papaya, turmeric, pineapples and drumstick around them, followed by tomatoes, ladies fingers and greens. Then the volunteers turned up: chillies, ponnanganni, nannari (sarsaparilla)... we did not plant those. They were free!Tradition on a plateThe produce makes its way into Solitudes restaurant, which specialises in serving healthy, traditional thalis. We cook local food that represents the cultural, nutritional heritage of this bioregion, says Krishna. Sundakkai sambar, green papaya kara kuzhambu, tapioca chips, ragi adai, mudakathan dosai and thoothuvalai rasam.Meals are cooked fresh, over a wood fire. Krishna pauses. It is not easy. We are going against the flow of a tsunami. But we do not see this as just a restaurant. It is a social learning space. He adds, It is important we celebrate local produce. Otherwise, we will become homogeneous. I do not even have a university degree. I have nothing special about me.... If I can do it, anyone can.Solitude Farm is in Auroville. The caf is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 3 pm. Krishna runs a free tour of the farm on Saturdays at 11.30 am."

No one comes to Congress to impeach a president,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the vote.Republicans have largely stuck by Trump, blasting the effort as a partisan exercise that has given them little input.""This is Soviet-style rules,"" said Representative Steve Scalise, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, as he stood next to a poster depicting the famous onion domes of Moscow's St. Basil's Cathedral.The vote largely broke along party lines. Only two Democrats voted against and no Republicans backed it.Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the inquiry a sham.If the House eventually votes to impeach Trump, that would set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump would not be removed from office unless votes to convict him by a two-thirds margin."

Not that they are into any fad diet, rather, the four of them have learnt the art of self-sustenance through subsistence agriculture.While a 20-cent plot of land in Vilavoorkkal near Malayinkeezhu on the outskirts of the city cradles their own paddy fields, a well-maintained kitchen garden on the terrace of their Kowdiar residence provides them with enough for day-to-day needs. Adding to this is the six-cent land around the house where some indispensable spices such as ginger, turmeric and black pepper, bananas and tubers such as chena, chemb and kaachil are cultivated.Uma Maheshwaran at his farmland in Vilavoorkkal near Malayinkeezhu | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementWe make our subsistence agriculture activities a fun family affair. Farming is a hobby of mine and I take to the fields after work hours, weekends and holidays, says Uma Maheshwaran, a Professor at the Department of Plant of Plant Pathology at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. He bought the plot at Vilavoorkkal in 2008 for the purpose of starting his own farming. For land preparation that involves ploughing and levelling, he ropes in the help of Krishi Bhavan workers. Planting of saplings is done using the transplanting method and a portion of the plot serves as a nursery where seedlings are raised.Not dampened by the rains, the family recently celebrated another harvest, this time procuring about 400 kg of the Jyothy rice variety. All our rice requirements are met throughout the year from our own fields. Any surplus is usually given off to kith and kin, explains Uma Maheshwaran.Rajasree M R at the terrace kitchen garden | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor the last two crop seasons, he cultivated the long and red Jyothy variety, having previously harvested the high-yielding, short-duration Prathyasha variety and the medium-duration Aishwarya as well. As the paddy crop duration is generally a little over three months, Uma Maheshwaran cultivates pulses on the plot during summer, when he manages to get a yield of close to 10 kg a year. He says one or two local labourers are employed for threshing, while the professor himself chips in.On the terrace of his single-story house, one can find a range of vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, bitter gourd, cluster beans, ladies finger and so on apart from red amaranth and a few varieties of chilli in eco-friendly grow bags.Keeping it cool Uma Maheshwaran says he uses basic farm implements. During the cool season during the November-January period, he grows vegetables such as cabbage and cauliflowers. No matter how much care you give, pests and diseases are unavoidable since we do not use pesticides. Sometimes, I spray organic pesticides like neem-garlic oil if required, he says.Perhaps, three essential items that we cannot grow on our terrace are onions, potatoes and garlic as they flourish more in cool climates, says his wife, Rajasree MR, Joint Director of Plant Protection, Krishi Directorate. She says every Sunday morning, the couple makes it a point to visit their Vilavoorkkal plot for weeding and examination of crop health.Anand U, a banker, says he developed a passion for farming right from a young age, learning from his green-thumbed parents. For me, farming feels like a refreshing break from an otherwise hectic and monotonous schedule. It also helps you be in close communion with Nature, adds Anand, now posted in Thrissur.Anand U near his farmland | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor Aparna Raju, farming came a new experience when she became part of the family after tying the knot with Anand but says she took to it like a duck to water. Now, in her father-in-laws absence, she makes it a point to water and prune the plants on the terrace. What I have learnt from my experience is that farming is not a hard row to hoe. In fact, anybody can do it, she says.The family is also focusing on apiculture, for the twin benefits of promoting cross-pollution for their terrace farming as well as to harvest honey for own use. A vermicompost pit set up in their backyard helps in recycling kitchen and farm waste and use the same as organic fertiliser for the plants.They want to promote sustainable subsistence agriculture not just to set an example against the growing menace of food adulteration in a mass consumption-driven culture but to highlight the trails and tribulations small-scale farmers go through.For now, its about making hay while the sun shines!"
2019-10-31,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/oct/31/chennai-grandma-starts-venture-to-feed-families-traditional-tamil-food-2054869.html,Chennai grandma starts venture to feed families traditional Tamil food,"By Express News ServiceCHENNAI: A grandmother of two, 67-year-old Vaidehi Opilli, a retired state government employee, has two missions in life  to make sure that children eat healthy, and nobody goes to bed feeling hungry. Vaidehi started cooking at the age of 12. Even though she was raised without a mother, Vaidehi always wore a smile on her face, cooking healthy food for her father and siblings  one younger and two elder sisters.She wore the proverbial pants by becoming a home cook to make ends meet. My main motive for cooking all these years was to ensure everyone around me got food. I am taking this dream forward. I am putting a price to the food I give people, but I am not looking for huge profits. I try to give them more food, she says.From her girlhood days, Vaidehi has been praying to her family deity Opilli. Its no wonder then that she decided to name her catering venture  Opilli Catering. She started this business two years back. She wanted to start this venture when she and her family were in Ahmedabad four-five years back but it did not happen. The locals there expect us to speak Gujarati. I dont know the language. That is why I couldnt do it. My actual plan was to give Gujaratis a taste of Tamil food, says Vaidehi who operates from her home in Pallikarnai.While some of her clients are regulars and want day-to-day food, others like the neighbourhood temple, and the school her grand-daughters go to are some special clients as they ask her to put up a stall on some special occasion or order some special dishes to suit the occasion. For such special occasions she makes karumbu rice or something more special.There is a Kamakshi temple near my house. During festivals when I get orders, my daughter-in-law, a software professional, helps me out, she says. Vaidehi is a master in cooking traditional Tamil Brahmin food like parupu thogaial without garlic, soji appam, manoharam, sembu elai parupu usili, puli kootu without parupu and puli nandal.She enjoys making food that is usually made in Brahmin households in Thanjavur, as she is familiar with the place and its cuisine. Most of her clients are Tamil Brahmins who mostly want food without onion and garlic. Some of her favourite foods are tenga saadam, chepankazhangu fry to go with vatha kozhambu. She likes to use molagu jiragam and paitam parupu (moong dal) in her dishes. Sometimes, she says, she substitutes paitam parupu with toor dal in her sambhar at times to make it healthier. Mindful about the health of kids, Vaidehi loves feeding them dry fruit sundal.Dry fruits could be given to children not just from the health perspective but also to satisfy their sweet tooth, she says pointing to her younger granddaughter, who at the time of the interview, attempts to sneak out as many coconut burfis from the kitchen as her tiny hands can carry. While she is keen to prepare more complex savouries like kai murukku, Vaidehis hands are now weak. Ive used my hands too much as a stenographer.Now, they dont move as I want them to and they are no longer flexbile, shares the former stenographer at the State Tax Department. A single-parent, Vaidehi feels cooking gives her an identity, and that gives her the strength to face difficulties. She makes somewhere between Rs 400 and Rs 600 a day. She usually spends the mornings in the kitchen trying to finish all the orders. She then enters the kitchen in the evening for dinner orders. If there is a huge order, she starts planning for it a few days in advance. Vaidehi has had her share of failures in the kitchen. Recalling one such incident, she says, Once a newly married couple was supposed to come over for lunch. I was given just about half an hour to prepare a meal.On the gas were two pots  one for kozhambu and one for payasam. Instead of putting all the masalas in the pot that was meant for the kozhambu, I put it in the milk that was being boiled for the payasam. That day onwards, I stopped making both these dishes together. Vaidehi believes that traditional foods are the best to keep one healthy. Her only advice to everyone is, Use iron vessels to get more iron in the body instead of eating iron medicines. Do not use non-stickWhile the world may be moving towards avocado, quinoa and kale as superfoods to fight uterus-related illnessesVaidehi chooses to cook food with staples available in the kitchen to strengthen the uterus.Gunuku is a special dish that was maderegularly in the earlier days, when a girl hits puberty. It was believedthat gunuku strengthened the uterus. It is aperfect dishfor a dailydose of proteins, shet e l ls us,while stirringthe hotpan on the stove."

Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry in Nauni near here worked towards an appropriate alternative -- the cultivation of Kharif onion.ALSO READ: Fresh stock to bring onion prices down in coming weekKharif onion cannot only save the farmers and the public from the sting of inflation but can also be a better option to increase the income of the farmers provided that the farmers adopt its cultivation techniques through the scientific method.The Kharif onion crop reaches the market at a time when the public is reeling under the increasing prices of onions.Deepa Sharma, a Vegetable Scientist at the University's College of Horticulture and Forestry in Neri in Hamirpur, has been working on a Rs 20.43 lakh project sanctioned two years ago by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in New Delhi, for popularising Kharif onion cultivation in Chamba district of the state.ALSO READ: After onion stalls, officials planning subsidised tomato stalls in rythu bazars?University scientists Rajveev Raina and Sanjeev Kumar Banyal are associated with the project as co-investigators.Under the project 245 demonstrations on farm fields, 14 training programmes have been organised in the last two years, which have benefitted 362 farmers, the university said in a statement.Keeping in view the growing demand and profit of kharif onion, the university wants to extend its cultivation to all suitable areas of the state.The experiments conducted in the Chamba district have yielded encouraging results. The farmers can replant setts during the second week of August and sell green onion bulbs from the second week of October.This crop is ready for harvesting from last week of November to the first week of December. The kharif crop is harvested at a time when the prices of onion are high and, therefore, the crop can be sold easily at Rs 50 per kg from the field itself.The farmers can obtain a yield of six quintals from one quintal setts and earn up to Rs 30,000. Vice-Chancellor Parvinder Kaushal called upon the farming community to take kharif onion cultivation as an enterprise."

2019-11-01,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-historic-awadhi-cuisine-from-north-india-continues-to-be-popular/article29854521.ece,A right royal treat,"Ask chef Mohammad Shaeem Quraishi what he packs first as he sets off on an assignment, and pat comes the reply, my spice blends and attars. And as thoughts waft along agreeably with the wonderful aroma of the Awadhi delicacies that the Lucknow-based Quraishi has brought to the Sangam hotels Chembian restaurant as part of an ongoing food festival, one can see why these ingredients would be so essential.I am a graduate in culinary studies, but I learned how to cook much earlier, from the age of 13, from my father and brothers, who were mass caterers for social functions in Lucknow, says Quraishi. College taught me the theory and chemistry behind cooking. My father taught me how and when to use the spices and ensure the right taste for every dish.Lucknow today is acknowledged as the seat of Awadhi cooking, named after the kingdom of Awadh in north India (the north-eastern portion of modern-day Uttar Pradesh state). With a rich heritage of at least two centuries of influences from the Mughal, Arab, and Central Asian styles of preparation known collectively as Dum Pukht or slow-oven cooking, Awadhi cuisine is a culinary showcase of refined flavours.Basic trainingAs a trainee, the young Shaeem was first tasked with washing the dishes. To learn anything well, you have to start at the bottom, right? he says. His six-month apprenticeship with his father culminated with learning how to fry onions to the right level of crispness. Awadhi food relies a lot on onions and yoghurt. The fried onions are used whole as a garnish, or ground with spices as a paste. If you figure out how to fry the onions, you are allowed to start cooking, says Shaeem.The other important element is the attar or perfumed oil that enhances the fragrance profile of the dish. The chef opens a vial and invites us to take a whiff. Like a lamp-bound genie, this attar holds the essence of biryani in it. Just one drop will be enough for a kilo of rice. There are attars for both sweet and savoury dishes; I source them from suppliers in Old Lucknow, says Shaeem, who has brought along others for kebabs and desserts to the Land of Awadh  Lucknowi Food Festival this week.The Quraishis, the clan to which chef Shaeem belongs, originally started out as butchers in Awadh. Since most of the royal diet was meat-based, the chefs would consult the butcher constantly before the dishes were prepared. Then we learned how to blend spices, and became as good as the royal cooks. This heritage maintained over generations by the Quraishis has helped Awadhi cuisine to stay above the rest, says Shaeem.On a culinary missionAfter graduation, Shaeem moved to Delhi, and worked under his uncle, who was the head chef at The Oudh restaurant of the five-star hotel The Ashok. This was my first time in a commercial kitchen, and I learned the importance of food safety and presentation after coming here, says the chef, who went on to work for several leading hotel chains in India and the Middle East for over 20 years before moving back to his native Lucknow in 2016.Awadhi Shahi Tukda Ingredients1 loaf unsliced bread(cut into 1/2 inch slices equally)or 8 bread slicesGhee (for deep frying)For syrup:7-8 strands of saffron1 cup sugar1 cup water2 cup milk1 drop meetha attar (available online)4 drop rose water4 drop kewra waterFor garnish:1 tablespoon almonds (finely sliced)1 tablespoon pistachio (finely sliced)Chandi ka waraq (edible silver foil), optionalMethodRabriIn a deep vessel cook khoya, milk, sugar and saffron. Keep stirring until thick. Add cardamom powder and set aside to cool.SyrupIn deep vessel, boil sugar, milk, water and saffron together till bubbles appear. Add meetha attar, kewra water and rose water. Switch off the flame and let it rest.Bread baseHeat pure ghee in a deep pan. Trim the sides of each bread slices and deep fry in hot ghee till golden brown.To serve, arrange the fried bread on a tray. Pour the syrup on the bread and cook on low fire until the bread becomes soft. Spread the rabri evenly on the surface to cover it entirely. Place the silver foil, if using, on the bread and sprinkle almonds and pistachios over it.I felt it was time for me to do something on my own to promote Awadhi cuisine, says Shaeem. As a consultant chef, he helps restaurants in creating menus and also training staff in the regional cuisine.An over-elaborate menu is a common mistake among eateries, says Shaeem. I always advise the management to offer just four or five items of a high quality, and then rotate the menu every two to three months, to keep both the chefs and the diners interested.Variety unpluggedAny banquet is a busy time for cooks in Lucknow, where the usual wedding feast normally has a guest list of at least a thousand people, says Shaeem. We are expected to serve at least 25-30 dishes, according to the prevailing norms of hospitality, otherwise it isnt considered to be a proper feast, he says. Considering the variety of breads (Sheermal, Mughalia Paratha, Baqarkhani, Taftan, Kulcha, Naan and Roomali Roti), and desserts (Awadhi Kheer, Shahi Tukda, Muzaafar, Sheer Khurma), besides the long list of kababs and gravies, not to mention the biryani, the cooking alone requires a team of at least 10-15 master chefs, says Shaeem. Awadhi chefs use metallic tandoors which are good for low intensity heat. So the first step ahead of any banquet usually involves the digging a pit deep enough to hold the tandoor.Lost recipesDespite its longevity, some recipes have disappeared over time from Awadhi cuisine. This is usually because they may have been very labour-intensive preparations, says Shaeem. For example, you can no longer find dishes like the Majlisi Kabab, a 200-year-old recipe made with finely-minced mutton cooked on low heat. The meat would be ground using the sil-batta with many spices, and used to be cooked at home, and for functions. Now people neither have the time nor the inclination to cook and serve such elaborate fare.The current craze for commercially sold Biryani doesnt impress him either. Biryani cannot be made in a hurry; so I feel what restaurants are selling is more of a replica of the rice dish, sometimes assembled with pre-cooked ingredients, he says.Hoping to launch his own restaurant featuring the lost recipes of Awadh, and perhaps a cookbook as well, chef Shaeem Quraishi clearly loves what he does. Though the patrons have changed, theres been no real change in Awadhi cuisine, because we are still using spices and cooking methods similar to those of the earlier generations, he says."

Pawar also said the central leadership of the Congress has so far been inimical to the idea of having a pact with the Shiv Sena.AdvertisingNo one is in contact with us. No one has spoken to us. (Sena MP) Sanjay Raut sits in Parliament with me and we have meetings. We do not speak about political dealings but about what the political situation is like around us. We have been having such discussions. However, neither has anyone come to us with any proposal nor have we gone to anyone with any offer, Pawar told mediapersons during his visit to Nashik district on Friday, following unseasonal rainfall in the area.On Thursday, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had indicated that his party was exploring options beyond the BJP. While claiming that no party or person has a permanent claim on the CMs chair, he had said: I am in touch with BJP, Congress and NCP. Raut had met Pawar at his residence on Thursday evening.Pawar also said the possibility of the Congress supporting the Shiv Sena was bleak. There had been talks that the Sena could seek out both Opposition parties for external support.AdvertisingI have seen the Congress leadership from up close. The national leadership, as per my experience, is cold towards such an arrangement. They have been this way in the past but I dont know what will happen tomorrow. However, my feeling is that the Congress leadership will not support such an arrangement, he added.While asking the BJP and Shiv Sena to expedite the process of government formation, Pawar said with the Ram temple verdict expected in a few days, it was imperative that the state had a government in place. NCP leader Nawab Malik said the party was open to the option of finding an alternative to the Sena-BJP government.Even after getting a majority, if the Sena and BJP fail to provide a stable government, we will definitely think of providing an alternative, he added.Earlier in the day, Pawar visited affected farmers in Igatpuri, Kalwan and other smaller hamlets in Nashik district, where nearly 50 per cent of the total 7.4 lakh hectare of land under cultivation had been damaged by unseasonal rainfall that have hit various parts of the state.According to government estimates, crops standing on 3.23 lakh hectare of farm land in the district had been destroyed. Preliminary estimates made by the district collectorate suggest that nearly 70 per cent of grape crop and around 40 per cent of onion crop had been severely affected.At many places where Pawar stopped, he was surrounded by farmers, who requested him to intercede with the government on their behalf for adequate compensation.Pawar said that he would assess the damage and pressurise the government in providing adequate relief to those affected. We hope that the government will be sensitive in addressing the farmers. It needs to support the farmers who have been affected by this disaster. If the government fails to play its role, we will take a strong stand against it, he told mediapersons.Criticising the states compensation policy for farmers, the NCP chief said: After a detailed discussion with local officials, it has come to my notice that the state has not taken any concrete step in compensating the farmers. The criteria that is being applied now is two to three years old. The situation and need today, however, are completely different.From November 6, he will be visiting the districts of Parbhani, Nanded and Hingoli in Marathwada to assess the damage caused by unseasonal rainfall."

According to farmers, the rain has damaged their almost-ready crops of soya bean, cotton, maize and jowar across 22.71 lakh hectares. Amravati and Nashik divisions have reported damage in over 11.98 and 16.69 lakh hectares of land respectively. (See box)Major crops damaged in the rain include jowar (2.10 lakh hectares), bajra (2.16 lakh hectares), toor (1.18 lakh hectares) and some vegetables (1.86 lakh hectares). The losses incurred by farmers may cross Rs 5,000 crore, according to initial estimates.In the last week of October, the state saw renewed rainfall activity due to cyclonic disturbance Kyarr as well as the withdrawal of monsoon. Barring districts in Amravati division, all other districts in Maharashtra have received more than their normal quota of rain. But the assessment of crop loss was delayed due to the state elections and Diwali holidays.More than 53,000 hectares of horticulture crops have been damaged in the rains. Grape growers of Nashik have said total production will fall by 40 per cent as growers from Niphad and Satana taluka, who were expecting an early harvest in January, have lost all their crop. Losses have been reported to the ready onion crop, which is expected to trigger a price rise in the next few days.Fadnavis has convened a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Saturday to decide on measures that need to be taken to reach out to the affected farmers. A survey of damages using drones have been ordered across rain-hit parts of Vidarbha, western Maharashtra, Marathwada, Konkan and north Maharashtra. A central team is also likely to arrive this week to conduct a detailed survey.On Friday, the CM held a video conference with the district administration to review the ground situation. Among the measures that need to be taken are providing a mechanism to the farmers to salvage their crops that are ready and take the same to the market for auction. Also, the process of assess crop loss would have to be expedited so that financial help can reach farmers shortly, he said."

The air we breathe contains a number of harmful pollutants. These pollutants are always present in the air, however, when the concentration goes high; it becomes dangerous for the health. Additionally, factors like cigarette smoke, dust particles, pollutants like carbon mono-oxide and radon makes the air more harmful.While wearing marks and taking measures to avoid harmful air always helps, one should also be careful about the diet around this time. It is necessary to have enough immunity and nutrients to make the body strong enough to fight these pollutants. Most important of all is to have enough antioxidants in the body, which can help your body. Here are a few tips on the food intake:1. Vitamin C: The single most potent antioxidant for our body, Vitamin C is also easily available in Citrus fruits. Vit C is water soluble and scavenges free radicals. Most importantly, it also contributes to vitamin E regeneration. Include vegetables like coriander leaves, chaulai ka saag, drumsticks, and parsley, cabbage and turnip greens. For fruits, amla and guava are rich sources.2. Vitamin E: The fat soluble vitamin E provides the first line of defense against injury to human tissues. Our body consumes vitamin E from plant based cooking oils like sunflower, safflower and rice bran oil. Other rich sources are almonds, sunflower seeds, and nuts. If you are non-vegetarian, include salmon, roe and eel for vitamin E content.3. Beta Carotene: With an important role in controlling inflammation, Beta Carotene converts to vitamin A in our body. To have it, depend on food items like Leafy vegetables, amaranth (chaulai ka saag), coriander, methi(fenugreek), lettuce and spinach. Other great sources are radish leaves and carrots.4. Omega -3 Fats: Having these in the body helps in protecting the body against the detrimental effects of air pollution. The rich sources of Omega-3 Fats ate fishes. However, for vegetarians, you can try nuts, seeds like walnuts, chia seeds and flax seeds. You can also add Methi seeds, mustard seeds, green leafy vegetables, kala chana, and rajma andbajra.5. Ayurvedic Solutions: Apart from these vitamins and fats, certain herbs and spices are also known to have antioxidant qualities. Turmeric is a well-known antioxidant. Mixing turmeric and ghee can relieve cough and aid during asthma. Jaggery mixed with onion juice is another useful medicine, useful during both wet and dry cough.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

The private trade will supply the imported onions wherever the demand is there in the country, the official said.It may be noted that state-run MMTC has not yet received interest from bidders for the import of 2,000 tonnes. To provide further relief to consumers, the ministry said that Mother Dairy will augment supplies of onions in Delhi-NCR by sourcing the quality commodity from the open market. The APMC Delhi will facilitate Mother Dairy in its operations.Mother Dairy is already selling onions from the Centre's buffer stock at a subsidised rate of Rs 24.90 per kg through its 400-odd Safal outlets in Delhi-NCR. It is also selling tomatoes at Rs 55 per kg.The ministry said that the price rise in onion has been due to supply disruptions because of Diwali holidays and rains in some of the growing areas affecting harvesting. ""However, the increase in arrivals would have a direct impact on arresting the prices in both wholesale and retail markets,"" it added.In case of tomatoes, harvesting is underway in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. The arrival of the crop has started improving. ""It has been somewhat affected due to heavy rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Arrivals are expected to improve during mid-November with harvesting taking place in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh,"" the ministry added.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Because of the extended monsoon and the delayed onset of winter, the harvest of several winter greens and other vegetables has been delayed. As a result, wholesale as well as retail prices of several winter vegetables have been rising over a fortnight.Green peas and purple yam cost as high as Rs 200 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, carrots, little gourd, French beans, and even fenugreek leaves cost more than Rs 100 a kg. The prices of tomato and onion, which are widely used in gravies and an array of dishes, have also gone up, hurting the pockets of restaurateurs.Many crops were damaged due to the extended monsoon, said a well-placed source in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Ahmedabad. Moreover, the supply of some vegetables not harvested here is also short. Thus, prices have been impacted.Commenting on the output, Mafa Bharwad, a farmer from Kamijla village in Surendranagar district said, I grow bitter gourd and ladys finger. Depending on the demand and supply, I get Rs 30 per kg sometimes. Bharwad said that but most of the times, farmers get around Rs 200 for a 20 kg bag of these vegetables. The winter crop will be delayed this time, he said.Vipul Patel, a farmer from Dhakdi village of Viramgam taluka of Ahmedabad district, cultivates tomatoes, brinjal, and cauliflower. Farmers get barely 50% of the wholesale rates of vegetables, he said. The recent unseasonal rain has badly affected tomato and cauliflower crops.Sources said that it will take another fortnight to a month for vegetable prices to stabilize."
2019-11-02,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/nov/02/carry-a-tune-2055832.html,Carry a tune,"Shevlin Sebastian ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: The lights go dim at the JT Pac hall at Kochi. Then a voice begins to rise in the silence. But the stage remains empty. Then a spotlight falls on the aisle at the back of the hall. And there stands the singer, Preety Bhalla. Adorning a black dress with a transparent black jacket lined with ruffles, she begins with a Sufi song, Teri Deewani in a husky and vibrant voice. Slowly, she walks down the steps, smiles at the guests on the left and the right and reaches the stage.After the song, she says, I feel so happy to be here. There are two reasons for this. I am from Mumbai, originally from Punjab, but I am married to a Malayali (Deepu Paul). So Kochi is my second home. The other reason is my daughter comes to this place every day (Kyra is a student of Class two at Choice School). It seems like I am in my own house. I am going to take you through different genres of music in different languages.And for the next two hours, Preethi indeed takes the audience on an exhilarating ride: hit songs of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Illiyaraja, RD Burman, Laxmikant Pyarelal, and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, among many others. She sings in Hindi, Punjabi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Spanish. The Spanish-Hindi song is called Senorita from Zoya Akhtars film, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. For a Malayali touch, Preety sings Appangal from Ustad Hotel as well as Meharuba, composed by Gopi Sundar for Joshiys Lailaa O Lailaa.Amazingly, there is hardly any pause between songs. Preety has no lyric sheet or song schedule in front of her. And there is no interval too. And for the climax, Preety sings her most famous number: a reworked version of Damadam Mast Kalandar from the Album Jalwa II that brings the house down.A day earlier, Preety, along with Deepu, looks relaxed and happy at their tastefully decorated apartment near Marine Drive, with wooden furniture and muted ceiling lights. From their sixth-floor balcony, you can see the setting sun across the Cochin Harbour.Living in Kochi is beautiful, says Preety. There is a peace of mind as compared to life in Mumbai. There is so much greenery all around. The traffic, as compared to Mumbai, is much less. The people are very sweet. I love the local food a lot.But she cant eat just everything. To protect her voice, she avoids ice-creams. But I melt it so that I can eat it, she says with a laugh. I also avoid pickles, as it irritates my throat and raw onions. But I like curd even though many singers avoid it. After all, I am a Punju and we love our curd. And every day, after a morning walk, Preety does a two-hour practice of her vocal cords. It is similar to a physical workout, she says. After that, I am ready to face the day.Preety has been ready to face every day as a singer for the past two decades. She has performed in all the major cities and towns in India, in Dubai, Indonesia, and Thailand.And after two decades, she no longer has any butterflies in the stomach before a show. But, yes, I do feel a touch of nervousness regarding the sound system, says Preety. I pray that nothing goes wrong.To ensure nothing goes wrong, Deepu accompanies her for all the shows. Before they met, they spoke on the phone, because Deepus partner was doing an album with Preety. Our first conversation lasted 15 minutes, and we sort of clicked, says Deepu. They met nine months later, and it was a slow falling-in-love. They got married three years later, in December 2008. To please both sides of the family there was a gurudwara as well as a church wedding.Asked what he likes about Preety, Deepu says, She is a nice human being, and very soft-hearted. I also like the way she is focused on her singing.Preety says, Deepu is a cool guy. And my in-laws are exceptionally sweet people.At this moment, Kyra comes into the room. A beaming Preety says, She is taking classes in singing. Thanks to God, she is naturally gifted and talented."

2019-11-02,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-its-deep-fried-its-bengali/article29863705.ece,"If it’s deep-fried, it’s Bengali","The main industry / in Kolkata  real estate / and telebhaja: Amit Chaudhuri, from TelebhajaMy friend from Berlin was delighted to discover pumpkin flowers in the markets of Kolkata.You eat pumpkin flowers too? she asked. How do you prepare them?Oh we dip them in batter and deep-fry them, I replied cheerily. She seemed rather crestfallen. She had been thinking she was about to discover the Bengali equivalent of Italian zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese. Just dunking them in besan and tossing them in a kadhai of hot bubbling oil seemed less inspiring.I could see her point. Once you dip something in heavy batter and deep fry it, it didnt much matter anymore whether it was yellow pumpkin blossoms or white bokphool flowers or any other flower to start with.The fact is Bengalis like to deep-fry everything  pumpkin slices, eggplants, greens, even the crunchy seeds of overripe parwals. Everything is fair game  vegetables, flowers, tiger prawns, fish roe, chicken lollipops. I am surprised our fairy tales arent filled with wicked witches who try to deep-fry little children.Pakoras and dumplingsDeep-fried is an adjective in English. In Bengali it acquires the solidity of a noun, telebhaja. Which literally means Things Fried in Oil. It could be begunis, batter-fried eggplant slices; or peyajis, little pakoras made of fine-chopped onion and green chillis; or it could be aloo chops, first cousins to aloo bondas but with thinner besan coatings. Winter lunches mean little florets of batter-fried cauliflower, while deep-fried crispy tiny mourala fish are perfect for any season. In recent years dal-vada wallah carts have sprung up in street corners all over Kolkata, frying up mounds of spicy little lentil dumplings that are served piping hot in newspaper packets, the oil stain spreading deliciously over the newsprint as if tracing a map of illicit pleasures.The Bengali romance with the deep-fried is not new. Pragyasundari Devis seminal cookbook of Bengali recipes from 1902 has over 100 recipes under Bhajibhuji aka Fried-This-And-That. She fries things I did not even know existed  gaandaal leaves, delo and punko saag  as well as things I would have thought defied frying  like pineapples, green papaya and jackfruit. Do not skimp on the oil, she warns. It will become limp instead of crunchy. Fry in batches. Dont overcrowd. Haste makes soggy.She assures us that something fried, whether batter-fried or shallow-fried, can accompany almost everything on a Bengali plate.With rice and khichdi you can try fried vegetables or fuluris, puffy besan dumplings. With pulaos, she recommends koftas and chops, the Bengali answer to croquettes. With puffed luchis (themselves deep-fried), you can have fried eggplant or fried parwal.Fried potatoes pair excellently with mutton or duck roast. And all this does not include the procession of deep-fried treats that accompany the afternoon cup of cha.The devilled eggTea-time snacks or jolkhabar is a Bengali orgy of deep-fried excess, starting with the humble singhara and the simple kalonji-speckled kucho nimki munchies to the vegetable chop, that curious ball of grated beetroot with raisins and peanuts. From here we quickly climb the food chain to diamond fish fries, mutton breast cutlet, fowl cutlets, fish fingers, and the lethal butter-fried Fish Orly. Many of these have colonial roots, though now thoroughly Bengalicised. A devilled egg in the rest of the world is a cold snack made with a boiled egg, its yolk mashed with mustard and mayo. An Egg Devil in Kolkata is a boiled egg wrapped with minced meat, dunked in breadcrumbs and deep-fried.I remember going to a Calcutta Classic Food Festival that celebrated some of Kolkatas most legendary snack shops. Chitto-das Suruchee, Niranjan Agar, Apanjan, Allen Cafe, Mitra Caf, started in 1910-11 not by a Mr. Mitra but by a Mr. Sushil Roy who wanted to create a hangout for friends or mitra. Each eatery has its own iconic dish, deep-fried of course. Allen Kitchen has its gloriously batter-fried Sp. Prawn Cutlet Big (Pure Ghee), though its Fish Fry sticks to refined oil. They say Bengali superstar Uttam Kumar frequented Mitra Cafe for its Chicken Kabiraji  the Bengali version of the British cover egg cutlet  where the chicken fillet is covered with a coating of deep-fried egg batter that makes a lacy egg doily oozing oil. It is not meant for the faint of heart.Iconic brain chopMitra Cafes real speciality, though, is its iconic brain chop. Imagine a deep-fried tennis ball with gooey goat brain inside. For those less daring, theres Chitto-das classic Diamond Fish Fry or Fish Roll, minced fish surrounded by a layer of Kolkata bhetki, then deep-fried.The only vegetables in sight at that food festival were raw onions and slivers of cucumber pretending to be a salad. I did not touch them. After all, you can get E. coli from cut raw vegetables.Perhaps thats the scientific reason behind this love for all things deep-fried. It might clog the arteries but at least no pesky germ can survive that wok of boiling oil.Yet, it is still the humble telebhaja, minus the attraction of a Kolkata bhetki or chicken breast, which remains the true marker of Bengali-ness. The hole-in-the-wall telebhaja shops rarely have names, or if they do, they are names like Potlas Shop or Naren-das Shop, but their clientele is devoted. And some have a hallowed history.Netajis snacksOn a road once named after Lord Cornwallis, theres a telebhaja shop that specialises in the usual favourites along with more exotic offerings like mango chop, soya bean chop and coconut chop. But thats not why its famous. Lakshmi Narayan Shaw & Sons was opened in 1918 by one Khedu Shaw. Back in the day it apparently supplied young Subhas Chandra Bose with all things deep-fried, especially during the secret meetings he held with other freedom fighters. In 1942, Shaw babu started to secretly distribute free snacks on Netajis birthday, a grease-stained act of subversion in our freedom struggle that we remain tragically uninformed about. Somehow, it makes our heroes more human, knowing that on a rainy monsoon evening, between meetings plotting how to throw off the yoke of colonialism, they paused for some aloor chop.But our favourite telebhaja shop was more humble. Nalin-dada was the cook who accompanied my mother as a new bride into the jungles of Madhya Pradesh where my civil engineer father was building a bridge. When they returned to Kolkata, Nalin-dada set up a telebhaja stall outside our house where he fried eggplants and onion pakoras every evening while his children and I played hide-and-seek.I can still picture his little display case lit by the flame of a kerosene lamp, with fresh-fried begunis and peyajis piled in a basket.My great-grandmother was a huge fan of his telebhaja. Actually, she was a fan of all things deep-fried, her appetite undiminished till the very end. Once in her 90s she fell down and bust her head. As the family scurried around trying to staunch the blood, she called out plaintively to the old maid, Jamuna, remember to soak the dal. I want to have dal bada tomorrow. My mother scolded her for her insatiable appetite for fried food but now, whenever we eat dal vada at lunch, she remembers her wistfully.In these parts, even our nostalgia is deep-fried.Moong BeguniAs found in Amish o Niramish, Vol. 1, the cookbook by Pragyasundari Devi.Getty Images/ iStockIngredients60g whole moong dal2 tbsp rice flour15g white sesame seeds75g eggplant1/2 tsp salt3 tbsp gheeMethod1. Soak the moong dal in water. After one hour remove the peels and wash the dal several times and grind to a paste. Rinse the sesame seeds.2. Cut the eggplant into round slices and rub salt on them. You should have 13-14 slices of eggplants.3. Beat the dal paste vigorously. Put a drop into some water, if it floats you do not need to beat it any more. Now add the rice flour, sesame seeds and salt. Smear the eggplant slices with the mixture.4. Heat the ghee. After a few minutes add the eggplant 3-4 at a time and fry till they are crunchy and brown. Each should take about three minutes.The author of Dont Let Him Know, like many Bengalis, likes to let everyone know about his opinions."

Read MoreOct rain damages a third of kharif crops in statePUNE/MUMBAI: Unseasonal rain in October has ruined kharif crops on over 54 lakh hectare of the 140 lakh hectare under cultivation in Maharashtra , with officials estimating the losses to rise, affecting this year's production.Agriculture minister Anil Bonde told TOI on Friday that nearly one-third of the total area under cultivation or crops on over 54 lakh hectare have been affected by the unseasonal rainfall.Cotton and soybean crops on 17 lakh hectare each have taken the biggest hit. Other crops lost include jowar, bajra, maize, vegetable and fruits. The otherwise drought-prone Aurangabad division is the worst-hit, with over 60% or 22 lakh hectare of the cultivated area damaged.Officials said there was delay in arrival of rains this year, which affected sowing in many areas, and now, farmers are facing huge losses due to unseasonal rain. ""This has been a difficult season for farmers in the state,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis, who chaired a review meeting on Friday to assess the losses, has asked the state administration to complete field surveys in the next few days to know the exact number of affected farmers. He has also directed that a grievance redressal mechanism be set up at district level for farmers to register their complaints. A meeting of the cabinet sub-committee has been called on Saturday to discuss the issue.Fadnavis said, ""The state has experienced four cyclones in the last four months, and due to the Kyarr super cyclone, in the last two weeks of October, there was major rainfall that caused big crop losses. We have asked for field surveys to be done, and even photos taken by farmers and the local administration will be considered as proof. He said production estimates for this year were very good. ""A lot of the crop was also harvested and kept, but it has been lost,"" Fadnavis noted.The state government has also decided to send a memorandum to the Centre to seek monetary aid for farmers.Of the kharif crops, mung and urad have been harvested, a state agriculture department official said.""Seeds have automatically germinated under the intense spells, damaging the crop. In some areas, entire farms were waterlogged for days, rendering them useless. This is the first time in several years that it rained so hard in October. The showers were above normal on several days in a month when it does not rain much,"" the official said.The actual yield from this kharif season will be known after three weeks. The agriculture department usually has some rough production estimates around this time of the year, but the showers have hampered this exercise too.""Jowar, bajra and vegetables like onions and tomatoes have been washed out due to the rain in October which led to rotting of crop roots,"" Vijay Thube, director of Shashvat Krushi Vikas Producer Company, said. ""Our farmers from western Maharashtra provide vegetables to markets like Mumbai and Pune. Unfortunately, we now have very little to sell,"" he added.Over 100 farmers registered with farmer producer group Krushi-Vikas Farmer Producer Company Ltd in Haveli are in a fix. ""Around 70% of crops in our region have been destroyed. I had sown leafy vegetables, sugarcane, cabbage and cauliflower. The nullah next to the fields began overflowing after heavy rain in October, and all the water entered my fields. Crops that were about to be harvested were waterlogged for days,"" Amol Jachak, who heads the firm, said.Ajit Thorat, a farmer in Ambegaon taluka, said 90% of the grapes in his vineyard were destroyed, while there was 100% damage to crops like soybean and onion. ""I have never seen so much rain in October. The damage is significant,"" he said.Kalidas Apet, Shetkari Sanghatana leader from Beed, said the government is inactive and insensitive to farmers' demands. ""The losses are huge, but the government is not bothered. We have demanded this be declared a national disaster and relief given as per the National Disaster Management Act,"" he said. He added that a large number of farmers facing losses are not covered under crop insurance and will solely rely on government relief."

Onions in kharif season, which usually arrive after Diwali, were either being harvested or were ready to be harvested when rain started battering the state. The harvested crop has been damaged while the late transplanted crop, which was to be harvested in another fortnight or so, has also been damaged, said a trader.The current price rise is likely to continue as overall availability of the produce has been hit.Other than onions, the prices of other kharif crops damaged by the rain, including soyabean, pulses and maize among others, have also started rising. The price of urad (black gram) has seen a 66 per cent increase in the last few days and at Laturs wholesale market  one of the biggest market of pulses in the country  urad is trading at around Rs 7,600 per quintal.AdvertisingGrowers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have also reported crop damage, said Latur-based daal miller and trader Nitin Kalantari.

2019-11-02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ban-on-onion-export-comes-as-a-shocker/article29865875.ece,Ban on onion export comes as a shocker,"At a time when onion farmers of the drought-prone Chitradurga district were hoping to get better prices for their yield, the continued ban on export of onions of the variety they grow has dashed their hopes.Chitradurga district, which suffered successive droughts for the past seven years, received some good rainfall this year resulting in better crop yield for onion. Damages to the onion crop in flood-hit districts of Maharashtra and north Karnataka had also kindled hopes among them of a better price after a long gap.However, even as the farmers of Chitradurga district (which is the largest onion growing district in central Karnataka) were dreaming of good returns for their yield, the shocker came from the Centre in the form of ban on export.Although Chitradurga has an APMC yard, the farmers are dependent on the APMC yard at Yeshwantpur in Bengaluru for a better price. Chitradurga, Challakere and Hiriyur taluks have the largest onion growing areas and the yield is usually exported to Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka through the Yeshwantpur APMC yard.State general secretary of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sanga, T.N. Shankarappa, said: Very rarely, once in 10 or 15 years, farmers get an opportunity to make some money by selling their agricultural produce. But now, their dreams have been shattered with the ban on export of onions. The Union government has done injustice to them.No storage facilitiesDespite being a big producer of onion, Chitradurga district lacks proper storage facility for the crop. Most of the farmers store the crop in gunny bags in their houses. An official of APMC, Chitradurga, confirmed that there was no separate warehouse to store onions.Meanwhile, lack of good prices for onions has brought down cultivation in the district and farmers are forced to migrate in search of job. The district had 17,560 onion farmers in 2016-17. It came down to 17,025 in 2018-19 and during the current fiscal, it reduced to 10,782.P.P. Kallesh of Paledahalli in Hosadurga taluk is among the distraught onion farmers. I was planning to clear my loans. I thought I will be better off for a year. Now with the ban, its the same old story, he told The Hindu."

While the retail price of onion has shot up again after a brief phase of stability, other vegetables are not far behind.While the former is being sold at Rs 55-65/kg against the wholesale price of Rs 4,000-4,500/quintal, standard retail price of other vegetables are on an average Rs 80/kg. Vegetables like brinjal and tomato are priced at Rs 50/kg while other vegetables including bitter gourd, raw banana, beans, ladys fingers, cabbage, cauliflower and ridge gourd are priced above Rs 70-80 per kg.The surge in onion prices is attributed to higher prices at source market, Nasik district of Maharashtra being the major supplier.Sources at Kuberpuri said according to the wholesale market for onion and potato at Aiginia on the city outskirts, retail price should be maximum Rs 50/kg. It is job of retail traders to display both wholesale and retail prices at their counters. The traders are benefiting to lack of supervision by field staff of the Food Supplies department, they said.The onion prices soared in the last couple of days due to low import from Nasik and Andhra Pradesh. With improved supply, prices of the commodity will cool down in the next 4-5 days, said general secretary of Kuberapuri Merchant Association Shakti Shankar Mishra.The wholesale market of the city on Sunday received around 250 tonnes of onion against its daily requirement of 200 tonnes. If onion supply to the State remains stable, its price is bound to fall, he said.Onion prices have remained high in the State since September following massive rains in Maharashtra as onion-producing districts - Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar-reported extensive crop damage.

On Monday, the average traded price of the bulb at Lasalgoans wholesale market was recorded at Rs 5,551 per quintal, the highest this year. Traders have hinted at a further spike in onion prices as arrival of the kharif crop is likely to be delayed.AdvertisingAs unseasonal rain battered the state over the last fortnight or so, onion growing tracts in Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have reported extensive damage to the kharif crop, which was about to be harvested. Farmers in these areas also suffered loss to harvested onion crop kept on the fields.In Maharashtra, farmers normally take three crops of onions, which feed the market round the year. The kharif crop is transplanted from June to July and is harvested post October, while the late kharif crop is planted post September and harvested after December and January.Farmers also take the rabi crop, which is transplanted from December to January and harvested post March. The rabi crop is the only one which is amenable to storage. Farmers store their produce in moisture- and dust-proof structures on field, called kanda chawl, in order to prevent it from sprouting. This stored onion feeds the market till the arrival of the new kharif crop.AdvertisingWhile kharif crop should have started arriving in Nashik and other onion growing areas, unseasonal rain has taken its toll on the same. Other than Maharashtra, kharif crop of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat has also reported damage.Currently, onions that farmers in Nashik had stored post March are feeding the market. Sources said that at the start of April, farmers had stored 22 lakh tonnes of onion in their chawls in Nashik. However, now only 5 to 7 per cent of it remains. The new crop has arrived in Karnatakas Hubli market. Markets in North India have also reported arrival of the new crop. This supply-demand mismatch has pushed up the prices in several parts, a trader said.A hike in onion prices earlier in September, just before the state elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, had seen the central government clamping down on markets. Onion exports were banned, while the state-owned Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) had floated tenders for importing 2,000 tonnes of onion.Sources in the Ministry of Agriculture said that while MMTCs tenders are yet to materialise, private traders have imported 60-70 containers of the bulb."

The monthly budget of an average Malayali is likely to be affected soon owing to a steep increase in the prices of some essential vegetables. The items that saw a hike in prices include two of the basic ingredients in every Malayalis platter  onion and garlic.The prices of onion and garlic have gone up mainly because of the shortage in supply. Most of the central and northern states and neighbouring Karnataka received heavy rain in October, affecting the production. This has led to a demand-supply mismatch. Kerala, too, has been witnessing heavy rain for the past few weeks. As vegetables are highly perishable, traders cannot take the risk of keeping additional stocks, said Nazeer M M, a trader at Kakkanad.The traders said the prices will remain high until new stocks arrive.The prices of onion, shallot (small onion), garlic, potato and tomato have increased steeply. The price of just one kilogram of garlic has increased by Rs 90 from the last month, to cross Rs 200 mark this month. Likewise, the price of small onion has increased by Rs 35 from last moth. Fortunately, the prices of many other vegetables remain stable.According to traders, more local produce are expected to hit the market in two weeks. Under the Palakkad zone, vegetables will be procured from Vadakarappathi, Perumatty, Elevancherry, Kollengode and Kizhakkencherry.Prices have mainly gone up for the items brought from other states. According to traders, the October rain that lashed states like Maharashtra  one of the major suppliers of onion to Kerala  had led to the price hike, said Uma P, Palakkad district manager, Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Kerala (VFPCK).The prices will become stable if more local produce are brought to the retail market. After the recent floods, our domestic vegetable production has gathered momentum. We expect that cowpea, bitter gourd, snake gourd and tomato grown in various areas in Palakkad will reach the market in the coming weeks, Uma said."

Wholesale Rates Hit 4-Year High, Disrupt Govt Efforts","New Delhi: After witnessing a hike for a few days in September, retail onion prices again skyrocketed this week to as high as Rs 100 per kilogram in several locations across major cities in the country. This was after wholesale prices of the bulb hit a four-year high due to a fall in arrivals (supply) in mandis.Prices in Nashiks Lasalgaon market  Asias largest wholesale onion market  touched Rs 5,500 per quintal on Monday, which is the highest since August 2015. Prices, however, were recorded at Rs 4,300 per quintal on Wednesday. This came after arrivals plummeted to just 200 quintals on Saturday  the lowest since December 2016 (185 quintal)  before rising to 4,500 quintal on Wednesday.It is the first time since October 2015 that wholesale onion prices have crossed the Rs 4,000/quintal-mark at Lasalgaon.Wholesale prices in Delhi were recorded at a relatively lower rate of Rs 3,607 per quintal on November 1, which is the latest figure available for the capital. Prices in Delhi have also gone beyond Rs 3,000/quintal for the first time in two years.Union minister for food and consumer affairs Ram Vilas Paswan said that the prices of onion have increased due to a fall in domestic production of the crop and that the government was reviewing the situation.Prices have gone up as production (kharif onion) has declined by 30-40 per cent in the country...We are concerned about the situation and the government is trying its best, Paswan said, adding that the prices should hopefully come down by end of November or beginning December.Nearly two-thirds of Indias onion production is in the rabi onion which is sown during December and January and harvested during April and May. Whereas the kharif onion is sown in May-June and harvested in during October and November which together with late kharif onion that is sown in August-September and harvested between January and February accounts for the remaining annual onion production in the country.Data show that onion prices generally rise between September and November. This is mainly on account of low rabi onion stocks till the arrival of kharif onion in the market.Paswan said that the government had already disposed off nearly all of its 57,000 tonnes of buffer stock and is looking to import onion through private trade. Paswan said that the government has also banned the export of processed and raw onion and has imposed stock holding limits on traders in order to stabilise market prices of the bulb.In September this year, after onion prices soared government had imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onion exports to stabilise prices in the domestic market.(with PTI inputs)Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Prices surged ever higher over the last few days, with onions currently being sold at Rs 80-Rs 90 per kg in retail outlets in the state capital of Bhopal.The prices are peaking in other cities as well.Excessive rains this year destroyed the onion crop in both MP and Maharashtra, which is another prominent supplier of the commodity, leading to a short supply that pushed up prices, said Rajendra Saini, a wholeseller at the local Karond Mandi.Saini said onions were selling at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale market on Thursday, adding the situation would be the same unless supplies improve drastically in the near future.Saini said the same is the case with other vegetables. Garlic prices have shot up almost five times, selling at Rs 150 a kg in the city. While the price of tomatoes has increased from Rs 25 per kg to Rs 40-Rs 50 per kg over the last few days, potatoes are now selling at Rs 20 per kg as compared to Rs 7 per kg earlier.Salim Khan, a vegetable vendor from Bittan Market, said most of the vegetables were selling at Rs 10 to Rs 25 last year.Onion prices are slightly lower in Indore, which is based in the onion-growing region of Malwa and Nimar. Since farmers with inferior quality of tainted onions, fearing rotting, are unable to send their produce long distances, they dump the crops in Indore mandi, said another Indore-based whole-seller Ajay Agarwal.To prevent rotting, suppliers are buying old stocks of onions and mixing them with the new inferior stock in order to enable the consignments to reach long distances without rotting, he added. Agrawal said onions are selling at Rs 45-Rs 48 per kg in wholesale markets and Rs 60-Rs 70 in retail markets.If the weather and supplies improve, only then will the prices of onions and other vegetables cool down, said Agarwal, blaming the dwindling supplies on heavy rainfall. MP has witnessed 148% of the normal rate of rainfall this year, with the agricultural-rich Malwa-Nimar regions primarily bearing the brunt of the rain fury.Most traders believe the prices will reduce once the supplies improve and fresh stocks hit the market, which could take within a fortnight to a month.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

As soon as a couple of trucks reach the city the prices fall, as was observed around November 8. However, the entire fleet, which started from Nashik in Maharashtra, has yet to reach the city. So, supply has run out quickly, driving up the prices, said Parlad Singh, president of the Apni Mandis Association.PRICES HIGH IN NASHIK TOOTruck drivers were also reluctant to go back to Nashik to pick up supplies as onion prices over there had increased, said KK Abrol, president of the Chandigarh Transport Association (CTA).Because of bad weather, the onion crop there was affected and prices have gone up. Our margins for transporting onion back to the city have fallen so many truck drivers are choosing not to go down to Maharashtra to transport onion, added Abrol.Meanwhile, officials of the Sector 26 vegetable market said that onions from Rajasthan were selling in the wholesale market for around 50 per kg.However, the quality of these onions is much poorer compared to the ones from Nashik, so they dont find many takers.ADMN WATCHING SILENTLYChandigarh administration officials have said that no steps have been taken to control prices. There is a problem with supply but it will be resolved in a few days, an official said on condition of anonymity.Tomatoes also maintained a high of 50 per kg after selling for 30 last month even as Punjab mandi board officials pointed to irregularity of supply affecting prices.Supply from Himachal Pradesh has been erratic, and tomatoes get destroyed even when light rain occurs. The local crop of tomatoes will be in the market soon and will drive down prices, they said."
2019-11-13,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/akshaya-patra-exempted-from-use-of-onion/article29957096.ece,Akshaya Patra exempted from use of onion,"While the new midday meal menu stipulated by the Department of Public Instruction specifies that onion should be included, the government has given an exemption to Akshaya Patra Foundation. The NGO, which provides middaymeals to lakhs of students, does not use either garlic or onionin its food.Also read: Why are Karnatakas schoolchildren unhappy with the mid-day meal?At a press conference on Tuesday, K.G. Jagadeesha, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said one of the clauses in the order states that if NGOs wish to make any changes to the menu, they need to approach the government. The foundation has already taken permission from the government for its menu, he said, adding that the National Institute of Nutrition has stated that the food the foundation provides is in compliance with the nutritional guidelines mandated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).According to MHRD norms, each serving supplied to lower primary students should have 450 kcal energy and 12 gm protein. For upper primary classes it should be 700 kcal with 20 gm protein per serving.Mr. Jagadeesha added that the menu was revised only to break the monotony for students.The controversy over the inclusion of onion and garlic had reared its head in November 2018, after the department had issued a notice urging the foundation to include both items in its midday meals. Although the State government had initially refused to sign a contract with it, it later relented.Officials in the department said that they were forced to relent as they did not find an alternative vendor. In Bengaluru alone, Akshaya Patra Foundation provides meals to 1.83 lakh students in 1,212 schools.In Karnataka, 8.6 lakh of the total 53.47 lakh students are served midday meals provided by non-governmental organisations, including Akshaya Patra. In the remaining schools, students get food cooked by midday meal workers in the kitchen located on the premises.Build curiosity in studentsInculcating curiosity and building lessons to hold the attention of students is high on the governments to-do list. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar has asked the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) to develop learning modules to build curiosity among the students. The services of the Block Resource Personnel and Cluster Resource Personnel will be tapped to study learning outcomes in government schools."

The central bank is expected to cut the repo rate in December for the sixth meeting in a row, according to a separate Reuters poll. That view primarily stems from a slowing economy.The inflation in the food basket spiked to 7.89 per cent in October 2019 as against 5.11 per cent the preceding month, showed the data released by the Central Statistics Office under the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) on Wednesday.A poll conducted by news agency Reuters had predicted that retail prices rose to 4.25 per cent in October, its highest since June 2018.Prices of most vegetables climbed during the month as monsoon downpours delayed harvests and disrupted supplies. That was despite a government ban on onion exports, a key component in the Indian diet.During the month, inflation in vegetables spiked to 26.10 per cent from 5.40 per cent in September, while for fruits it jumped to 4.08 per cent from 0.83 per cent.Aditi Nayar, economist at Icra told news agency PTI that looking ahead the pace of normalisation in vegetable prices will be the key driver of the trend in food inflation over the next few months.""Overall, the CPI inflation may continue to print higher than 4 per cent in the remainder of FY2020, complicating policy choices in light of the slowdown in economic growth momentum.""The sharp uptick in the CPI inflation in October 2019 has contrasted with the industrial contraction recorded in September 2019. In our view, the extent to which the Q2 FY2020 GDP growth reading eases further from the 5 per cent recorded in the previous quarter, will influence the MPC's decision on whether to cut rates further, and by how much, in the December 2019 policy review,"" she said.Despite easy monetary and fiscal policy, recent business surveys indicate the economy, which slowed to a six-year low of 5 per cent growth during the second quarter, is still struggling and is not expected to recover anytime soon.(With agency inputs)"
2019-11-13,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/retail-inflation-at-16-month-high-as-food-prices-soar/story-a9OkJtmQD6ULoSSHyAHaNK.html,Retail inflation at 16-month high as food prices soar,"businessUpdated: Nov 14, 2019 00:56 ISTA sharp increase in food prices pushed the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Indias benchmark retail inflation measure, to 4.6% in October, a 16-month high.Analysts said the headline number probably conceals overall tepid demand in the economy, evident in non-food non-fuel inflation falling to its lowest level in the current series (since January 2012). Retail food inflation in October was 7.9%, the highest since August 2016. Retail inflation, excluding the food and beverages sub-group grew at just 2.7% in October. The food and beverages group has a share of 46% in the CPI basket. The 2.7% is the lowest ever value in the current series. Core inflation, which captures non-food non-fuel prices, too posted an annual growth of 3.3% in October, again the lowest in the current series.A steep rise in vegetable prices is the biggest reason for the sharp spike in food inflation. Vegetable price inflation in urban areas was 35.4% (over the same period a year ago); it was 21% in rural areas in October. Overall vegetable price inflation was 26.1%, the highest since February 2018. Price of pulses too increased at 11.7%, the highest since January 2016. A seasonal shock to vegetable supplies, such as that of onions because of untimely rains, is the main reason for the sharp rise in vegetable prices.To be sure, inflation has been inching up steadily this year. Retail inflation growth was 2% in January this year and it has increased every month except in July to reach 4.6% in October. However, the current phase of rise in inflation has been characterised by a peculiar trend of falling core inflation and rising food inflation unlike the earlier period, when core inflation continued to remain sticky even as food prices were falling.A fall in core inflation, when seen along with other high frequency economic indicators in the non-farm economy suggests weak demand conditions, analysts said. Industrial production, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production has contracted in both August and September this year. The Nikkei Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for service sector fell below 50 in the months of September and October. A value below 50 signifies contraction in economic activity in this index. PMI for industry was 50.6 in October, the lowest since November 2017. Composite PMI for both industry and services was below 50 in September and October. Various rating agencies have further downgraded their growth forecasts for the Indian economy after the IIP numbers were released this week. Japanese brokerage firm Nomura cut its fiscal year growth forecast for the Indian economy in 2019-2020 from 5.7% to 4.9%.The latest inflation numbers are likely to complicate matters when RBIs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets in the first week of December. Under Indias inflation targeting framework RBI is obliged to keep inflation at 4% with a range of two percentage points on either end. The central bank uses policy rates, the interest rate at which it lends money to other banks, to achieve this objective. RBI has cut the policy rate in five consecutive bimonthly policy meetings to pump-prime the Indian economy. However, this has not helped as growth rates have continued to slide. With headline inflation above the 4% mark, itll be interesting to see whether RBI continues its monetary easing stance, analysts said.The sharp spike in inflation, which is driven solely by food price increase, highlights the growing crisis in the economy. With non-farm sectors in a protracted slowdown, rise in food prices will hurt aggregate demand even more said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. This also raises questions on the validity of sticking to the inflation targeting framework, as policy rates can hardly influence food prices, he added.We expect a December rate cut, but beyond that, it will be close decision (as inflation prints beyond October will remain elevated). Thus, it will be better if the rate cut is front-loaded in December, said a research note from Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at the State Bank of India."
2019-11-14,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/understanding-india-s-inflation-trends-ht-editorial/story-1LiTjmk5KJqbgNznSvOn2H.html,Understanding India's inflation trends | HT editorial,"editorialsUpdated: Nov 14, 2019 20:34 ISTIndias inflation numbers are diverging once again. Retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), grew at 4.6% in October on an annual basis. This is the highest in 16 months. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) grew at just 0.2% in October though, the lowest in 40 months. These figures will be a key subject of discussion when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India meets next month to decide on policy rates.The short answer to why inflation numbers show a divergent trend is food. Food and beverages have a share of 46% in the CPI basket. This is only 24% for the WPI basket. The spike in retail inflation is mainly because of a seasonal shock to food prices, especially vegetables. In fact, non-food, non-fuel retail inflation is the lowest since January 2012. In terms of a trend, this is not very different from what the WPI numbers tell us. WPI for food group grew at 7.7% in October, the highest in 38 months.There is very little monetary policy can do in terms of influencing onion prices when crops have been destroyed due to rains. However, the sharp fall in non-food inflation suggests that aggregate demand in the non-farm economy continues to be weak, despite RBI having cut policy rates in five consecutive MPCs. While it can be argued that rate cuts on their own are not enough to revive economic activity, there is good reason to believe that a reversal in the rate cut cycle can worsen matters even more. The central bank is mandated to keep headline inflation at 4%, within a range of 2 percentage points under the inflation targeting framework which guides Indias monetary policy. Even if the MPC expects food inflation to remain high in the near future, and this is a possibility, as unseasonal rains have destroyed crops in a lot of regions, it should be careful in unleashing rate hikes. The hallmark of good policy making lies in knowing when the tools at hand will work and when they wont."
2019-11-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rbis-choice-monetary-policy-committee-6120252/,RBI’s choice,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India is scheduled to meet in the first week of December. With various economic indicators indicating that growth has slowed down considerably over the past few months, the consensus so far has been that the MPC will cut the benchmark repo rate for the sixth straight time in December, bringing it below 5 per cent. It was expected that this accomodative stance would continue in the next year as well until there was firm evidence of a broad-based pick-up in growth. But the sharper than expected spike in headline retail inflation in October has complicated the policy choices before the MPC. Data from the National Statistics Office shows that headline retail inflation edged up to 4.62 per cent in October, up from 3.99 per cent in September, largely on the back of higher food inflation. This upswing, which is unlikely to reverse in the coming months, has created uncertainty over the future course of monetary policy.AdvertisingThe inflation data shows that food inflation has jumped to 7.89 per cent in October, up from 5.11 per cent in the previous month, driven by a surge in vegetables prices, especially of onion and tomatoes. This surge is unlikely to subside. Food inflation is likely to remain elevated over the coming months, driving up headline retail inflation. Core inflation, which is essentially inflation excluding food and fuel, has moderated further, however, signaling continued weakness in demand. In its last policy review, the RBI had lowered its estimate for growth this year to 6.1 per cent, down from its earlier assessment of 6.9 per cent. This estimate was based on growth coming in at 5.3 per cent in the second quarter, and ranging between 6.6-7.2 per cent in the second half of the financial year. But there is little possibility of the RBIs projections materialising as various high frequency indicators suggest that growth is likely to fall below 5 per cent in the second quarter. Thus, the MPC finds itself in a peculiar position of having to address the growth slowdown while inflation rises.Going by current trends, with little possibility of a meaningful recovery in the near term, the situation warrants further monetary accommodation. So, while the MPC should carefully assess the trajectory of food inflation, its primary concern should be to arrest the slowdown. It should frontload the rate cuts in its December policy, though the magnitude of the cut will depend on the extent to which growth deviates from the RBIs own projection. The shift to external benchmarking should lead to a quicker transmission of the cuts to the broader economy."

The seized stocks would be handed over to marketing officials, he added.The SP (V&E) made it clear that the price should not exceed 35-40 a kg.The situation will ease once the stocks meant for supply in the district by the government arrive.

The first grade variety was not to be seen anywhere in the markets.Some traders have hoarded the fine variety with an eye of profits in mid-winter when availability of the vegetable comes down.Petty traders were seen moving around many localities selling the scrap variety at  100 per 3 kg, but housewives who thronged the outlets had to return disappointed after being told that they could not pick and choose. Left with no choice, they were making a beeline for the markets to buy the vegetable at a higher price."

And being a bar, the festivities had to go on beyond a day, and not one but two of Asias top female mixologists would guarantee a good night. The culinary collaboration with Martin was destined to happen for we had loved his food when we were in Valencia. The quirk and the willingness to push boundaries drew us to him, not to mention the warmth. The bartenders are in a league of their own, and their lineage and pedigree have also made them the perfect ambassadors of the culture we want to showcase. One comes from an award-winning tapas bar and the other is a boss lady who does the salsa, says Sharma.Fresh and favourfulFor Martin, it was important to push his palette and introduce a bit of India in the flavours too. When I received a call from Uno Ms, I was over the moon as we had met when they were on their research trip to Spain. They had tried a couple of restaurants before and after mine. There was something about my food which struck a chord with them. From Spain, we bring our seafood flavours and combined with local fresh produce, we are sure that the offerings will surprise everyone, Martin tells us. The visiting chef, will be using local squid, octopus, duck, asparagus and artichokes. Adding flavours to this will be smoked paprika, chillies, cumin, fresh herbs, lots of onions, some pickles, saffron and aioli. These dishes will complement chef Anuritas pastry menu, which includes ingredients such as membrillo and horchata from Valencia. Several spices overlap between Spain and India and we are here to lend a lovely balance, Martin tells us, before heading off to a local market to discover ingredients that will add to the flavour explosion.Whats for tippleHeading the bar for three days will be Macarena Rotger, the chief mixologist and bar manager of The Other Roof in Singapore. Rotger, we are told is the first woman to hold the title in the history of the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts chain. She will be joined by Patricia Lozano Peral, Senior Bartender at 28 HongKong Street, Singapore. The duo will offer special concoctions such as Mexican Mistress (a mix of tequila, grapefruit, jalapeno, firewater bitters); Flamenco Martini (ginger vodka, passionfruit and cinnamon); and the Uno Mas, a mix of Monkey 47, fresh lime and cucumber.On November 16 and 17 at Uno Mas, BKC, Bandra East"

Mehta, executive director of the SEA.As a result local soybean prices have risen to their highest in 3-1/2 years, making exports of soymeal uncompetitive, traders said.Lower soybean production could force India, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, to import more in 2019/20 marketing year that started on Oct.1, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.Other Crops HitThe deluge also hit cotton in the world's biggest producer.Cotton bolls were damaged by late rains in Maharashtra and Gujarat, which account for over half of the country's output, said Arun Sekhsaria, managing director of exporter D.D. Cotton.0Until a few weeks ago, industry officials such as Pradeep Jain, president of Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Factory Owners and Traders Association, were expecting a 20% jump in cotton production in 2019 from a year ago.But now Jain says the production could rise by 10 to 12%.Cyclone Bulbul also soaked the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal last week, damaging rice crops in these key producing states, said Nitin Gupta, vice president for Olam India's rice business.""Supplies from the new season crop for exports have been delayed by around two weeks,"" Gupta said.Sugar mills in Maharashtra, the No. 2 sugar state, were forced to delay the start of the new crushing season by a few weeks due to wet fields, said Prakash Naiknavare, head of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.The heavy downpours also elevated prices of vegetables such onions and tomatoes and lifted food inflation to 7.89% in October from a year earlier.That in turn pushed inflation above the central bank's medium-term target of 4% in October for the first time in 15 months. The untimely rains also delayed winter sowing of wheat, chickpeas, vegetables and other crops.""I need to harvest soybean before planting sugarcane. But soybean harvesting has already been delayed,"" says Chikhale.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-11-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-lisbon-connection/article29985612.ece,The Lisbon connection,"Chef Andr Magalhes is full of tales. He weaves history and anecdotes into delightful stories about food. By the side, he also creates delicious meals. Born in Angola, Magalhes has a colourful history. He has dabbled in the movie industry, did a short stint as a sailor, a tourist guide and set decorator. Today, he teaches food science, is a journalist, and the chef of the celebrated Taberna da Rua das Flores in Lisbon.Beyond the clichsHe is in India to curate a menu, Finding Lisbon in Goa, at O Pedro that seeks inspiration from his travels to Goa and harks back to its Portuguese origins. Magalhes is all set take over the O Pedro kitchen for two days, while select dishes will be on the menu until the end of the month.The challenge was to create a menu that illustrates the diversities and complexities of Portuguese and Indian food. We didnt want to stay too conventional but go beyond the clichs, he says. The food thus, has Portuguese techniques with local ingredients though Magalhes has brought with him salted cod, cheese and chourico.My food journey starts with Petiscos, which are small snacks or nibbles eaten at the beginning of every meal. These are not like tapas. Petitcos have their own identity. We eat small bites before the meal, usually bread and butter, he says. My Petiscos platter has Cultured Butter ( 90) made with dry yeast, Herb marinated Buffalo Milk Cheese (160) and Warm Cured Olives (190) and sourdough bread (we eat only sourdough at home). In small plates, first up is Cheese Toast (550), with sheeps milk cheese, apricot chutney and smoked almonds.Instead of rennet, we use thistle flowers in the preparation. The resultant cheese is so runny, it is wrapped in a cotton cloth to give it shape, he says. Next is Asparagus Tempura (650) served with Parmesan truffle cream. This dish is an ode to how food travels the world. Portuguese missionaries took this cooking technique to Japan but its origins are possibly Jewish. Battered and fried green beans called peixinhos do horta (little fish of the garden) was commonly eaten during Lent as a replacement for meat, he says. His version for the feast replaces green beans with asparagus, in a light batter, topped with grated cheese.A sizeable portion of Magalhes menu is dedicated to greens. Theres Sweet Potato Croquettes (450) with scallion and string cheese, and Pumpkin Empanada (595)  a pie with garlic, spinach, onion served surrounded by a creamy red pepper sauce. I reserve my attention to the meat in front of me. Grilled Chicken Skewers (550) comes with chips and Peri Peri Sauce.The Peri Peri is the protagonist of this story. In Mozambique and Angola, this chilli was typically paired with a protein like wild chicken. Any barbecued chicken had to be marinated for hours to soften the tough muscles. The secret of a good grilled chicken depended on the length of the marinating process, he says, adding that it is very popular dish in Portugal especially on Sunday nights. A Seafood Cataplana (1100) impresses with its flavourful broth, stacked with chunky bits of red snapper, lobster and calamari. The dish gets its name from the copper utensil in which it is prepared  it can be sealed thus allowing the fish to cook in its own juices, he says.My pick is the Bolinhos de Bacalhau (650). Bacalhau is salted or dried cod. Magalhes prepared his cakes by soaking the salted cod in water for three days, shredding it and mashing it with potato, parsley, onion, salt and pepper. Soup spoons give it shape. This dish requires a lot of work to ensure it is fluffy and aerated. You judge bacalhau by the amount of fish is in it as compared to potato. I use a 60-40 ratio, he says.Culinary additionsAnother favourite is Chorizo Flamb (850), homemade Portuguese Sausage that is cured, dried and smoked. Goans took the sausages and not only improved it but made it more user-friendly, quips Magalhes as he snips the meat into slices.Goa is the only example of charcuterie making in the southern hemisphere. In warm climates, chacuterie is bound to spoil, which is why they add spices and vinegar to the preparation. Magalhes love for Goa is evident. His current visit happened after 15 years. He has a few Goan-inspired dishes on his menu at Taberna da Rua das Flores, like sarapatel and para but prefers to leave the rest to the excellent Goan restaurants in Lisbon. An apt cocktail for a feast thats reminiscent of Goa and Portugal is the Porto in Bombay (675), deep red and slightly sweet with the aroma of rosemary and a vibrant homemade port.Sweet collaborationsMy meal has been consistently good so, dessert is no surprise. The real surprise is learning that the Serica (495) is a dish that travelled from Goa to Portugal.This baked custard was originally made with gram flour and jaggery and cooked in an earthen dish. Magalhes uses wheat flour and sugar, and fresh strawberries. The Flan Cake (450) is like a boozy Christmas pudding layered with dried fruits, fresh oranges and port wine.It was originally made with smoked pork lard to increase the savoury flavour. This version is like a rich crme caramel. Its the perfect ending to a stellar meal and a nod to the season ahead.Chef Andr Magalhes Takeover at O Pedro, BKC on November 16 and 17 (November 18 to 30, specials menu)."

In October, inflation quickened more than expected to 4.62% because of, yes, an onion shortage. Yet core inflation, which strips out volatile commodity prices, slumped to 3.4%, the lowest since the current price series began in 2012.One explanation is that people have less money to spend on other things after buying vegetables. Yet, as Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics puts it, a 1.1% point drop in core inflation over three months is rare. This weakness isnt solely due to spending being diverted, he says in a research note.Its a demand funk. Until about 2012, temporary supply shocks dominated. The starting point of production and transport is hydrocarbons, and India needs to import most of its crude oil. The government also has to pay farmers to feed 1.3 billion people. Because of the outsize dominance of food and fuel in consumption, price stability is ephemeral: A few months of high inflation could drastically impact consumers expectations.Any gap between (runaway) headline and (soft) core inflation would typically close with the core moving toward the main indicator. But something has changed. The supply-dominated headline number is now more likely to shift toward the demand-led core figure, JPMorgan Chase & Co. research has shown. Slack in the economy  of which theres plenty  has become much more important than a transient disruption in commodity supplies.Therefore, despite consumer prices rising more than the central banks 4% target for the first time since mid-2018, the new consensus is that the economy is deflation-bound. Thats the reason most observers are shrugging off the October inflation rate as any kind of a speed limit on the central banks rate cuts.Whether the five rate reductions this year will lift demand is a different story. Banks arent passing lower borrowing costs down the line. As of August, their weighted average lending charge was almost double the Reserve Bank of Indias repurchase rate. This record spread is a crisis-like situation, Credit Suisse AG strategist Neelkanth Mishra says.Its also a supply-side bottleneck, except more durable. The input missing from the production process is trust. In September last year, when I termed the collapse of infrastructure financier IL&FS Group as Indias mini-Lehman moment, lending by shadow banks was growing by 24%. Its now collapsed to 7% because everyones worried about who will go bust next. Nonbank financiers funding sources have dried up. Meanwhile, state-run banks are dogged by $200 billion-plus in bad corporate loans, no matter how generously a cash-strapped government tries to recapitalize them.Nomuras Sonal Varma calls it a triple balance sheet problem shared by banks, shadow lenders and India Inc. In her estimate, GDP expansion may have slowed further to 4.2% in the September quarter from a six-year low of 5% in the previous three months. The potential growth rate, she says, is around 6.5%. The longer the deleveraging cycle lasts, the bigger the risk that this potential could ebb further.How fast an economy can grow is measured from the supply side  by slapping together labor and capital inputs as well as productivity growth. But its here that demand is emerging as a constraint. Consumer spending fell in real terms in 2017-18, its first decline in four decades, the Business Standard reported Friday, citing an unreleased official survey. As Rathin Roy of the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy has been arguing, the economy grows by producing what 150 million of the top income earners consume. When it comes to an inexpensive shirt that Indias workers can make for their billion-plus fellow citizens, Bangladesh does a better job.India balked at the last minute from joining the 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement because it cant compete against China in making everyday things. Roys call for a meaningful minimum wage for workers in all Indian states rich and poor shows a sensible way to create sustainable demand. Make things well enough for a swelling home market, and eventually India will supply them to the world.Satisfying the needs at the vast bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid will reduce slack. In an emerging market, confidence of entrepreneurs comes not from killer innovation but from knowing that producers can sell what they make. An undemanding India hurts everyone."

But soybean harvesting has already been delayed,"" says Chikhale.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Accordingly, four consignments were booked between November 11 and 17, 2014.However, after receiving the first two consignments, the purchaser asked the exporter not to ship the remaining ones citing financial and marketing problems. However, since the consignments had already been dispatched, the exporter sold it to different buyers in Vietnam and Malaysia.However, it incurred a loss of Rs 48.70 lakh to the exporter, the complaint said.The exporter then submitted his request for claim to the ECGCI, which turned it down saying the buyer had raised an issue about the quality, which is not covered in the claim.The complainant, however, contended that the buyer had duped him by raising the issue of quality in July 2015, eight months after the first two consignments were shipped.After hearing the arguments, the commission observed that the ECGCI Limited, after insuring the complainant for loss during import-export, rejected the claim on the basis of late communication by the original buyer.The ECGCI did not bring on record any quality expert report, and hence, was not successful in proving its own contention.The ECGCIs act of rejecting the claim of the complainant amounted to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice, the commission said."
2019-11-18,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/onion-prices-may-fall-after-january/articleshow/72116243.cms,Maharashtra: Onion prices may fall after January,"Representative imagePUNE: The onion crisis sweeping the state may reduce to some extent from January-end after harvesting the late kharif crop. The area under cultivation has already surpassed that of the last year for the same period. Onion sowing statistics from the state agriculture department show that the area used for late kharif onion sowing till November 11 is up by approximately 9,400 hectare in the state in comparison with the same period last year. The harvests from this sowing will come out from January, officials said, which is likely to bring down the prices of the kitchen essential.Rabi sowing of onions in the state is also likely to touch 2.90 lakh hectare for 2019-20 as against 2.66 lakh hectare in 2018-19.A state agriculture department official told TOI that the area growing onion has increased for the late kharif season.Kharif onion sowing which starts in May and continues till July reduced due to less water earlier in the season. Late kharif season which normally starts in August and continues till September was extended due to the continuing rain and non-availability of farm labour. There was a delay in preparing the soil due to intense rain and hence the late kharif season onion sowing has extended into November. It is likely to continue for another 15 days, he said.Another reason for an increase in the area growing onions in the current season is the high prices that the vegetable is fetching currently in the markets.This is prompting farmers to plant more onions as they feel they would get a good price when harvests are out by January end, after which prices are expected to fall, he said.Currently, onions are being sold at a high cost of Rs 80 per kg in the retail market and Rs 1,500-Rs 5,800 per quintal in the wholesale market. Traders said this has been one of the steepest rise in onion prices in several years.Shriram Gadhave, president of Vegetable Growers' Association of India, said farmers could not plant onions during August and September due to intense rain spells.Those who had planted had to suffer heavy losses because of the rain. Many farmers are now either replanting the bulb or undertaking fresh sowing in anticipation of getting a good price once the harvests are out in January. Prices should also stabilize then, he added.Vijay Thube, director of Shashvat Krushi Vikas Producer Company, said prices of onions are not expected to fall before January-end as the bulbs planted in the late kharif season will be harvested in February and March. Onion sowing began two weeks ago and it takes around three months for the harvest to be ready."

However, in the same week last year, the price of Grade-I on average was Rs 1,850 per quintal and of Grade-II was Rs 960 per quintal.In comparison, this year the price of Grade-I in the same week was on an average Rs 3,800 per quintal and Grade-II was Rs 3,440 per quintal.Coming to retail rates, price of Grade-I onion in the city is as much as Rs 85 per kg and the lower quality is Rs 50-60 per kg.GV Ramanjaneyulu from Centre for Sustainable Agriculture says that the main problem is a lack of drying space and storage facility for farmers.As a result, farmers sell their produce soon after it is harvested, which is bought in huge quantities by traders.These traders then dry the onions, store it, and release them into the market in fewer quantities, thereby jacking up the prices.Telangana Rythu Sangham, general secretary, T Sagar, said, Farmers are getting just about Rs 25-Rs 30 per kg of onion. The middlemen and traders are taking a chunk of money that consumers pay. There is a serious need for the civil supplies department to intervene."

But these are almost over now and will soon run out of stock, said Ravi Kumar of Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association.Onions from Mahaarshtra, especially Pune and Nasik are expected to arrive by December first week. However, the recent spell of rains has led to large-scale crop loss in these areas too creating a high demand for good quality onions in the market. This may drive its price beyond the 100 a kilo mark in December, Mr. Kumar said. But onions of a poorer quality will be available for a lower price as well, he added."

The government has decided to import 1 lakh tonnes of onion through state-run MMTC, which has already invited bids for import of 4,000 tonnes.Onion prices came under pressure due to 30-40 per cent estimated fall in the kharif (summer) output this year on account of floods and drought.

The dampness in the fields, which lasted long after rains stopped, complicated their problems.Sudden slump in the prices had triggered protests at various places even as traders expressed helplessness over poor quality of the yield. Prices in the retail market were skyrocketing because of shortage in supply but farmers were not getting even the minimum price they were expecting.Wet consignmentsFarmers from various villages in the districts of Dharwad, Belagavi, Bagalkot and Vijayapura come to Hubballi APMC to sell their onion crop and several of them had returned disappointed.That was because we could not keep wet consignments for long. We had to dump them as the crop perishes quickly because of dampness. The slump in prices was due the damaged crop in each lot. Good quality onion got more price than before, said onion merchant Salim Byahatti. According to him, onion from Vijayapura and Bagalkot got better price while that from Dharwad, Haveri got less.In the first week of November, it was a pathetic situation for the rain and flood-affected farmers when the prices of both local and Teligi varieties fetched as low as 300 per quintal and the modal price stood around 1,700.Change for the betterBut now the situation has changed, farmers are getting fair prices, said Gurusiddappa Ambiger, General Secretary of the APMC Hamali Karmikara Sangha. In the last one week, the modal price of onions both local and Teligi varieties at the Hubballi APMC (Amaragol) hovered around 2,000 to 2,500.According to Mr. Ambiger, due to changed weather, the quality of the arrivals too had improved and the farmers too were not complaining much since they were now getting better prices.APMC data shows that while the minimum price has been 500, the maximum price has gone up to 4,500 in the last week. And on Monday, the modal price was 2,600 and maximum price stood at 4,800.But farmers are not happy as despite short supply, there has been just a marginal increase in the prices. Fakirappa Hadimani from Navalgund was upset because, according to him, low prices were being quoted although the quality of the crop was not as bad as claimed. However, he admitted that compared to the first week of November, the situation had improved a lot now."

He said early 44 farmers in Nashik alone had committed suicide in the past 10 months.WATCH | Presidents rule in Maharashtra: All you need to knowThe Pawar-Modi meeting comes two days after the Prime Minister praised the NCP for their decision to not enter the Well of the house during proceedings.In the memorandum, Pawar said crops like soyabean, paddy, finger millets, corn, bajra and vegetables like tomato and onion were at the harvesting stage but incessant rainfall in Nashik completely ruined them.Owing to Presidents rule in the state, the NCP chief requested Modi to intervene and ensure immediate steps to provide relief measures to ameliorate distressed farmers.In the memorandum, Pawar demanded zero per cent credit to farmers to raise new crops and to save them from being exploited by private money lenders or finance companies. Citing data, he said that cotton crops over 35,000 hectares had been damaged.He stated that the Maharashtra Governors recent announcement of Rs 8,000 per hectare for agricultural crops and Rs 18,000 per hectare for horticulture crops were too inadequate to compensate for the losses faced by farmers.

Retail prices of onions are continuing to rule above Rs 60/kg in the national capital and other consuming centres.Onion prices have come under pressure due to 26 per cent fall in the production to 52.06 lakh tonnes during the kharif output late-kharif seasons of 2019-20.The all-India average retail price of onion stood at Rs 60.38 per kg on November 15, compared with Rs 22.84 per kg on the same date last year.Besides easing norms for onion import, the government has taken several measures including ban on exports, stock limits on traders and sale of the commodity stored as buffer, at a subsidised rate."

A look closer at the menu and its not difficult to ascertain that most of the ingredients used are procured from the very source  Nature given the tribe doesnt believe in artificiality and modern culinary approaches.The tribe uses the local produce like lentils, ragi and other millets. Shares chef Vellu, The settlers entered through Tamil Nadu and settled in Marayoor, Kerala 42 km north of Munnar. They dress up nicely in white attire and pagdi and have deep religious belief. The root vegetables are offered as the prasad. With the permission of government he reached to people there and brought back the recipes.As the region is known for production of pepper, lemongrass, tea, cardamom, jaggery and a few other spices we found a generous hint of many of these in the dishes. The welcome drink sambaram was buttermilk spiced with lemongrass. The herb gave it a unique freshness.In the starters we liked Meen Varthad, fish smeared with ground peppers, rolled in betel leaves and then shallow fried. We loved Kootu Curry, a combination of yam and Bengal gram, tempered with mustard and coconut. Nei Choru, the ghee rice sprinkled with fried sliced onions was the star among staples. Erachi Melagu Curry was a mix of boneless mutton in spicy black pepper gravy.The taste can be overwhelming for some as the dishes are quite spicy and a bit above tangy. What we loved the best was the steamed salted rice cake named Aatu Kari Charu which had tiny chunks of mutton. Shares the chef, To prepare this, rice batter and coconut water are fermented separately, then they both are mixed together and again allowed to ferment for some more time. Thats why it rises like a cake and is relished for breakfast with a cup of black tea. We rounded up the lunch with Neyyi Payasam, red rice kheer of coconut milk and jaggery.The food fest is on till November 24 at Dakshin, ITC Kakatiya.Charges:Veg: Rs 2,000++Non veg: Rs 2,200++Seafood: Rs 2,400++For lunch and dinner"
2019-11-20,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/nov/20/veggie-prices-go-north-2064070.html,Veggie prices go north,"Gautham S ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: The shortage of vegetable supply from other states and lack of local produce are causing a steep increase in prices of vegetables. The rates of shallot (small onion), onion and garlic have shot up with garlic registering the highest increase. According to Udayakumar, a vendor at Ernakulam local market, the price of garlic now stands at Rs 220 per kilo.While shallot was priced at `80 per kg in October, it touched Rs 90 on Tuesday. Onions are being sold for Rs 75-80 per kg since October while drumsticks, priced at Rs 80 in October, rose to Rs 240 in November. Two months back, one kg of drumstick was priced at just Rs 40. The production has come down drastically in other states, which reflects on the prices, adds Udayakumar.Coriander leaves, priced at Rs 60 per kg in October, now costs Rs 150.Cheaper veggiesThe price of carrot has gone up to Rs 70 from Rs 60 in October. Ooty carrots are being sold at this rate. There is a cheaper variety which is being sold at Rs 30-40 a kg. The market also has small-size onions priced around Rs 70, he says. However, the sale isnt affected. Since shallot, onion and garlic are unavoidable, people will buy it despite the price. The quantity, of course, has come down. Earlier, if people bought 3 kg, it has come down to 1 kg, says Aji, another vendor at Ernakulam local market.More takers for Chinese potato One vegetable that has seen a slump in prices is Chinese potato. The price has fallen to Rs 40-50 per kg from Rs 80 in October. The fall in price has favoured the sale. Chinese potatoes will remain cheap till March, after which the prices will go back to Rs 80, says Udayakumar.Crisis for vendorsAccording to Valsa Antony, a vendor at Kaloor market, the increase in prices doesnt favour vendors much. After transportation charges, we get just `5 or `6 as profit. We havent benefitted from the price hike, he says. Though the price hike is common during this period, this year it is particularly high.The vegetable market is down this year. Also, markets like Kaloor are not getting enough customers with the arrival of hypermarkets, says Sathar O A, another vendor.According to residents, the government should bring more produce to the market, in the wake of the hike. Unless local production improves, the prices hike will keep fluctuating, says Udayakumar. According to Shameed N H, general secretary, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association, the flood in Maharashtra has affected the production of shallot, onion and garlic.The onions stored by the farmers are being sold in the market now, thats why the price has gone up. According to reports, the price of onion in New Delhi has reached around Rs 100. Maharashtra and New Delhi, which produces onion and garlic extensively, hasnt been able to bring the price down. Since we lack local production, we cannot control the prices. Vendors can sell local produce at lower rates if the government helps them with subsidies, he adds.LoadsAccording to the vendors, the Ernakulam local market used to get around 50 loads daily from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. But since the production has gone down, the number of loads has reduced to 20-25."

While nearly half the calls the agency receives are termed ineffective, one-fifth of the remaining calls are non-emergency calls, performance reports published by the National Rural Health Mission in Tamil Nadu revealed.The control room in Chennai, which works round-the-clock, got 17 lakh calls between April and June this year. Of these, around 5 lakh were for medical emergencies, including pregnancies, road accidents, poisoning, heart attack and strokes. Though the percentage of non-emergency and ineffective calls has come down from 83% in April-June 2013 to 68.46% in April-June 2019, staff say prank callers including drunk men continue to clog the helpline. They complain about increasing onion prices, discuss current affairs, ask for cricket scores, sing songs or sometimes just keep silent. Over a period, we have learned to quickly disconnect such callers. But before we do so, we have to ensure the person calling isnt in pain or scared to talk, an employee said.For instance, if students are calling in panic ahead of examinations or if someone sounds dangerously low, the line is transferred to 104 for counselling. Even among emergencies, some calls are transferred to police and fire services.As a result, staff point out that the percentage of unanswered calls has gone up from 1.72% in 2013 to 4% in 2019 and the percentage of calls attended to on the first ring has come down from 92% to 85%.This is despite a reduction in the number of calls. Between April and June 2013, the agency got 23 lakh calls compared to 17 lakh in the same period in 2019. But, in some months, we see very high numbers, a senior official said.The call centre, which works from the 108 headquarters in the Directorate of Medical Services campus, has more than 120 lines and more than 60 operators on every shift. It receives more than 4,000 calls a day from across the state. Almost every helpline across the globe has this problem, said GVK EMRI state head Dr Selvakumar.The 100 helpline operated by the police department also faces similar problems. Those manning the police helpline initially asked callers to hang up if they had dialled by mistake. Now, callers are asked to dial 1 to proceed. So if people have dialled by mistake they can cut the call. We are now trying to develop a programme to track those making prank calls so legal action can be initiated against them, said a senior police officer."

I am also trying very hard to stick to my truism that praise comes from me quite miserly. I am trying not to overstate the elation and rapture I felt, as I left the restaurant after eating that meal.So before I turn into a gushing fanboy, let me talk about Akerkar himself. Somewhere in the 90s, south Mumbais beau monde started prattling about how theatre actress Jinx Akerkars son had returned from abroad armed with an engineering degree and wanted to give it all up, to do some catering.I knew the Padamsees and the da Cunhas and Jinx had dabbled with The Theatre Group, so I heard the news too. Even at that time I thought to myself, that fellow must have gumption. The next nugget the grapevine brought in was that the Akerkar boy had started a catering service from home called The Moveable Feast, which did French-European food for home parties. This was a time when catering for parties from home meant you either slaved in the kitchen along with your cooks and maids, or hired a chef for the day or ordered in from an Indian or Chinese restaurant.Just as The Movable Feast was making the citys movers drool came Just Desserts. Along with AD Singh, Rahul appropriated Parisian Bakery and Caf, an Irani eatery in Fort, for the evenings. The caf downed shutters at 6 pm, and thats when Rahul and AD brought it alive with desserts and coffee. It was insane. Bombay thronged to this place; there was music, coffee, pastries, not only in the caf but flowing out onto the pavements and on top of bonnets of cars.Just Desserts then moved over the weekends to The Ripon Club, but permissions and landlord woes shut it all down.I lived at Breach Candy then. A faux hard rock caf had opened near China Garden, and Open House, under the Kemps Corner flyover, was quite the rage for burgers and stuff. One fine day, Open House shut and Under the Over opened. It was 1992 and we had never seen a caf like that in our little lives. Rahuls personality was written all over the smart, stylish, bright, simple restaurant. Twenty-seven years later I still remember the menu. Stuffed potato skins, cheesy nachos and chicken Dijonnaise (a creamy mustard sauce with bacon bits). And the piece de rsistance, the Hungry Mans Barbecue. Half a chicken roasted and smothered in a smoky, sweet and tangy sauce. And brownies and Baileys cheesecake for dessert.Here Id like to emphasise that Id never heard of brownies or cheesecake before that, and neither had most people. By that time I had met Rahul, but by chance. I was art directing an ad campaign that was being photographed by the then young shutterbug Atul Kasbekar. Rahul (with hair), featured prominently in the photograph, all double-breasted with a hand-tied bow. Id then meet him as he bustled around in and out of the kitchen of Under the Over.I have very fond memories of that place; two stand out for me. The first a very spirited lunch with writer, author and friend Nisha da Cunha who accompanied me thinking shed have to settle for a salad, since she was vegetarian, but was pleasantly surprised. And the second, a heart-to-heart with Cyrus Broacha who had quit his first proper job that morning so that he could head to New York to study acting. Unfortunately Under the Over shut down, and my lament will always be that very little remains documented about a restaurant that changed the way we ate in Bombay.Then came Indigo. The first standalone fine-dine restaurant in the city. Rahul took over this little cottage in a bylane of Colaba and shook all five-star hotels out of their complacency. Indigo elevated the dining experience to the highest level, with design, cuisine and a focus on modern and classic-modern food. The clubby bar counter with dining areas, its terrace with a deep, brown cigar lounge. The lobster bisque with hints of fennel, Camembert souffl truffle fondue, beef carpaccio with capers, the risottos made to perfection, pork belly slow-cooked with bacon jam. This was gastronomy at its best. I had many a good meal and dozens of great boozy evenings stumbling down the wooden staircase and onto the pebbled exit, looking up at the lonely dome of the Taj at night.Then another first, Indigo Deli, which opened where Nanking once stood. Top-notch design, lots of wine, the best charcuterie and fromagerie, great sandwiches, pizzas, mains, dessert and breads. And then Neel at Tote on the Turf, the finest Awadhi food. I could go on and on, but I need to get to Qualia before I run out of ink and space.Staged with high ceilings, chainmail curtains, jars of pickled viands; you enter to the soothing crackle and pop of a wood fire that heralds warmth and energy and embraces you. Qualia is a spectacular space. Its posh, yet approachable. The staff is friendly and warm, yet proper. In his words, Rahul brings his international and Konkani tastebuds together in a chorus of strong flavours and vibrant textures.I started with the oxtail tortelletti. Little packages of pasta stuffed with tender meat in a reduced and flavourful bold meat stock with roasted onions a la a French onion soup. It was fresh and resolute. Next the steak tartare. Smarting and pickled, perfectly denatured meat served along with cured egg, pickled mushrooms, capers, chives and a slice of homemade sourdough.Coimbatore pork chops in a cider cumin glaze with white beans, poignant candied tomatoes and crunchy sage leaves. And pizza for my finale. Half with steak and eggs and the other with clams and mussels. The steak and poached egg, with mushrooms, tomatoes, aged cheddar and mozzarella, and the mollusk with black garlic, confit potato, Emmental and arugula. Not about to leave without dessert I finished with the Textures of Bitter Chocolate soil, ganache, wafers and wonderful things.Ill put it this way: there are gimmicks and mimics and then there is Rahul."

The price has risen by 33.3% in a week  from 60 to 80.President of the apni mandis Prahlad Singh said, In around two decades in Chandigarh, the price of onions never reached 80 per kg. The supply hasnt reached the city this week and farmers are earning little from onion produce.Officials at an apni mandi said, Most onions in the mandis have come from stores and the stock will run out within a few days. No fresh supply of the commodity reached the city on Saturday. The price may increased further if supplies dont become normal. Only onion from Rajasthan will be available in the market and none from Nashik.Political scenario of Maharashtra to blameA senior official of the UT food and supplies department, on the condition of anonymity, said, The shortage of onions isnt just in Chandigarh but all over the country. It is happening due to the political upheavals in Maharashtra. Nashik supplies major portion of the onions across the country and, at times, the commodity is used as a tool to meet political ends. Officials confirmed that there is very little supply of onions in Sector 26 mandi and wholesale rate is 70 per kg there.Meanwhile, the price of tomatoes has come down to 30 per kg, a drop of 50% from the previous week."

The prices are based on the wholesale price of onion at Kurnool agriculture market yard.Though the price of onion has spiralled to Rs 7,200 per quintal in the district and has made the common people unhappy, the onion farmers are a happy lot with the wholesale price of onion reaching to a record 10-year high.As a result of this high price, farmers are bringing their produce to the Kurnool agriculture market yard in huge quantities daily, even when the vegetable brought may need 10 more days to fully mature. On an average 4,000 quintals of onion from various parts of district have been arriving in the market daily for the past few days and the farmers, as has been mentioned before, are a happy lot because following last years huge losses, this year they are getting very good price for their produce.This (Rs 7,200 per quintal price of onion) is the highest rate of this season and is also the highest in the last 10 years, said K Seshagiri, a farmer of Chinnatekuru village in Kallur mandal. Good days are back and this we owe to the good prices of our produce. We had faced huge losses last year, he said. It is surprising to note that previous year onions were sold at a low price.The reason behind the farmers getting high price is damages caused to onion crop in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and other States due to the floods there. With non availability of onions in the above mentioned States, traders have been exporting the crop from the Kurnool market.As many as 80 per cent of the daily arrivals at the Kurnool (agriculture market yard) are exported to other areas, said R Vijaya Lakshmi, Secretary of the market yard. Suppose we have received 4,000 quintals of onions on a given day; from this nearly 3,200 quintals are exported to other States, she said and added, Kurnool onions were sent to Nepal recently.Presently, the price range of onion is between Rs 6,500 and Rs 7,200 per quintal and average rate is more than Rs 7,000 per quintal. This hike may continue till January, she said.However, in reality, this year onion had been sown in less area than sown during the previous year. While onion was sown in 32,000 hectares this year, during last year the crop was sown in only 25,000 hectares, she said."

Your overall health depends on a variety of factors  most of it having to do with nutrition. It is, therefore, imperative to do everything in your power to stay healthy this season.A perennial vegetable, onion is a real charmer. It goes with all kinds of foods. So, it does not matter how you eat it, as long as you continue to acknowledge its nutritional value. Heres how it can help you.WarmthIt is believed that the Chinese thought of onions as a powerhouse of energy. Its juice has been used in ancient Chinese healing practices as well. When consumed, onions provide heat inside the body, giving you a feeling of warmth. So, have a lot of it, and dont worry about the pungent breath.Fighting seasonal infectionsOnions are considered to be packed with anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties. Naturally, they are great for winters, as they fight common cold, cough, earaches, fever and some skin problems.Dental healthWe tend to eat desserts after our meal. But, what can we eat after desserts to keep our teeth healthy? Onions. Winters are all about merriment and craving and caving in  resulting in tooth pain and decay. All of this can be taken care of by maintaining oral hygiene and eating onions. By chewing raw onions, we balance the taste inside the mouth and reduce the risk of oral diseases, including gum infections.Reduced risk of breast cancerRaw onion consumption is believed to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women. According to a study carried out between 2008 and 2014, on more than 600 women in Puerto Rico, those who ate more than one serving of onion and garlic sofrito  a sauce popular in Latin American regions  a day, were at a 67 per cent lesser risk of developing breast cancer.Digestive health and weight lossOnions are a great source of fiber and pre-biotics (non-digestible types of fiber broken down by good gut bacteria), which are essential for gut health. Experts say that a diet which is rich in pre-biotics, may also help the body improve the absorption of calcium, which is great for bones.Also, onions are low in calories, so if you feel too lazy to work out in the cold weather, you can simply stay home and eat some.

At these stalls, each person is liable to get only one kg of the vegetable per day at the subsidised cost of Rs 25. However, the timings for the sales have been limited to just four hours a day, from 8 am to 10 am and again from 4 pm to 6 pm.In view of the steep rise in onion prices and non-availability of the produce, the Chief Minister had asked the authorities concerned to set up stalls in the farmers markets across the State. Krishna district officials have procured around 100 quintals of Kurnool onions. Patamata Rythu Bazar estate officer V Koteswara Rao said, The cost of onions on Friday at the Patamata rythu bazar is Rs 40. We have procured 30 bags, each weighing 45 kg, from Kurnool district. Today (on Friday), as many as 15 bags were sold.The remaining bags will be put on sale tomorrow. ""According to the instructions, we are selling onions at subsidised price at just one counter from 8am to 10 am and again at 4 pm to 6 pm,"" B Anjaiah, a resident of Vijayawada, said.Though the onions at rythu bazars have half the price than those available at retail markets, their stock is very limited and we are unable to get even a small quantity of vegetable. It is a good thing that the officials are providing onions at a subsidised price. We take autos and come from very far to the rythu bazar. So, the scheme of only one kg per person does not make much of a difference. They should increase the limit to at least two kg per person, he added.Meanwhile, the vigilance teams have been instructed to locate stock holding points and black markets and further take action against those found guilty.At present, the Maharashtra variety is unavailable in the market and retailers are selling onions at Rs 75-85 per kg. Vijayawada alone has a daily requirement of 170 quintals. Usually, Krishna district receives 250-300 quintals a day."

Our first suggestion if youre indulging in this is skipping breakfast to ensure you do justice to the spread, which also includes beverages such as fresh fruit juices, cocktails, mocktails and premium-quality wines and whisky.Picking a sunny afternoon, I started off with cut fruits and boiled eggs, along with some sprouts, trying to keep things healthy before digging into the multi-cuisine spread organised by Lush and R Bar, the two restaurants of the hotel. But our promise to stick to healthy food soon went off track when we encountered the live chaat counters, set on the lush green lawns. I picked up a sizeable portion of roasted chicken from the live counter and added a dollop of butter. Moving to Thai delicacies, I chose the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Tom Yum Soup, fusion-style Wok-tossed veggies, sushi, noodles and fish in Black Bean sauce.From the Indian cuisine, I couldnt stop myself from tasting steamed rice with Mangalorean fish curry  smoothly flavoured with tamarind, curry leaves and coconut  and chicken curry which was cooked in traditional south-Indian style. Surprisingly, the fish piece was large, quite in contrast to my previous experiences. And of course, this was a delight to the Bengali fish-lover in me. To add more spice to my plate, I filled it with Biryani rice and gravy dishes.While I was ready to try desserts  pastries, ice creams, waffles and pancakes of various flavours  many around me munched on grilled chicken (dont miss pairing it with onions), mutton, fish and paneer finger-foods, and sip on alcohol.Cost for two: `2,000 (approx)"

The restaurant does not have the look and feel of a typical Andhra joint but the dcor elements, however, are typical to three broad regions of the Telugu-speaking regions coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Rayalaseema.My dining companion and I started off the dinner with an innovative dish, where they have experimented with rasam, which the region is famous for. Verushanga Tamata Chaaru, a semi-thick soup made with peanuts, tomatoes and onions, churned our appetite with the tanginess and a rich flavour of mixed spices.The restaurant is a fiery heaven for non-vegetarians who love the heat of chilli and the kick of spices in meat. We tried Telangana Lollipop deep fried chicken drumsticks tossed with green chilies, curry leaves and dusted with pounded spice and Udayagiri Mamsam Vepudu  lamb flavoured with curry leaf-infused gravy. On the first bite, the first wave of heat will hit you, followed by an amalgamation of spices absorbed by the meat.Go for the Goddu Karam Chanduva Fry, which is a whole pomfret marinated in green chilli paste, deep fried and sprinkled with homemade chilli garlic powder. However, this is not for the faint-hearted as it can leave Habanero and Sriracha in the dust trail on the Scoville charts. For vegetarians, the appetizer section is a little limited but Chamadumpa JeedipapPuvepudu, a colocasia and cashew fry, stood out. We longed for a glass of beer as the flavours and the crispy colocasia would go well with it.Andhra meals are synonymous with pappu and Samaikya clearly knows how to get theirs right with Gongura Pappu. The perfectly cooked lentils and gongura greens (roselle) on a hot bed of rice, with a dollop of desi ghee on top, made our day. If you want to do some experimentation with vegetarian food, then Pachikaram Junni Paalu, Creamy Paneer Bhurji cooked with full fat milk, is a good recommendation.For the non-veg main course, we tried a few of their specialties, the first one being Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, an authentic Vijayawada-style biryani prepared with slow-cooked horse gram gravy. It has a distinct and pungent taste, which is very different from dum biryani. It might need an acquired taste to gorge on but you can definitely give it a try for its uniqueness. The star dish in the entire course was the Bommidayulu Pulusu, a traditional Andhra eel fish curry. It was savoury with classical Andhra spices. The heat was tempered down and well-refined.Rounding up the whole experience was the Double Ka Meetha, a classic Hyderabadi sweet made of fried bread slices soaked in hot milk with spices, saffron and cardamom. We also tried Qubani Ka Meetha prepared with apricot pulp. While the desserts were from the region, they were nothing out of the ordinary.Samaikya procures specialty ingredients such as Gongura, Bommidayulu (eel fish) and Guntur chilli from their region of origin, making these dishes authentic. The head chef is from the region and recreates his grandmothers recipes, which adds to the authenticity.The food festival will be held till December 1 at Samaikya in HSR Layout.

The retail price of onions in the city shot up to Rs 100 per kilo on Friday. Traders blamed the dull business on the high price at Koyambedu, as bulk consumers stayed away from onions.Abdul Khader, secretary of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, said the price is expected to go up as the supply has slumped.Dont be surprised if the wholesale price shoots to Rs 100 due to non-availability of the crop, he says.On Friday, retail prices varied between Rs 80 and Rs 100 in various parts of Chennai. Bhaskar, an onion trader at Koyambedu market, says the wholesale price of a 50 kg sack of Bangalore onions is Rs 4,000.Of this, 4-5 kg would be rotten, which adds to the cost. As a result, I sell 1 kg for retail price of Rs 90. Outside Koyambedu, the retail price has crossed Rs 100. Bhaskar says that the price is likely to go up further due to a shortfall in stocks from Bengaluru. Onions from Andhra Pradesh, which do not have a long shelf life, are now selling at Rs 70 a kilo, compared to the usual price of Rs 50.The non-availability of supply from Nashik and Bengaluru have pushed up demand, as well as prices, for onions from AP. This comes even as the Centre is planning to import onions.We heard about it, but the quality of imported onions is below par compared to Indian varieties, says Bhaskar. S Chandran, president of Market Management Committee Licensed Merchants Association.If the onions are made available, we will sell it as per the rates fixed by the government, he said.He also defended retailers selling onions at Rs 100, stating that most of the produce they procure is damaged.You have to wait till mid-January when the fresh crops arrive. Till then, the wholesale price will hover around Rs 60 to Rs 80, says Chandran."

While growing up, cooking was a necessity for him and his four siblings because his parents used to be away at work. Recipes were learnt from observation.

Even basics help, says Padmanabhan who made pongal and bajji for the day's breakfast.K Anand Bhattar, priestHis level of dedication extends beyond cooking to the cleaning process. No item goes waste. I like arranging things in a certain way. The environment while cooking has to be serene and organised. We grew up in a generation that never relied on outside food. Everything would be made from scratch at home. Ive passed on the cooking skills to my children to take care of their basic needs. My spicy chutneys are peoples favourite. I also like trying out different kinds of kuzhambu and traditional items, he says.

Its a delight to watch him slice merakai (Chow Chow) effortlessly, and saut it in a pan with urad dal. A simple vegetable curry for the day is ready. He picked up the art from his father and grandfather who were excellent cooks.My grandfather was a caterer. Id accompany him for marriages and help in laying banana leaves. In one such instance, at the age of 15, I had to make kaju cakes since the head cook fell sick at the last minute. It turned out to be tasty and people loved it. Since then, Ive been equipped to cook in bulk for even 1,000 people, says Anand, who loves to read about ancient cooking practices and regional cooking. He takes turns with his wife for cooking depending on his work timings. Both his kids are also trained to cook.Anands job demands him to travel across the world for different kinds of rituals. Once in Rajasthan, we were gearing up for the days puja. The cook, who had to come, met with an accident and I had to take over. I had to cook in the freezing temperatures without even tasting the food. One needs to identify everything with smell. Its a different kind of experience that not many will get, points out the priest.Anand believes in educating his children on the consumption of organic and healthy vegetables. They never order or buy from outside.

In a time when both men and women are on par in everything, why attach pride to the aspect of cooking alone? Why does it become special when a man cooks for his wife while the latter does it every day?, asks Jagannath R who has too many questions about the kitchen conundrum.Jagannath grew up in Kolkata in a household where everybody cooked. It was a family affair. He forayed into cooking at the age of six under his parents supervision. It helped him during his scouts and guides camps when they were asked to make a basic meal for survival without the luxury of having appliances or ingredients.I spent most of the time in boarding school, college, and now I have a travelling job. During college days in Chennai, my sister and I would cook to unwind from everyday stress. I do the same now. After long hours at work, we find it to be therapeutic, he says.A good set of knives, minimal cooking appliances, and western music in the background  this is the ideal mood for Jagannath to get him cooking. He loves having friends over for parties frequently and likes to prepare multi- cuisine delicacies. Warm appreciation and motivation from friends make him want to cook more food. Im proud that I can cook anything and dont have to be dependent on anyone. My friends envy me for that, he shares.Spaghetti with tomato sauceIngredientsStore-bought spaghetti: 200 gram, Garlic: 10 cloves (finely chopped), Onion: 2 medium size (finely chopped), Tomatoes: 2 medium size, Olive oil, Salt to taste, Oregano to taste, Chilli flakes to taste, Thyme to taste, Fresh/dried basil to taste, Parmesan cheese: 30 gMethodl In a deep vessel, add water and bring it to a boil l Add salt to the water.

From helping his mother out in the kitchen to learning the nuances and tricks of cooking from his aunts, hes come a long way to preparing a meal for an entire household.My father was a flawless cook. Even if its a basic flat beans curry, hed do it with perfection. I admired and liked his cooking better. Hed make roti for me and my grandfather on the terrace under the moon, just the traditional way. He died when I was young and I decided to carry forward his memories through cooking, reminisces Muhilann.The budding architect grew up in a big household. To help his aunt, hed wake up early morning and get started with the days cooking. During his childhood hed leave for school only after washing and drying the used vessels. I appreciate criticism. But if they touch my nerve by finding faults often then Id deliberately prepare it in a way they dont like. Im mischievous in the kitchen, says Muhilann.During his college days in Ooty, Muhilann used to cook and have his friends over whenever they felt homesick. There was always food in his room. My mother used to visit me with traditional sweets and candies. Everybody in college loved it so much that I opened a stall and made money out of it. I also used cooking as an incentive to study better. Whenever I scored low marks, Id make a demand for a kitchen appliance and when my mother promised to buy it for me then I would clear the paper with good scores. Its a lifelong skill that I carry everywhere to make people happy, he says.Vennai puttuIngredientsRice: 1 cup, Bengal gram dal: 50 gram,Jaggery: 2 cup, Coconut:  shell, Cardamom: 5 nosMethodl Soak rice for two hours, finely grind it to a batter consistency l Boil four glasses of water and add Bengal gram dal l Once Bengal gram dal is half cooked, then add rice batter to itl Stir it well until the rice batter is cooked.

Families, vendors and restaurant owners struggle to keep this staple ingredient out of their daily menu, despite the pinchSelvaraj M, GomathiChettinadu Hotel, TeynampetAlong with a hike in petrol prices, basic food products have also become expensive. Onions now cost Rs 85-Rs 100 per kg. Earlier, we used to buy 60 kg of onion per day but we have had to reduce it to 45 kg on average, and sometimes it reduces to 25 kg too. Customers expect the quality to be consistent, but its us hoteliers who suffer. We cannot compromise on quantity, but we are striving to maintain quality. We are uncertain of what will happen in the future.CR Balaji, officer at a petrochemical industryThe first and obvious reason for the price hike is poor rains in our state. Not just onions, the price of every vegetable has shot up. As common people, were left with no choice but to cut down our consumption by half. We cannot afford to miss out on our daily intake. My wife and I also make it a point to buy from local vendors in our area because we find fresh and affordable goods. Small-scale vendors are also having a hard time with the increase in prices. However, they do manage to get vegetables at a marginalised price from Koyambedu.Nazir J, Lip and Lick Snacks, TeynampetWe buy about five to seven kilos of onions daily and havent cut down on the quantity after the price hike. We dont expect the prices to drop soon. As of now, our profits remain the same. Maybe when that reduces, we might have to cut down on our onion consumption.Diwan, retailer atNungambakkamEarlier, I could sell 60 kg in one day, and now, I sell the same amount in two days. People have reduced their onion intake. I have to sell onions at a high price to ensure I recover what I bought them for. Sometimes I have to sell for Rs 80 a kg.BG Shivakumar,owner of Tamu TamuOnion and lettuce prices at the moment are higher than usual. As a restaurant, we havent cut down on purchases nor have we changed our menu prices. We consider the movement in prices to be fairly normal pressures on margins that we face from time to time and have to budget in our expenses.Manikandan, wholesalerin Tambaram SanatoriumWe sell onions at Rs 70 a kg because if we increase the price nobody will buy it. Despite the loss, we cannot run a vegetable shop without onions and so we sell it. Our stock comes from Bengaluru and is usually expensive. Good onions usually come from eastern India. Okra, onion and tomato are the fastest-selling vegetables in my shop and I rely on those for most of my income.PS Maheswaran,retired engineerThe prices of vegetables are fluctuating every day. I prefer shopping at supermarkets, either at malls or standalone stores because they give offers. When onions were Rs 75 a kg they sold it at Rs 15 a kg. I make use of those offers and stock up on vegetables. These are basic vegetables and we need to buy them irrespective of prices. The quality might not be the same everywhere, but we cannot survive without them either.K Vani,homemakerWe are from Coimbatore and generally onion is an important ingredient in our every meal. This increase in price has forced us to either use lesser quantity, or avoid dishes exclusively made of onions like onion chutney. I was saddened when I read that government has planned to import onion. We are capable of cultivating onions and the government can take initiatives to encourage farmers. Some positive steps need to be taken to bring down the onion price.Shruti Bhaskaran, graphic designerIn the past, every time the onion price went up, we used to stop purchasing them and cook dishes without it. As onions are a must in every dish, even though the price is high, now we just buy some for daily use. Sometimes, we also try to buy them in bulk and use it.Preethi, a residentof West MambalamWe have had to reduce our consumption. Earlier, I would buy two kilos for the week, now I buy just one kilo. As onion has to be used for all kinds of gravy, I have started grinding it in the mixer so that I can use less quantity while making enough food."

Solomon, a tenant farmer growing onions, has finally started making profits this year after incurring losses for four years in a row.While consumers are ruing the upward spiral in onion prices, farmers in Kurnool district are happy that they are earning decent returns in the last one month.Mr. Solomon, who cultivates onion on a land of two acres, about 12 kilometres from Kurnool city, says that he can repay a big part of the loans that he had taken in the past four years with the profit he made this year.It takes about 60,000 to cultivate one acre of land per year. I took a loan of 4.80 lakh over four years to cultivate two acres of crops, Mr. Solomon said.This year has been good and I have made a profit of 3 lakh. However, most of the profits would go towards clearing the loans, Mr. Solomon said.Speaking to The Hindu, Kurnool market yard secretary Jaya Lakshmi said that the highest price yielded for a quintal of onions was 7,000 on Friday. On average, we have auctioned onions at 6,000 per quintal, she said.Explaining the sharp inflation in onion prices, Ms. Jaya Lakshmi said that onion crops failed in the rest of the States due to excessive rains this year.As a result, onions from Kurnool are being exported to Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, she said.Another reason behind the price rise was lesser yield. Two months ago, we were getting about 70 bags of onions per acre (each bag has about 50 kg of onions). Now, we are only getting about 17-20 bags of onions, he said.Mr. Solomon also blamed the crisis on restrictions imposed by the Centre on onion exports. Apart from the lack of exports, the rains also hit us hard, he said.While there was an abundance of onions, a large number of crops were also damaged in rains in Kurnool. For every 70 bags produced, we lost about 30 bags worth of onions, Mr. Solomon said.High input costsOther farmers said that while the prices are high, input costs have also significantly gone up. It now costs us 10,000 just for the labour per harvest. Apart from that, the prices of fertilizers and pesticide are also soaring, leaving us with little profits, said B. Aiahanna.He insisted that the government bring down input costs so that the farmer gets to see a profit. This is the only work we know. Even when there are profits, we are still not seeing them, Mr. Aiahanna said."

After India banned the export of onion in September, it created a ripple effect that quickly spread. Prices of the kitchen staple shot through the roof  at one point in November, it spiked five-fold  giving nightmares to housewives. People cut down on consumption, while the government cracked down on racketeers and made desperate efforts to import onion by air.A Dhaka housewife, Sufia Chowdhury, 46, even ended up fighting with her husband. With the prices on a steady climb, Ms. Chowdhury found her husband less and less willing to spend money on onion. But it was difficult for her to cook without this humble bulb. Ive never seen something like this and onion has never been such a pricey item before, Ms. Chowdhury said.On September 29, India banned all onion exports after local prices jumped to 4,500 per quintal, the highest in nearly six years, due to the delay in the arrival of the summer-sown crop triggered by a prolonged monsoon.Since the ban, many countries have turned to Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey and China to increase supplies in a bid to bring prices down. But the hefty volumes lost will be hard to replace as India exports more than two million tonnes of onion a year.As the government grappled with rocketing prices, it turned to neighbouring countries.One costly but probably unavoidable option was the airlifting of onions from Turkey and Pakistan as public discontent was simmering. The first consignment arrived in Dhaka on the evening of November 20 from Karachi.When the cargo plane with 82 tonnes of onions touched down at Dhaka airport, it brought cheers to hard-pressed consumers.Airborne imports may bring quick relief to the crisis, but the market will remain turbulent in the days to come, analysts said.Ban to stayIndia may retain the ban on exports until February as domestic prices have risen after the harvest of summer-sown crops, which were expected to augment supplies, was delayed and damaged by untimely rain, Reuters reported citing a government official.The ban on overseas sales by India, the worlds biggest exporter of onion, will keep prices high in Asia and it will require countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka to find other sources to fulfil their demand.As prices zoomed up to 250 taka (211) a kg about two weeks ago, the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), a government agency that maintains a buffer stock of essential commodities to stabilise local markets, dispatched trucks across the country to sell onion at 45 taka. People from low-income backgrounds waited for hours in queues, long before the trucks arrived.Hundreds of thousands of people scrambled for low-cost purchases. Images of men and women scuffling through the crowds just to get close to the onion vehicles emerged in Dhaka.Bangladesh then homed in on traders, blaming them for creating an artificial crisis. The government punished 2,500 rogue traders for price rigging, Commerce Secretary Jafar Uddin said at a media briefing in Dhaka on November 18.The official read out a written statement to the media, highlighting a list of government steps in three minutes, and left the press conference without taking questions. The onion market will return to normal very soon, he said in the statement with a degree of assurance.Despite the prices going beyond her reach, Ms. Chowdhury refused to join the desperate group for TCB-supplied onion and stayed home pondering over how to get through the crisis.But there was only one option open to her: consume less onions. Over the past month, her family of three consumed 10 kg of onion, half of the usual quantity.While Ms. Chowdhury, who uses onion as the main cooking ingredient, had to compromise on the taste, many others shunned it altogether.Ms. Chowdhurys neighbour, Kazi Ferdosi, 44, said: Onion is not an essential food item for everyday consumption. Worrying over something not so important isnt worth it.Ms. Ferdosi has decided to abandon onion for now, but it is deemed essential to many  a fact of life in Bangladesh that forces the government to import the item by air. More cargo planes will fly in with onion to give Bangladeshis some respite from the squeeze.(Arun Devnath is a journalist based in Dhaka.)"

A few dozen young men and women wait and watch as batches of dosas take shape. Not the round dosas we are used to but oval ones, topped with oodles of shredded cheese, butter, paneer and tomato. Between the dosa and the topping is sandwiched a layer of runny upma. The process of creating this fusion dosa at Ram Ki Bandi is dramatic  the cheese bubbles and turns red as it is sprinkled generously with chilli garlic powder or chat masala. For the young people wearing the lanyards of IT companies and grumbling about bosses, this dosa, sliced into two and topped with a dollop of peanut chutney, is what they eat before they call it a day.Hyderabad, known for its biryani, haleem, kebabs, sheer korma, sheermal and shorba, has suddenly seen an explosion in its range of food, making it quite a gourmands destination. Little wonder then that the city now has been included in the Creative Cities Network by Unesco in the gastronomy category. And all that eating is helping the economy too: a study by an auditing firm discovered that about 12% of Hyderabads working population is directly or indirectly employed in the food sector.Dosa with toppings | Photo Credit: Getty ImagesThe average Hyderabadi is quite the foodie: the city consumes some 700 tonnes of chicken and 291 tonnes of meat every day, according to a dossier prepared by city officials. On festivals, chicken consumption goes up to 2,000 tonnes, says Musharraf Ali Faruqui, zonal commissioner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, who was part of the team that drafted the case for Hyderabads inclusion in the Unescos Creative Cities Network. The team mapped eateries ranging from pushcarts under expressways to tea shops that pop up for a few hours a day to omelette kiosks near bus and train stations. We found roughly 1.5 lakh establishments, plus countless tea stalls. Some of them stick around for just a few hours before moving on, he says. The team also discovered that 10,000 women in self-help groups are employed in the food sector in Hyderabad.On the menuDiners are spoilt for choice. From experimental dishes that come from small new-age eateries to the established players dishing out success formulas, the range is huge.Arrayed on both sides of the Musi River, the choices for breakfast at The Grand, Nayaab, Shadab, Shah Ghouse and more are staggering. The meat dishes include bhaji gurda (kidney curry), kaleji (liver curry), jabaan (tongue), paya (broth with trotters), and keema (mince), while vegetarians make do with bagara (seasoned rice), kuska (plain biryani), and khichdi. Shorba is a rich broth with a floating layer of lard, seasoned with coriander and served with sheermal, naan or roti. At Nayaab, it is newspaper executives and early morning visitors to Charminar who stop by for tea and breakfast.By 8 a.m., the traffic picks up and business at Ram Ki Bandi winds down. We close by 9 a.m., says Ram, a first-generation food entrepreneur. A few hundred metres away, groups of students, daily wage workers and office goers throng the road near Hanuman Tekdi. People were getting bored of the routine idli-dosa-upma, so I created cut dosa  I made the dosa crisper, added a topping of upma, and cut it into two. Others got the idea from us, says B. Komariah, the owner of the eatery. Starting with a roadside stall in 1982, he now employs 45 people. I was 24 and jobless when a Tamil rickshaw puller named Kumar suggested I start a tiffin centre. We borrowed 1,200 and ferried the grinding machine here in his rickshaw. He taught us about the batter and other cooking secrets, says Komariah, as people jostle to buy the tokens for a plate.Piping hot mirch bajji | Photo Credit: Nagara GopalBetween 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., the streets near schools and colleges, banks and small businesses become hubs for fast food. My favourite breakfast is keema roti. But now most restaurants in the old city serve puri-bhaji. It is cheaper and also filling; people can no longer afford meat for breakfast, says Hyder Razvi, who lives near the Darul Shifa, the oldest part of Hyderabad. A traditional snack like lukmi, which earlier had a filling of mince mutton, is now stuffed with either mashed potato or beef.Of kulfi paansSunil opened Shree Lakshmi Tiffins in Boggalkunta near Abids in central Hyderabad four months ago. The shop shares space with one of the citys fanciest pan shops, which has evolved into a juice parlour and a chaat and pani puri hangout. Mayur Pan House opened in 1998 and boasts on its menu kulfi paan, Meenakshi laddoo paan, and chocolate paan, among other choices. By evening, the area in front of the shop is transformed into a street cafe where families drop by to dig into Jain pav bhaji, samosa ragda, avocado juice, garlic bread, or that eternal street food favourite, pani puri.By afternoon, biryani preparations for dinner have begun. At the Shah Ghouse Cafe in west Hyderabad, biryani looks like a work of art in the making. Hyderabadi biryani is kacche gosht ki biryani, where raw meat is cooked with rice creating many layers of flavours, says Muhammad Rabbani, the owner of Shah Ghouse. On large kadais, chef Chand Bhai uses his eyes and hands as measuring tools, throwing in sea salt, chilli powder, spices, and curd on the meat, then leaving it to marinate. He then layers the marinated meat with half-cooked rice before setting it to cook on dum. Three layers of long-grained rice cooked for different lengths of time appear to be the secret for the perfectly cooked biryani. One kadai of biryani can feed 40 people.Vermicelli being prepared | Photo Credit: G RAMAKRISHNAFood should always be eaten in the place where it is cooked. You can order food online but it arrives cold. A takeaway doesnt give you the atmosphere of a restaurant, says Rabbani. He goes to sleep at 4 a.m., when everyone else wakes up to food.But it is not just elaborate food that is Hyderabads culinary calling card today. A small family-run confectionery near Salar Jung Museum makes a little sweetmeat called badam ki jaali (almond coin). Shaped like a Nizam-era coin, the mellow sweet is an heirloom delicacy.Nouvelle cuisineAt the other end of the spectrum are the new-age patisseries with owner-chefs trained in Paris or London. Hossein Barazandeh studied baking in Paris and opened a desserts place in Banjara Hills called Feranoz. Beginning with a small bakery, Sahil Taneja went on to Concu, a high-end patisserie, also in Banjara Hills. He imports the choicest strawberries and the best gold leaf for dessert toppings. Recently, he opened another restaurant in Jubilee Hills called Farine. His neighbours are Churrolto (Spanish cafe), Guilt Trip (dessert house), Maguro (Pan-Asian diner) and a drive-in restaurant called Cuba. Gourmet city? For sure.The gastronomy reaches a crescendo during Ramzan. A 1 km radius around Charminar transforms into a food street where the action begins at 5 p.m. and goes on till dawn. It is a night bazaar where mutton shikhampur, a pan-fried minced kebab stuffed with raw onions and coriander, competes with patthar ka gosht, chunks of delicately flavoured meat grilled over heated stone. The dish of choice is, of course, the sublime Hyderabad haleem  a thick, dark spicy stew of meat, lentils, crushed wheat, vegetables and ghee. Lots of ghee. The dish, understandably, has a GI tag.Except Punjab and Kashmir, you will find workers from all States working here. Their number goes up during Ramzan when we employ 800 men, says Ameer, who manages a popular city restaurant. One of the bigger haleem makers, Pista House, has even created a network to door-deliver haleem every day at Iftar across multiple cities.Importantly, the Unesco Creative Cities Networks gourmet tag is as much about food as it is about pulling people out of poverty and meeting the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. As the food business booms, it has created lakhs of jobs in Hyderabad  for bouncers, bakers, baristas, chefs, delivery executives, cooks, scullions, maitres dhotel, and even rat catchers. At a cloud kitchen in Nanakramguda, one of the specialised jobs is that of a rat catcher. He sets traps each evening and disposes of the rodents each morning.It takes many hands to place Hyderabad so firmly at the high table of world cuisine."

Read MoreHYDERABAD: Onion prices in the city have seen a steady increase since October, with prices in certain parts of the city touching Rs 100 per kg on Monday.The increased rates have made people think twice about including the staple vegetable in their cooking.In the first week of October, prices of onions hovered around Rs 60 per kg, but this soon escalated to Rs 80 per kg, hitting a new high now.I use onions in almost every dish I make, but I am having to cut down due to this surge in prices. I started searching for recipes that do not require as much use of the ingredient. The onion crisis seems to be haunting us every year and has become a pattern, said Shailaja Alluri, a resident of Domalguda area.Expressing her frustration Revathi Rao, a resident of Banjara Hills, said, I shop online for my groceries. On Monday, when I decided to buy a few kilograms, I realised that the rate had touched Rs 99. I will wait for the prices to fall before making a bulk purchase, she said.However, her hopes for a slide in prices may have to wait a while. Officials said multiple factors had resulted in the rates shooting up, including poor yield this year.Venkatesam, selection grade secretary, at the agriculture marketing department told TOI, Besides a poor yield this year, storage was also an issue because rain wet the onions. This resulted in huge losses.He however said that the cost of second grade onion remained lower at Rs 60 per kg. We get larger and better quality onions from Maharashtra which cost upward of Rs 90, per kg he said.He also added that crops from Kurnool and Karnataka had been procured to stabilise prices of onions in the city."

But before she gets the one kg of bulb vegetable, the stock got over leaving her disappointed.One kg of onion per family is too little to pull on for a week, complained another fuming home-maker Prema working in a textile shop in the Bapuji Market complex here while waiting for her turn in the queue by producing the Aadhaar card as the price of the vegetable skyrocketed in the open market.The waiting is not worth it to buy at 25 per kg, said another woman, Kamala, skipping purchase of the essential commodity, the price of which touched 90 per kg mark in the open market.People need not come at one go to the Rythu Bazaars as 300 tonnes of the vegetable was allotted for supply at subsidised price, said Kothapatanam Rythu Bazaar Supervisor S. Amar while overseeing its sale.Each day, about 10 tonnes of subsidised onion arrives in the three Rythu Bazaars in the city and one farmers market in Kandukur and get exhausted in no time. Excessive rainfall in the Kurnool region and Maharashtra had damaged the vegetable crop causing acute shortage.Rationing of onion supply will continue till such a time the availability improves, probably in the third week of January or so, explained Agriculture Marketing Assistant Director K.V.N. Upendra Kumar in a conversation with The Hindu.Farmers happyMeanwhile, onion growers in and around Yerragondapalem made a killing as people came from far and near to purchase it as cooking is incomplete without its use for most of them. Whatever available stocks in Yerrongondapelm is grabbed by persons in the price range of 55 to 65 per kg. 'We do not have to take the trouble of moving onion to market now, a group of happy farmers said.Onion is grown in 274 hectares in Prakasam district as against the normal extent of 345 hectares during the khariff season and its cultivation has been taken up only in 19 hectares during the ongoing rabi season so far, sources in the Agriculture Department said.The present situation does not warrant giving an additional one kg or so to each family as the arrival of onions to the Kurnool market was just 300 tonnes per day as against the normal 1,300 to 1,400 tonnes per day, the sources added.Traders warnedMeanwhile, AMD officials warned of stringent action if wholesale traders were holding more than 50 tonnes of onion and if retail traders had onion stocks of more than 10 tonnes.Public having information on any hoarding could get in touch either with AMD or Vigilance officials here. Their identity would be kept confidential, Mr. Upendra Kumar said."

This consignment is being offered to State governments at 52-55 per kg in Mumbai and 60 per kg in Delhi, according to an official statement from the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs on Monday.Domestic pricesLast week, the Union Cabinet gave its approval to the import of 1.2 lakh tonnes by the Central trade agency MMTC, to tame the soaring domestic prices. The late arrival of the monsoon as well as excess rainfall and flooding during the harvesting season in the major producing States such as Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are likely to result in a 26% drop in the production during this season.The supply shortages have put pressure on prices, with retail rates breaching the 100 per kg mark in Delhi earlier this month. While the price has now dipped to 75 per kg, it is as high as 120 per kg in Mumbai and other metros, the National Horticulture Board data shows.Delhi has not yet put in an order, but the Central agency NAFED plans to retail them through its own outlets, along with the outlets of Mother Dairy, Kendriya Bhandar and NCCF.Total demandSo far, the States which have communicated their wish to distribute the onions include Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Kerala and Sikkim. Along with the NAFED demand for Delhi, the total demand so far is 2,265 metric tonnes, said the statement. Other States have also been asked to indicate their demand.The price that the Centre is offering to sell them to the States is higher than the wholesale domestic price of onions.

As per the strength of the school, a cylinder can last only two weeks. We cannot afford another cylinder with the funds allotted by the department. So, we use firewood to cook a meal.Essentials items like rice, lentils, cooking oil, and spices are provided to the mid-day centres directly by the district administration. The centres are separately given funds to purchase gas cylinders and vegetables once in three months. Most of the mid-day meal organisers raise concern as to how a few thousand rupees can be sufficient to purchase gas cylinders and vegetables for three months.Speaking to Express, a mid-day meal organiser says the administration provides Rs 5,000 for three months. Currently onions are sold anywhere between Rs 70 and Rs 100 per kg. Also, it is important that vegetables are given to children, which can cost minimum Rs 150 a day. If we get Rs 5000 for three months, it is still a challenge to provide nutritious food to children, he said.He also says, When the organisers seek more funds, they are told to shell out from their pockets. So far, I have spent Rs 11,550 for buying vegetables and gas cylinders. But, many organisers refuse to shell out money from their own pockets.A district official says, Recently, the State asked for a report on schools and (their) students strength. There might be a possibility to increase funds. Also, not many cooks and workers know how to use gas cylinders.Poor infrastructureMost mid-day meal centres in the district lack proper infrastructure, including water facilities. A cook at a Virudhachalam school says, Due to incessant rains, the roof has weakened and looks like it will collapse any minute. I am scared to sit inside vIn the district, there are as many as 1,565 mid-day meal centres catering for 1.65 lakh children from classes one to ten. and work. We have informed the officials to carry out maintenance work at the earliest.Former district secretary of State Non-Meal Employees Association S Rangaswamy says, The government insists workers not to use firewood. But, it hardly provides facilities or funds. There is no ventilation or proper light at most mid-day centres in the district. The cooks have to be careful that nothing falls into the food and should also be cautious while serving it to children."

If the retail traders keep a margin of Rs 5 a kg, the average price would be Rs 70-75.There is absolutely no logic to charge Rs 100 in Bhubaneswar market, said general secretary of the Kuberpuri Merchant Association Shakti Shankar Mishra.It is the responsibility of the Government to regulate prices of essential commodities. If the Government can sell onion at Rs 60-70 a kg through fair price shops in most of the districts, there is no reason why retail traders will sell it at more than Rs 80 a kg, he claimed.The government is selling onion through 227 fair price shops at district headquarters at no profit no loss basis. The highest price of onion in Maitree (fair price) shops at Rayagada was Rs 77 per kg while the lowest was Rs 50 at Malkangiri.While local traders fear a further spike in view of the rising prices of onion at source markets in Maharashtra, Mishra said the market will remain volatile till the harvest of the winter crops which generally starts in December.He, however, said the supply of onion to Odisha is quite normal and there is no indication of any shortage of the kitchen staple in the near future.The sell of onion through fair price shops is intended to benefit the economically weaker sectors who are ration cardholders.If the Government will utilise the price stabilisation fund (PSF), general consumers will benefit. But the Rs 100 crore corpus is peanut given the high prices of the commodity in the source markets, Mishra said.As the Centre has decided to import one lakh tonne of onion to curb the rising prices, the State may utilise the PSF to buy onion from the Centre to go for market intervention, official sources said.The onion price in Maharashtra was as high as Rs 62-65 a kg. This is because of extensive damage to the crops due to prolonged monsoon and excess rains in Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune.According to traders, the prices of old stocks will be higher as the new ones have been damaged by the rain and production of old stocks was low last year."

Traders said that floods in main onion producing states like Maharastra and Karnataka had cut off connectivity creating a high demand for the vegetable.Members from traders organisations said that onions prices would remain on the higher end for the next 15 days until fresh crops arrive.Abdul Khader, secretary of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, said the price of onion has breached Rs 120 in the retail market while the wholesale price of a few variety of onions havecrossed Rs 100. ""Eight years ago, we witnessed a surge in prices when a kilo was sold for around Rs 100. But we have never seen the price go up like this,"" Khader said.He added that the price of Nashik (Maharashtra) Onions has touched Rs 100 to Rs 120 while that of Bangalore onions is also hovering around Rs 100. Consumers are now rooting for Rs 80 per kg Andhra Onion which are considered to be low in grade due to its shelf life. But traders warn that the prices of all varieties could also go past Rs 100 depending on the availability of the crop.Bhaskar, an onion trader, said that the price on Monday reached a new high with onions from Nasik, which has a long shelf life, breaching Rs 5000 per sack (50kg).The escalating prices of the crop have put enormous pressure on onion traders as suppliers are seeking immediate credit from the traders. ""Usually a small time wholesale dealer would be buying 20 to30 sacks of onions, which was earlier selling at Rs 3,000 per sack a couple of month ago. Later he sells it to retailers in bulk. However, with the surge in prices, the cost of procuring onions also have shotup,"" said Bhaskar.""Now for buying 30 sacks of onions, I have to shell out Rs 1.5 lakh. This puts us in a difficult position as we run short of cash. Even the suppliers are now asking us to pay 50 per cent of the credit immediately.This all depends on the payment from the retailers, who at times dont pay up immediately,"" says Bhaskar.S Chandran, Market management Committee Licensed Merchants Association President said that the Koyambedu market is receiving only 75 per cent of onion supplies. Many hotels are dependent on these low grade onions. And prices have gone up as many hotels are stocking up onions in panic, says Chandran.Meanwhile, the price of small onions have also breached Rs 100 mark in the wholesale trade. Khader says that in the retail market the small onion is priced at Rs 130 to Rs 170 per kilogram. Soon we have tokeep onions in the Jewel box, Chandran quipped."

""MMTC has placed order for the first consignment of 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt which will be arriving at Nhava Sheva (JNPT), Mumbai.The Onions are being offered to state governments for distribution at the rate of Rs 52-55 per kilogram ex-Mumbai and will also be made available at the rate of Rs 60 per kilogram ex-Delhi,"" an official statement said.States could directly take the imported stock from the location and also have the option of getting transportation facilitated through NAFED, if required.""The supply of imported onions will begin from early December onwards,"" the statement said. Consumer Affairs Secretary Avinash K Srivastava on Monday held video conference with state governments to analyse their demand.He has also written a letter to chief secretaries of all states on November 23 in this regard. While the Delhi government is yet to place any demand for onions, NAFED has informed that it will retail onions through its own outlets and those of Mother Dairy, Kendriya Bhandar and NCCF.""The total demand received so far from various state governments for the 1st week is 2,265 tonnes which includes demand from Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Kerala and Sikkim and also includes the demand of NAFED for supplies in Delhi,"" the statement said.Other states have been requested to indicate their demand at the earliest. On November 19, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said production in kharif and late-kharif seasons of 2019-20 is estimated to fall 26 per cent to 5.2 million tonne, putting pressure on supply and prices.In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Paswan said onion is a seasonal crop with harvesting period of rabi (March to June), kharif (October to December) and late-kharif (January-March).During July to October, the supply in the market comes from stored onions from rabi season.""During 2019-20, there was a 3-4 weeks delay in sowing as well as decline in sown area of the kharif onion because of late arrival of monsoon.Further, untimely prolonged rains in the major growing states of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during the harvesting period caused damage to the standing crops in these regions,"" Paswan had said.As a result, the minister said the production of kharif crop was affected. The rains during the September-October period also hit transportation of crop from these producing regions to consuming centres, he had said.""This led to limited availability of kharif onions in the market and has put pressure on its prices,"" Paswan had said.The minister said the government has banned onion exports and imposed stock limits to boost domestic supply and check prices."
2019-11-25,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cci-urged-to-step-up-cotton-procurement/article30079652.ece,CCI urged to step up cotton procurement in State,"The State government has asked the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to step up procurement of the fibre crop produce and has directed the Marketing Department to scale up arrangements at purchase centres by providing more moisture measuring meters to enable speedy transactions since the arrivals are expected to increase in the coming weeks.In a teleconference conducted on Monday, the Marketing Department officials stated that about 93% of arrivals were of quality cotton with the specified moisture content. Agriculture Production Commissioner C. Parthasarathi said the arrivals at the procurement centres would increase as the price of cotton in the open market was ruling below the minimum support price (MSP) of 5,550 per quintal for long staple varieties which are raised in the State. The cotton market committee secretaries, district marketing officials, CCI branch managers, regional deputy directors and joint directors of marketing participated in the teleconference.Director of Marketing G. Laxmibai said about 7,91,598 quintals of cotton has been procured so far by the CCI through 252 purchase centres set up in the purview of 101 market committees. On payments to farmers in lieu of cotton sales, she said against 405 crore worth purchases, 150 crore was already credited into the bank accounts of the farmers concerned.Mr. Parthasarathi told the field officials to ensure completion of purchase proceedings of the entire quantity of cotton arrivals every day at the procurement centres so that farmers were not made to stay put at the centres with their produce. Further, he asked the purchase centre in-charges to forward the takk pattis (farmer-wise procured cotton quantity details) to the CCI branch managers concerned at the end of days transactions every day so that they could make arrangements for timely credit of money against the cotton sale proceeds into the bank accounts of farmers.Onion priceOn the spiralling onion price, Mr. Parthasarathi said the State government has requested the Centre to send 500 tonnes of onion to Telangana to provide some relief to consumers. He said the wholesale traders of onion have agreed to sell onion at 40 a kg through special counters to be set up at Mehdipatnam and Saroornagar Rythu Bazaars from Wednesday."

It can continue operating during the appeals process.Transport for London cited several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk in its decision not to extend Ubers license, which expires at midnight Monday. Among other things, unauthorized drivers carried out thousands of rides, the regulator said.""While we recognize Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured, said Helen Chapman, director of licensing and regulation at Transport for London, known as TFL.""We cannot be confident that similar issues wont happen again in future.The company fired back, pointing out that TFL had found it fit and proper in its most recent license renewal in September.""We understand were held to a high bar, as we should be. But this TfL decision is just wrong, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted. Over the last 2 years we have fundamentally changed how we operate in London.The denial in a lucrative European market is a big setback for Uber as it struggles to turn a profit. The company posted a $1.16 billion loss in the latest quarter and Mr. Khosrowshahi forecast it wouldnt make a profit until 2021. Shares fell 1.5% in New York.TFL had already been keeping Uber on a tight leash. It had revoked Ubers license once before, in 2017, but a court later granted it a license lasting 15 months, which TFL then extended for two more months in September, but added 20 conditions.Unlicensed driversIn the latest decision, the transit authority said it was concerned Ubers systems seem to have been comparatively easily manipulated by drivers.One key issue was a change to Ubers systems allowing unauthorized drivers to upload their photos to other driver accounts.This let them pick up passengers as though they were the booked Uber driver on at least 14,000 trips, which means all those journeys were uninsured, TFL said.The change also resulted in some passengers traveling with unlicensed drivers, including one whose license was previously revoked by TFL.TFL faulted Uber for another failure that allowed dismissed or suspended drivers to create a new account and carry passengers. And it cited other serious breaches involving unspecified insurance-related issues.Uber said it has audited every London driver over the past two months and will soon launch a new facial matching process for its Microsoft-powered verification system, which requires drivers to periodically take selfies for comparison with their account photos.Drivers will have to more actively confirm their identity by blinking, smiling or turning their head - part of recently announced beefed up safety measures.Investors shouldnt be under the impression the phony photo issue is limited to London, said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, who estimated London represents 3% to 5% of Ubers business.""Regulators around the world are going to scrutinize this issue, peel away the onion and make sure there are no similar issues, he said.In the U.S., safety advocates have criticized Uber for conducting less thorough background checks on drivers than traditional taxi companies, which generally check drivers fingerprints against databases.Uber has been slugging it out with regulators in recent months and losing. California recently passed legislation to make companies treat rideshare drivers as employees instead of independent contractors, which could force Uber to provide health and other costly benefits.New Jerseys labor department recently sought more than $640 million from Uber, saying it misclassified drivers as independent contractors, and New York has enacted a minimum wage for drivers, which Uber passed along to customers in the form of higher prices.""It feels like the regulators have the upper hand, Ives said.Baked into Ubers business plan is the assumption that many mundane parts of running a business, including recruiting and dispatching drivers, can be automated or handled by a driver, said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. That may save money, but it doesnt guarantee safety.By contrast, becoming a black cab driver in London takes about three years.""The temptation with a platform as big as Uber for fraud is pretty high, Mr. Farhi said."

After months of upwardly mobile prices, the price of onion has breached the 100-rupee mark in Kolkata, pinching end-of-the-month pockets.On Monday, onion was selling for anything between Rs 100 and Rs 115 per kilo in retail markets across the city. Even at Koley Market, the citys biggest wholesale vegetable hub, superior quality onion sold for Rs 100 a kilo, for the first time ever, though there were few takers.Some traders recalled that the last time the price of onion crossed Rs 100 per kilogram, albeit for only 48 hours, was in 1999. Onion prices became the main issue in several state elections that year.Kolkata and its adjoining areas consume close to 1,400 tonnes of onion every day. The price of onion goes up during this time every year due to various reasons and then settles, said Chandan Chakraborty, working president, Posta Bazar Merchants Association. This time, that hasnt happened. The price is on an upward swing. In most retail markets, onion was selling at Rs 100 or more per kilo on Monday, he added.Most of Kolkatas onion supply comes from Nashik and Ankola in Maharashtra. This year, there was rain during Ganesh Chaturthi, which damaged the crop. The resultant scarcity raised prices. On Monday, onion sold at Rs 110 in New Market, Rs 115 in Jadavpur market, Rs 110 in Salt Lakes BD market and Rs 100 in College Street market. The price has been steadily rising for the past three months.Households are trying to figure out substitutes for onion on the dining table. The price of onion has been burning a big hole in the pocket. It is an indispensable kitchen ingredient. Earlier, I used to buy for the whole week; now, I am buying in much smaller quantities  just the amount needed for the day, said Madhusree Ghosh, a homemaker in Salt Lake.In a meeting soon after cyclone Bulbul just a little over two weeks ago, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had come down heavily on traders and instructed police and the Enforcement Branch to conduct raids in the market to stop pricing malpractices. At that time, the price of onion was Rs 75 per kilo. The government has been selling onion at Rs 59 a kilo through Sufal outlets.A member of the task force set up by the government felt the soaring price was an indication of malpractice and hoarding. We have been holding repeated meetings with traders and their associations, but prices have not come down, he said.Food processing and industries minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said the state fully depended on other states for onion supply. The states onion production cannot meet the total demand. The government is selling onion at Rs 59 per kilo. We have also remained vigilant towards malpractices, he said."

Some have reduced the number of orders. Quantity of onions used in sambar is also reduced and carrot, cucumber and cabbage have replaced onions in raitha. These measures have been taken as prices of food cannot be increased, he added.Asaithambi, who runs a roadside teashop which offers samosas, vadas and bhajjis in T Nagar, said: We have started to cut down on onions in vadas and masala in samosas. Onion costs around Rs 80 to Rs 90 a kg but we cannot increase the price. We have cut down on the purchase. Instead of buying 3-4kg we buy only 2kg these days. We have stopped including onion in masala. But, many here have not thought about an alternative like using cabbage. We feel better off not using onions at all, he added. Prices are high since loads to the city from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have dwindled.In Madurai, another city famous for its food outlets, many restaurants and eateries have started using onion sparingly while rustling up meals. Most have removed dishes like onion bhajji and raitha from the menu till the prices, which touched Rs 100 a kg in the retail market, cool off. Onion bhajji is not available in many eateries, and so is onion raitha in many hotels and eateries in Madurai as the price of the basic ingredient in 90% of the dishes has skyrocketed to Rs 100 in the retail market.Shenbagam of Anna Nagar, said her daughters wedding has been scheduled for this weekend and they had gone to the market to buy about 20kg of onions, but found none. Those that were available were a little bigger than shallots and soggy, and wont stay good for more than a day, she said. Biryani lovers, who may swear that it is the onion raitha that compliments the non-vegetarian dish, are having to make do with cucumber raitha instead, with just two or three bits of onions. It is not even like garnish, and we are told that it is the only thing they can provide, said S Kannan.K L Kumar, president Madurai district hotels association, said the hotels were facing difficult times. All the hotels in the city purchase half a tonne of onions on average daily as it is the basic ingredient, and now they are buying just 300kg with much difficulty. We know the taste is getting compromised, he said.He said most of the hotels have decided to do away with onion raitha, and the price of omelettes with onion had been increased.A single omelette contains about Rs 10 worth onions, and if the price is not increased accordingly, we stand to loose, he said. Omelettes with egg are priced at Rs 30 to Rs 40, compared to the regular Rs 25. All the hotels have started replacing onions with cabbage in vadas, he added."

After months of unremittingly grey weather, I do not need much persuasion to head for sunnier climes. A week later, we are on a flight to Kingston.Rons sister, Estelle, is waiting for us when we walk out of Manley airport, after an eight-hour-long flight. We settle into the backseat of her 4-by-4 and set off on a two-lane highway running parallel to the sparkling azure waters of the Caribbean.With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas, after the United States and Canada. Kingston, the capital, is located on the south-eastern coast of the island. It has two major sections: downtown and uptown, also referred to as New Kingston. Rons parents reside in a comfortable villa in the affluent part of town. He has three siblings: a brother and two sisters including Estelle. They are a Mullato family, and like many Jamaicans have white, black, Indian and Chinese blood coursing through their veins, making for a striking combination.The following morning, after a sumptuous breakfast, we set off on a trip to the Blue Mountains, Jamaicas longest mountain range, to visit a friend of Rons who runs a coffee plantation in the region. The area is known for the famous Blue Mountain Coffee, which commands premium prices on world markets. About thirty minutes later, we leave the flats and start chugging up into the hills. The road is scooped out of the rock as if by hand. It seems barely wide enough for one vehicle, let alone two passing from opposite ways. We drive around numerous hairpin turns and are constantly bouncing on potholes. Just when it seems like the road couldnt get any worse, it turns to dirt. Finally, after two hours of driving, we arrive at the plantation.B07MJ9NPS5Daniel is a grizzled, serene-looking Rastafarian dressed in loose white clothing, with a beard and long dreadlocks collected under a white turban. He greets us with hugs. Holy Emmanuel I Selassie I Jah I Rastafari. Welcome to my humble abode he says with a beaming smile. We climb the steps of the porch and seat ourselves on a long bench running along the verandah. The large two-story wooden home is painted in white and brown and has a rooftop terrace with panoramic views of the mist-shrouded peaks and deep valleys encircling it.A tall white woman with blonde dreadlocks comes out with a tray bearing fresh fruit and steaming mugs of coffee. She introduces herself as Gretchen, Daniels wife. Three children ranging from ages four to ten are trailing her. I look around and cant help but notice dozens of tall marijuana plants growing wild all around the house. Then it strikes me. We are smack in the middle of a cannabis plantation. Daniel notices my gaze and explains that he grows both coffee and cannabis on this piece of land. He cultivates coffee for export while the cannabis is strictly for personal use.As night descends on the mountain, he builds a bonfire on a grassy knoll behind the house. We huddle around as he lights a clay pipe.A cannabis farm in Jamaica.Daniel belongs to the Bobo Ashanti sect of Rastafarianism, one of the more orthodox lineages within the larger movement. Bobos take their name from the Asante tribe in Africa, the original source of the majority of slaves in Jamaica. Several well-known Bobo Reggae artists have passed through Daniels home including Sizzla Kalonji, Capleton, Anthony B and Ras Shiloh.The next day arrives bright and clear, and after a meal of watermelon and pineapple, we bid our hosts adieu. Estelle is in the drivers seat as usual. We head towards Trench Town.Trench Town was notorious for political gang violence during the seventies, forcing Marley to leave after an assassination attempt. Sadly, not much has changed since then. Today it is carved up into different zones, each one controlled by a leader or don. Political parties created the gangs in the 1970s to rustle upvotes. The gangs have since turned to drug trafficking, but each remains closely tied to a political party. The hostility between these rival gangs and ensuing urban warfare has turned the area into one of the most dangerous places in the world.0805080864, 0007255535We stop in front of an unassuming restaurant with Jerk Chicken, Oxtail Soup and Red Stripe Beer printed on the wall in large red letters. A group of kids are kicking around a soccer ball on the street. Its nearly lunchtime and we have decided to stop for food. We order beers and two portions of each dish with salads on the side.Jerk chicken is the de facto national dish of Jamaica; aromatic and smoky, sweet but insistently hot.

Ironically, while the carnival is getting bigger by the year, groundnut sellers have been complaining of dipping sales Chudamani Swamy, a groundnut seller, who has been participating at the fair for over 10 years, said, Today, people come here to experience the fair and buy things like whistles, trumpets, toys, earrings, but not groundnuts. Our sales have dropped.Chudamani said last year she sold groundnuts for Rs 40 per seer, but this time there are very few takers though the price is down to Rs 20 per seer. We reduced the price thinking people would buy more, but we arent able to make more than Rs 2,000 per day. Last year, we had made Rs 7,000 daily, she added.Another groundnut vendor, Dhanavantri Marimuttu from Dharmapuri, said her husband has set up a store, where he is selling knick-knacks, jewellery, bangles and other items and thats making more profit than her groundnut stall. People are buying fancy stuff instead of nuts, because they know that this is available only once a year at the fair, but groundnuts will be available for the next few months, Marimuttu said.The fair is enjoyed by people of all ages. It feels like a real celebration of life amid all the humdrum. There is light, noise, music, divinity and food, said Stella Thomas, a BA student.The parishe has all the markers of a grand carnival. The sound of peepi (whistle) and the beats of tamate (drums) blend with the aroma of delicious chilli bajjis, onion pakodas and fresh corn roasted on red embers.Sushmitha Naidu, a homemaker, said she was excited as it was her first time at the parishe. I have been living in Bengaluru for two years but this is the first time that I have visited the fair and its exciting, she said.Meanwhile, old-timers have chosen to stick to the basics, buying groundnuts. Ramakrishna Rao, 73, who has been visiting the fair for over 33 years now, said: The event has grown over the years. Earlier, only a few hundreds would come here, but today things have changed."
2019-11-26,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wholesale-onion-prices-skyrocket-to-all-time-high-of-100/article30081061.ece,Wholesale onion prices skyrocket to all-time high of ₹100,"The price of one kg of onion touched 100 in the wholesale market for the first time on Monday. The price has skyrocketed owing to low supply following damage to crops during the unseasonal rain that hit farmlands across the State this year.Ashok Walunj, former director of APMC market, said, This is the first time that the price of onion has reached 100 in the wholesale market. In the retail market, it had already touched 100 and now it will be priced between 120 and 150.Meanwhile, traders said the onions produced this season were mostly spoilt in the unseasonal rain and the stock from the summer crop, which were stored in kanda chawls are being supplied in the APMC market.Mr. Walunj said, There are certain problems that arise owing to conventional storage of onions such as drop in weight, and sprouting and rotting of the bulb. To overcome such losses, onions are stored in a scientific manner at a place called the kanda chawl, which are constructed in farms. This minimises the threat of losses and deterioration in quality of the crop. It also helps farmers fetch better prices for their produce. They then release the stock as per the season and demand of onions in the market.Mr. Walunj said since the old crop is of good quality, it is being sold at a higher price. He said, Even though it will burn a hole in the common mans pocket, it is a good phase for farmers.Mr. Walunj said onions are usually dried for a week after being harvested. However, farmers are now sending their stock immediately owing to the low supply in the market and the onions turn out to be wet and spoilt.As of Saturday, the old stock was being sold between 70 and 80 per kg at the wholesale market, but it has now spiked to 100.The new stock was being sold between 50 and 60 per kg, and it is now fetching prices between 70 and 80. The onion supply to APMC market primarily comes from Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur.Mr. Walunj said, We get imported onions from Egypt, but they are not of good quality. They are too huge to be used in households. One onion weighs around 250 gm. Of the 100 trucks bringing onions to the market daily, hardly four contain imported ones.He said usually the good stock of onions floods the market and is sold at 25 per kg. He said the price of onions is not expected to reduce till December 15."

The retailers, in turn, are selling it with a margin of between 2 and 5 kg.According to Janardhana Saliyan, secretary, Central Market Merchants Association, the wholesale price hovered between 86 and 90 a kg, depending on the quality.There is a shortage of quality onions, he said.Mr. Saliyan said earlier the Central Market was getting five truck loads of onion a day and the wholesale merchants could stock some. Now, the supply has come down to three loads a day and all get sold daily.Shoheb, a wholesale onion merchant at Bunder, said the fresh arrivals cost between 60 and 70 a kg while the old ones are being sold between 90 and 95 a kg. The big size Egypt variety costs between 85 and 90 a kg, he said.Another wholesale trader in Bunder said the traders are getting damaged onions, because of recent rains and floods in north Karnataka and Maharashtra.Making use of the opportunity and citing short supply, some retailers especially on the outskirts of the city are quoting even up to 100 a kg and more, the wholesale trader said.A retailer at Yekkuru in the city said he sold the produce for 86 a kg on Tuesday."

I am going inside the House wearing this mala (garland) as I want the honorable chief minister to behold this sight. I hope that it would compel him to take some serious action.

(File) This year, heavy and unseasonal rain has reversed the normal trend of lower vegetable prices in winter. (File)The onset of winter has failed to cool vegetable prices as unseasonal rain in October has damaged standing crop across agricultural fields in the state. Farmers and traders in Pune have ruled out any easing of prices in the near future.During the last two weeks of October, heavy rain lashed vegetable-growing districts in the state. The rain led to destruction of standing crops of vegetables, which led to a steep rise in the prices of most vegetables in markets. Green leafy vegetables such as methi, coriander, among others, are now being sold for around Rs 25 to 30 per bunch. Similarly, brinjals, beans, cabbage, etc, are all being sold for around Rs 50 to 80 per kg. Onion prices continue to be high with retail markets reporting prices from Rs 60 to 70 per kg.Vilas Bhujbal, a commission agent operating in Punes wholesale market, said the prices remained steady, albeit on the higher side, as supplies were still under stress. He added that onion prices continued to be high as farmers reported loss of fresh crop due to the heavy rain.Although imported onions have hit the markets, the markets have not accepted them, he said. The main onion growing regions like Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, have reported loss of crop. This year, heavy and unseasonal rain has reversed the normal trend of lower vegetable prices in winter.Meanwhile, fruits such as pomegranate, custard apple and figs have also been affected by the unseasonal rain. Rohan Ursal, a commission agent in Punes wholesale market, said farmers had suffered enormous losses.The quality of fruits coming to the market is poor; thus, farmers are unable to realise good prices, he said. Ursal said the arrival of custard apple from Purandhar and other areas of the state was hit as the rain had caused a major drop in the fruit crop in the region. Other than fruits and vegetables, the price of eggs has also started rising. Wholesale price has gone up from Rs 4.50 per egg to Rs 4.77 per egg in the last few days. In the retail market, prices have crossed Rs 5 to 5.50 per egg. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Early this month, the government had started four retail stores in Bhopal selling onion at Rs 50 a kg. But they were closed within a week, with the administration claiming that onion prices have decreased.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-11-27,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/some-takeaways-from-maharashtra-government-formation/story-AlbIKnG2yZJfLTrihLvnOJ.html,Some takeaways from Maharashtra government formation,"mumbaiUpdated: Nov 28, 2019 03:24 ISTWith many fast-paced political developments headquartered in Mumbai all month so that Maharashtra can have a government, what else would Mumbaiites discuss? The ridiculously high price of onions, next movie release or job? Most of it circles back to politics. The shenanigans are confusing, but there are some takeaways.The BJP and Shiv Sena contested the Assembly election together, secured a majority in the 288-member legislature, but could not form the government. What should have been an open-and-shut case has lingered into its fifth week because the Sena upped its fight with its partner after the results  for its own survival. The Congress and NCP together won 98 seats, were willing to play the good Opposition, but will now be partnering with the Sena in the new Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. Mandate means nothing. The Sena, which proudly wore the badge of belligerent Hindutva for 30 years, and the Congress, which swears by secularism, made common cause. Its complicated.To cut through the clutter, they were driven by a single-point agenda of keeping a predatory BJP away from power. And Sharad Pawar fused the ideological opponents into an alliance along with his NCP. Theres a good reason hes been called strongman, boss-man, master strategist and more; he gave a practical demonstration of political manoeuvring to generations that did not associate gladiatorial skills with the portly grandfather.Last Friday night, they were all set to form the government. Next morning, BJPs Devendra Fadnavis and Pawars impetuous nephew, Ajit, had been sworn in. People move fast in Mumbai, but even so, this was breathlessly rapid. The uncle-nephew turned into a full-blown soap opera and three constitutional heads  the Governor, President and Prime Minister  had acted in ways not befitting the offices they held. They have not offered explanations yet.This power-at-any-cost by bending constitutional norms needed to be pushed back. This, the alliance managed to do. Thats why its opportunism and five-star resort politics may be overlooked. Theres never a perfect solution in politics anyway. That said, status quoism and dynasties are still thriving. CM-designate Uddhav Thackeray has not ever contested an election or held office.The so-called modern-day Chanakya and his Chanakyaniti that steamrolled all norms to form governments in other states came a cropper here. Not every politician everywhere can be bought with massive funds from electoral bonds, Chanakya now knows. Thats not because they are a highly principled lot, but their regional pride was shrewdly kindled. Remember Maharashtra doesnt bend in front of Delhi remark? This sub-nationalism is not going away soon. Thackeray spoke of teaching (BJP) a lesson. Sena men protected MLAs from BJP. Senas Abdul Sattar said mundi tod denge. The Marathi versus Gujarati sentiment is back. All, triggers for social anxiety, 1990s redux.Can Uddhavs Sena behave now that it is in power? Mumbai is watching."

Traders note there may be a further spike in its cost, and prices may drop only around mid-December.The cost of small onion and drumsticks too have been on an upswing since the first week of November. Traders said the unseasonal rain in Maharashtra and crop damage had led to a surge in prices. The Koyambedu wholesale market is receiving only 40 to 50 truckloads of onion daily and a shortfall of 40% of produce has led to a spike in prices.Onion has become costly in other cities too, as arrivals have declined. The wholesale price of onion in Coimbatore on Tuesday was 95 a kg. M. Rajendran, onion trader and president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, Coimbatore, said: We used to get 600 to 700 tonnes of big onion daily from Karnataka and Maharashtra. It has reduced to 200 tonnes now. The fresh arrivals do not last the 48-hour transport from Maharashtra to Coimbatore.At the Uzhavar Sandhais in Coimbatore, the price of small onion range from 65-85 a kg, while big onion are priced 60-80 a kg.Consumers were in for a shock, as onion prices in retail markets surged on a daily basis. The cost of onion increased from 80 a kg two days ago, to 100-110 a kg, in Chennai. Many residents noted that they spend one-third of their vegetable shopping budgets on onion. A kilogram of drumsticks is priced up to a staggering 250. A bunch of coriander leaves also costs 15-20.Hoteliers too are in a fix. Onion is a base product in the dishes. We reduce the use of onions wherever possible, says Jegan S. Damodarasamy, executive director of Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar Hotels.S. Chandran, general secretary, Federation of Chennai Koyambedu Wholesale Market Associations, said there had been a steady rise in onion prices since November first week. The cost went up by 5 a kg daily, due to low yield and surge in demand. We expect the rates to come down to 60 a kg only by mid-December or January, he said. The shortage of onion has also sent the cost of small onions spiralling. Small onion, which was sold for 70/kg early November, now costs up to 130 a kg, depending on the quality.Traders noted that drumsticks are costly now, as this is not its season, noted traders. However, the market receives stock from places such as Vadodara. This time, short supply from the region has led to a steep increase in prices.Plea to import onionP. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said onion prices previously hit 100 a kg a decade ago. Imported onion from Egypt is yet to reach the city. There is no storage facility or space for hoarding in the market.The government must explore storage facilities, like in Israel and Brazil, where onion is stored in open ventilated warehouses, he said.C.M. Jayaraman, president of Coimbatore Consumer Voice, said the government should distribute a minimum of 5 kg of onion through PDS outlets, State-owned supermarkets and Uzhavar Sandhais.PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Tuesday demanded that the Central and State governments take immediate steps to rein in the price of onions and asked the government to ease the rules to import onions from Egypt."

Read MoreTimesView There needs to be closer monitoring of price movements, especially when there is a demand-supply gap. An abnormal rise in retail rates indicates profiteering.KOLKATA: With onions breaching the Rs 100 mark in retail markets and the prices showing no signs of dipping, the Bengal government is working on modalities to procure the staple vegetable from Rajasthan.Almost 70% of the demand in the state is met by supplies from Nashik and Akola in Maharashtra. But due to untimely rains this year the supply from these places has taken a hit leading to a spike in prices. Supply from Karnataka and Telangana has also dried up. The government has started working on the process of procuring onions from other states. Rajasthan produces a good quantity of the vegetable. The agricultural marketing department has been given the responsibility to work out the modalities, said Abdur Rezzak Mollah, minister for food processing industries and horticulture. The minister warned that the prices are unlikely to decline at least for the next few days.Government officials and those associated with the trade could not recall the vegetable ever being procured from Rajasthan to bridge the demand-supply gap.Onions from Rajasthan are crimson in colour and taste sweet. A very small amount of this variety is sold in Kolkata during this time. But I cannot recall the government procuring onions directly from Raj-asthan in the past few years, said Rabindranath Koley, a member of the governments task force.On Tuesday, onion prices dipped marginally in the wholesale markets  on news that rates have dropped slightly in Nashik  but retail prices continued to hover between Rs 100 and Rs 110 per kg. We expect the prices in the retail market to come down marginally in the next couple of days but there would be no substantial decline since there is a huge gap between supply and demand. This may continue till the second week of December, said Kamal Dey, president of the West Bengal Vendors Association and a member of the CMs task force.Members of the task force visited a couple of municipal markets in Salt Lake and claimed the prices had come down to Rs 80 per kg but residents who visited the market claimed they had paid upwards of Rs 100.Not only is the price very high, the stock with the vendors is also very low. This is automatically creating a scarcity and spiking the price further. Onions are a staple in most kitchens and it is becoming difficult to think of dishes where onions are not required, said Ayantika Das, a homemaker in Salt Lake.West Bengal along with some other states will also receive a tranche of onions the central government has imported from Turkey and Egypt."

He said onion is an essential daily need, but the the government was not doing anything concrete to tackle the situation.The daily requirement of the city is around 30 tonnes, but on Tuesday, the availability was around 3 tonnes, the MLA said.On the sale of onions at 25 a kg at rythu bazaars, he said, The quantity is just not enough. Moreover, stocks reached the bazaars at around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The Marketing Department failed in its duty, he alleged.Andhra Pradesh is not a major onion-growing State. Most of its requirements are met from from States such as Maharashtra. In the past, the government went to the rescue of people by subsidising the product and ensuring adequate stocks were available, said Mr. Ganesh.If the government does not take note of my gesture, I will do it again, he said.After Anna Canteens were closed by the government, Mr. Ganesh ran a canteen near the closed one near KGH for a few days. He supplied lunch for  5 a plate to the needy.No respiteMeanwhile, there has been no respite for citizens who were forced to wait in long queues outside rythu bazaars. I never imagined that it would take four hours to purchase 1 kg of onion. We can buy in the black market, but the price is around 100 a kg, which we cannot afford. Earlier, onions were available in the morning, but in the last two days, they are being supplied in the evenings, said Radhika, a housewife.According to M. Kaleswara Rao, Assistant Director Marketing Department, the district administration had put up a demand for 30 tonnes for supply to 13 rythu bazaars in the city, but the supply has been around 25 tonnes."

Onion prices have rose to 70-80 per kg in retail markets across major cities.Stockholding limit on retailers and wholesalers are being further extended until further orders, an official statement said.The stockholding limit was imposed in September. At present, retailers can stock onion only up to 100 quintals and wholesale traders are allowed to keep up to 500 quintals.The decision was taken at an inter-ministerial meeting, chaired by Consumer Affairs Secretary A.K. Srivastava, to monitor the price and availability of onions across the country.The consumer affairs secretary has written to chief secretaries of all States asking them to suitably reduce the stock limits further in their states as per the availability and prices.State-owned MMTC informed that the first shipment of onions from Egypt would arrive in the second week of December. The public sector trading firm has contracted imports of 6,090 tonnes of onions. It has floated a country-specific tender.Expressing concern over the price rise, Mr. Paswan said the situation is being closely monitored by a team of five Union ministers chaired by Home Minister Amit Shah. Finance minister, agriculture minister and road transport minister are also members of the group of ministers.On November 19, Mr. Paswan had said onion production in Kharif and late-Kharif seasons of 2019-20 is estimated to fall 26 per cent to 5.2 million tonnes due to a delayed monsoon and then excessive rains in key growing areas."

From the money to organise a post-Durga Puja get-together, the members decided to distribute one-kilogram onions to more than 100 people free of cost on Wednesday.Onion is a staple in every kitchen. It is a basic ingredient to make food. But the price has gone up so high that the economically backward section of the society cannot afford to buy even a small quantity. Our members decided that on the humanitarian basis, we must come to the rescue of such people. We had some money to organise a post Durga puja get together but we decided to use it to help people by providing them onions free of cost, said Koushik Chatterjee, president of the club.The club purchased onions at wholesale price and distributed it from its premises on Wednesday morning. Hundreds of people queued up since morning to receive the onions. Initially we had decided to give to 100 people only. But the demand was high so we ensured nobody returned empty handed. If prices do not come down we will try to reach out to more people, said Chatterjee.On Wednesday despite a dip in wholesale prices, onions continued to sell at Rs 100 in almost all Kolkata markets.Kolkata and its adjoining areas consume close to 1,400 tonnes of onions every day.Households are trying to figure out substitutes for onions on the dinning table. Onion prices are burning a big hole in the pocket. It is an indispensable ingredient in the kitchen. Earlier, I would buy for the whole week but now I am just buying the amount needed for the day, said Madhusree Ghosh, a homemaker in Salt Lake.Abdur Rezzak Mollah, food processing and industries minister, said the state was fully dependant on other states for the supply of onions. The onion production in the state cannot meet the total demand. The government is selling onions for Rs 59 per kilogram. We are also vigilant towards malpractices, said Mollah."

Several onion farmers are in distress as shallot (small onion) crops are affected by basal rot disease, which indicates that fresh supplies would take some more time to arrive in the market. Prices of Onion and Shallot crossed `110 in Tiruchy on Tuesday.Over 1000 hectares of shallot crop in Perambalur, which is one of the hubs, are affected out of the total shallot cultivation area of 3,291 hectares, said sources. Several farmers are destroying the spoiled crop and starting afresh. Perambalur is a top producer of shallots for over a decade now and farmers in more than 150 villagers are into shallot cultivation.Starting from August till December, the farmers cultivate two seasons of shallots back to back. This year, basal rot disease has been reported in several villages. The disease is caused because of cloudy, drizzling weather and fog. Officials said, such weather will induce soil-borne microorganisms that damage the crops. Once infested, crop cannot be saved but can be prevented.P Kanagaraj, a farmer in Adaikkampatti, said, This year, disease shattered our hopes. We have no option other than destroying the crop. I spent `1 lakh for an acre to plant small onions in two acres in Adaikkampatti. We should be harvesting but are destroying the crop now.

(Express photo by Partha Paul) At Janbazar vegetable market in Kolkata on Wednesday. (Express photo by Partha Paul)Many households in the state have decided to take fish and chicken curry off their kitchen. Hosts to several weddings are revising their menu. The reason? The onion price on Wednesday soared to Rs 100-a-kg mark at retail vegetable markets. Traders have blamed Cyclone Bulbul and alleged hoarding in Maharashtra and Karnataka for shortage in the supply of the bulbous vegetable.Sandhya Shaw, a domestic helper in Kamarhati area under North 24 Parganas district, said the soaring onion prices had left her in a fix as how to manage her daughters wedding within her budget. My daughters wedding is on December 1. We have set aside an amount for the menu. As the onion prices have gone up, the cook has increased his budget. I dont know how I will manage. I think we have to either use less onions or have to completely manage without them if we want to stick to our budget, said Shaw.There are others in the state who have shunned non-vegeterian foods for now. Onion is the most elementary gradient in such curries.Chicken and onion are being sold at almost the same price. So we have turned vegetarian and are eating spinach and other seasonal vegetables instead of fish and chicken, said Subhir Bhattacharya, a teacher from Baguihati area in North 24 Parganas.Sangeeta Acharya, a housewife, said, I would buy 1 kg of onion for a week from the super market as it was cheap. But, for the time being, we are not using onions.At several local vegetable markets in Kolkata, onions are selling at Rs 120 a kg or even more. The state governments efforts, including formation of a task force, to check onion prices have seemingly failed. Rabindranath Koley, a member of the task force, accused the Central government of not cooperating with state government to bring onion prices down. Usually, 25-30 trucks each with 16 tonnes of onion enter Bengal daily. But, these days only two-three trucks are carrying onions in the state. The annual consumption of onion in the state is 9 lakh metric tonnes yearly, Koley said.Wholesale traders in Bengal blamed the supply chain, saying their counterparts in Maharashtras Nasik and Karnataka have hoarded onions. They also blamed cyclone Bulbul which left many parts of the state flooded. However , the task force members claimed that due to its inspection in local market, prices of other vegetables have come down.Meanwhile, the task force assured that the situation will improve by next week.

Despite the marginal dip in the wholesale rates, the price of onions did not decrease in the retail markets. The wholesale price on Wednesday dipped to Rs 2,400-Rs 2,800 per 40kg bag from Rs 2,600-Rs 3,100, making the wholesale price of good quality onion Rs 60 per kg. However, in most markets, including New Market, College Street, Maniktala and Lake Market, the price per kg remained static at Rs 100.Freshly harvested onions from Nagpur and Bengaluru, two major onion-producing zones in the country, usually hit the city market around the end of the second week of December. Till then, the onion price is unlikely to dip beyond a point. A decrease of Rs 10 or Rs 20 per kg does not make sense when the price is as high as Rs100 per kg, said Kamal Dey, a market expert and president of West Bengal Vendors Association.Shoppers were surprised to find the stock on the shelves decreased drastically on Wednesday. Vendors who normally stock around 25kg to 30kg only had close to 5kg on display. A market insider said traders were hoarding the vegetable to further jack up the price to maximise profit. The government must carry out raids at some of the godowns where onions are stocked, the source said.Bazar main maal hi nahi hai. Paisa dene se bhi maal nahi mil raha hai (There are no onions in the market. We are willing to pay, but the stock is inadequate), said Mustakim Ali, a retailer in New Market.After visiting some of the markets in Salt Lake, members of the task force said the price has dipped in the retail markets though the ground reality was far from it. On Thursday, members of the task force, along with officers of the enforcement branch, will visit five markets in Salt Lake to look into the reasons why the prices are not coming down. We have decided to visit five markets in Salt Lake because of complains that shopkeepers are charging very high for onions. We will talk to buyers, shopkeepers and local wholesalers, said a member of the task force."

Traders have ruled out any immediate relief for consumers as the new crop of onion is expected to come only in January.On Monday, onion rates at the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai had crossed Rs 100 per kg. Rajendra Shelke, a commission agent operating out of the Vashi market, said this was highly unusual and was brought about by severe supply shortage in the markets. However, the prices have since come down to Rs 70-80 per kg, he said. Shelke said this trend will continue the whole of December with some relief expected only in January.At Punes wholesale market, onion prices are hovering at Rs 80-90 per kg. Vilas Bhujbal, commission agent of the market, said arrival has been severely hit, which is the reason for the higher price.Bhujbal also ruled out any immediate correction in prices.The present price comes at a time when around 4,500 tonnes of imported onions have reached the Indian shores from Egypt. A senior official of the ministry of agriculture said more onion is expected to reach the Indian markets later in December. It might be remembered that the government-owned MMTC had floated tenders to import 1.5 lakh tonnes of onions in order to check the current price trend.Shelke and Bhujbal said that the imported onions had failed to create any impact in terms of prices as consumers have given it a thumbs down. Such onions are taken in by the hotel and hospitality industry but there are reports that the shelf life of such onions is short, they pointed out.Suresh Deshmukh, a commission agent operating out of Nashik, said the increased demand from India had pushed up onion prices in Egypt also.By the time the onions landed in Mumbai and headed for other markets they too sold at Rs 80 per kg, which failed to create any impact in the domestic market, he said.The present hike is a result of a 7 per cent dip in onion acreage from 2.73 lakh hectares for the kharif crop. Also heavy rains had caused damage to the standing crop with state horticulture directorates talking of 58 per cent destruction of the ready crop in Madhya Pradesh, 18 per cent in Karnataka and 2 per cent in Andhra Pradesh. The crop in Maharashtra has also sustained damage reflected in the lower arrivals in wholesale markets. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

In what could well be a record for the State, a kilo of onion on Wednesday crossed 100 in wholesale markets.Traders and officials in the Horticulture Department claimed that this was the first time onion prices had crossed the psychological barrier of 100 in Karnataka. It is being sold for 115-135 a kg in retail markets, while the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price on Wednesday was 118.The price hike indicates that the Union governments programme to stabilise the rising cost of kitchen staples  tomatoes, onions, and potatoes  announced in the 2018-19 budget, has evidently failed to take off, said a senior procurement official for a leading retail chain.Farmers and traders blame the heavy rains in August and September across Karnataka and Maharashtra. This has led to large-scale crop damage creating an acute shortage of supply. Even the onions currently being sold are wet, of very low quality, and decompose very fast, said Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association.A respite in the near future seems unlikely as the next harvest is only expected by the end of January 2020. This gives no respite to consumers for another two months and may drive the retail prices further north to even cross the 150 barrier if the government doesnt intervene, traders said.

However, Karnataka is yet to place an order for onions from this consignment.When contacted, Shashikala Jolle, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, said she was busy with the byelection campaign in Gokak, Belagavi, but would review the situation soon.Shamla Iqbal, Commissioner, Food and Civil Supplies Department, said the department was reviewing production strategy with the Horticulture Department and will take a call.

We cannot afford to raise the prices of items on the menu as business is already tough. Most hotels have a standard recipe and the cooks are often not comfortable deviating from it. This has hit our profit margins, he said.Some hotels are taking to drastic measures like dropping items from the menu altogether.

Maybe the CCTV cameras placed in the market will give us a clue, said the vendor, who found five sacks containing nearly 50-52 kg of this veggie missing from his shop.Curiously enough, the sacks containing the precious commodity were kept camouflaged under waste paper and rubbish so as not to attract unnecessary attention.

In Delhi it was selling up to Rs 100 a kilo. Consumer affairs secretary A K Srivasatava said a shipment of 6,900 tonnes will start arriving in India from December 12 in tranches.Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan blamed unseasonal and torrential rain for nearly 26% reduction in onion production. Since rain has impacted production, I cant give any timeline about fall in onion prices . We are making all possible efforts, from importing to checking hoarding, he said.The government had created a buffer stock of 57,000 tonnes, half of which rotted in storage and the rest got liquidated.He pointed out that the season for onion cultivation was mostly over except in Turkey and Holland and the government is making all efforts to get stocks from these countries and Egypt. Officials said MMTC had floated two tenders earlier for import of onions which had to be cancelled. The third bid was successful and 1 lakh tonnes are being imported.On Wednesday, Srivastava chaired an inter-ministerial meeting which decided to work out modalities for transportation of sealed containers of onions from the Mumbai port directly to a facility at Rai in Sonipat.According to dealers in the capital, heavy rain in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka  the states that cater to the bulk of Delhis demand had destroyed a major chunk of the crop resulting in the surge in prices.The quantity of onion that we are getting from Alwar in Rajasthan is not enough leading to a hike in prices. Unless we start getting fresh crop of onions from Gujarat and Maharashtra, which is not going to happen before the end of December, prices will not ease, said Srikant Mishra, secretary, Onion Traders Association, Azadpur, adding that the stocks from Alwar will not last for more than 20 days.While the wholesale price at Azadpur mandi is hovering between Rs 35 and Rs 60 per kg, in the retail market it goes up to Rs 100 in Delhi. Though Delhi government had started selling onions at a controlled rate of Rs 23.90 per kg through mobile vans in September and October, consumers are heavily dependent on retailers. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal claims that the Centre had stopped supplying onions to Delhi at the controlled prices for the past 2-3 days. We will write to the Centre, he said.Though India had imported onions from Afghanistan to bridge the gap, traders say the demand for this variety, which is big in size, is not very high in Delhi and people generally prefer the desi variety, which, they say, is tastier.According to an estimate, Delhi consumes about 2,000 tonnes of onion daily. Since several traders from neighbouring cities in UP and Haryana prefer to buy the bulb from Delhi, the daily average demand at the wholesale markets touches 2,200-2,400 tonnes.But what we are currently getting is just about 1200 tonnes. A big chunk is also sent to UP, Bihar and Assam directly from Alwar and thats why the gap between demand and supply is not bridging, said Delhi agricultural marketing board member Ram Baran.In Video: Onion prices resume upward trend, touch Rs 100/kg mark in vegetable markets"

Though the new stock of onions has hit the city vegetable markets, its quality remains disappointing.In August this year, onions were priced at just Rs 30 per kg, however, due to the bad weather conditions, prices of onions saw a steep hike. The prices of onions even touched Rs 90 per kg this Sunday, highest this year.According to the traders, the new stock of onions, which is coming from the Alwar area, has been affected due to the heavy rains and the demand. Due to increased demand, onions were harvested in a rush and not in a proper manner. As a result, onions arriving in the city to tackle the increased demand, are poor in quality.Madan, a city resident, said ""If one is lucky, he or she will get onions at a reasonable price. Back in 2018, such problems never occurred, but this year, it is like a stock market. Just like the petrol prices are daily mentioned in the newspaper, soon, if these conditions prevail, the price of onions will also have a separate column.""Balbir Singh, chairman of the Sector 26 vegetable market, said ""The new stock is priced at around Rs 55 per kg in the wholesale market, but the retailers further sell it at a higher price. Now, some amount of stock is also arriving in the city from the capital, so most likely the situation will improve within a week."""

Veerendra N Kamat, who is part of the Kamat Group of Hotels and treasurer of Bruhat Bengaluru Hoteliers Association, said, We have no option but to compromise on use of onions in some dishes but cant stop using it in North Indian dishes. We have not stopped Onion Dosa, but have stopped Onion Chutney and have increased the price by 10%.ALSO READ: Madhya Pradesh - Onions worth Rs 22 lakh go missing, empty truck foundIn areas like Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Commercial Street, MG Road and Ulsoor, the price has touched Rs 120 while in areas like Vijayanagar, Rajajinagar, Rajarajeshwarinagar, etc., it is Rs 100 at retail outlets, said Uday Kumar, a onion trader at the APMC yard.For the past three months, onion prices in both the wholesale and retail markets have been steadily rising. It touched the Rs 100 mark early this week and was Rs 120 on Thursday. This has been the case in most parts of Karnataka. In Mangaluru, while the wholesale price is Rs 60 per kg, the retail price is Rs 100. In Tumakuru, which is about 70 km, from Bengaluru, the wholesale price of onion is Rs 90 while the retail price has touched Rs 100.We have stopped making dishes with onions at home. The price is too much. Also, the onions which are available are not of good quality. They looks good from the outside but are really bad within. I got only six pieces for one kg and of those, three were bad, lamented Sarika Raju, a resident of Jayanagar 9th Block.While residents are fretting over the quality of onions, farmers are saying they are getting very less for their yield.Onion prices may be high in retail outlets, but we are hardly getting about Rs 20 or so per kg. We are not earning any money. It is all the middlemen who are taking the money and the retailers sell at high prices. Our own relatives in the city are paying four to five times the price we are selling to the market, said Rangappa, a farmer from Chitradurga.However, Sharath Saxena, a retailer said, When we buy it at Rs 90 per kg in the wholesale market, we need at least Rs 20-30 extra to cover the cost of labour, wastage, commission etc."

A gist: papa blanca (white potato), papa amarilla (yellow potato), papa negra (black potato), papa prpura (purple potato that turns blue when cooked), papa rosada (pink potato with a white inside) the list, never-ending.You wont stumble upon these at the Peruvian Gastronomy Festival, a 10-course degustation menu on traditional staples by The Peru Embassy.Its all Indian aloo. The trivia, however, will explain why mounds of papas occupy your table in every imaginable preparation  boiled, baby-sized and mashed. Even as French fries.Your first papa dish is Yuca with Green Sauce, fat boiled and fried sticks of cassava (from the tuber brood) with avocado and parsley sauce; redolent of French fries with green chutney, nothing fancy.But Potatoes with Huancaina Cream is the mood-setter. Instead of dunking cold sliced potatoes in the sauce, how its traditionally done, we were served boiled baby potatoes (skin intact) with the cream as dip.The yellow, rich, creamy, almost cheesy textured Huancaina with a subtle hint of chill is the star. But the ultimate potato lovers haven is the Causa, a mashed potato mini cake sandwiching shredded chicken and boiled avocado bits. Youll love how your fork just slides through the soft textures and each morsel, a melt-in-the-mouth. About the name, Causa was a fundraiser for the cause of Perus independence from Spain in the 19th century.A food-and-drink pairing is the Ceviche with Pisco Sour. Ceviche is Perus national dish with its own national day  June 28.The soupy hors doeuvre involves sea bass (or any other white fish) cubes marinated in lime topped with corn, aji chili, onions, and coriander. The hit juicy, acidic combo might not sit well with the Indian palate, especially because its prepared cold and must be eaten fresh to evade food-poisoning.Wash it down with Pisco Sour or South American brandy, Perus national drink that can only be distilled from any of their eight earmarked Peruvian grape varieties.A bigger frothier head than beer, the notes of lime and Angostura bitters getting increasingly heady with every sip.A favourite post-soccer match drink for Peruvians, its flexible taste profile is susceptible to blending with an array of unimaginable ingredients. With ginger ale, it graduates to chilcano, and Im told it goes well with kokum as well.From desserts, though heavily saccharine, youll love the Suspiro Limeo; creamy caramel pudding (dluche de leche) with meringue sprinkled with cinnamon.Till: December 1At: The One, Le Meridian hotelCost: Rs 3,080 per head"

He argued that the Centres decision to make onion available at such high price will adversely affect the supply of onions to the people of Delhi.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta in a tweet, alleged that the the AAP government had cancelled an order of four truckloads of daily onion supply in the first week of October."

But we have put up a board at our hotel to inform the customers that a plate of raw onion would cost 15 extra.

But it has become impossible today  we are left with no other alternative, he said.Another restaurant owner said, several food items have become costlier as a result of the rising onion prices. The prices of a number of dishes, which cannot be prepared without onions, have gone up. Earlier, we used to procure onions from wholesale market at 15-20 per kg.

If they try to reduce use of the kitchen staple, their products will lose their tang and customers will stop buying. If they attempt to raise prices of the items, the consequences could be similar. And not like rates of yeast, potato, carrot and capsicum offer any respite, rue bakers.""We use onions in multiple products. Egg/vegetable puffs, sandwiches, bread toast and mixture get their taste from onions. I have not increased prices of these products in my bakery. All I have done is reduced the quantity of onion we use in them,"" said Bala Subramanian Bhat, who has been running a bakery in Kamakshipalya for 33 years now. ""I can't even reduce wages of my workers as the cost of living is going up. I have incurred a loss in the past six months,"" Bhat added.Unwilling to compromise on quality, most bakers may be left with no choice but to charge more for the items they sell, if the price spiral does not abate.""As an old establishment we have faith that onion prices will come down. In the unlikely scenario of that not happening, we wouldn't have a choice but to increase the prices of our products. For instance, a sandwich at our store costs Rs 35. We will increase it by Rs 3,"" said VF David, owner of Fatima Bakery, Castle Street junction, Richmond Road.For now, bakers are looking at various avenues to compensate for the price spiral. And their first target is manpower.""Not just onions, prices of carrots and beans too are on the higher side. I have laid off three managers from my store,"" said David.""Onion crops were ravaged in the recent rain and that is why prices have hit the roof. We don't expect the rates to drop for another month and a half. Until new crops arrive, prices aren't going to reduce,"" a Hopcoms official said.Some bakers have, meanwhile, decided to weather the crisis. Vijay Shankar, owner of Variar bakery, told TOI: ""Such unpredicted situations are a part of every business.

2019-11-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/champaran-meat-curry-gopal-kushwala/article30113688.ece,Champaran meat curry now shines as a regional delicacy across Bihar,"At Old Champaran Meat House in Patna, the crowd waiting is restless. What keeps them engaged, however, is a dramatic kitchen scene. A line of whistling earthen pots sits atop gas burners, with jets of steam gushing out of small openings on their lids. The mouths of the handis or ahuna are sealed with kneaded flour, and an aroma of mutton stewing in mustard oil floats over the expectant diners.This scene unfolds regularly across Patna, where the popularity of Champaran meat curry, served in takeaway handis, rages. The curry from the nondescript town of Champaran, from where Gandhi famously started the Satyagraha, has recently been making it to the tables of the rich and famous. Gopal Khushwaha, who claims to be its originator in current recipe and form, says it has even made it to the banquet at Raisina Hill.An innocent query about the dish from a client inspired Gopal to trace the dish to Ghorasahan, a small village 30 kms from Motihari on the Bihar-Nepal border. The dish has its origins in Nepal, where it is cooked in open handis. On the Indian side, it is cooked covered, but stirred often. Mutton is marinated in mustard oil mixed with onions, a paste of ginger and spice powders, and cooked slowly over a low flame.Gopal says the goodness of the curry depends on the quality of mutton, or more precisely, the type of goat used. Meat of a hilly goat will taste different from one that has grazed on grass; meat of a goat fed on herbs is dark, as is the case of mutton in Champaran. The cooking time for a goat weighing six to seven kilograms is about an hour, during which the pot has to be tossed six to seven times.Mohan Thakur, a food connoisseur from Sitamarhi in Bihar, says that migrant workers from the villages of North Bihar brought the dish to Patna. It was not sophisticated food made in the kitchens of zamindars, and thats why it had not received the kind of exposure it has now found. The farm hands or labourers generally marinated the mutton with whatever spices they had, mixing all ingredients with the meat and cooking it over slow charcoal or wood fire. It is a hearty, thick and strong curry, not subtle but forceful.Babloo Roy recalls eating it in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, prepared on wood fire. He remembers an earthy taste that is absent when the dish is cooked in a pressure cooker on a gas stove. After cooking on high heat, it is left to stew for a long time on doused charcoal. This slow cooking tenderises the meat and allows it to soak in the spices.Puja Sahu, who runs Potbelly, a chain of Bihari cuisine restaurants in New Delhi, says the ahuna mutton is marinated in a mix of ghee and mustard oil, with whole spices, along with onions, garlic and ginger paste. The cooking pot is sealed and tossed frequently in the one-hour cooking time.In a richer version, it was called batlohi mutton and cooked in a bell metal pot, much the same way, but enriched with spices and dry fruits. But even as a discussion on its origin and evolution rages, it is evident that the Champaran curry began as the poor mans party fare."

The Delhi government claimed that NAFED has currently proposed to sell onions at Rs 60 per kg in the city.In his letter, Hussain alleged that NAFED had stopped supply of onions in the city, saying it will only be able to make the bulb available to the Delhi government only after procuring adequate stock from the markets in Rajasthans Alwar or dipping into supplies that are to arrive from Egypt, in December.High onion prices even saw governments topple in the national capital in the years gone by, and the AAP knows full well that the spiralling rates of the kitchen staple could soon result in public anger and increasing attacks from opposition, months ahead of the Assembly elections.Department of Consumers in letter dated November 23, 2019, has also informed that the onion can be made available for five days after the scheduled date of arrival at the estimated cost of Rs 60.This is too high and the people will not be able to afford if onions were supplied at such a high price. Government should not be seen as doing business with profit motive over an essential commodity. In view of this, there is immediate need to review the matter and activate the price stabilisation fund mechanism under which onion was earlier being supplied to Delhi, read Hussains letter to Paswan.AAP didnt demand onion supply: BJPThe state BJP unit accused the Arvind Kejriwal government on Thursday of not making any demand for supply of onion from the Centre, and claimed that the ruling AAP was trying to politically exploit the high prices of the kitchen staple in the upcoming Assembly polls.The Kejriwal government cancelled an order of four truckloads of daily onion supply in the first week of October, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said in a tweet."

Top-grade onions from the summer stocks are being sold at 120 a kg in Mysuru.The sky-rocketing prices of onion are making homemakers shed tears and shops have witnessed 50% to 60% drop in sales.Some traders said the prices are unlikely to become stable with fresh supplies from Maharashtra, one of the largest producers, yet to start. The fresh arrivals may take at least 15 to 20 days and the prices may continue to be on the higher side until the fresh supplies hit the markets.With substantial drop in sales, HOPCOMS has cut down its procurement from the wholesale markets. Sales have dropped by 50% to 60% in our outlets alone across Mysuru, and therefore procurement has been cut to half. It is difficult for us to keep stock without sales. Onions are sold at 115 a kg in our outlets, said Datta, manager, HOPCOMS, Mysuru.He told The Hindu that HOPCOMS supplies veggies to many government institutions and hostels besides the Mysuru zoo. Despite the sharp rise in price, the supplies to these places have not been affected as they have asked us to continue with the same quantity. But the sales in our outlets have dropped.

Some qualities of garlic, however, still remained Rs 250 a kg. Prices of several vegetables have become unaffordable to the common man since Cyclone Bulbul struck. While prices of brinjal, peas, capsicum and cauliflower have dipped in the past couple of days, there are other vegetables, which have become almost out of reach of many. Spring onion, drumsticks and beans are selling for Rs 100 and above a kilogram. Carrot prices had gone up till Rs 130 per kg but the rates are now, on a decline, but still they hover around Rs 100 a kg. Ginger has touched Rs 100 a kg and garlic has been selling for Rs 225-Rs 250 a kg, said Rabindranath Koley, member of the chief ministers task force for monitoring vegetable prices.Capsicum, a winter vegetable, now costs Rs 70 a kg, after witnessing a higher rate of Rs 100-Rs 110 around 10 days ago. This, when the vegetable usually sold for Rs 25 a kg previous winters. Similar is the case with cauliflowers. Three medium-sized cauliflowers could be bought for Rs 25 even last winter but this time, the price touched Rs 45 apiece. Around 10 days ago, each sold for Rs 60.Vegetable prices first skyrocketed earlier this month, after Cyclone Bulbul struck, cutting off supply from South 24 Parganas, the biggest supplier of perishables and vegetables to the city. Sources in the government pointed out the prices shot up as Bengal had been depending on the supply from other states, where crops had also taken a hit.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee intervened, instructing cops to visit the markets to stop hoarding and other malpractices. Prices of some vegetables, like cauliflower, peas, eggplant, cabbage , ladys fingers, have dipped marginally compared to that a week ago. Even the supply has increased, said Dilip Kumar Mondal, secretary of shop owners association at Gariahat market.But residents are not convinced by the claim of a dip in prices. Vegetables become affordable in winter but this year, they are on fire. The household budget has almost doubled, said Aparajita Mukherjee, a resident of Tollygunge."
2019-11-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-its-alkaline-it-must-be-khaar/article30116273.ece,If it’s alkaline it must be khaar,"Such a humble dish, khaar, yet so addictive, and a defining one for the Assamese. Simple to make, with ingredients that are easily available around the house, khaars had with rice. It has a unique taste that is neither salty nor umami, but alkaline.Both the dish and the taste are called khaar. This taste comes through the addition of a particular ingredient. This khaar agent is of two different kinds, which I would call the traditional and the contemporary. And thereby hangs the tale of khaar in my home.From father to kidsMy father worked in different countries, my mother set up home in all of them, with us siblings in tow. And though schools, textbooks and friends changed, the one constant was the food that ma churned out. True, the local cuisine invariably left its mark on her cooking. But there was rice, perhaps a fish or meat curry, dal and a vegetable for many of the meals.My father, though, was a khaar aficionado. Having grown up in a Sattra, a monastery-like religious and socio-cultural institution associated with the Vaishnavites, he was used to eating it, and he passed on his love of khaar to us, the children. I remember the cavernous kitchens of the Sattra, with its earthen wood-fired fireplaces and mud-wiped floors, where something or the other always seemed to be bubbling in the vast iron kerahis.On a normal day, there would be around 30 people for a meal, many more during festivals. There were professional cooks, baputis, who did both the daily and the ceremonial cooking, though I also remember my grandmother going in to cook sometimes. She would discard the mekhela sador she was wearing, and after a bath, don one of the two red saris that were kept specifically in the kitchen for her. This was customary.A lot of fishIt was the taste of the khaar she cooked that had my father hooked for life. Which was strange, because there were so many other things that those kitchens turned out  fish fresh from the pond; turtle meat curry; pigeon with pepper; duck cooked with ash gourd. Venison, too, and, of course, lots of goat meat, but no chicken. The turtle gave me a severe allergy, but I relished the fish, which my cousins hauled out of the ponds with shouts of joy and triumph. They tasted of the pond and the earth, and I loved them.But it was the khaar that pita, my father, missed the most.Craving itThe problem was that ma did not come from a khaar-eating family. She was from Dhubri, where the food traditions are different. The food that came out of my Dhubri grandmothers kitchen was what a Brahmin widow would be allowed to eat those days. Vegetarian, of course, with no hint of onion or garlic. But she treated us, her grandchildren, to delicious discs of crunchily fried sesame held together with rice flour, and payox, kheer, that was sweetened with nolen gur and served in stone bowls. There was a separate non-veg kitchen too where meats and fish were cooked. No chicken though  that was taboo.And never khaar. Dhubri shares many traditions, including culinary ones, with neighbouring Bengal and Bangladesh. And khaar is something that is not seen there. One encounters khaar in a variety of forms as one goes more to the east. Some variants of this dish are popular among the ethnic communities of the hill states of the Northeast. Mizorams bai, for instance, though more watery than khaar, has a tinge of the same taste. Alkaline.Ma learnt how to make it quickly enough. Its not difficult. Like most Assamese fare, it does not require spices. It was that other Assamese dish, the tangy fish tenga, that she never mastered. I fell in love with it after my marriage to a family from eastern Assam, where it is a staple. And when I went back to mas kitchen on visits, I cooked tenga for them. But they never acquired a taste for it.Burnt flavourTraditionally, the agent that brings in the khaar taste is made by burning the peels of a particular kind of banana, and then distilling the ashes. But the faster way is to use baking soda. There is perhaps a slight difference in taste, but I dont really notice it. But it mattered to pita. Wherever he was, he would experiment with different kinds of bananas found in those places, roasting the peels to make khaar. But it never really worked, and he had to be content with baking soda.Pitas search for the perfect khaar, though, does have a happy ending. These days, bottled essence of banana peel ash is available commercially. Ma would use that to make khaar, and he would relish it as much as he had in his Sattra dining hall. He also loved the khaar in my marital home, my mother-in-law being an expert khaar maker.Her specialities were the delicious tenga she made with elephant apple and fish, and the khaar, always for lunch, never dinner, made with the leftover prasad of chickpeas and mung after a puja in the house. Khaar and tenga, however could never be served together. Her khaar was something I looked forward to, and though I make it myself now, that flavour that came from the touch of her hands is missing.Sunday recipeOmita (green papaya) khaarFor kol khaar (khaar made of banana peels)Use the peel of the bheem kol banana. Sun-dry the peel, then roast on flame. Dunk it overnight in a bowl of about two cups of water and strain. Discard the peel and ash, keep the water. Half a cupful of the freshly made liquid is needed. Or, use bicarbonate of soda  half a tsp.IngredientsGreen papaya  peeled, with the seeds removed and cut into medium-sized cubes (about two cups)Grated ginger  approx a tspTwo fresh green chilliesSalt to tasteMustard seeds  approx a tspMustard oil  two tbsp, and a little extra to drizzle over the finished khaarWater  one cupMethod1. In a kerahi, heat the oil till it is smoking. Throw in the mustard seeds, lower the flame and cover till the crackling stops.2. Add the green chillies and the papaya. Stir, add the ginger and salt.3. Add enough water to cover the papaya cubes.4. Sprinkle the soda, and cook till the water decreases and the papaya is a soft mush.5. Sprinkle raw mustard oil before serving for added pungency.The writer is a novelist, short story writer and translator whose latest book is A Full Nights Thievery."

They pilloried the states BJP-led three-party coalition government for failing to give relief to the people.Congress MLA Rekibuddin Ahmed said the state governments silence on the issue was its admission that it had failed to check the price.ALSO READ: GDP growth slumps to six-year low of 4.5 per cent in second quarterLater, he told journalists outside the Assembly building: While replying to a query, the government said the wholesale price of one quintal onion ranges between Rs.6500-Rs.7200 and the retail price is Rs.71-Rs.80 a kg. So, the government admitted that it has failed to curb the price.This is for the first time in Assam that the retail price of onions has touched Rs.100 a kg. Till a fortnight ago, onion was sold at Rs.60 a kg in the state.The traders in Guwahatis Fancy Bazar, which supplies essential commodities to most parts of the Northeast, said the lack of supply, as a result of heavy rains in major onion-growing states, was the reason behind the rising price. The sale, according to them, has dropped by nearly 50 per cent."

Shopkeepers are apprehensive the prices may shoot up further while many families have avoided the use of onion in their meals.Some hoteliers have stopped supplying Irulli Dosa (onion dosa) as the prices have gone up, while some other have reduced the quantity of the vegetable in other food items, president of All Karnataka Pradesh Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association Chandrashekhar Hebbar told PTI.He, however, was optimistic that the shortage of onion in the market is for a short-term and said the situation would be better after a month or so.It is usual that whenever there are floods in Maharashtra and parts of northern Karnataka, onion supply is hit because those regions produce the vegetable on a large scale, said Hebbar.Another hotelier Vasudev Adiga said his hotel chain per se has not reduced the quantity of onion and has decided to bear the extra burden caused by soaring prices.However, his hotel chain has decided to introduce some innovative items, which require less onions. We will introduce new items using less costly items. It will bring a new taste to our customers, Adiga said.In a lighter vein, Adiga said innovators usually take advantage of a situation like this and come up with alternative solutions.That's the way innovation happens, Adiga explained. He too said the current phase of onion shortage is for a short duration, as the government has decided to import the vegetable"

The truck was later found, but devoid of its precious cargo. With prices touching Rs 130 a kilo in local markets, it is no wonder why the vehicle was targeted. Despite a slew of measures announced by the Narendra Modi government,prices have been soaring across the country.From Islamabad to Dhaka and beyond, onions produced in the fields of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have been much in demand. The international demand, however, has not brought much cheer to the onion producers in the villages, who have been hit hard by natural causes in two consecutive years. The previous years drought and the delayed monsoon coupled with the late unseasonal rains have spelt the death knell for the onion producers.Mirror breaks down the reasons behind the onion getting dearer by the day.The Lasalgaon market in Nashik, the countrys largest wholesale market, has seen a dip in the daily produce. The daily stock at the market has come down from the usual 15,000 quintals to 2,400 quintals. Most of the produce that is coming to the market is the Rabi crop (sown between October-November and harvested in April). The rabi crop cultivation in Maharashtra declined from 3.54 lakh hectares in 2017-18 to 2.66 lakh hectares in 2018-19.The, which are sown at the beginning of the rainy season, was affected by the unseasonal rains that hit Maharashtra as well as other onion-producing states this year.The unseasonal rain not just destroyed the crop but has also delayed the next crop. The situation is likely to remain so till the end of December, said an official at the Lasalgaon market. Adding to the problem is the fact that the Kharif and late-Kharif crops have greater moisture content and cannot be stored, unlike the Rabi crop.The wholesale price at Lasalgaon on Friday was between Rs 60-Rs 65 per kg though by the time the onion bulbs reached Andheri on Friday, a kilogram was being sold at Rs 130.The government has restricted the onion stock at 500 quintals for wholesellers and 100 quintals for retailers, but there are fears of massive hoarding. Earlier this month, Income Tax officials raided more than 10 traders in Nashik for violation of these restrictions. There is a shortage of onions which cannot be denied. But the stock available is being hoarded and released sporadically, says Vijay Patil, an onion trader from Nashik.The situation has not improved despite the arrival of 2,500 tonnes of onion imported from Egypt. Another 6,090 tonnes are expected to arrive in Mumbai in early December.The government steps in In June, the Narendra Modi government decided to scrap the 10 per cent subsidy that was given to exporters. Later the minimum export price was raised to $850 per tonne, which was followed by a complete ban on exports in September. In the 2018-19 fiscal, India exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onion. This year, the figure has dipped, hurting the farmers-traders who target the international market. The export ban is likely to remain till February unless the domestic situation improves. , India has decided to continue with its export of 100,000 tonnes of onion bulbs to Maldives, which is dependent on India for all essential commodities.Onions gave the Bangladesh government another reason to be peeved with India, after the contentious Teesta water-sharing issue. The Indian governments decision to ban export of onions has hit its eastern neighbour, and the prime ministers kitchen too.We are facing some trouble over onion. I dont know why you have banned export of onion. Prior information would have been beneficial for us, we could have procured from other countries, Bangladesh Prime Ministersaid at a meet of the Indo-Bangladesh Business Forum in early October. On a lighter vein, she added, So I asked our cook to stop using onions. After India banned exports, Bangladesh has been forced to import the bulb from, Turkey, China and Egypt."

The retail price is over Rs 100/kg, while the wholesale rate is Rs 60-90/kg. Market experts said prices will remain high till mid-December with the expected arrival of full supply of kharif crop.With only 60-65 truckloads of onions arriving at the wholesale yard daily from Karnataka, Gujarat and other parts of Maharashtra, it has created a huge gap between supply and demand. Demand for Mumbai market is 100-130 truckloads, but supply has dwindled to half.Delay in arrival of a new crop and damage due to post-monsoon showers reflected in the price rise.On Friday, old onions sold for Rs 80-90/ kg in wholesale, while the price of the new crop was Rs 60-70/kg. In the retail market, old onions sold for Rs 100-120 and new onions for Rs 80-100. Wholesale traders said they have never experienced such a price hike and dip in supplies in 50 years.For the last few days, Mumbai received 60-70 truckloads daily. It seems insufficient for a huge market like the Mumbai metropolitan region. Egyptian onions did not help subsidise prices and are unpopular among households due to their shape and size, though favoured by restaurants. Gujarat onions have dominated the market now, said Ashok Walunj, a trader.Shortfall in onion supply from areas of Maharashtra after post-monsoon showers damaged the crop led to the spike in wholesale and retail prices at markets in Mumbai. Prior to Diwali, onions were priced Rs 34-37/kg in wholesale, and Rs 40-50/ kg in retail.Traders said the price will continue to escalate for at least a fortnight till the fresh crop hits the market."

But when it comes to pork, alls fair in love, war  and food. In Delhi, pork is usually served in Chinese eateries, and in some high-end restaurants. But its not easy to find regional dishes such as Goas Sorpotel or the Coorgi Pandhi Curry.One of the first to offer a variety of pork dishes was a restaurant in Connaught Place called Mosaic, which shut many years ago, and later took some of its dishes to the YWCA Kitchen on Parliament Street. But thats been closed for a while, too.To cut a long story short, it was my fondness for pork that propelled me towards a restaurant called Mustard Seed. As it happened, a friend had sent a message saying that the restaurant at Assam Bhavan (called Baankaahi) had moved to the Uphaar Cinema Market. I was looking for that on the internet when I suddenly came across an eatery called Mustard Seed in the same market. To my surprise, it turned out to be the very same. The people who ran Baankaahi had now opened this. Whats more, they were the very people who were behind Mosaic and the YWCA Kitchen. To top it, a group of old friends of mine had all gathered there one afternoon for lunch  and said they'd had a great meal. So, that very evening, I found myself at Mustard Seed (011-40072565 and 9999459462).The menu has various kinds of dishes from across the country and elsewhere and quite a few pork preparations. The starters include East Indias much loved Mochar Chop (prepared with banana flower florets, 325), Thai Fish Cake (400 for full, 250 for half) and Pork Khorika (a variation of Pork Satay, 400 for full and 250 for half).Among the entrees are Kosha Mangsho (475/300), Alkas Mutton Curry (a Bhagalpur speciality, 475/300), Pork Dos Noing (Khasi pork with black sesame gravy, 400/250), Puducherry Chicken Curry (475/300), Dahi Fish (350/200), Seafood Sizzler (prawns, squids, fish, corn, salad, garlic mashed potatoes, 600) and Pork Sorpotel (500). The tea plantation specials include Shepherds Pie (475), Chicken Potpie (425), Fish and Chips (500), Vegetable Cutlets (350) and Vegetable Potpie (240).We were in a hurry and did not want an elaborate meal. So we asked for an Assamese non-vegetarian thali (450), a dish called Paas Torkari (a mix of five vegetables, 325), Fried Pork (345/250 for half) and Cocktail Mutton Chops (400/250).The pork came first, and was superb. It consisted of thin slices (with fat on the side, I was happy to note) fried with onions and bell peppers and what the menu described as a special sauce. I loved its piquant taste, complemented by the sweet touch of the onions and peppers. The mutton chops consisted of minced meat that had been crumbed and fried to perfection.The thali was as grand as it looked: rice at the centre, with a fried brinjal (beguni), a bowl of Mung Dal, Posto-Aloo (poppy seeds with potatoes), Tenga Fish (an Assamese preparation), khar (a digestive), Aloo Pitkia (mashed potatoes) and Gur Ka Kheer. The Paas Torkari was a delicious mix of carrots, beans, spinach, capsicum and potatoes, cooked lightly with just a sprinkling of spices.I love Aloo Pitikaand this had been nicely sharpened with mustard oil and green chillies. The dal  roasted and then cooked with peaswas superb. I didnt have the fish, but was told it was nice and tangy. And the kheer was finger licking good.Mindful of a friends comment that I seldom have a word of criticism, I thought hard about what I didnt like. I realised what it was. In front of me was a wall TV, and on it was an anchor who gives me nightmares. Thats one way of curbing ones appetite!But it was truly a great meal. And I felt as if I had found an old friend.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

It is this unholy nexus, which is responsible for the rising onion prices in the country. Our government was selling onions at Rs 23.90 per kg at fair price shops. To stop this, the central government increased the wholesale price of onion from Rs 15 per kg to Rs 60 per kg. It was unmoved as 32,000 tonnes of onion rotted away at government godowns,"" Singh said.Over the last few days, the going rate of onions in several parts of the city has been between Rs 80 and Rs 100 per kg. While the AAP is wary of the issue resulting in public anger just months ahead of the Assembly polls, the Opposition is keen to cash in on it.Earlier, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had accused the Centre of stopping supply of onions at subsidised rates in the city. The BJP hit back, with MPs Vijay Goel and Meenakshi Lekhi holding a protest on Friday demanding that the Delhi government stop exploiting the issue for political advantage and reduce onion prices at the earliest.On Thursday, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Imran Hussain wrote to Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, seeking his intervention in ensuring steady supply of onions from the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India. ""When a farmer goes to sell his onion produce to the market he is paid Rs 2 to Rs 3 for every kilogram. Hoarders and black marketeers buy the produce at this price and later release it a premium rate of Rs 100 per kg,"" Singh alleged."

Traders have warned that the present price trend was likely to continue till December end when both imported and domestic onions hit the market.Since September, bulb prices have been on the rise following a sharp decline in sowing due to the ongoing drought in the main-onion growing districts of Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, etc. The crisis peaked in the last few weeks as the expected arrival of the new Kharif crop, which was slated to hit the markets from October onwards, suffered heavy losses due to the unseasonal rainfall in the last two weeks of October.In its October report, the Ministry of Agriculture had referred to standing crop losses in Madhya Pradesh (58 per cent), Karnataka (18 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (2 per cent). Maharashtra, too, suffered losses due to the unseasonal rainfall.On Monday, the average traded price of onion in Punes Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) was around Rs 9,000-10,000 per quintal. The spike in the wholesale market was reflected in the retail markets with most organised retailers selling the bulb at Rs 120-150 per kg.Last week, bulb price stood at Rs 75-80 per kg in the city. Onion price had breached the Rs 100 per kg mark in Pune around five years ago, traders said.Meanwhile, at Lasalgaons wholesale market in Niphad taluka of Nashik district average traded price of onion touched all-time high of Rs 7,100 per quintal on the day. In neighbouring Kalvan market, the bulb traded at Rs 9,500 per quintal. The trend was more or less similar across Nashik, with onion trading around Rs 7,000-9,000 per quintal. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market said the present trend is mostly due to the dip in arrivals. As against the 30,000-40,000 quintals of daily arrival in December, the Lasalgaons market is reporting just around 10,000-15,000 quintals per day, he said.At Vashis wholesale market, in Navi Mumbai, around 10,000 quintals of onion had arrived on Monday with wholesale prices hovering around Rs 100 per kg. Rajendra Shelke, commission agent at the market, said, The current trend will continue till the new crop arrives later in January.To quell the onion prices, the central government has recently allowed for imports, especially from Turkey and Egypt.

Onions, which used to come for less than Rs 50 a kilo, are now coming at no less than Rs 80 per kilo. In fact, I had to purchase these (pointing towards his midriff) for Rs 100 per kg, Ram claimed.He also attacked the Nitish Kumar government in the state for his empty promises of setting up stalls where the staple vegetable would be available for a price as low as Rs 35 per kg.I am yet to see any such stall. I am going inside the House wearing this mala (garland) as I want the honorable chief minister to behold this sight. I hope that it would compel him to take some serious action. It is my demand that the government provide onions to the poor for Rs 10 per kg, Ram told reporters before walking inside the premises.It was not clear as to whether the legislator got an opportunity to present himself, as desired, before the Chief Minister who had not arrived in the House during the pre-lunch session."

The legislator from the Mariani assembly constituency was protesting against the Assam governments alleged move to sell off Nagaon and Cachar Paper Mills, Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizer Corporation Ltd, Halmari Tea Estate in Dibrugarh and Ailabari Tea Estate in Karimganj.Kurmi, who justified his act saying he was furious with the privatisation attempt, wrote on the paper in Assamese: The honour and future of Assamese people would not be allowed to be sold off in the name of Jati, Mati, Bheti (community, land and base) and Joi Aai Asom (glory to mother Assam). While sitting on the ground during the protest, he slit his left hand, finished the poster with his right, and showed it to everyone before being taken into custody by assembly security personnel.Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami criticised Kurmi for this nonsense and childish act, and reminded him of assembly decorum. How can you ignore assembly ethics when you are a three-time MLA? Proper action will be taken, Goswami said, while he also ordered a probe and held an emergency meeting with the leader of the opposition and parliamentary affairs minister in the state on the issue.Kurmi had on a previous occasion protested against the rise in prices of onions by wearing a garland made of the vegetable and lying at the entrance of the House.Speaking to News18, Guwahati police commissioner Deepak Kumar said his department will take steps after discussions with the Speaker.Leader of the opposition Debabrata Saikia distanced the Congress from Kurmis act, which he termed personal and outrageous.""We support the cause but this was not at all acceptable. We have taken up the security issue with the Speaker, he said. How can someone enter here with a sharp object and inflict injury when there is assured tight security for elected representatives? Why was he not stopped by on-duty police? There is a serious lacuna in assembly security.Kurmi said his protest was because thousands of employees of the enterprises in Assam are going hungry due to non-payment of salaries for the last three months.The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) last month ordered the liquidation of the Nagaon and Cachar paper mills after the central government refused to release Rs 98 lakh that Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited (HPCL) owed to Alloys and Metals (India) as payment for raw materials the latter supplied to the two paper mills.Kurmi was taken for primary medical treatment and later joined the assembly session with a bandaged hand.(With PTI inputs)Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

On Monday, it reached an all-time high of Rs 10,180 per quintal at Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard, the highest in the history of the market since its inception. Officials say that the price may touch Rs 15,000 per quintal at the market in the coming days.Damage of onion crops in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and other States in the recent floods is the reason behind the unusual price rise. With non-availability of onion in the neighbouring States, Kurnool onion merchants are exporting them to these States and Nepal.Around 4,000 quintals of onion from various parts of the district have been arriving at the market in a day for the past one month. Around 80 per cent of arrivals in Kurnool are exported to other areas, Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard secretary R Vijaya Lakshmi said. She stated that if they receive 4,000 quintals of onion, nearly 3,200 quintals will be exported to other States. ""This price hike may continue till December-last,"" she said.According to officials, this year, onion sowing was less compared to last year. While onion was cultivated in 32,000 hectares in the district last year, this year it was only 25,000 hectares, officials said. Assistant Director of Horticulture department B Raghunath Reddy said that Kurnool is the largest producer of onion in the State followed by Kadapa and Anantapur.ALSO READ| Onion shortage hits hard in Krishna district of Andhra PradeshThe farmers of Kurnool district are fortunate this year. With crop damages in Karnataka, Maharashtra and other States, all have to depend on Kurnool Agriculture Market. Presently, a kg of onion is being sold at Rs 101.80, based on wholesale rate, at the Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard, he said.While all vegetables are being sold at Rs 40- 60 per kg, onion prices touch Rs 120 per kg in retail markets, wholesale vegetable vendor P Hanumantharao Chowdary said.Chowdary said that anticipating similar trend, retailers may resort to hoarding. The vegetable prices have gone up. There is not much of a difference in the number of customers as vegetables, especially onion, are necessary for everyday needs, but regular customers buy lesser quantity, Chowdary added.B Srilatha, a resident of Udyoganagar, said that the increase in prices has caused lot of problems. Onion is being sold at Rs 100 to Rs140 per kg in the retail markets, K Viswanath, a customer, said.D Naveen Gupta, a supermarket owner, said: Inflation has not only hit buyers, but also sellers. We stock vegetables, but customers are purchasing them in small quantities now. Sometimes, a lot of edibles get stale in the shop. Now, people purchase vegetables in grams instead of kilograms, he said and added that even hotels and Bajji centres, are not supplying/offering onion to customers.Teary Facts"

2019-12-04,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/dec/04/the-king-size-plate-of-indian-breakfast-2071069.html,The king-size plate of Indian Breakfast,"Neelanjana Singh By""Indian food is terrible and we pretend it isnt,"" reads a recent tweet by American academic Tom Nichols. This statement set off a war on Twitter, and it was interesting to read the variety of responses that followed.Comments ranged from accusing Nichols of lacking taste buds to some offering to cook for him, yet some others pointing him to the restaurants that serve good Indian food. One among these responses explained to Nichols that it was pointless to lump all the diverse cuisines of India into one category. This remark got me thinking about our truly diverse breakfast menus.While it is perfectly possible for someone to dislike the Indian cuisine, it would surprise me if there isnt at least one thing for everyone in our very eclectic breakfast menu. Breakfast options in the west typically include eggs, toast, meats and coffee or tea, but the Indian breakfast menu happens to be far more extensive. Some may argue that the west offers pancakes, waffles and french toast, while we have puris, parathas and kachoris, hence there is little difference.The difference, however, is in how we combine a variety of flavours and incorporate seasonality and region-specific foods into our breakfast menu. In the winter months, parathas are a hot favourite for breakfast in north India. These parathas are almost always stuffed with gobi, mooli or methi. When these veggies go out of season, the quintessential onion or ajwain ki roti/paratha takes over. This is usually eaten with dahi as an accompaniment, which is a perfect combination in terms of taste and nutrition.The breakfast menu in Rajasthan includes millet preparations such as bajra rotis, eaten with pickles made from veggies grown in that region. Venture southwards and the options change to idli, dosa, vada, upma and appams, which are all-time favorites. The millet that finds favour in these parts is ragi.Ragi goes into the preparation of almost all kinds of foods in the region, including dosa. Pittu, another popular dish in the south, is made with rice and coconut, and is eaten with a curry made from chickpea (Kadala curry). The western part of India has a range of completely different breakfast options  thepla, khakra, rotla, poha, dhokla and sabudana preparations.In east India, sattu reigns supreme in various forms  as a sweet or savoury drink or stuffed in roti/paratha. Another staple breakfast food here is dahi-chidwa. The beaten rice is softened by washing and soaking it briefly in water and eating it with dahi. To this, one could add either jaggery or spices and salt for flavour.Interestingly, certain dishes that are popular across all these regions are found under different names. Cheela made with moong dal or besan, paired with chutney, dahi or pickle, is one such dish. Similarly, porridge prepared with different grains (broken wheat/amaranth/vermicelli) is a popular breakfast food in all parts of India. Breakfast continues to be the most important meal of the day, and the extensive Indian menu gives us little reason to skip it."

The prices of these kitchen staples have touched Rs 130 and Rs 140 per kilogram, respectively overnight, burning a hole in the pockets of the public. Households, hotels and traders are equally affected in this dire situation.Vegetable vendor at Palayam market,, Arjunan, said: Vegetables were brought by borrowing money. When lenders demand the loaned money, we have no choice but to request them to take the unsold onions and shallots. A few vendors have even stopped selling onions because of the alarming prices which detract consumers.Jaleel, owner of Chala Friends Hotel, Chalai, said that onions cant be substituted. Even if we use cabbage instead of onions, it will only result in making the curry stale within a few hours. Jaleel also strongly believes that small-scale hotel owners are the ones who suffer the most under this dilemma. Rajan, a snack shop chef at East Fort, said that they have stopped making onion fritters (ulli vada) due to the price hike."

Anil Sharma My spine, neck and head stronger. Anil SharmaA DAY after his release from jail, Congress leader P Chidambaram launched an aggressive attack against the Centre on the state of the economy, saying that the BJP-led government was clueless and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had left it to his ministers to indulge in bluff and bluster.Asked about his 106 days in prison, he said: Sleeping on a wooden board without a pillow strengthens your neck, spine and back. My spine is stronger, my neck is stronger and my head is stronger. He refused to comment on the cases against him, saying the matter was sub-judice, but added that my record as minister and my conscience are absolutely clear.The Supreme Courts clear and comprehensive order, granting him bail in the INX Media case, would clear the many layers of dust that have unfortunately settled on our understanding of criminal law and the manner in which criminal law has been administered by our courts, he said.Addressing a press conference, the former Finance Minister focussed on the economy instead. Nothing sums up the state of the economy better than the GDP growth figures for the last six quarters  8, 7, 6.6, 5.8, 5 and 4.5, he said. We will be lucky to end the year if growth touches 5 per cent, he said.Even after seven months into the fiscal year, the BJP government believes that the problems faced by the economy are cyclical, he said. Calling the government wrong and clueless, Chidambaram said it was unable to look for the obvious clues because it is stubborn and mulish in defending its catastrophic mistakes like demonetisation, flawed GST, tax terrorism, regulatory overkill, protectionism, and centralised control of decision-making in the PMO.He said Modi has been unusually silent on the economy, and left it to his ministers to indulge in bluff and bluster. The net result, as The Economist put it, is that the government has turned out to be an incompetent manager of the economy, he said.Criticising the government for calling the slowdown cyclical, he said, Thank God, they have not called it seasonal. It is structural and the government has no solutions or reforms that would address the structural problems, he said, adding that he wasnt sure if the government understands the difference between cyclical and structural.Rural consumption is down, according to NSSO. Rural wages are down. Producer prices are down, especially for farmers. Daily wage earners get work for no more than 15 days a month. Demand for MGNREGA is up. FMCG, both durable and non-durable, are selling less. Wholesale prices are up. CPI is going up. Onions sell at Rs 100 a kg, he said.Earlier in the day, Chidambaram joined the Opposition protest outside Parliament against the rising onion prices. Asked to comment on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharamans comment that her family doesnt eat onions, he quipped, does she eat avocado?At the press conference, Chidambaram said: I was not sarcastic, I was quoting her. They should have planned in advance, what is the point of importing (onions) now? When will they arrive? But if the Finance Minister says I dont eat onions, that shows the mindset of this government.There is less demand among the people because they have less money and less appetite to consume due to uncertainty and fear, said Chidambaram. People dont want to buy because they have less money and they have less confidence about the future, he said.He also pointed out that the RBI had reduced its (GDP growth) forecast from 7.4 per cent in February 2019, to 7.2 per cent in April 2019, to 6.1 per cent a month ago, and 5 per cent today. Saying this was unprecedented, he said the RBI was either completely incompetent in making its first assessment in February 2019 or the government has been extremely incompetent in managing the economy in the last eight months.He said the BJP governments idea of reforms was that GDP is irrelevant, protection is good, personal Income Tax must be cut, Customs duty must be increased, and this is the way to make India strong. The economy can be brought out of the slowdown, he said, but this government is incapable of doing that.Responding to a question, he said: Global slowdown is responsible to the extent that it affects our exports, but exports are only one of the four drivers of the economy the other three are entirely the responsibility of the Indian government.In his opening remarks, Chidambaram said that as he breathed the air of freedom after being released, his first thought and prayers were for the 75 lakh people of the Kashmir Valley who have been denied their basic freedoms since August 4. Saying that he was particularly concerned about the political leaders who have been detained without charges, he said, freedom is indivisible: if we must preserve our freedom, we must fight for their freedom.He said he intended to visit J&K, if the government allowed him to do so.As far as Kashmir is concerned, the reason is arrogance, he said, calling the Centres decision ill-thought out, ill-founded, ill-intention design and policy to suppress the basic freedoms of the people. In the case of the economy, he said, it is simply ignorance and incompetence.Regarding industrialist Rahul Bajajs comment at an event last week, Chidambaram said there is complete fear everywhereEvery institution is gripped by fear and the media is no exception. With Home Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal listening, Bajaj had expressed concern over the lack of confidence among corporates to criticise the central government.Chidambaram also supported the protest against a fee hike in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the Indian Institute of Mass Communication. In a welfare state, he said, higher education should be totally free, and if that is not possible, we must only charge reasonable fees. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

However, the measures lay forgotten as Indians on social media and off it latched on to a another statement made my the minister - that she comes from a family that does not consume as much onions or garlic.In response to a question posed by NCP MP Supriya Sule in Lok Sabha, Sitharaman said, ""I don't eat much of onion and garlic.

MPs are of the view that it is not appropriate,"" said BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy, a member of the business advisory committee.Out of the total subsidy of Rs 17 crore, currently Rs 14 crore is availed by Parliament staff and others who visit the premises while Rs 3 crore is by MPs.As per the subsidised rates, a plate of vegetarian 'thali' costs Rs 30, while non-veg 'thali' costs Rs 60 in the Parliament canteen. As per sources, the price of meals is likely to at least double  a plate of biryani, which now costs Rs 56, will be at least Rs 112 after the move.The subsidised rate card.Screenshots of the rate card have been shared widely on social media in recent days during protests against a fee hike in Jawaharlal Nehru University, with many questioning why MPs get to enjoy subsidy when students are being made to shell out more.There are currently five canteens in the Parliament complex run by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). Sources said now the IRCTC will fix the price of each item, calibrating it with the steep onion prices and submit the same to the Lok Sabha Secretariat, which will then take a final call.(With inputs from PTI)Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

I condemn this approach, she added.Chidambaram, who was the home minister in the UPA-2 government then, had chided the urban middle class for bemoaning soaring prices of fuel and essential commodities.Now the ruling BJP finds itself heading towards the same situation as the Congress did at the time. Inflation has crept up in the last few months, adding to the woes of a slowing economy.This has reflected the most in the prices of onions, which have skyrocketed in the past couple of weeks. The kitchen staple is being sold for Rs 100 per kg in most places and prices even touched Rs 150-180 in some states due to supply shortage.Yet during a debate on the issue of the price rise, Sitharaman made the tone-deaf remark that she or her family does not eat onions. ""I don't eat a lot of onions and garlic, so don't worry. I come from a family that doesn't care much about onions and garlic,"" she had said on Wednesday.The statement, which evoked laughter in the Parliament, had come after an MP had intervened and asked the FM if she eats onions while she was answering a question on price rise.Yet, it had sparked backlash outside with many commenting on how out of touch the minister seemed with the needs of the common man. One of the other reasons why Sitharamans remark did not go down well with people is because onion is widely seen as the poor mans vegetable.The Congress also protested outside the Parliament building, demanding an apology. Chidambaram, who at a press conference slammed the Narendra Modi governments handling of the economy, had singled out Sitharaman and asked if she doesnt eat onions, does she eat avocados.

I absolutely condemn this approach,"" she said.Sitharaman again made a reference to the decisions made by Chidambaran as finance minister in UPA-1 when she sought to justify the rollback on higher surcharge levied on foreign portfolio investors in her maiden Budget.Again without naming Chidambaran, she said fringe benefits tax and a tax on high-value cash withdrawal from bank accounts were brought in 2005 only to be ""rolled back"" in 2009 and 2008 respectively.""For drawing money from your accounts, a tax was going to be levied in 2005 and again by a former finance minister who is scholar in economics and talks about finance with great authority, he introduced it,"" she said.The Rajya Sabha approved with voice vote the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019 that replaces the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019, promulgated on September 20, 2019, to cut the base corporate tax rate.The amendment carries a negative list of industries that will not qualify for lower tax rate meant for manufacturing companies set up on or after October 1, 2019 but that begin production before 2023, she said.The negative list includes computer software development, mining, and printing of books as they are not manufacturing per se, the minister added.Sitharaman on September 20 announced lowering of the base corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent for companies that do not seek exemptions, and reduced the rate for some new manufacturing companies to 15 per cent from 25 per cent. Including surcharges and cesses (levies to raise funds for specific purposes), the effective corporate tax rate will drop by nearly 10 percentage points to 25.2 per cent.The corporate tax cut followed other measures by the government to prop up slowing GDP growth adopted since the May general elections. These include efforts to reduce red tape and boost foreign direct investment (FDI), and plans to consolidate the state-owned banks.While replying to a question raised by NCP lawmaker Supriya Sule in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Sitharaman said, ""I don't eat much of onion and garlic. I come from such a family which doesn't have much to do with onion.""Sitharaman made the comment on her eating habits during a debate in the House on onion price rise across the country. Supriya Sule had raised the issue of NPAs and onion farmers.""Why has the production of onion gone down? We export rice and milk and so many other products. Onion grower is a small farmer and he really needs to be protected"", Sule had said.Sitharaman during the reply to the debate on the first batch of supplementary demands for grants for 2019-20 in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday had stated that the government has taken several steps to check rising prices of onion and has initiated steps to improve technology for better storage of the kitchen staple.Prices of onion in many places have crossed Rs 100 per kg.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

(Suvajit Dey) Street vendors have either reduced the amount of onions they use or replaced it entirely with shredded cauliflower. (Suvajit Dey)Written by AmandeepAs onion prices have crossed Rs 100 per kg in Pune, local residents are being forced to cut down on their consumption and ration their purchases. The exorbitant price hike has also hit street food vendors, whose lip-smacking fares now lack the distinctive taste of the kitchen staple.These vendors, whose livelihoods depend on their daily earnings, were the first ones to drop onions from their dishes. They say they will not be able to pass on the hiked price to their customers. Onions have gone conspicuously missing from bhel puri, sev puri and pani puri, street food items which otherwise have a generous amount of the vegetable. Street vendors have either reduced the amount of onions they use or replaced it entirely with shredded cauliflower.Sandeep Bhagal, who runs a pani puri stall at Senapati Bapat Road, said he has stopped buying onions due to the steep rise in prices. But this move, admits Bhagal, has cost him quite a few customers. I used to buy 2-3 kg of onions every day, but have stopped now, he said.Fluctuating for months, onion prices began soaring again after unseasonal rain in Maharashtra, one of the biggest producers of onions in the country, hit production this season. Traders have warned that there no possibility of onion prices falling any time soon, and they may rise further. The Centres decision to import onions has failed to quell the price rise as there is not much demand for imported onions.Even hotels and restaurants are not unaffected by the spike in prices. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association, said, We make gravies that are made of 85 per cent onions. The price rise is a problem. We are curbing the use of onions by only adding them to salads, that too if customers specifically ask for onions, he said.Shagan Lal, who owns a vegetable shop at Law College Road, said the increasing prices have led to lower sales. Our margins are still the same, but the sale has dropped by half. I used to sell over 30 kg every day, now I barely sell 15, he said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The price of onion has touched C140 per kg on Thursday, making it an unaffordable item which has vanished from many a kitchen.With onion prices witnessing a steep rise, many hoteliers have started using cabbage instead of onion in most of the dishes. This has eventually resulted in the hike in the price of cabbage as well.Traders attributed the increased prices of vegetables to the adverse weather in neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu, from where the largest quantity of the commodities is brought to Kerala.The governments decision to import onion from countries like Egypt and Indonesia is likely to bring down the price. However, most of the retailers and wholesalers are apprehensive about the impact of such a move. We are clueless about the distribution criteria and mediator fee if the onion is imported. We do not know how it will affect small-scale businessmen and sellers, said N H Shameed, secretary, Ernakulam Market Merchant Association.In many small and medium level hotels, popular dishes like egg roast and omelette are not available because of the high price of onion. Daily snacks that require onion are not being made in bakeries and food stalls due to the price hike.Another vegetable that has seen a steep increase in price in the last one month is drumstick. To protect the kitchen budget, many people are not buying drumsticks, which is one of the essential items in Malayalis favourite dish aviyal.Hotelier K J Aravind said the people will slightly alter their food habits to accommodate the steep increase in prices.It is a natural trend that we use to witness at the time of price hikes. For instance, instead of egg roast, many hoteliers are now offering egg curry, where the gravy is made out of grated coconut. Likewise, the customers are also now opting for comparatively lower-priced items like bitter gourd, beetroot, snake gourd and pumpkin, he said."

(Express photo/Partha Paul)Slamming the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for economic slowdown in the country, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said only Hindu-Muslim politics will not bring development.Only Hindu-Muslim politics and divide-and-rule policies will not bring development. There is an uncertainty in banking, insurance and industries sectors. The situation in the country is very grim. At a time like this, I dont know if harping on Hindu-Muslim issues will yield any positive result, she said while addressing industrialists at an event here.Let us be united and work for peace and integrity, she said.Banerjee alleged that industrialists, who express their dissent against the policies of the Modi government, are being harassed with the help of the CBI or Enforcement Directorate (ED).Those who express dissent against the central government policies, are kept under scanner, she said, urging the Centre not to interfere unnecessarily in industrial matters. None has the right to get anyone searched by I-T (Income Tax Department), ED and CBI. Harassing industrialists is resulting in recession. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is down. Nobody knows what will happen to the banks tomorrow, she said, adding Ghar me paisa rakho toh notebandi. Bank me paise rakho toh lootbandi (There is note ban if you keep money at home, while it will be looted if you keep it in banks).She told the Centre, Take action against those who are violators (of law). Differentiate between those who commit mistake and those who do not. Many of them (industrialists) have left Indian shores as they are scared.Industrialist Rahul Bajaj recently said the India Inc was afraid of criticising the Centres policies. He found support in Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw who said the government treated India Inc as pariahs and doesnt want to hear any criticism of the economy.About the steep onion prices, Banerjee said inflation was skyrocketing. The price of onion has become Rs 140/kg. The Centre has no control over the rising prices, she stated.Banerjee alleged that the Centre was planning to sell off railways, in the wake of reports that the Union government might outsource commercial and on-board services of a few trains.Inviting industrialists to Bengal, she said the state was growing. Bengal is still doing better. We have kept poverty low there are efforts to run parallel governments in Bengal and Maharashtra (through Raj Bhavans). It is 100 times worse than Maharashtra (in Bengal). My Assembly was adjourned because some Bills were not signed (by the Governor). We did not get consent for discussions (over the Bills).

The case of the police appears to be that all four suspects who were in custody were trying to flee and also attacked the police. Factually, it is difficult to accept this theory for more than one reason. When the accused are being taken out of lockup or prison, they are always taken with adequate guards and under handcuffs. The police team in a case of such gruesome offense would not take chance by inadequately equipping themselves with the weapons. Secondly, assuming that the accused tried to flee, it is settled law that in such a case the escorting policeman is permitted by law to use a firearm, but only to hit them on the lower part of their body.

Meanwhile some of the party members called the police which nabbed him, said Mehra.Vice president of Congress Sevadal Ramesh Goswami said Bisht was shouting slogans, abusing and even misbehaving with women party workers in the group selling onions at Rs 30/kg at towns Buddha Park area when Mehra intervened.I was just trying to calm him down as he was abusing all of us, Mehra concurred before adding, He was definitely a BJP member disrupting our protest by such despicable means.A video of the incident, however, shows Congress members were also pushing and shoving the man who was in an altercation with the group. The video however, doesnt fully capture the events preceding the scuffle.Haldwani police station SHO Vikram Rathore said initial investigation suggested Bisht was either drunk or under the influence of some drugs.A probe is on, he added.BJP district president Pradeep Bisht denied Manish was linked to the BJP.He has nothing to do with our party, he said."

(Express photo/Partha Paul) Onions on sale at a market in Kolkata on Friday. (Express photo/Partha Paul)Onion scarcity will continue for the whole month of December and the situation may only improve by the first week of January, said a member of the Task Force, which was formed by the West Bengal government to check vegetable prices. Vegetable sellers, on the other hand, have refused to sell or stock onions due to fear of incurring loss.I had stocked 6 kg onions, which were not of premium quality. One kilo turned bad. Due to regular loss, I have decided not to sell onions till prices come down to normal, said Ravi Shaw, a vegetable seller at Kestopur local market.Onion prices reached an all-time high with the premium variety selling for Rs 150 a kg from Thursday, despite the governments efforts to make it available at a reasonable rate.The prices are likely to remain high till the year-end. In the new year, Bengal will have its own stock. Also, it is likely to receive onion from Maharashtra and Karnataka. So, the situation may improve, Rabindranath Koley, a member of the Task Force told The Indian Express.According to officials, as a large number of vegetable sellers have refused to sell onions, the government is planning to make them available in ration shops in the state.Five quintal of onions will be supplied to each ration shop. The vegetable will be available to consumers at Rs 60 per kg, said a government official. Sources said onions will be available at ration shops by next week.According to other members of the Task Force, 40 kg of onions are being sold for Rs 5,000 in the wholesale market, while in the local markets, prices range from Rs 120 to 150. However, as per the state government, all efforts are being made to fight the crisis.Government officials claimed that onions are being sold at the Sufal Bangla stores at Rs 59 per kg. The Agri-marketing Department is selling onions at the same price through its mobile vans stationed outside markets, including Manicktala, Beliaghata, Sobhabazar, Kankurgachhi and Sarat Bose Road.The government constructs the stalls and provide vehicles for bringing the goods from the farmers directly to the stalls of Sufal Bangla.The Bengal government has also placed an order for 800 tonne of imported onions with the NAFED for delivery by December-end to support the supply of the staple at a fair price.

Indian tourists ask for onions and chillies (along with meals). Due to rising onion prices, they are being served cabbage and chillies,"" Lobo said here on Saturday.Lobo is a BJP legislator who owns a chain of restaurants, lounge bars and hotels. He hails from Calangute Assembly constituency, home to some of the most popular beaches in the state  Calangute, Baga and Candolim.The onion prices have shot up over the last few weeks in Goa too, touching Rs 170 a kg in the retail markets on Friday.Earlier this week, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant had to intervene and provide subsidy to wholesalers to ensure relatively cheaper onion supply to the government-operated corporations dealing in the rationed vegetable sale.The Goa tourism industry has complained about dip in quality tourist footfalls and has blamed a combination of factors, including the collapse of UK-based charter tourism operator Thomas Cook earlier this year as well the poor quality of tourism infrastructure in the state.Goa, one of the leading beach tourism destinations in the country, attracted nearly seven million tourists last year, nearly half a million of which were foreigners.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

It’s the healthy durian fruit,"Have you tried this healthy fruit yet? (Source: Getty/Thinkstock) Have you tried this healthy fruit yet? (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)While there are many different varieties of fruits available out there, nothing matches up to the durian fruit, which is a unique tropical fruit found in Southeast Asia. High in nutrients, it also has a bad reputation for smelling repugnant, so much so that in countries like Singapore, the subway network forbids you from carrying the fruit inside the train. Wondering what the fuss is all about? Here is everything you need to know.The fruitAs mentioned earlier, durian is popular in many Southeast Asian countries. It somewhat resembles the jackfruit because of its large size, colour and a spiky, hard outer shell. Inside, it has a yellowy flesh  with a custard-like texture  and large seeds. The flesh, however, is not always yellow, and can sometimes be red, white and even green. A fully grown durian fruit will have about two cups of edible pulpy content.The useThose who consume it, use it in both sweet and savoury dishes. The pulp and seeds are both edible, but the latter needs to be cooked first. The fruits flavour can be described as cheesy, with a hint of almond, garlic and caramel; puzzled much?If you decide to try the fruit, there are a variety of ways, including consuming it in the juice form, eating the seeds, having it as a soup, a side dish, or even as a dessert. It is believed that some of its medicinal properties have also been studied over the years.Health benefitsDurian is often hailed as the most nutritious of fruits. It has everything, from carbs, fat, calories, protein, vitamin C, manganese, vitamin B6, potassium, magnesium, among others. It is also rich in many plant-based compounds which function as antioxidants.Traditional Malaysian medicine is believed to have used all parts of the durian plant  its leaves, roots, the fruit itself  for the treatment of jaundice, fever, skin conditions, etc.In fact, some studies show that being rich in antioxidants, durian can fight off cancer-causing free radicals, prevent the occurrence of heart diseases by reducing cholesterol, and fight many bacterial infections.How to eatUse a knife to break open the shell, and to gently remove the flesh. Next, you can consume the pulp as is, or in the one of the many ways mentioned above.What is with the smell?While some people do not mind the smell, others abhor it. The smell can be described as a weird combination of the fruit, rotting onions, honey and sulfur. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Almost 50 per cent of the onion production gets lost after factoring in crop loss and post-harvest loss, leaving only the balance to arrive in the market.Heavy rains during the harvest also led to the rotting of a good share of the onion production.In November, Karnataka markets received 60-70 quintals of onion a day, which fell by 50 per cent in December, leading to the crisis.Aiming to increase the availability of onion, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) has issued a circular that onion trade should happen even on holidays.""There is not much stock left with the wholesalers and retailers.

2019-12-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/dont-cry-for-onions-6157150/,Don’t cry for onions,"The Modi government should focus on problems that shall not pass as easily as onions. The Modi government should focus on problems that shall not pass as easily as onions.Onions continue to burn consumer pockets, notwithstanding several firefighting measures deployed by the Narendra Modi government.Since September-end, exports (annually worth almost $500 million) have been banned, stock limits imposed on the trade (wholesalers cannot keep more than 25 tonnes and retailers 5 tonnes), the state-owned MMTC Ltd ordered to import one lakh tonnes (lt) and the requirement of fumigation against pest and disease at the country of exports relaxed.If all these actions  the income tax department is even conducting nationwide raids on traders to probe any holding of unaccounted stocks  havent stopped retail onion prices from doubling to Rs 100-per-kg levels in the last two months, the primary culprit is clearly not hoarding, but production. Kharif onion sowings were, this time, affected by deficient monsoon rainfall till late-July.Even the crop that was planted suffered damage from excess rains, especially after September and extending to November. As a result, the total kharif and late-kharif onion output is officially down nearly 18 lt or 26 per cent; the actual decline could be more.But it isnt just onions. This years unusual combination of early-season drought and prolonged unseasonal rains around the time of harvesting has taken a toll on most kharif crops. Pulses, soyabean and maize, among others, are trading significantly higher than last year.Dairies, too, are procuring less, even as the cost of milk has gone up. While some of that is due to a slow start to the flush season  animals generally produce more after October, which again has been disrupted by an extended monsoon  there might be structural reasons as well.Low milk realisations of the past 3-4 years have forced many farmers to reduce herd sizes and underfeed their cattle, particularly calves and pregnant/non-lactating females. Its effects are showing now, with skimmed milk powder rates crossing Rs 300 per kg, from Rs 140-150 a year ago. Simply put, the period of low consumer food inflation  an average of 1.38 per cent year-on-year from September 2016 to August 2019, unprecedented in India  is over.That, however, isnt necessarily bad news. Ultra-low inflation isnt sustainable or even in consumer interest, if it disincentivises producers. The current price increases, after discounting for weather aberrations or factors specific to onion, are more of a correction. Price recovery, combined with the best monsoon rains in 25 years that have filled up all major reservoirs and substantially recharged groundwater tables, will spur ongoing rabi plantings.That would, in all likelihood, yield a bumper harvest and more than compensate for any kharif shortfalls. There can be nothing better for the economy today than rural incomes bouncing back. And there can be nothing worse than knee-jerk policy reactions to temporary shortage-induced price spikes.

Traders are lamenting customers are avoiding buying onions, which has led to reduced demand in Tiruchy. Prices of drumsticks have also soared in Tiruchy, with 1 kg selling for Rs 600 on Wednesday.Onion cultivation took a severe hit due to heavy rains in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, destroying much of the crop. The number of trucks carrying onions to wholesale markets here has dropped in a drastic manner. For almost three months, onion prices have been ruling at above Rs 100 rupee per kg. With prices predicted to go higher, owners of eateries are using less onions in their dishes.In smaller eateries, dishes like onion dosa, omelettes and other items have been totally taken off the menu. Some places are using cabbage as a substitute for onions. With the prices of drumsticks and garlic also rising, smaller eateries are finding it hard to satisfy customers with alternative vegetables as substitutes.Speaking to TNIE, Kadhar, a street eatery owner, said, For such onion-based dishes, we are able to earn Rs 5 to 7 as profit. But as onion prices have drastically increased to above Rs 120, we cannot afford to provide dishes for the prices listed. We also cannot increase prices of dishes, which may cause us to lose customers. To deal with the situation, we are only using onions where absolutely essential. He said for side dishes and fillings, owners of smaller eateries are using alternatives like cucumber and cabbage to replace onions.Bala, another eatery owner, said, In certain cases, we are providing the dishes at a slightly increased cost. Apart from this, we have started using brinjal and other vegetables to replace drumsticks."

But the government is not ready to accept. The prices of onion have reached Rs 200 per kilogram. The Finance Minister has also given a very childish answer on this issue. She said I do not eat onion-garlic, so do not ask me about onions, the party said.Stepping up the attack on its erstwhile ally BJP, Sena said, ""Pandit Nehru (Jawaharlal Nehru) and Indira Gandhi cannot be held responsible for the apocalyptic destruction of the country's economy.

What are the prices you are selling potatoes and onions for? From where are you getting supplies of the vegetables such as potatoes and onions, Banerjee asked the shopkeepers, also enquiring about the price at which they were further selling the vegetables to the buyers.The sellers explained her how they are forced to buy onion for more than Rs 120 per kilogram from wholesale market.Didi we buy onion for Rs 120 per kilogram from wholesale market and sell it for Rs 140/kg. What can we do? Its (onion) not in India, a vegetable seller told the Chief Minister.She also asked them if they were getting the onions that the state government was selling through Sufal Bangla stores atRs 59 per kg. The state government is also selling onions at Rs 59 a kg through 935 fair price shops in the city, besides Sufal Bangla stores, with each family getting to buy a maximum of 1 kg on producing ration cards.After visiting the market, she wrote on her Facebook wall, along with sharing a small video: Onion prices have gone beyond the reach of the middle class. In market, one kilo onion is being sold at Rs 140-150. The same onion is available at Sufal Bangla stall for Rs 59 per kg. Our government has always worked for the betterment of the middle-class people. To check the prices of onions and other vegetables, I went to Bhawanipore Jadubabu Market.The CM blamed the central government for the crisis. Prices of onions are skyrocketing, but they (Centre) are least bothered about it. The issue of price rise is Centres concern. Why cant Centre take measures to control the price rise of the essentials, Banerjee questioned.There was an agreement with the central government, but the Centre did not provide onions and hence the crisis in the state, she alleged.She said that there are 101 Sufal Bangla stalls. The state government has not only subsidised the price of the onion, but is also bearing the cost of transportation, distribution and losses in transit, said a government official.

Read MoreSURAT: Skyrocketing prices of onions that made life of residents in the Diamond City miserable are expected to come down in next fortnight.Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) sources said that farmers in Maharashtras Nasik, Satana, Malegaon and Nizampur have started harvesting fresh onion crop and that it has already started coming in small quantity to the market. At present, old onions from Nasik and other places are priced heavily due to shortage.APMC sources said prices of onion have been ruling between Rs1,200 and Rs2,000 per 20 kilograms. The APMC is getting about 350 tonnes of onion in the market yard and that majority is from Maharashtra. Supplies are also coming from Gondal, Rajkot and Bhavnagar.Market sources said onions are being sold for Rs130 per kilogram in retail markets. The prices will come down below Rs70 per kilogram, they added.APMC director Babu Shaikh told TOI, Onion prices are likely to come down in the next fortnight as fresh supply has started from onion producing areas of Maharashtra.He said that erratic rainfall pattern this season coupled with floods almost destroyed the crop and sowing was affected. We expect fresh stock of onions to bring down the prices below Rs70 per kilogram.Shaikh added, At present, about 75% of onions arriving in the market yard are of very low quality, but still the prices are high due to shortage. The situation may not remain like this by next 15 days.According to Shaikh, areas like Nizampur, Sankri, Pipalner and Pipalgaon in Maharashtra will be dumping onions from their farms by December-end and early January. This will ease price pressure on consumers in the city.APMC secretary Nilesh Thorat said, There is heavy shortage of good quality onions in the market. We are expecting that fresh supplies will start by next fortnight, especially from Maharashtra. This will ease price pressure in retail markets."

2019-12-10,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/dec/10/gastronomic-experiments-with-alcohol-hic-2073937.html,Gastronomic experiments with alcohol... hic!,"By Express News ServiceAlcohol and food makes for good table mates, mix them together and they create an even better combo for connoisseurs of fine eating. While this trend isnt new but chefs across the city are busy rustling up their very own speciality.The trend of using alcohol in cooking has been primarily adopted from the Western style of cooking along with Asian cultures for indirectly turning them into kinds of vinegar, informs chef Saurabh Udinia, Farzi Caf, adding, A major part of the reason for the rising popularity of using alcohol as an ingredient can be given to the versatility of alcohol  from fuel for cooking to braising, deglazing and finishing, thus enhancing the overall flavour of the dish.Udinia uses local fermented rice beer to finish bamboo rice and serve it with Naga Pork. He also flambs Tandoori Raan, lending new dimension and richness to it.Using alcohol during the cooking processes leaves behind a faint aroma and a subtle taste, bringing out the flavour in food like salt.Whether it is wine, beer, rum or vodka, the alcohol improves flavour perception through evaporation and molecular bonding, bridging the gap between aroma and food thus increasing flavour penetration. Our signature pasta using alcohol is Penne Alla Vodka, which is traditional penne pasta, usually made using heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions and cheese. The creamy and bright Italian delicacy tastes great with a mild vodka flavour and a flamb aroma, says chef Ashish Singh, Caf Delhi HeightsAmit Bagga, Co-founder of Daryaganj, finds a growing demand for this trend.People want experimentation and Baileys Kulfi is one of the dedicated experiments in-house at Daryaganj. It is a fusion of traditional dessert but experimented with a modern twist. Keeping the traditional taste of classic kulfi intact, we have embellished it with layers of baileys, thus, providing an elevated experience unheard of.While the alcohol and food combo creates wonders, chef Anas Qureshi, Molecule Air Bar, points how one needs to be careful when choosing the alcohol.Use any alcohol you would drink. Nothing undrinkable and none of that cooking wine which is just inexpensive wine that isnt meant for drinking. If you deglaze with a non-alcoholic liquid such as broth, fruit juice, or water, the flavour of your sauce wont be as intense.Qureshi himself uses alcohol in Butter Poached Chilli Garlic Prawns which are deglazed with white wine.This is a delicate dish where the prawns are slowly poached in clarified butter with dry red chilli flakes, garlic cloves and peppers so that they soak in all the flavours from the butter and stay moist while cooking. Once the prawns are perfectly cooked we finish the dish on a high flame with a dash of white wine and season the dish, he shares."

The firebrand writer aka P Lalita Kumari has rocked the literary world busting myths bringing alive historical female characters who are feminists in their own right. She was speaking at SheThePeople Women Writers Fest held on Saturday at The Park, Somajiguda.Prof T. Vijay Kumar was in conversation with her taking the audience on a fiery ride and riot of words. Talking about 50 years of her writing, Volga said, Also means 50 years of struggle from across all classes and areas which includes rural regions as well. Of women who cannot read or write. It also means 50 years of feminist writing in Telugu literature.Its a celebration of womens writing. Different people understand feminism differently. For me, feminism is understanding the inequality in the society. Within women there are inequalities including sexual preference. Feminism is analysing society through the lens of gender not just for women but men as well.Volga was a committed leftist writer. Prof Vijay asked her as to what made her leave leftist politics and enter feminist political writing? Volga quickly responded, I studied Marxism and learnt social and political aspects of society, writing for those who think like me. Though there were female writers, women werent considered intellectual by the thinking men. They were treated as subaltern and not leaders. This troubled me a lot. I began to question the democractic set-up within the organisation. Thats when I decided to leave.On her novel Swechha, her former colleagues were bitter ly critical. Vijay asked if it was a right decision to leave?The book was already in the market with one lakh copies while it faced much criticism from leftists. The 69-year-old author added, These were stories of common women with a lot of ideas. Shes married to a good man of her choice but she leaves him in the end. The women wanted to live as citizens. Take part in movements. The husbands wanted her to be a mother. A woman. Thats all there is for her in a marriage. In my tales there are women in live-in relationships. The good people got very angry decades ago. Its the readers who decide what they want to read not the progressive critics.Conversation is very important in her writing, especially among women. When women come closer its easier for them to discuss and connect. Among women, there is always feminist sisterhood. Brotherhood has an ideal. The conversation among women disturbs men, especially a conversation between Sita and Surpanakha who actually should have been enemies. In one of dance ballets, they dance together. Its a war between Aryans and Dravidians. Surpanakha is this beautiful Dravidian woman. Draupadi was also there. Doordarshan wanted to showcase it and they didnt accept the character of Surpanakha. They wanted to remove her from the story.She later wrote three more stories. Theres another one on Ram whos trapped in his own loneliness. Its later translated as The Liberation of Sita. Her recently-translated book is Yashodhara on Gautam Buddhas wife. How did she see Yashodhara as? The Sahitya Akademi awardee author replied, People can easily identify with Sita and Draupadi. Its all about power dynamics in understanding and operating the society. Maybe Yashodhara gave reason to Buddha for becoming a sanyasi. How is it possible that he decides to leave the palace and the wife doesnt wake up? She is not the victim. Maybe she was the strength behind Buddhas decision. Its time they are not seen just as poor victims.And the narratives by women writers and poetsFOOD FUNDAThe panel Food Trends 2020: From Kombucha to Keto was moderated by city-based food writer Shivani Mohan and saw gorgeous actor-author Tara Deshpande speaking on the same as she said, How many of us know the real Roghan Josh? A lot of restaurants fool the consumer by adding tomatoes for getting that typical red colour. In fact, Mawal flowers are used for the colour and not any other alternative colouring agent. After this Shivani shot the question, What are the five ingredients you would like to see in kitchen in 2020?And the other panelist Seetha Anand replied, Breakfast should consist of lots of food. Fill your fridge with fresh vegetables. Salad doesnt mean slices of cucumber and onions. You should look at it and your mouth should water. Shivani suggested that the whole family should come together for preparation of food to which Seetha replied, Get children to eat healthy and include them in the preparation. We eat for various reasons. Not just one reason. And then there was the eternal fusion question. Tara chuckled, Fusion can be confusion. Who would have thought of blueberry bagel? A Jew would be tearing his hair. Burgers trend started in the forties. Fusion food has been there from a long time. For example: Vada Pav. The bun is Portuguese. The potatoes are Portuguese.EVERYDAY STORIESThe session Womens writing: Chronicling the everyday was moderated by author-blogger Kiran Manral. Author Shilpa Suraj elaborated on romance writing saying, People mistake womens writing as fluff. Its not. Writing is the rut of life which is processed. Kiran asked authors if male romance writers are outselling female writers? Shilpa responded, The real work begins when your book is out. Men somehow write from a relatable perspective. Thats why they sell more. Kiran asked writer Sophia Lorena Benjamin as to how difficult it is to correlate what a woman goes through especially the protagonist? My book Claudia is on historical romance is set in Goa. When the Portuguese left Goa, they must have left behind a lot of relationships. I couldnt find much material on that, but wrote on it. Claudia falls in love and goes through it all. Younger audience relate well because the protagonist also finds solutions and does not just sulk.THE SONG OF POETSThe poetry session When Words Sing: Womens Journeys Through Verse saw six women poets from the city reading in English and Telugu. The poets not only read their verses but also talked about their journeys of writing. Poet Shikhandin shared about her different childhood of being a third unwanted child. But how she was also surrounded by animals and birds which seeped into her writing. Poet-teacher Jhelum Chattaraj talked about how her stay in Hyderabad has shaped up her writing as she read a poem on nail paint and eating fish, while poet Nabina Das explored socio-political aspects through her poem They Are Kissing. Telugu poet Shahjahana, whos gone through much in life especially when it came to men, spoke about it reading a lyrical poem. The audience enjoyed the poetic evening as an attendee Nivedita N said, This session just woke us up. We need more evenings like these."

With inflation rising, fears of stagflation -- a fall in aggregate demand accompanied by rising inflation -- have resurfaced.The Shiv Sena said former prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi cannot be held responsible for the country's present economic situation.""Centralisation of power in PMO and powerless ministers - this situation is not good for the economy,"" the Marathi publication said.""The present government is not ready to listen to economists as it considers the economy like a 'share bazaar satta'. What is Nirmala Sitharaman's contribution as finance minister - 'I don't eat onion, you also do the same',"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said in taunting remarks.The government wants the finance minister, RBI governor, finance secretary and Niti Ayog chairman under its control, it claimed, adding that this is the main reason for the country's ""poor"" economic health.The economy is ""paralysed""and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan's ""diagnosis"" is absolutely correct.""The government is not ready to accept the economic slowdown.

An unconscious person is brought back to senses by being made to smell onion, but this is not possible now since onions have disappeared from markets,"" it said in sarcastic comments.The Sena also blamed decisions like demonetisation and ""unnecessary focus"" on projects such as the bullet train for the current economic situation.""Whatever Pandit Nehru and his colleagues earned for the country, this government is selling it off,"" it said, apparently referring to the proposed sale of public sector undertakings like the BPCL and Air India.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Its time to look for alternatives. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)However hard it may be, finding an alternative for onions, which have witnessed a sudden spike in prices, may not be as easy as it sounds. Given that in some parts of India, prices have risen beyond Rs 200 per kilogram, people are looking to find cheaper alternatives. If you too are fond of flavouring your dish with onions, but are unable to lay your hands on the bulb, here are some alternatives you can rely on.ChivesFresh chives, which are related to onions and garlic, can be used to flavour food as an alternative. They have long green stems and a mild, not-too-pungent flavour. Usually used as a garnish, chives can also be used as a main ingredient. They are an ideal substitute as they have a mild onion-y flavour, especially fresh ones.Since chives have a milder flavour, theyre perfect to add to soups, dips, mashed or baked potatoes, fish, seafood dishes and omelettes. Heat destroys their delicate flavour, so add chives to your dishes at the last minute. To maximise their taste, thinly slice, chop or snip before using.LeeksView this post on Instagram A post shared by Plot17a (@nodig_ben) on Nov 16, 2019 at 10:11am PSTComing from the same origin as onions, garlic and chives, leeks have a distinctive taste of its own, which can be described as mild, onion-like. In its raw state, the vegetable is crunchy and firm. The edible portions of the leek are the white base of the leaves (above the roots and stem base), the light green parts, and to a lesser extent the dark green parts of the leaves. Leeks are widely used to prepare salads and soups. You can also use leeks for baking, sauting or even braising.ShallotsShallots can be added to bring the onion flavour. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Shallots can be added to bring the onion flavour. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Unlike regular onions, which grow as single bulbs, shallots grow in clusters, more like garlic. They are a bit sweeter than regular onions, and their flavour is more subtle. Delicate enough to eat raw and easy to roast to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, shallots can be added to various dishes.Green onionsGo for sprig onions. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Go for sprig onions. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)When chopped together, leeks and green onions look pretty much the same from the exterior. But the texture definitely varies. While leeks are firm and crunchy when raw, green onions are a bit slimy. They get slimier after cooking too. Green onions are much smaller than leeks but have a similar shape.Dry onion flakesYou can substitute onion flakes for fresh ones.

Meanwhile, he sold shallots for Rs 140 per kg.However, the retail price of the onions is anywhere between Rs 100 to Rs 180 per kg in Cuddalore."

It will take three more weeks for the rates to be affordable and the quality to improve.Looking at early returns, farmers harvested the onions before the scheduled time and so the onion quality is not good, though the rate has dropped by Rs 50- 60 per kilo. The difference in price at the wholesale and retail markets is not much, depending on the quality.Hopcoms assures to be selling superior quality onions at Rs 134 a kilo. Prasad Kumar, Hopcoms Managing Director, told The New Indian Express that since there is sufficient produce in the market, the cost has dropped. But as the crop was harvested prematurely, the water content in the onions is very high, and it will rot if stored for more than three days, he added.He said the onion price will not come down immediately, but will gradually. The good quality onions will come by January, as the harvest was done in September-October. Normally, it takes 100-120 days for the onion to be ready for harvest and supply. But farmers harvested the crop earlier this year. Though the onion is ready, the water content in the bulb is rich because there has been no resting time for it to dry. The rates will get stabilised in January, said C Udayshankar, Secretary, Onion Traders Association.Udayshankar said rates of perishable items cannot be fixed, it changes depending on the supply and the stocks availability. Since the new crop has been sown and farmers have understood the steady drop in price, the crop will be good in the coming days. With the availability of imported onions coming from Turkey and Egypt, the stock in the market is also good. This has also helped in controlling the rates, he added.Retail customers are not preferring imported onions because of the size, colour and smell. This is another reason why there is sufficient stock in the market. So to clear stock, the wholesalers are requesting hoteliers and commercial units to take the imported onions so that the locally grown ones can be sold in the retail market.Onion price in marketD100-110Retail ratesD70-100Wholesale rateD70Rate of imported onionIt takes 100- 120 days for onions to be ready, normally"

(File photo) Simply put, whatever little rising wages that rural workers have experienced has, in recent months (from March), been more than eaten away by inflation. (File photo)Real rural wages growth has fallen to an all-time-low of minus 3.8% in September, further confirming the deep structural slowdown in Bharat that is also evidenced in sluggish fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and two-wheeler sales.The daily wage rate in rural India for male workers across 25 occupations (12 agricultural and 13 non-agricultural) averaged Rs 331.29 during September, as per field data compiled by the Labour Bureau. This was 3.42% higher than the corresponding level for the same month of 2018. But in real terms, after adjusting for inflation based on the all-India consumer price index (CPI) for rural labourers, the wage increase worked out to minus 3.77% year-on-year.The accompanying chart maps month-wise annual growth in rural wages since 2017. The divergence between nominal and real growth can be seen particularly after January 2019. That, in turn, has mainly to do with inflation: Between December 2018 and September 2019, nominal year-on-year growth in rural wages has been more or less flat, registering only a marginal decline from 3.76% to 3.42%. However, CPI inflation for rural labourers during the same period has gone up from 1.66% to 7.20%.Simply put, whatever little rising wages that rural workers have experienced has, in recent months (from March), been more than eaten away by inflation. And that also explains why sales of two-wheelers  considered a barometer of rural demand  recorded a 16.18% de-growth in April-September 2019 over April-September 2018, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The market research firm Nielsen has estimated rural FMCG consumption in India to have grown by just 5% year-on-year in July-September, the lowest in the last seven years.The accompanying chart maps month-wise annual growth in rural wages since 2017. The accompanying chart maps month-wise annual growth in rural wages since 2017.There could be two reasons why real rural wage growth has slumped to negative territory during the current fiscal.The first is structural: Low crop prices, especially in the post-demonetisation period, and the overall slowing down of the economy has reduced demand for labour in farms as well as non-farm avenues such as construction, manufacturing and assorted services.The second is more immediate. Kharif crop production this time has been affected by a combination of early-season drought from the delayed onset of the monsoon and prolonged unseasonal rains towards the time of harvesting. Together, they have impacted farm labour demand, even amidst further diminishing employment opportunities in the rest of the economy.What can one expect in the months ahead?A possible source of optimism is the recovery of sorts taking place in crop prices  not only of onions, but also pulses, milk, soybean and maize. Click here to read. This, alongside the vastly improved soil moisture conditions from the late monsoon rains extending to November, should spur agriculture labour demand in the current rabi season.Its interesting to note here that in the months immediately after the Narendra Modi governments demonetisation announcement in November 2016, rural wage growth actually saw an uptick. Nominal wage growth touched 6.9% in April 2017. The fact that even real wages showed acceleration, despite the scrapping of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes, was cited by many as proof of demonetisation not adversely hitting rural India.The real reason for wage acceleration during that period, though, was a good monsoon coming after back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015. Farmers, therefore, planted more area both during the kharif (April-October 2016) and rabi (November-April) cropping seasons. The very prospect of harvesting a bumper rabi crop, and keenness to recoup the production losses of the previous two years, was motivation enough for them to plant at any cost. The resultant rise in demand for labour pulled up rural wages.But subsequent events showed that while farmers did harvest a bumper rabi crop, the gains from it were offset by a crash in prices. That was largely induced by the post-demonetisation liquidity squeeze in produce markets. As crop prices entered a prolonged bear phase after April 2017, nominal rural wage growth slipped to below 5% by October and have continued to fall thereafter.It remains to be seen whether the recovery in crop prices seemingly underway now is sustainable. If it turns out that way, wages of rural workers should also, hopefully, recover along with farm incomes. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-the-kitchens-of-murthal-onion-prices-6162505/,Inside the kitchens of Murthal,"The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food. The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food.On the stretch of National Highway 1 which passes through Murthal in Haryana are over two dozen dhabas  both big and small. These popular rest stops started out catering to truckers, providing hearty, if simple, meals of parathas and dals, as well as cots on which their customers could rest. Since the 1980s, however, many have grown into restaurants that cater increasingly to customers who come from nearby Sonepat and even Delhi, just to sample the dhabas famous tandoor parathas with white butter.At noon on a Tuesday, the parking lot of one of the more popular eateries, Pahalwan Dhaba, is already full. Inside, bowls of sirka pyaaz (onions in vinegar) are on each table, along with green chillies and pickles. Platters of parathas, dals and other dishes emerge from the kitchen in a steady stream.In a room behind the kitchen, surrounded by sacks of potatoes and seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and radish, two young men seated on chairs pull out onions from sacks piled in one corner and chop them into a large plastic container. These, we are told, will be used as tempering for some dishes, while many more will be boiled and then ground to a paste. The onions are chopped fresh, based on the dishes being ordered at the restaurant.Many years ago, when the price of onions had shot up dramatically, the dhaba had tried to cut back on the use of this staple in its kitchen. Nothing tasted the same, recalls Sudesh Sandhu who, along with her husband, owner Dayanand, runs the eatery. Since then we decided that should the price of onions skyrocket again, we will still use as many as we usually do. Our customers come here for the taste, and if it eats into our profit for now, its okay. We can make it up when the price drops, which it is sure to, she says.Onions are currently selling for about Rs 90 per kg. On an average, Sandhu informs, Pahalwan Dhaba uses about 250-300 kilos of onions every day: this includes the onions used to make aloo-pyaaz and pyaaz parathas as well as the ones that are sliced and served raw as part of the salad or are preserved in vinegar. The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food. And tomatoes and onions form the base of almost every curry that we serve here. If you reduce the proportion of onions in anything, the taste changes noticeably and thats not something were willing to risk.Pahalwan Dhaba, which has been around for more than three decades, does enough business annually to be able to absorb the cost of not letting onion prices affect customer experience. Sandhu says that smaller or newer eateries in the area havent been able to do the same, with many substituting onions with daikon radish in the salads. One of these is the three-year-old Shiva Dhaba. While owner Pradeep Arya isnt able to offer an estimate of the dhaba kitchens average per day onion usage, he says that in the past few weeks, the soaring prices have forced them to cut back by an estimated 30 to 35 per cent. Weve stopped serving free onions at the tables. Were now charging Rs 40 per serving. Of course, we understand that customers expect it to be served for free along with the pickles and chillies, but at this point, the cost is simply not something that we can bear, he says.

2019-12-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/the-story-of-the-humble-bulb-onion-price-6162496/,The story of the humble bulb,"The onions seem to have come into their own in upper class cuisine during the Mughal age. (Getty Images) The onions seem to have come into their own in upper class cuisine during the Mughal age. (Getty Images)Onions are known to be amongst the earliest food items cultivated by humankind. It has been cultivated for more than 5,000 years and there are doubts as to whether today it exists as a wild species. The exact place of the origin of the vegetable is not clear and researchers have ascribed onions to a region stretching from northwest India, parts of modern day Pakistan and Afghanistan in the west to parts of China and Central Asia in the northeast. One of the earliest recorded history of the vegetable dates back to the 4th BCE when labourers working on the famous pyramids in Egypt were fed onions to keep them in good strength. The Romans are known to have introduced the vegetable to different parts of Europe.But the ancient world also had an ambivalent relationship to onions. In ancient Mesopotamia, writes the cultural geographer Fredrick J Simoons in Plants of Life, Plants of Death, though leeks and onions were freely eaten, they were banned in certain times of the year, especially during ritual occasions. Their pungent smells, propensity to introduce certain baser sentiments and supposedly aphrodisiac attributes gave the onions bad press in several parts of the world, including India.But much of the onion story in India is inextricable with the caste system and gender-related restrictions. As the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai writes in a 1988 article in the Journal of the Comparative Study of Society and History, How to make a national cuisine, Cookbooks in Contemporary India, Food taboos and prescriptions divide men from women, gods from humans, upper from lower castes, one sect from another. Widows were especially prohibited from consuming onions. In early India, writes Simoons, onion was banned to Brahmins and other respectable castes who had to perform penance for violations. In the laws of Manu, notes the cultural geographer, onions, garlic and leek are unsuited for eating by twice-born men. The Vedic texts carry no mention of the onion. The moral dictums of the caste system played a big role in the rules of commensality and which food found a place within the folds of respectability. The 5th Century AD Chinese traveller to India, Fa Hsien writes in his memoirs except for those who were scorned, few ate onions.It is not difficult to locate who were the ones scorned. In the laws of Manu, writes Simoons, onions and garlic emerge from unclean things, which mean should a person eat them, he would be deemed an outcast. Fa Hsiens fellow countryman Hieun Tsang, who visited India about two centuries later, almost mirrors his predecessors observation on onions. Very few people eat them. If anyone uses them for food, they are expelled beyond the walls of the town.Some ancient medicinal texts, however, acknowledge the benefits of onions. The Charaka Samhita, compiled between 2nd BCE and 3rd Century AD  and possibly contains wisdom from earlier era  extols the digestive properties of the onion. The consumption of onion makes the man healthy, stout and energetic, his voice turns melodious and his skin becomes lustrous, it notes, quoting a saying from an earlier age.But moral prescriptions on food are often complicated by actual practices. The Manasollasa (literally refresher of the mind), one of the earliest Indian texts to pay attention to cooking, contains the usual proscriptions on onions. The writer, the Chalukyan king, Someswara, asks kings to abstain from eating chicken, radish, garlic and onions. Nevertheless, onions find a place in more than one recipe in the 12th-13th century text. Pieces of meat are mixed with a paste of gram, grounded with spices and fried. To this are added tender hyacinth beans, onion and garlic, notes one recipe.Ibn Batuta, who visited India about a century after the Manasollasa was composed, notes in his Rihla that a favourite dish of the Muslim community in Keralas Malabar region was a lamb dish that had grated coconut and onion. The vegetable also finds a place in his mention of the royal meal. The Tughlak emperor, writes Batuta, ate bread, which is thin round cakes, meat cooked with ghee, onions and green ginger, sambusak or triangular pastries made of hashed meat and cooked with almonds, pistachios, onions and spices put inside a piece of thin bread fried in ghee.In Curry, A Global History, food historian Lizzie Collingham writes, By the time Babur conquered Hindustan, vegetarianism had become a powerful statement of ones position in Indian society Orthodox Brahmins avoided all foods which were thought to stimulate the passions. These included meat, onions and garlic.The onions seem to have come into their own in upper class cuisine during the Mughal age. The rice and meat dishes, kababs and kormas that became the hallmark of culinary culture of the court and the upper classes, were laced with onions. So did the Rajput cuisine of roast meats.But what about the taboos on onion? Collingham has a vivid account. Prakash Tandon observed the breakdown of caste restrictions in his own Punjabi Khatri family. Tandons father was a member of the educated Indian middle class. Tandons mother was a strict vegetarian, consequently her food was cooked separately. While she did not mind onions entering the kitchen, meat and fish were kept separately.Mahatma Gandhis writings have several references to onions as food for common people. In fact one of his earliest satyagrahas, in Kheda, was associated with onions. In his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, the Mahatma writes that when the colonial state attached the properties of the Gujarat agriculturists, he asked them to harvest their onion crops from fields which were wrongly attached.Gandhi, a Vaishnav himself, did not grow up an onion eater. But in England he took to the vegetable with gusto. He gave up onions in South Africa, only to advocate them for nutritive purposes on his return. In 1936, he wrote what many Indians think today, I dont know what the poor man will do without onions and garlic. (Mahatma Gandhi, Collected Works, Volume 69). The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(Express photo/Pradeep Kumar) Congress MLAs after a walkout from the Assembly in Dharamshala Tuesday. (Express photo/Pradeep Kumar)Congress legislators wore garlands of onions during Question Hour on the second day of the ongoing winter session of the Himachal Pradesh Assembly here in Tapovan Tuesday, as a mark of protest against the staple vegetables rising prices.Raising slogans like Bhajpa ka dekho khel, mehanga pyaaz, mehanga tel, Ye mehangai kaha se aayi, Bhajpa laayi-Bhajpa layi, they targeted the BJP government over the issue.The issue of expanding private investment and industry in the state was also taken up by the Opposition. While Congress MLAs protested and walked out of Assembly early during the session, BJP members expressed confidence that fresh investments and industry would generate employment in the state.As soon as the session resumed Tuesday, Congress MLAs objected to the merging of their resolution regarding discussion on the recently-held Global Investors Summit being and another resolution by BJP. Speaker Rajeev Bindal said this was done because they were similar and the Opposition would be given full hearing on the same. This was followed by an exchange of charges between the Opposition and ruling party.Opposition leader Mukesh Agnihotri Agnihotri alleged the investors meet was the biggest scam in the history of the state.At this, the CM rose from his seat and said Congress legislators should not make Himachal Pradesh Assembly like Punjabs or Bihars. Thakur said the BJP government the state spent much lesser on the investors summit last month as compared to what the previous Congress dispensation spent for digging soil in the name of setting up industries.Industries Minister Bikram Singh said less than Rs 24 crore was spent on investors meet organised on Nov 7-8, whereas Rs 58 crore was spent by Congress in Pandoga.Thakur accused the Congress of disturbing the decorum of the Assembly on a daily basis. We are not even sure why they walked out todayThey could ideally have remained patient and engaged in a healthy discussion over the investors meet, he said. Nurpur MLA Rakesh Pathania said there is no greater platform than the Assembly session for voicing their concerns but Congress chose to remain absent.Chintpurni MLA Balbir Singh said that the previous government had failed to adequately utilise the industrial package given to the state by the Centre and several prominent companies had backed out of the state after being asked for bribes. Himachal has a huge potential for the natural farming industry, especially Himalayan herbs. For example in Una, a Harvard-educated agriculturist has started the cultivation of black wheat which has health benefits and sells for Rs 150 per kg, he remarked.Several other MLAs said that only a few areas such as Baddi Barotiwala Nalagarh (BBN) and Kala Amb had developed as industrial hubs and new industrial areas such as Pandoga had failed to take off.Industries Minister Bikram Singh said that more than 700 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to the tune of Rs 9,600 crore had been signed during the investors meet, which were projected to create around two lakh jobs in the future. He read out a letter from the UAE ambassador praising Himachal Pradesh for facilitating foreign investment. He said that delegates from 36 countries and ambassadors from ten nations had attended the meet.Lone CPI(M) MLA Rakesh Singh cautioned the House against the motives of private industrialists. They will only come here for their own profit. We must raise the purchasing power of our people to create a higher demand for private investment, he said. The CM replied that other states were surging ahead in establishing industry and Himachal must not lag behind. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/few-takers-for-processed-onion-alternatives-ciphet/,Few takers for processed onion alternatives: CIPHET,"Highest per cent of the onion that is coming to the apmc market on Tuesday. Express Photo by Narandra Waskar Highest per cent of the onion that is coming to the apmc market on Tuesday. Express Photo by Narandra WaskarOnion prices have skyrocketed to Rs 150 a kg in retail markets despite supplies coming in from Afghanistan. However, despite the fact that prices of onion fluctuate every year after the monsoon season, there are hardly any takers for processing of the vegetable, to convert it to dried flakes, powder or paste. Experts from the Central Institute of Post Harvest Technology (CIPHET), Ludhiana, say that this, if done in summers when prices of onion are low, can save consumers from high prices.Dr Vikas Kumar, senior scientist of the technology transfer division of CIPHET  a department that organises training programs  said, Training programmes for farmers continue at our centre throughout the year in which we teach them how to process fruits and vegetables so as to reduce post-harvest losses. Farmers either come on paid training sessions or sometimes even attend sponsored training sessions. Normally, programmes are sponsored by the Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA). Farmers, budding entrepreneurs come to us for training so as to earn profit and reduce post-harvest losses. They come from across the country in groups. However, they take interest in post-harvest training on turmeric, pomegranate, fruits and vegetables. In vegetables, we cover onion processing as well in the course, but no farmer group or non-farmer group has come specially for training only on onion processing so far.He added, Drying onions is very simple. It can be converted into flakes, powder or paste. Through our solar dryerit gets dried up fast. Dried onion has an export market as well. But in India, it is yet to catch fancy as every year onion prices become a cause of concern for the masses.CIPHET had introduced training on onion processing in 2007 under which around 100 kg of onions are dehydrated to 14-16 kg dried flakes. They have a shelf life of more than 9 months and can be rehydrated in water before consumption to get 5-6 times of dehydrated onions. Though there are some onion processing units in Gujarat and Maharastra but none in Punjab, most of the dehydrated onion is exported with little use in domestic market.In 2015, soon after yet another onion price hike, Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had suggested that onions be dehydrated when they are cheap and hence can be sold during lean period. When asked about her departments initiative to deal with the price rise, she had said, We have set up the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology in Perambalur district of Tamil Nadu and have initiated a Mission Onion Program a concept to double the income of farmers by 2022. However, this program was started in August 2017, and hence afterwards, the department had no other details to share regarding onion processing.Dr Shailender Kaur, director, horticulture, Punjab, said, Area under onion in Punjab is 9,360 hectares  it is 0.9 per cent of the total area under horticulture in Punjab. All onion varieties are not processable, still PAU developed one variety last year but it is being grown in a controlled area as of now. Moreover, consumers are not very adaptable to using processed onions as of now.Meanwhile Gurvinder Singh, a wholesale onion seller in Ludhianas sabzi mandi, said, Onions have started coming from Afghanistan as well. I think situation will start improving in a fortnight. As of now low quality onion available in mandi at Rs 50 a kg and good quality at Rs 80-85 a kgbut this is the wholesale price and hence retailers always add their margins.In Ludhianas retail market in Sarabha Nagar, Ghumar Mandi and even in Apni Mandi onion was priced at Rs 120-150 a kg.

(Express Photo: Narandra Waskar)A day after bulb prices fell across the state as arrivals in the wholesale markets rose sharply, onions continued to be missing from salads and sparse in curries served at hotels and restaurants in the city. The significant dip in wholesale rates, restaurateurs said Tuesday, was yet to be reflected in the retail markets.Onion prices had touched Rs 160-170 per kg in local vegetable markets across Mumbai and its suburbs over the last week. On Monday, prices fell by 30 per cent with onion growers bringing more domestic produce to wholesale markets to get the benefit of the higher prices.At Lasalgaon wholesale market, Indias biggest onion market, prices fell to an average of Rs 4,500 per quintal Monday after it traded at Rs 6,000 per quintal last week.At Jai Hanuman restaurant, a vegetarian eatery in Andheri East, customers were served a medley of cucumber and tomato, instead of the usual raw onion, alongside other dishes. We have been buying onion for Rs 130 per kilogramme. Our stock will last another three to four days. Till then, we will not serve any free onions along with dishes, manager Diwakar Shetty said. Shetty added the prices fell only by Rs 20-30 per kg after larger establishments began to buy from the recently imported stock. It is still expensive. We will wait for onion prices to touch Rs 40-60 per kg before we start serving it as usual, he said.Crawford Market-based vendor Mohan Turkar said he continues to sell onions at Rs 12 per kg. The cost in the wholesale market is Rs 95 per kg today. But I am yet to exhaust my existing stock. It will be two-three days more before prices fall in the local market, he said.Meanwhile, several vendors said they have stopped stocking onions. Rohit Chheda, the owner of Satyam Grocery store on Veera Desai Road in Andheri, had decided not to buy a fresh stock when the prices touched Rs 100 per kg. My regular customers have stopped purchasing onions. So we stopped stocking it, he said. Nearby, Chheda Stores owner said they would restock once prices reach Rs 80 per kg. In Andheri, onion continued to be sold at Rs 120-140 per kg.At Shalimar Hotel in Bhendi Bazaar, Captain Sabir Khan said the management has instructed waiters and chefs to reduce wastage of onions. Earlier, we would put any quantity of chopped onion into parcel orders. Now we are conscious of how much we give. But we ensure that the customers dont complain. If they ask for more, we are still serving onions free of cost, Khan said. Shalimar has a chain of restaurants across Mumbai, with a central procurement unit that makes wholesale purchases for all outlets.However, some restaurants have continued to use the usual quantity of onions. Parvez Qazi, working with Joeys Pizza in Andheri West, said even with the sky-high prices, the restaurant did not alter its onion purchases for its pizzas over the last two weeks. Customers like onions in certain pizzas and we did not reduce the quantity. We continued to buy at a high price. There is a small loss incurred, he said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But the response, lack of it rather, from consumers has left traders worried.SK Chidambaram, a trader who bought the variety in bulk, said consumers were wary of the variety because they were dark red in colour whereas the domestic varieties are pinkish. Apart from the dark red colour, onions from Egypt have more layers which are not useful he reasoned for the lack of enthusiasm among buyers. Hoteliers, however, do not have any qualms about buying the imported variety.Meanwhile, the price of the onion which ruled high for the last three months started easing a bit. What was selling at Rs 200 per kg two days ago sold at Rs 160. Traders hoped the prices would come down further as they have been informed the load of onions from Maharastra has been started moving towards Tamil Nadu market. Onion from Maharastra is expected to reach the market in another week, Chidambaram said."

Within a week, major drop in rates is expected.Officials of the Punjab Mandi Board said, The trucks have reached the wholesalers in Chandigarh as well as Punjab, many of whom are coming to Chandigarh to sell the wares. There are two varieties of Afghani onion in the market; one is a rosy pink, which is of a better quality than the deeper red version. They have turned red because they were exposed to water. Right now, both varieties are being sold for 80 per kg. In the coming days, however, the price of the redder Afghani variety is expected to fall further.The onion from Alwar was priced at 90 per kg, they said.As per the officials of the UT food and supplies department, around 35 trucks laden with produce have come into the region and within a week, the price of onions is expected to lower to somewhere between 50-60 per kg.

For many regulars, this absence has made the experience at this iconic hangout zone as dull as curry without spices. The exorbitant price of the vegetable has also made two other dishes disappear  chicken and mutton afghani  which require generous doses of onion. And whats worse is that ICH cant tell customers when the pakoda will return.The price of onion must dip below a certain level  at least under Rs 100  to make the pakoda a viable option, said ICH secretary Tapan Kumar Pahari. The onion pakoda is the most-ordered dish here, along with coffee. We sell as many pakoda dishes as cups of coffee we make in a day, he added.Priced at Rs 26, which has remained unchanged through decades, the onion pakoda is pocket-friendly to the student community ICH serves. Its taste is unmatched, said Manoranjan Sardar, a teacher-cum-writer and a regular at ICH.With the visible disappointment on the faces of customers, ICH is trying to replace the onion pakoda with a special aloo pakoda. We are experimenting with it. Hopefully, we will come out with one soon, said Pahari.The establishment normally requires 45kg-50kg onions a day. With the price hovering around Rs 120-Rs 130, offering onion pakoda is not possible any more. We have reduced the onion consumption to 15kg-20 kg a day. We are still serving onion in the green salad, but the proportion is not as generous as it used to be, Pahari added.Coffee and onion pakoda have become synonymous with ICH. I try to go there at least once a week. The coffee without the pakoda does not taste the same, said Joyeeta Mukherjee, a school teacher.Priya, a pice hotel in Phariapukur, has gone a step forward by doing away with onion in their mutton dish. When the onion price was shooting up, we were thinking of how to keep our rates the same without compromising on quality. I sent my cook to Tarapith to learn how to make mutton without onion, said owner Tapan Ghoshal.Sidheswari Hotel in Jaanbazar has done away with rohu kalia and rohu korma. We have reduced use of onion to keep prices same. Our chicken and mutton dishes have much less onion than earlier, but, somehow, we have not lost our customers, said Dibakar Mondal of the hotel."

After incidents of onion theft in Surat and Bhavnagar, a similar incident has come to light at the Khanderao Market.Alarm bells have been pressed at the Khanderao Market after some unidentified persons stole bags full of onions from the market on December 7. The traders realized about the theft next day and later approached the police.According to police, Alpesh Gandhi, a vegetable vendor submitted an application with Navapura police in this regard. Gandhi said that they had kept sacks full of onions in market. Some sacks of onions worth about Rs 7,000 were stolen by unidentified persons. We will file a FIR once we get complete information from Gandhi, said a police official.Many traders stock vegetables at the market in night as they start their retail shop early in mornings. Sacks filled with greens lie unattended at the market as they have never been stolen in the past. The prices of onions have crossed Rs 100 per kilogram over last few days and in some metros, the prices have touched Rs 140 per kilogram.Earlier this month, around 14 bags of onion containing 50kg each were allegedly stolen on December 6 from Bhavnagar marketing yard. However, the traders decided not to register a police complaint. Talking to TOI, president of traders association at Bhavnagar market yard, Narendrasinh Gohil said, We believe the bags have been misplaced by the labourers while loading them in the truck. The entire stock lies in the open in the market yard and labourers load the bags onto the trucks.On November 28, nearly 250kg of onion stocked in a vegetable vendors shop in Palanpur Patiya area of Surat city was stolen during early hours of Thursday. The vendor Sanju Prajapati who sells potatoes, onions and garlic usually keeps 200kg of stock of all the three on a daily basis. On November 28 evening too, he bought five bags of onions each containing nearly 50kg and kept in his shop for sales the next day."

Over Saturday and Sunday, the Swedish national residing in Bengaluru didnt just put up his seven-feet tall Christmas tree (complete with ornaments that have been in the family for generations) but also cooked up a storm with pepparkakor (ginger snaps), lussekatter (saffron buns) and vrtbrd (Christmas bread)  all traditional Swedish dishes without which the festive season is incomplete. The coming weekends will have making a batch of Glgg or Swedish spiced mulled wine. The days in between will also see him conducting free carol concerts with the choir he leads, across venues in Bengaluru. Its a busy time but thats exactly how I like it since it reminds me of home, where Christmas preparations begin on December 1, says the 43-year-old HR director at Volvo Group India.Like Olsson, many other members of the expat community too will be celebrating the festive season here. For Nicolas Grossemy, the festive season means quality time with family, but since they are back home in Arras, France, he is now looking forward to spending it with his friends here with a game of Secret Santa and a potluck that involves the closest substitute they could find to turkey: Roast chicken. The one thing he misses most are the Christmas markets of France. Since hot wine is popular at these markets, I am going to make some of that here. Im also going to buy some gingerbread and traditional Buche de Noel cake, says the 28-year-old co-founder of Paris Panini.And since a feast is an integral part of every festival, other expats too are whipping up traditional dishes from back home. For Frances Rao, an American who has been inBengaluru since 1991, this includes Christmas cakes, rum balls and eggnog, whereas for Faith Mbahaotu, the 23rd of December has been kept aside for preparing Jollof rice, a popular dish in Nigeria. Comprising rice, chicken or beef, tomatoes, chilli, onion, peas and carrots, Mbahaotu compares it to biryani. But the procedure is where the magic lies, says the 26-year-old student.Petra Wendelborn too celebrated the second Sunday of Advent with traditional German treats such as Christstollen, special cookies like Zimtsterne and Glhwein (a hot red wine). This is her first Christmas in the city after arriving here last year with her husband. We were surprised at the festive spirit we see. There are tree lighting ceremonies and our Indian friends have carol singing sessions, which we appreciate so much, she says, adding that in Germany, they go to church for mass, but are giving it a skip here to avoid the traffic.Though she may miss out on that part of her annual tradition, Wendelborn doesnt mind too much as she will still be spending the festival with her daughter, who is flying in from Germany soon. While she looks forward to reuniting with her family, Luiz Fernando Pizzani is all too glad to be miles away from them this Christmas. The Brazilian is a brewmaster at The Big Pitcher and says Christmas came early with him brewing a special plum cake ale for the microbrewery. Back home, I have to worry about the gifts to give and spending time with relatives, which can be slightly annoying. Of course, I miss my family but Im just looking forward to a quiet Christmas here in Bengaluru, he says."

Onions which cost as less as Rs 25 a kilo about six months ago is now being sold for the past few weeks at `180, wholesale. In the wake of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association, the umbrella body of hotels in the state, expressing their displeasure over the rising prices and a plan to begin protest activities in the state, Express speaks to housewives and event caterers whose budgets have exceeded expectations.The onion which is an essential commodity in the kitchen is now merely a dream due to its unaffordable pricing. For a family that primarily survives on chappatis, our side dish almost always comprises onions. Therefore, it is sparsely used in curries now. Perhaps, we should try growing small onions in our terrace gardens, said Deepa M, a homemaker.Sarah C M, a retired bank employee, is unsure about the feasibility of growing onions in the state considering its geographical and economic reasons. But, anticipating shortage, the government can at least ensure that adequate stock is provided, remove middlemen and distribute it through civil supplies stores to prevent hoarding, thereby regulating prices, she said. Caterers claim to be the most affected lot with the wedding season underway.The requirement can be managed in a vegetarian sadya, but as onion is a primary ingredient in non-vegetarian dishes. The situation we face is rather drastic. It is the event season now, and business isnt smooth as expected, said Prince George, state president, All-Kerala Caterers Association.Can caterers charge an additional amount due to the unanticipated expenses? Hisham Kabir of Ideal Caterers at Padma, said they could lose their clients if rates are increased. Another catering service will agree to the price that the customer is willing to pay. So, increasing rates is not an option. Dried onions are an apt substitute, they are long-lasting and has the same flavour. But as the processing cost is high, people do not opt for it, he added."

Things have reached such a state that people are now preferring to get three kg onion instead of an all-expenses-paid trip to Goa. While the social media is abuzz with memes and jokes on surging onion prices, city-based bus aggregator company AbhiBus, introduced a scheme where Hyderabad customers booking their bus tickets on Abhibus.com can participate in a contest where they could either win an all-expense-paid trip to Goa, win an iPhone or an e-bike or three kg onions.Results showed that more than 54 per cent opted for onions as their prize while Goa option was chosen by 46 per cent. Clearly, customers are willing to place their bets on onions over Goa or other aspirational options - reflecting how onions shape their daily lives. Anyone booking their tickets on the platform between December 10 and December 15 can enter into the contest by selecting their preferred option. Before this, whenever the ticketing platform ran an offer that had Goa trip as an option, it always trumped all other prizes on offer, but this is the first time consumers relegated Goa to the second spot."

(File) The average traded price of the bulb in the wholesale market of Pimpalgaon in Nashik districts Niphad taluka on Thursday was Rs 6,000 per quintal  a correction of over Rs 500 since Wednesday. (File)Notwithstanding a correction in wholesale markets, onion prices in retail markets in Maharashtra continued to remain high with the bulb trading at an average of Rs 100 per kg. Trade sources are now speaking of an imminent dip in onion prices as domestic arrivals are set to increase in the second half of December.The average traded price of the bulb in the wholesale market of Pimpalgaon in Nashik districts Niphad taluka on Thursday was Rs 6,000 per quintal  a correction of over Rs 500 since Wednesday. The bulb was trading over Rs 8,000 per quintal since the start of December, but prices have started coming down starting December 9. This correction, NCP MLA and chairman of the market Diliprao Bankar said, was due to improved arrivals.Arrivals will increase after December 15, after which prices will collapse, he said.Bankar has asked the central government to allow exports of onions to prevent a collapse in prices once arrivals improve. If imports are allowed, we should be allowed to export, else prices will collapse in wholesale markets, he said.Bankar opined that imported onions had failed to make much impact in wholesale or retail markets. Their lack of pungency has not gone down well with the consumers. Also, the quantum of imports is negligible as compared to the consumption of the country, he said.Maharashtra alone is estimated to consume about 5,000-6,000 tonnes of the kitchen staple on a daily basis. Till date, about 20,000 tonnes of imported onions have entered markets, with private traders alone bringing in about 7,000 tonnes.The correction in wholesale rates is yet to reflect in retail rates, with the data maintained by the Price Monitoring Cell (PMC) of the Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies showing the average retail rate to be about Rs 100 per kg. Retailers in cities such as Pune and Mumbai have been selling their stock at around Rs 110-120 per kg. Bankar said retail prices would correct themselves in the next few days as more and more stock reaches such outlets from wholesale markets. The stock is in transit. Once it reaches, there is going to be a large-scale price correction, he said.Suresh Deshmukh, a commission agent operating out of the Dindori wholesale market in Nashik district, ruled out any chance of stocking by traders. With the premium rates being offered, it would make sense to sell rather than stock, he said.Officials of the district collectorate are keeping a close watch on onion prices and daily sales. Wholesale traders can now stock only 250 quintals while retail traders can stock only 20 quintals of the bulb, as of December 3. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The supply line, which was unsteady over the last two-three weeks, has been getting into the groove. Twelve onion-laden trucks from Nashik reached Koley Markert on Thursday. Another 12 have reached the wholesale market in Posta.Apart from other states, freshly harvested onion has started arriving the city from Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum, said an agri-marketing department officer on Thursday. More than 100 tonnes of onion has been supplied to the city markets and the agri-marketing department will now keep a close watch on onion prices post this supply.Retail onion prices have already plunged below Rs 100/kg on city fringes. In the city proper, it will take a day or two more as retail traders have a stockpile of unsold onion they bought at a very high wholesale price. Much of the stock will be exhausted in a day and the price will plunge subsequently, explained a retail market expert.In wholesale markets, onion prices have dropped significantly. The smaller variety was sold for Rs 2,700-Rs 2,800 per 40kg bag and the bigger variety was priced at Rs 3,200-Rs 3,400 per bag. This is the first time in last two months that the wholesale price has dropped below Rs 3,000 per kg.The state governments sale of onion at subsidized rate has upset the retail market. Retailers have got discredited. We want the onion price to plunge to the normal level so that the retail market stabilizes, said Sujit Ghosh, a potato-onion retailer at Behala Old Market.The state government on Thursday sold 75 tonnes of onion through its 131 Sufal Bangla stores and 934 ration shops at Rs59/kg. We will continue to sell onion at this price till the price range stabilizes, said a senior agri-marketing department officer.The onion price will certainly dip below Rs 100/kg in a day or two. The new crop has hit city markets. This freshly harvested onion from Nashik cannot be hoarded as they are highly perishable. This onion is bound to pull the price down. But a section of retailers is refusing to go by this market dynamics and are sticking to the price of their old stock, said Kamal De, president of the West Bengal Vendors Association and member of the Market Tusk Force appointed by the state government.Meanwhile, the enforcement branch kept a close watch on retail markets across the city and carried out a few raids against hoarding."

Last week, the ministry had reduced the stock holding limit on wholesalers to 25 tonnes from 50 tonnes.The ministry had also directed state governments to carry out immediate anti-hoarding operations to ensure the supplies in the markets are augmented and stock holding limits are strictly enforced.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

A calm, persuasive group went house to house, talking about local issues, and policies that hurt.The team asked housewives why they were paying so much for onions, evoking instant support from half the constituents, who were seething with rage over skyrocketing onion prices slicing into their kitchen budgets.The onion couldnt be used among the Marwari Jain voters, who shun the spicy vegetable, so when addressing Jain businessmen, they asked them why their businesses were uniformly down, and spoke about policies like demonetisation, GST and other central policies which had slowed down growth and hurt their wallets. It touched a chord, for many in the business community were angry about shrinking profits, and complained that during Dhanteras, they had little money to splurge. Throughout the campaign, the team did not badmouth PM Narendra Modi or anyone in the rival parties, but only cautioned them to think and vote.Which paid handsome dividends to Rizwan Arshad, whose win was the only cheering factor for the Congress in Bengaluru. Rizwan, who faced the ignominy of having twice lost the parliamentary election from Bangalore Central, badly needed this win.The Congress team  campaign manager Partha Prathim Das, Ajay Singh, Vijay Singh, MLC Srinivas Mane, Ravi Basavraj, who is son of an MLC, and in-charge Shantinagar MLA NA Haris  drew up a strategy keeping in mind the demographics of Shivajinagar, which has Muslim dominant areas and also mixed population localities.The managers were sensitive to local caste equations and politely told Rizwan Arshad, a Muslim, not to go to orthodox Hindu homes where he may not be welcome and could lose votes. Instead, Jewargi MLA Ajay Singh and MLC Vijay Singh spoke to the residents here.In many households, where unemployment or underemployment was noticeable, the team had a separate pamphlet on unemployment, and spoke about policies affecting the job market. This enthused the youth about voting for a candidate who would ensure jobs and the right policies.While other Congress candidates were demanding that star campaigners like Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar stage rallies, this team did not put up such a demand.Their other worry was the serious divide in the minority vote between Tanveer Ahmed of the JDS and Abdul Hannan of SDPI. Though written off, the Congress team did not panic; instead, they counted the potential voters -- 72,000 Muslim votes, about 12,000 Christian votes, and others. They also made the voter aware of the risk of a vote divide.While the IMA scam involving former MLA Roshan Baig did play a role, the team also learnt that Rizwan had lost last time mostly due to the Balakot factor. Ajay Singhs office in Jayamahal, which runs Accident Relief Centre, has about 170 employees, of whom 120 are Shivajinagar voters. They too helped swing it for Rizwan Arshad."

His brother Naga Babu and senior leader Nadendla Manohar were also present while the partys lone MLA Rapaka Varaprasad did not take part in the protest.

One such hoarding was seen attached to a 108 ambulance, which was reportedly intercepted by a TDP activist.The ambulance staff, upon being intercepted by TDP activist Battula Venkata Ramana, reportedly told him Rapakas flex was printed a month ago for thanking the Chief Minister for hiking their salaries. Later, it was taken to Mamidikuduru for framing and then to Nagaram, for which an autorickshaw was arranged. As the vehicle developed glitches, the flex was shifted to a 108 ambulance, which was coming in the direction.The 108 vehicle already had a photo of YSRC MLA Kondeti Chittibabu, the staffers explained.Rapaka had been distancing himself from party activities as he did not take part in the Rythu Sowbhagya Deeksha. On Wednesday, Rapaka also hailed the YSRC government for introducing English medium in all government schools on the Assembly floor. He went against the partys line on the issue."

Read MoreCHANDIGARH: The Afghani onions  price has fallen to Rs 70-75 per kg from Rs 80 on Thursday. The Indian variety from Alwar stayed at around Rs 80 per kg. The dispatch from Afghanistan has proved to be beneficial for the buyers as they had pushed the price down. It is expected to fall further in the coming days with the arrival of more stock.The rates of onions have dropped within a week. The wholesale rate is Rs 65 to Rs 70 per kilo in Sector 26 market.Kartik Sharma, a wholesaler, said, Due to stock shortage, the rates are fluctuating this much. We are also trying to bring more stock to the market as this will help in balancing the kitchen budget. There are two varieties of Afghani onions in the market, one is rosy pink and other is deeper red. The pink variety is of better quality.The onion sellers in Sector 26 market said, The rates depend on the stock. In mid November, when three trucks came to the region, rates had fallen. Same as now, the consignment from Afghanistan came to the wholesalers and rates had fallen.The traders also said Afghani onions are of poor quality when compared with the onions from Alwar. Retail sellers are not purchasing onions from Afghanistan. These are mainly purchased by food caterers, said a trader in Sector 26 market.Onion is one of the necessities of most Indian kitchens. With the street sellers hiking the rates to Rs 110-120 per kg, as they get the onions at Rs 90 per kg from the market, the buyers had to cut down on the onions.Official of Mandi Board said, The fluctuation in rates was due to shortage in supply.

The supply of other vegetables in the market is according the demand of the residents."

She also said the Centre is aware of the pending GST compensation to states and will honour its commitment.Addressing a press conference on the state of the economy along with senior officials, Sitharaman said the government will continue to take measures as and when required to boost growth.Asked by when she expects the economy to revive, she said, ""I'm not engaging in any prediction based thing. I am looking at the economy, where I need to intervene, I am intervening and I shall continue to address the problem of the industry as and when it rises.""She declined to comment on the narrative of stagflation -- high inflation coupled with declining growth.""No comment on that. I have heard it. Stagflation is a narrative which is going on. I am hearing it,"" she said.Rising food prices pushed retail inflation in November to an over three-year high of 5.54 per cent, while industrial sector output shrank for the third month in a row by 3.8 per cent in October, indicating deepening slowdown in the economy, government data showed on Thursday.Many economists, including former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, have expressed fear of India getting into stagflation mode.India's economic growth slowed to a 6-year low of 4.5 per cent in the July-September quarter. With inflation rising, fears of stagflation -- a fall in aggregate demand accompanied by rising inflation -- have resurfaced.Ahead of the crucial meeting of the GST Council, Sitharaman also said the buzz of an increase in GST rates is everywhere other than her office.She was responding to a question on talk of current Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent being raised to make up for the fall in revenues that has even hampered giving compensation to states for loss of revenue from implementation of the indirect tax regime.""Buzz is everywhere other than my office,"" she remarked.Sitharaman, however, did not rule out a hike in GST rates, saying her ministry is yet to apply its mind to it.She further said there is no denying the fact that GST compensation is pending to all states.""I'm also say that it is an article of faith and we should keep up what has been coming to in terms of giving compensation to states,"" she said.On the rising onion prices, the finance minister said prices in some places are coming down with imports of the commodity.With fresh crop coming in the market, the prices will further decline, she said, adding a Group of Ministers (GoM) is regularly reviewing onion prices.On the quantum of revenue shortfall during the current fiscal, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said tax collection data is out till November and the advance tax numbers after December 15 will give fairly good estimate of the tax mop-up.Some realistic estimate will be known after advance tax collection figures are out, he said.While making a detailed presentation on the state of economy, chief economic advisor K V Subramanian said various measures have been taken since August to boost economy. These include moderation in interest rate and infusion of liquidity through various means.Also, capitalisation of public sector banks and giving last-mile funding to realty projects was announced.Subramanian said following RBI guidelines mandating banks to link their lending rates to external benchmarks, all public sector lenders have introduced repo rate linked loan products and 8.18 lakh repo linked loans amounting to Rs 72,201 crore were sanctioned till November 27, 2019.Besides, through MSME bill discounting, about 5 lakh bills worth Rs 12,698 crore were traded till November 15.As part of the government's initiative to clean up the banking system, he said a transparent one-time settlement policy was adopted."

Addressing the media, Subramanian also spoke on the road towards the $5 trillion economy and support for the small and medium businesses.""Evidence of measures to boost investment is actually seen in the record FDI inflows - $35 billion in the first half of 2019-20 as against $31 billion during the same period last year. It's a good sign of foreigners seeing India as a very important destination,"" Subramanian said.Also, capitalisation of public sector banks and giving last-mile funding to realty projects was announced.As much as Rs 4.47 lakh crore has been sanctioned to non-banking financial institutions and housing finance companies to support retail lending, he said, adding that 17 proposals amounting to Rs 7,657 crore had been approved under partial credit guarantee scheme.Also, 66 per cent of budgeted capex of Rs 3.38 lakh crore has already undertaken, he said.He further added that more than 8 lakh repo-linked loans amounting to Rs 70,000 crore have been sanctioned till November 27.It is widely believed that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may announce more measures to lift the economy. India's economy grew at its slowest pace in over six years -- 4.5 per cent -- in the September quarter amid by weak manufacturing, falling consumer demand and private investment.Replying to a question on whether the economic growth with pick in the second half (H2), Sitharaman stated that ""the second half is not over yet"".On reports of hike in GST rates, she said that ""the buzz is every where else, except my office"". Although, the finance minister didn't rule out the possibility.When asked to comment on the rising onion prices, she said: ""Onions are a fast perishable commodity. Due to rain in some places, flooding in some other, crop extent was less and hence the less output. Due to this it has gone out of certain reasonable level.""The finance minister also commented on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's ""rape in India"" remark and termed the statement as ""horrendous"". ""It's a matter of shame that a senior leader of Congress party speaks forgetting the dignity of women,"" she said.With states not being paid compensation for loss of revenue from implementation of GST since August, Sitharaman on Thursday assured the Centre will honour its commitment but did not say by when the dues will be cleared.States -- that surrendered powers to collect taxes on goods and services after local levies got subsumed into the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1, 2017 -- was through legislation guaranteed to be paid for any loss of revenue in the first five years of GST implementation."

The polluted air, the depleting groundwater table, and unpredictable rainfall patterns are severely impacting agriculture and thus overall public health, say experts.Delhis air pollution is seen as a direct result of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. But how many of us have thought about why it was not happening 20-30 years ago?asked Dr. Rashneh Pardiwala, founder and director, Centre for Environmental Research and Education, at the Asia Society India Centres discussion on the impact of the environment on public health in India, on Wednesday.The discussion was opened by photographer, filmmaker and former editor for National Geographic Traveller India Ashima Narain with a presentation of images depicting the impact on the poor.Dr. Pardiwala said Indias groundwater table had decreased by 61% in the last 10 years. In 2009, a law was enacted in Punjab preventing farmers to plant rice until mid-June. To get the field ready for the winter crop of wheat, farmers hurriedly burn the stubble as removing it is labour intensive and time consuming. So when you connect the dots, you know that Delhis air pollution is connected to the groundwater and surface water, she said.Dr. Pardiwala explained how the unpredictable monsoon cycle has impacted agriculture. Last year this time, onions were 20 per kg. Today, because the crop has been affected, it is 120 per kg. What happens due to this is that the poor cannot afford the fruits, vegetables, and pulses and are thus deprived of nutrition, she said.Dr. Nerges Mistry, director, Foundation for Medical Research, highlighted the various forms of pollution  the traditional pollution from the burning of wood, modern pollution from industries and medical pollution from mass production on antibiotics. She said that India not only deals with a high amount of air pollution but the cost of treatment is also very high.There are 36 pulmonary rehabilitation centres in New York where one can be referred to battle the effects of air pollution like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The cost of treatment for an episode is about 15,000 in these centres. In Mumbai, which has five such centres in the private sector, the cost of treatment for an episode is 1 lakh. Thats the kind of disparity, she said."

For every bag of paddy sold, one kg of paddy is deducted towards weight of each gunny bag by agents of millers in the mandis or procurement centres.A gunny bag that has the capacity to stock a minimum of 45 kg grains weighs 650 gram and at least two bags are required to pack a quintal of paddy.While this has been the practice in all the 178 mandis, no steps are being taken by the administration to stop the deduction that farmers claim is illegal.Consider this - around 40 lakh quintal of kharif paddy will be procured in the district this procurement season.Going by the deduction, for 40 lakh quintal paddy there will be deduction of over 28,000 quintal of paddy towards gunny bags which is valued more than Rs 5.20 crore.The minimum support price of one quintal fair average quality paddy is Rs 1,815.We have been raising this issue with the authorities concerned but to no avail. The deduction was done last kharif procurement season as well, said Santanu Mund, director of Khairpadar PACS who is also a farmer from Brahman Chenai village.Millers too are unhappy over the gunny bag depreciation charge. They alleged that the Civil Supply Corporation is paying only Rs 14.05 towards depreciation charge of three gunny bags which should be at least Rs 20.They said the Government should change the procurement policy for benefit of the millers.Meanwhile, the district administration has drawn the plan for ensuing rabi crop season when 2.23 lakh hectare (ha) of land would be covered under different crops - 59,197 ha under paddy, 1,16,809 ha under pulses, 23,868 ha under oilseeds, 19,121 under vegetables and 2,515 ha under onion.Irrigation water would be provided to 92,622 ha through Indravati project, mega irrigation and life irrigation points besides, borewells."

We will wait and watch the trend for a week to 10 days before taking a decision of hiking prices on the dishes that contain onion,"" AHAR president Santosh Shetty told PTI here.AHAR is an apex body which has over 8,000 members of big and small scale restaurants in Mumbai. The rates of onions had increased sharply in the last two months, the tuber which was available in Rs 20 per kg, crossed over Rs 100, Shetty said.""There are many hotels and restaurants which have cut down on onion-based items. If this situation continues, we will be left with no option but to increase the prices as we cannot sustain the business,"" he added.The AHAR members had called for a meeting of hotel and restaurant owners last week to decide on the future course of action. In India, especially in Mumbai, onion is used for making gravy in almost all dishes. It is also served as Salad and Topping for free. But, after the rate hike, the restaurateurs stopped offering it for free.Average onion prices across major cities have jumped five-fold in the last one year to Rs 101.35 per kg as domestic production in Kharif and late-kharif seasons (summer-sown) is estimated to have declined by 22 per cent.The untimely prolonged rains in the major onion growing states of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during the harvesting period of September and October damaged the crops. To curb the rising prices of the tuber the government has taken various measures like creating onion buffer of about 57,373 tonnes during Rabi 2019, the ban on exports since September 29, facilitation of import, the imposition of stock limit on traders among others.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Police cases have been filed over missing sacks of onions in a number of Tamil Nadu villages as the bulbs prices have been touching Rs 180 to Rs 200 a kg. Most states have been caught unawares by the sudden shortage of this culinary staple. Indias onion produce went from 16.81 million tonnes in 2012-2013 to 23.48 million tonnes in 2018-2019, leading to farmers suffering losses in the initial phases due to the increase in supply. But the rains abruptly curtailed the supply this year. For instance, in TN, where Perumbalur and Tiruchy districts are the largest suppliers of shallots, the freshly sowed crops suffered severe damage in the floods and the subsequent misty conditions.Big onions are produced both during the Kharif and Rabi seasons. The Rabi crop is sown in October and harvested in March. It comes from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, and is consumed from April to October. But the heavy rains and floods damaged this crop. The rains also hit the Kharif crop sown in Andhra and Karnataka during summer. The shortfall has prompted the government to order onions from abroad, including Turkey and Egypt. But the Egyptian varieties have few takers in TN despite being sold for Rs 110 a kg as against home-grown ones (Rs 160 a kg). Traders said the imported dark red variety had too many layers that added to the weight, but were useless for cooking.Onions have even brought down governments. In 1998, the then Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma said the poor do not eat onions anyway. He was hurriedly replaced by Sushma Swaraj, but the damage had been done and the BJP lost the polls. This history should remind governments of the importance of building good storage facilities to save the harvested crop from the vagaries of monsoons and floods. It is high time authorities formulated policies to protect the farmers not only from crop loss but also from excessive produce that triggers a sharp price drop. A protected minimum support price can alone stop farmers from being peeled out of the onion turf."

For some reason, the tickets Id booked on Vayudoot (remember that dodgy airline?) for the handsome sum of Rs 250 got cancelled and I couldnt re-book them. All the other flights to Goa were full by then, and I had to get to Goa for a wedding, so I jumped on a bus that took off from Dadar in the evening. It was a terrible bus. The seats were musty and cramped and the windows were dirty and the curtains smelly. The rattling promised to rearrange my insides, and so I thought the only way I could survive this ride was to get smashed and fall asleep.We reached Mahad, on the Bombay-Goa road, at about 10 pm for a dinner and evacuation stop. I headed straight to the bar to find some booze. Dark rum was the only strong alcohol they had. And although I dont really drink rum, I bought a quarter because the rum was available only in quarts and not millilitres. By the time I had decided, paid and settled down with some rum and cola, the bus revved up as if to start and my fellow passengers started clambering back in.I looked at the bus, and then at the bottle. It didnt seem right to carry the bottle on board, so I just knocked the whole quarter down in one go and jumped on. I was knocked out. Nearly 12 hours later I woke up in Mapusa, Goa. I had missed the whole ride, including a couple of stops and the breakfast halt in Kudal. I was hot, hungover and hungry.Looking out of the window, I realised the bus terminated at Mapusa and would not go on to Panaji. Too disoriented to find out more, I went off to try and deal with my hunger. Destiny led me to Caf St Francis Xavier. Its one of the oldest eateries in Mapusa. Here I had my first tryst with real sorpotel, sausage and curry rice. The sorpotel was mature and fiery, the vindaloo sour and spicy and the sausage, an acquired taste that took me a minute to acquire, all eaten with hot poi (Goan bread) a side of beef patties, croquettes and potato-and-egg chops.My life thereafter became one merry ride of vindaloos, sorpotels and chorizo. Occasionally, caldine, cafreal and xacuti. Without even looking back to see whether this small state with a vast Hindu population had another cuisine.It was at the Mandovi Hotel in Panaji, some time later, that I discovered the vast world of Hindu Goan cuisine. With dishes like Hooman, a mild and sour mackerel curry made with grated coconut paste and spices; muddoshya (lady fish), slightly different from the Christian Goan fish curry because of the spice mix; khatkhate, a mixed-vegetable and lentil stew cooked by the states Goud Saraswat Brahmins, spiced with curry leaves, ginger, black pepper, chillies and turmeric. Its a must on days of fasting when the community eats just vegetarian food.Udid Methi is another kind of curry typical of the Saraswats of Goa and Karwar. Its unusual taste comes from a combination of black gram and dried fenugreek seeds that combust excitedly with mackerel. And finally, the kaju biyaam tondak, made with fresh raw cashew nuts, coconut and no onion or garlic; you can add to it almost anything  vegetables, lentils, pulses  because the raw cashew or bibya in this dish is used as a pulse.Unless youre visiting a Saraswat Goan home, though, the Hindu cuisine is hard to find. I just discovered a whole lot of it at Goa Portuguesa in Dadar. My early advertising and theatre days in the 80s and 90s were spent guzzling alcohol, feasting on prawn-stuffed papads and gorging on choriz pav while a merry crooner with a guitar serenaded us with old nostalgic songs and merry Konkani numbers at this fun-filled restaurant. Chef Deepa Awchats menu of Goan Hindu food for me went quite unnoticed amid the haze of vinegar, pork and bread. But then I was invited to a feast last week. A feast to celebrate 31 years of Goa Portuguesa. A feat not many restaurants in Mumbai can boast of.I decide to go, for old times sake, this time determined to concentrate on the food. And Im so glad I did. Of course there was the inevitable pork sorpotel, nearly pickled and the finest Id eaten in a long time; caldine prawn curry with ukade tandool (red Goan rice), artfully flavoured with kismur (dried shrimp roasted crisp, garnished with chopped onion, coriander and spices).But it was the Goan Hindu food that stood out. Tender coconut and cashew nut sukke (juliennes of the two sauteed with tomatoes and spring onion); rajma tondak (rajma and French beans seasoned with Goan spices and simmered in coconut milk); moongacho ghati (sprouted green gram with dry coconut and cashew nut, tempered and cooked in coconut milk); green pea xacuti (cooked in a dark coconut gravy); and tisreo sukke (clams sauted in onion and freshly ground spices, garnished with grated coconut).The meal ended with Amore being belted out in the background and a serving of serradura, a simple dessert which is a combination of sweetened whipped cream, powdered tea biscuits and a chilled bowl of trifle pudding. The evening transported me back to Goa, and did it without a single drop of alcohol. Now thats a feat."
2019-12-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/after-onion-milk-price-hike-is-new-headache-for-government-food-inflation-6169021/,"After onion, milk price hike is new headache for government","Contrast this to the period since 2010 before this government assumed office, which saw the MRP of full-cream milk in the Delhi-NCR market going up by Rs 18 per litre, while amounting to Rs 14 for toned milk. (File) Contrast this to the period since 2010 before this government assumed office, which saw the MRP of full-cream milk in the Delhi-NCR market going up by Rs 18 per litre, while amounting to Rs 14 for toned milk. (File)After onion, its milk that seems to be pinching the pockets of consumers. On Saturday, the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), better known as Amul, and the National Dairy Development Board-owned Mother Dairy hiked the maximum retail prices (MRP) of their various pouch milk variants by Rs 2 per litre.This marked the second such rate revision undertaken by the two dairy majors in the current year.However, it can be seen (chart, page 2) that the milk MRP increase during the NDA governments tenure, since its first tenure started on May 26, 2014, has been quite insignificant. The overall rise in the last more than five-and-a-half years works out to just Rs 8 per litre, with half of it coming within the past seven months.EXPLAINED Signals food inflation As Indias largest crop by value bought and consumed daily, milk is more representative of the return of food inflation. Unlike onion, the prices of which can be expected to fall after March, the milk supply situation may take longer to ease.Contrast this to the period since 2010 before this government assumed office, which saw the MRP of full-cream milk in the Delhi-NCR market going up by Rs 18 per litre, while amounting to Rs 14 for toned milk.The price trend also mirrors consumer food inflation, which averaged below 3.3 per cent year-on-year during the NDA governments first term from June 2014 to May 2019, as against 11 per cent-plus between 2009-10 and 2013-14 under the Congress-led UPA.While consumers have had a relatively good deal during this regime, the same cannot be said about farmers, though.The average procurement price paid to milk producers by GCMMF unions, for instance, rose from Rs 298 per kg of fat in 2008-09 to Rs 535 in 2013-14. That, for full-cream milk containing 6 per cent fat and 9 per cent solids-not-fat, translates into an increase from Rs 18.42 to Rs 33.06 per litre or 79.5 per cent. But since 2013-14, the average producer price has gone up by only Rs 155 to Rs 690 per kg fat or Rs 42.64 per litre in 2018-19. That is less than 29 per cent over five years.This relatively bad deal for producers is whats witnessing some correction now.Consumer food inflation in November touched 10.01 per cent, the first time it has crossed single digits since December 2013. This is being reflected in milk as well, with both cooperative and private dairies reporting 4-5 per cent lower procurement so far this fiscal compared to in 2018-19.GCMMF unions alone  perhaps, for the first time  have recorded a 5-6 per cent drop in milk collection, despite paying Rs 100-110 more per kg fat to their 30 lakh-odd producers. Meanwhile, skimmed milk powder prices have roughly doubled to Rs 300 per kg levels in the last one year.The reasons for the tightness in supply may be partly weather-related and partly structural. The flush season for milk  when production by animals goes up due to better fodder and water availability, besides lower temperatures and humidity  is normally from October till March. This time, the flush has been delayed because of excess rains from September through November.Its been raining intermittently, so much so that even the open fields where animals graze are waterlogged. The fodder isnt coming up, as the water has to go down first for that. Now that the winter has set in and the rains have also subsided, the flush should take off. The demand situation, too, is likely to ease with the end of the marriage season, says the chairman of a leading south-based private sector dairy company.As far as structural reasons go, R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF, feels that the extended three years or so period of low prices have resulted in farmers reducing herd sizes and also under-investing in animal nutrition and health. On top of it, the cost of maize, cottonseed oil cake, de-oiled rice bran and other feed ingredients has also increased. The recent price revisions should hopefully encourage farmers to buy more animals and feed them better, he says. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-cost-of-food-inflation-economic-slowdown-rbi-agriculture-modi-govt-6172223/,The cost of food,"The right question to ask, then, is whether this inflation, which has been sudden and sharp, is transient. The right question to ask, then, is whether this inflation, which has been sudden and sharp, is transient.Retail food inflation crossing 10 per cent, the first time in nearly six years, isnt good news for an economy already mired in a deep slowdown. The suddenness of the increase (from under 3 per cent in August to 10 per cent-plus in November) and the fact that the Narendra Modi governments tenure has been marked by low consumer food prices (an average rise of hardly 3.3 per cent year-on-year during its first term from June 2014 to May 2019) makes it all the more unsettling. That core consumer inflation  which excludes price increases in the more volatile food and energy components  is still only 3.5 per cent cannot be any consolation. Food prices strongly shape the inflation expectations of Indian households and, in turn, their spending behaviour. Given that the monetary policys overarching concern is price stability, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for one, has to pay as much attention to inflation expectations as actual inflation. Food inflation, in other words, cannot be dismissed as non-core.The right question to ask, then, is whether this inflation, which has been sudden and sharp, is transient. In the case of onions and other vegetables, that could well be the case. This years unusual combination of delayed onset of the southwest monsoon (resulting in reduced/late kharif sowings) and prolonged unseasonal rains in October-November (damaging the standing crop at the harvesting stage) has caused significant supply disruptions. The impact of it has been felt most in vegetables, which have registered the highest inflation of almost 36 per cent for November. But since the extended rainfall has also helped fill up reservoirs and substantially recharge groundwater aquifers, one can expect a production rebound in the current rabi crop due for harvesting from March-end. However, theres reason to believe that the inflation apparent or likely in pulses, milk (Amul and Mother Dairy have just raised prices) and even sugar is not one-off. Most agri-commodities have gone through a protracted bear phase, with consumer food inflation during the period between September 2016 and August 2019 not only averaging a mere 1.4 per cent, but consistently trailing overall retail inflation. At some point, prices have to play catch-up and its quite possible thats beginning to happen.If food prices are simply correcting from lows, neither the government nor the RBI should do much to stop that. Rather than resorting to export bans, subsidised imports or stockholding restrictions  these will only discourage investments in modern warehousing, cold storage, processing and farm extension support  the focus of policymakers should be on removing structural impediments to the production and free movement of agri-produce. The return of food inflation may not allow RBI to further slash interest rates now, but it certainly opens up room for much-delayed reforms in agriculture. Farmers will not mind the rationalisation of subsidies when prices are looking up. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-18,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/onions-from-alwar-hit-110-per-kg-as-rain-sends-supply-tumbling-in-chandigarh/story-ZpzAUp79BAjajWxaJbyDOO.html,Onions from Alwar hit ₹110 per kg as rain sends supply tumbling in Chandigarh,"chandigarhUpdated: Dec 18, 2019 06:02 ISTOnion prices at apni mandis, which had come down to 90 per kg for the Alwar variant, and 70 per kg for those imported from Afghanistan and Turkey, have become dearer by 20 each, following the rain last week.With supply trucks getting stranded due to the downpour on December 13 and 14, the onion from Rajasthans Alwar has hit an all-time high of 110 per kg, a price that the Nashik variant was fetching in November before its supply ran out.As per Punjab Mandi Board officials, Alwar onion was almost 20 cheaper than that from Nashik.When the latters price had reached 70 per kg in November, the Alwar variety was available for 50 per kg. But as it was inferior in quality, customers still preferred Nashik onion, despite its higher price tag.However, due to the rains in North India last week, supply had been affected. Several trucks were stranded due to the hailstorms in Rajasthan, delaying arrival of fresh stocks in the city. This further caused the vegetables number to dwindle at the wholesale market in Sector 26.Officials said the wholesale price of the Alwar onion has touched 100 per kg here as well.President of the apni mandis in Chandigarh, Parlad Singh, said, Now that the weather has improved, normal supply will resume in a few days and prices will drop soon. However, the prices can continue to increase till then.BL Sharma, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, said the new crop of onions from Nashik will reach the city by the first week of January, and will significantly help bring down the onion rates.FEW TAKERS FOR AFGHANISTAN ONIONSingh said though the onion from Afghanistan was cheaper than the Alwar variety, it hadnt caught the customers fancy. Though their size, which can cross 250gm per onion bulb, captures the buyers attention, they are useless in domestic use, he added.On the other hand, the Turkish variant was smaller in size and considerably better in quality, and was thus being chosen by customers.POTATO PRICES ALSO HEAD NORTHEven though the monsoon rain had majorly affected the prices of only onions and tomatoes, the cost of potato, which was 10 per kg till November 30, has shot up by 200% to 30 per kg.Singh said, The monsoon rain had destroyed the fields of several farmers near Jalandhar, damaging the potato crop. The recent rains have also harmed the local crop. The only supply still in place is coming from Sirhind. The vegetable may become even more expensive if the local crop isnt ready soon."

Pointing at vested interests behind the violence, Kejriwal called for an investigation into the incident and stringent action against the guilty. People are unhappy, people are hitting the streets, is anyone provoking students across thirty-three universities? he questioned.For the first time since the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had opposed in the Parliament, the chief minister spoke extensively and unambiguously against the law.My suggestion to the central government is that this is a very dirty law, I dont know why it was enacted. The entire country is on fire, let them withdraw the law and call a meeting of all the chief ministers to thrash out ways to provide jobs, tackle price rise, fight economic slowdown, re-start factories that have shut down  let the focus be on that.Trying to steer away the debate from just the Hindu-Muslim, Kejriwal said if an all-India NRC (National Register of Citizens) exercise is held, it would be the poor who would stand to lose the most, as he pointed out was the case with another Modi government scheme: demonetisation.I heard a statement by Amit Shah yesterday in a channel  that those who will not have documents, whether that person is a Hindu or Muslim, will be thrown outin this country 70% of people do not have documents. The poor do not have documents. And the rich will get their documents made after paying a hefty price, he said.Combining the CAA and the NRC in one narrative, the Delhi CM said while the government wants to give documents to non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries and make them citizens, it wants to do the opposite to Indians  ask them to get documents verified or be thrown out of the country.Those who come from there (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan) will not have documents. So who will provide them with documents? The Government of India. In our country, when the NRC exercise happens, what will happen to those who do not have documents? Will they be thrown out of the country?Criticising BJPs argument in the citizenship debate, Kejriwal argued, In Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan there are nearly three crore non-Muslims. Even if half of them come to our country, who will give them jobs? Where will they be settled? How will housing be provided for them? Will you settle them in Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat, Assam or Tripura? Today, our children are not able to get jobs. Our aim should be to provide them jobs and we are worried about giving jobs to Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Afghanistanis.Highlighting the economic slowdown in the country, Kejriwal questioned the timing of the law. Today, the price of onions has reached Rs 200, the price of potatoes is steadily rising, price rise taking a huge toll, the economy is in a dire state, all factories are shutting down. Was the CAA the only issue? What was the need to set the country on fire? Our students are being rained with lathis, girls are being beaten up inside their hostels, students from thirty-three universities are on the roads.The chief minister, who commonly uses terms like aam aadmi (common people) and janata (public), on Wednesday used the term nagrik, signalling the importance of the citizenship for the people.Recalling his own days as a student in IIT between 1985 and 1989, the chief minister wondered if he could have been able to afford the education had it not been for the monthly fees of Rs 32 and scholarships. I want to tell all governments that education budgets should not be slashed, he said in support of the JNU protests against the fee hike.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

(Express photo: Ganesh Shirsekar) Thousands protest against the new citizenship law at August Kranti Maidan in Mumbai on Thursday. (Express photo: Ganesh Shirsekar)Students across several educational institutes came out in large numbers on Thursday in a show of solidarity to protest police action against students of Jamia Milia Ismailia and Aligarh Muslim University.Apart from major institutions such as IIT-Bombay, TISS and Mumbai University, students of minority institutions and other colleges also came forward to show their support. Mobilisation drives were conducted across college campuses ahead of the protest on Thursday. Students will also hold another rally on December 27 from Ambedkar Bhavan in Dadar to Byculla.Dr Saeed Jaunpuri, who recently finished his internship from Mumbai Tibia Unani College in August, wrote over his white coat Will not give any documents till the PM reveals his degree.The PM should show us his educational degrees. If youre the first person in the country, you should be fearless about your own documents. Why should one give documents to prove his citizenship? My father and grandfather have given their hard work and contribution for this country, said Jaunpuri.Jaunpuri, who said he has friends in Delhi, Aligarh and Lucknow, added that students were being harassed.We want a united India that believes in the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi and B R Ambedkar. BJP wants to break the foundation of our united country, said Maharashtra Students Union President Siddharth Ingle.The protests were not only about standing in solidarity with our fellow students from across the country, but also about sending a stern message that the youth of today reject the divisive politics in the form of CAA. Furthermore, it is also an expression of constitutional solidarity without getting divided by the current governments attempts. Tushar Gandhi had also stated today that if Bapu were alive today, hed stand with us today, said Manas Gubbi, an alumnus of St Xaviers College.Former Islamic studies professor of St Xaviers College and Director General of Wisdom Foundation, Dr Zeenat Shaukat Ali, came wearing a white dress to symbolise peace.Inclusiveness is the hallmark of India. The act is giving a wrong impression and message to the world about us and who we are. Why are we spending all this money when there are people in our country who are dying from hunger? Last week I brought onions for Rs 160 a kilo, she said.Im a Gandhian and August Kranti Maidan is a place where revolutions began peacefully and non-violently. The preservation of the constitution says we are a secular democratic republic, all religions are equal, Ali added.Meanwhile, the TISS Teachers Association lent its support to activities by the students union.These profoundly divisive attempts by the present government to discriminate between citizens on the grounds of religion has damaged the secular fabric of India and created massive unrest in several states across the country, said the statement issued by the association.The TISS Literature Festival, which was to be conducted on December 20 and 21, has been postponed by the TISS literary society.While the theme of TLF 2019 was supposed to bring to light the role that art and journalism play in dissent and democracy, we cannot ignore that such instances are not in isolation and deserve our utmost attention. We believe that the current condition of the country does not only cause political distress, but also personal, mental and existential distress, and so continuing with our plans is out of the question, said literary secretary Nikita Pathak in a statement.

In its 1,500-page chargesheet, the police have booked five persons under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and Indian Penal Code for attempting to export a controlled substance without clearance from the Narcotics Control Bureau, and also for forgery.FUGITIVE DRUG supplier Kailash Rajput has emerged as the orchestrator in last Decembers failed attempt to illegally export 100 kg of 1-Phenethyl-4-Piperidone  the precursor to the opioid Fentanyl  to Mexico, the Mumbai Police has claimed in its chargesheet submitted before city civil and sessions court last week.In its 1,500-page chargesheet, the police have booked five persons under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and Indian Penal Code for attempting to export a controlled substance without clearance from the Narcotics Control Bureau, and also for forgery. Two persons, including Rajput, have been named as wanted accused in the chargesheet.This is our first chargesheet in the case. We are carrying out further investigations and will be filing more chargesheets subsequently, said Shivdeep Lande, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC).Rajput, who fled to Dubai in 2014, had enlisted a Vasai-based exporter, paid him to procure the controlled substance and instructed him to send the consignment by air cargo to a Mexican firm, the chargesheet stated. Police investigations have revealed that the firm manufactures paper products and is not engaged in the trade of chemicals.The ANC blew the lid off the alleged drug trafficking attempt after arresting three men on the Western Express Highway in Vile Parle, close to the international airport on December 26, 2018. Salim Dola (52), Chandramani Tiwari (41), Sandeep Tiwari (38) and Ghanshyam Saroj (43) were found in possession of four drums, each filled with 25 kg of 1-Phenethyl-4-Piperidone.The men had allegedly falsely declared the substance to be Organic Sacha Inchi Powder, which is extracted from a plant of the same name and considered extremely rich in protein. The consignment was to be sent to a company named Vesuvius Mexico SA de CV in Mexico City.The crucial breakthrough for the police arrived in September this year, with the arrest of 44-year-old businessman Wasim Abrehani. In his statement, Abrehani, who exports onions and rice to Dubai, claimed that he was introduced to Rajput by a business partner while on holiday to the UAE in November 2018.Abrehani said in his statement that Rajput had asked if he could procure 1-Phenethyl-4-Piperidone for him.Having no experience in dealing with chemicals, Abrehani had asked Rajput what it was used for and whether its export was legal, but received no reply, the chargesheet stated.Once back home the next month, Abrehani gave serious thought to Rajputs request and sought the assistance of his friend and frequent drinking partner Chandrmani Tiwari, who sells cellphones and an acquaintance, Sandeep Tiwari.The chargesheet stated that in the first two weeks of December 2018, Tiwari purchased 100 kg of the substance from a chemical manufacturing firm in Rajkot for Rs 7.5 lakh. Abrehani, however, quoted a price of Rs 9 lakh to Rajput, who delivered the cash to him through a courier.However, the chargesheet added that when Rajput instructed Abrehani to export the substance to Mexico, both he and Tiwari were hesitant. It is then that Tiwari allegedly enlisted Salim Dola, a friend of his from Vasai with a history of narcotics offences.Rajput allegedly paid Dola Rs 5 lakh to fraudulently use the KYC details, import-export code and letterhead of a firm located in Mumbai and create fake a packaging list and invoice to be billed to the Mexican firm. The Mumbai Police is yet to hear from its Mexican counterparts on the identities of contrabands intended recipients.In the past, both Abrehani and Rajput were also investigated by the Mumbai Police after two men were arrested in Amboli in January 2018 in possession 13.5 kg of Mephedrone valued at Rs 2.28 crore.Rajput is also wanted in connection with the 2017 arrest of Abu Aslam Azmi, the nephew of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi, for allegedly attempting to courier 5 kg of the synthetic drug methamphetamine, worth Rs 40 crore, from Delhi to London. The Delhi Polices Special Cell had then suspected Rajput of putting Azmi in contact with a network of drug distributors and peddlers and of transporting the methamphetamine abroad through them.

But it also means fresh vegetables, soaking in the sun, eating warm and flavourful dishes. India celebrates this bounty with its indigenous menu and no matter what part of the country you are from, it is a toasty treatTeliya Mah in Himachal Pradesh, Nimona in Uttar Pradesh, Makki ki Roti, Sarson ka Saag across North India, Nolen Gur and Pithas in Assam, West Bengal and Odisha, Kollu Rasam in Tamil Nadu to name a few.In India, winter months are exciting for any chef because of quality and availability of produce. From date, jaggery (Nolen Gur) to so many different types of green vegetables and fruits. I have experimented with a wide variety of winter bounty such as persimmon, red carrots, sarson, etc. Also winter means frequent travel to Old Delhi for Nihari and fried chicken, says Chef Sujan Sarkar of ROOH. Chef Dharmen Makwana of The Leela, Delhi, talks of the winters green abundance as well. From a variety of berries available to sweet lime and mandarins and fresh vegetables like the dark orange carrots that we get locally and are great for Indian sweets or for juicing. I also use fresh peas and turnips, fenugreek leaves heavily in winter. This season also gets the best and fresh beetroot and grapes.The cold nights peppered with sunny days also mean rehabilitation for the body and with enhanced appetite and abundance of seasonal ingredients. One such delicacy for Chef Sarkar is Daulat ki Chaat. Daulat ki Chaat is only available in winter months and no way you can get that in any other time of the year. One of the best-kept secrets of Indian confectionery. This also demonstrates sustainable food culture and seasonality, he says. An unusual comfort food that is loaded with health boosters for Makwana is braised lamb trotters with shiitake mushrooms, dry beancurd skin and bamboo shoot. It is cooked with a lot of ginger, garlic, spring onion and star anise, and served with gingerly rice and spiced chili lime sambal. It was one of the first few dishes I learnt from an old Hainanese Masterchef and the benefits are huge as most of the ingredients used have several health benefits. Garlic and ginger have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant benefits coupled with star anise, which is great for treating cough and cold, and aids in digestion and imparts a lovely flavour when cooked in stews. Beancurd is higher in protein than meat and the use of shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoot adds more benefits to ones health. The dish tastes wonderful on a cold winter night, he says.As restaurants use winter to showcase their best produce and renditions of seasonal meals, chef and co-owner of Tres, Jatin Malik, says, Winter means roasts, grilling, BBQs, red meats, bakes, cheese red wines, pies, a lot of root vegetables, corn, pumpkins, beautiful local spinach-like bhatua. I love the rich flavour of pumpkin and butternut squash, which is ideally suited for winters. It is such a versatile vegetable that it adapts to various forms of cooking and also lends it flavour very well with what it gets served with.The cold gastronomical comforts, however, vary outside of India, according to Sarkar. Ingredients-wise, the west is different from India. Red fruits play a massive role, from savoury to desserts, in the west. Plenty of root vegetables, red meat and games are found in abundance there. What is really lacking is citrus fruits and green vegetables. Cured meat and fish, pies and stews are a big part of winter food in the west whereas grilled dishes, green vegetables and good quality sea food are staples of Indian winter diet, he points out. Malik, however, feels that in India not a lot change. We pretty much eat the same meats like chicken, lamb and fish. Whereas a lot of changes for vegetarians. Seasonal vegetables come a lot into play like mongra, pumpkins, colaccacia, squash etc. In the west, a lot of things change in the meats as well. A variety of game meats come into play such as goose, quail, venison. So, accordingly their treatment, cooking styles and accompaniments also change. During summers, a lot of raw food is consumed like ceviche, eaw cured salmon etc, he concludes."

Partha Paul At the protest rally in Park Circus, Kolkata, on Friday. Partha PaulHardening her stance against the new citizenship law and the proposed NRC (National Register of Citizens), Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that her agitation will continue till the Centre revokes both the new law as well as the NRC.Calling the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) anti-people, Banerjee sought Prime Minister Narendra Modis intervention and demanded its immediate revocation. The CM was addressing mediapersons at the Trinamool Congress headquarters on Friday.Later at a rally in Park Circus, the CM said: The PM was present in Parliament on the day when the Citizen (Amendment) Bill 2019 was passed. But he was absent when the voting took place. So, he also did not support the Bill. He is basically against it. Therefore, I am requesting him to withdraw the Bill for the countrys sake.It is not about any political victory or defeat. It is the matter of our country Withdraw CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and NRC, she said in her appeal to Modi.The BJP is imposing one political agenda after another under the impression that Indians are peace-loving under the impression that only it will remain in power, Banerjee said adding that this will not happen.Hindustan mazboot hai, majboor nahi hai (India is strong, not helpless), she added.Amid the growing crititcism on her Thursdays remark over the UN-monitored referendum on CAA, Banerjee said she had only suggested that an opinion poll be conducted by impartial experts of the country, the process for which could be observed by the United Nations.I am proud of my country I have full faith on my countrymen. What I had said was that a gana vote (mass vote or opinion poll) be conducted by a panel of impartial experts, such as the National Human Rights Commission. It can be observed by the UN, she said.Later, Banerjee also said, To cover up onion price hike and growing unemployment, the BJP came up with this Bill. And those who are protesting the Bill are being labelled as anti-national.She added, How many bullets will you fire? How many jails do you have to arrest us? Do whatever you want, our movement will continue.Banerjee also said if former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee would have been there, then he would have never taken up such a step.The rally also saw the presence of several religious leaders, including Muslim, Christian and Buddhist, and spoke against the NRC.Writer Joy Goswami also attended the rally. This Act is an insult to all Indians, he said.Meanwhile, Banerjee also held a meeting with her party MLAs and MPs on Friday, following which she told mediapersons that programmes related to the protest against CAA and NRC will continue till January 1 next year. She asked the party leaders to spread the movement to the grassroots-level.Not only in Kolkata, we will now spread our movement throughout the state.

(File photo) Swapnil Borbade at his stall, selling onion flakes and vegetable powders, at Bhimthadi Jatra. (File photo)Swapnil Borbades stall at the Bhimthadi Jatra, with its array of dried onion flakes and bottles of vegetable powders, is a big hit as many visitors stop to take a look at it. Borbade, a farmer from Rashin village of Ahmednagars Karjat taluka, says in the last few days, business has been brisk with onion flakes being an instant hit. I have also got some export orders which will generate business, he says.With 20 acres of land, Borbade had decided to invest in a processing unit to ensure a steady source of income.To install the unit a year ago, Borbade, who grows crops like sugarcane, wheat, toor, onion, availed a loan of Rs 25 lakh. His idea is simple  generate powder or dehydrated flakes from fresh vegetables after taking the moisture out of them. Such processed vegetables, although still new to the Indian consumer, has a steady market with food processing units, hotels, among others. Other than onion, Borbade also produces powders of pumpkin, bottle gourd and carrot.Talking about his business, Borbade says in the first year alone, his turnover is around Rs 10 lakh.Through my own network, I had managed to get customers in hotels and hospitality industry. Also, around 10 to 20 kg of processed powder has found its way out of the country through traders, he says. A popular product at the Jatra, the dehydrated onion flakes are priced at Rs 450 per kg. Borbade says he requires 12 kg fresh onion to produce a kilo of flakes.I had produced the flakes from onions in my fields and in case of voluminous orders, I would procure them from other farmers, he says.Other than the hospitality industry, Borbades produce has found a market with ayurvedic doctors and sweet shops, among others. His marketing, for the first year, was restricted to Karjat and other areas, but he is hopeful of taking his business forward in the years to come.Dehydrated onions has a market mostly controlled by multinational companies. Due to the preference for fresh produce among Indian consumers, this market has not developed much.At present, the hospitality industry is the biggest consumer of such flakes. Given the crisis in onion trade, such flakes may find a bigger market. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar.Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Saturday accused the Centre of trying to divert attention of people from its failures by bringing in the new citizenship law that aims at snatching away the fundamental rights of people.The government has been regularly failing on all fronts and to divert the attention of people, the BJP leaders have brought in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Jakhar said.He said the BJP was unsuccessfully trying to change the basic feature of the Constitution, something that the citizens would never let it do.The CAA seeks to grant Indian citizenship to refugees belonging to Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities facing persecution on the basis of religion in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, and who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.Chairing a meeting with party workers at Barnala, Jakhar also attacked Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, accusing him of trying to save the party president post by staging protests against the state government. On Saturday, Badal held a protest at Patiala against the Congress-led government.Sukhbir Badal is trying to save his post as president of the SAD by staging protests against the state government. It was he, who had once claimed that the dharna or protests is the job of idles, Jakhar said.Jakhar also backed the stand of disgruntled SAD leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa who attacked SAD leadership and described Sukhbirs appointment of party chief as undemocratic.Only to save a post of minister in the Centre, the leaders of SAD are not issuing any statement against the wrong doings of BJP, said Jakhar pointing out that when the Modi-led government delayed GST compensation to Punjab, the SAD leaders remained silent. It is sad to know that even (former chief minister) Parkash Singh Badal too is mum on these issues, he added.After the meeting, state party senior vice president Kewal Singh Dhillon and other leaders from Barnala gave onions and potatoes to Jakhar for sending the kitchen staples to PM Modi as mark of protest against inflation.

This is despite trials and frontline demonstrations carried out by Kerala Agriculture University in farmers fields proved the feasibility of onion cultivation in the plains of the state.Onion is cultivated in only around 31 hectares at Attappadi in Palakkad, while the commercial cultivation of garlic is in about 400 hectares, mainly in Vattavada and Kanthalloor and parts of Devikulam and Marayur in Idukki.In the case of onion, seedling preparation takes at least six weeks which can be done only in the month of October as short-day condition is ideal for its growth in the nursery period, while it requires long-day condition in the time of bulb formation, that is in January and February. Dry condition is feasible for cultivation of onions but it can withstand up to 75cm rainfall during its 110-day growth duration, said KAU assistant professor Jalaja S Menon.KAU identifies suitable varietiesKAU has identified varieties best suited for the state and appropriate farming protocolsAgrifound Dark Red and Arka Nikethan, Arka Kalyan and Arka Pragati are found to be better-performing varieties in the plainsNovember-December to February-March is the time best suited for onion cultivationOpen land with porous and fertile soil is the bestSix-week-old seedlings should be transplanted after mixing soil with organic inputs and bio-control agents"

(Source: PTI) The new law allows citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who entered India before 2015 after facing religious persecution in three neighbouring countries. The list excludes Muslims. (Source: PTI)Terming the new citizenship law as discriminatory and against the spirit of the Constitution, senior Congress leader Rajeev Shukla Sunday accused the BJP of creating divisions in the society for political gains. He also claimed that there was fear and apprehensions surrounding the proposed nationwide implementation the National Register of Citizens (NRC).Intellectuals, students from IITs, IIMs, professors of top universities and institutions are coming out to register their protest. Can anyone mislead them? They are all educated people. If they are saying something, that means there is something wrong, but the government is not prepared to listen, Shukla said addressing a press conference here.He said there was no need for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as the Centre already had the power to grant citizenship.The new law allows citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who entered India before 2015 after facing religious persecution in three neighbouring countries. The list excludes Muslims.The BJP wants to create divisions in the society for its own political gains, the Congress leader said, as he termed the amendments in the law discriminatory and against the spirit of the Constitution.Anarchy has spread all over the country, from Assam to Gujarat to whole of North India. Students are being beaten on the streets. In many cities, the police have vented out their anger on the journalists. There is chaos everywhere, he added.Claiming that the proposed nationwide NRC would particularly hurt the poor and vulnerable sections of the society, Shukla said, There is fear and apprehension among people about NRC. Enforcement of NRC means people will have to dig out birth, school and other certificates of their forefathers to prove citizenship.Some of the BJPs own allies too have expressed concerns about NRC, he asserted.If NRC is about identifying those who entered the country or settled here illegally, already there are laws to deal with that. Anybody who enters or has entered the country illegally can be sent back, who stops the government from doing so? But what they are doing through this exercise is creating divisions in society for polarisation of votes, Shukla claimed.Asked about the violent protests against the amended citizenship law and the proposed NRC, Shukla said, All should follow the path of non-violence in protests as shown by Mahatma Gandhi.Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi put up a strong defence of the contentious law at a rally in Delhi on Sunday and accused the Congress, its allies and urban naxals of spreading the rumour that Muslims will be sent to detention centres.Modi said lies were being spread about the NRC and asserted that the previous Congress governments had mooted it. His government has not discussed it so far either in Parliament or in Cabinet, he added.He also hit out at the Centre over the economic situation of the country, saying, The economy is in a bad shape, farmers plight is known to all, unemployment is at its peak, prices of essential commodities are soaring, onion prices have shot through the roof, but the government is silent on this.(With inputs from PTI) The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The department has started distributing onion seeds at a subsidised cost in Tiruchy. On Sunday, 700 kg of onion seeds were brought to the district.Heavy rain had damaged hundreds of acres of harvest-ready onions in Karnataka, a key supplier to Tamil Nadu which led to a surge in demand.The soaring demand is yet to be quelled despite onions being brought in from Nashik and Madhya Pradesh as well as Egypt and Turkey. For the past couple of weeks, onion prices have been ruling at over Rs 100 per kg.Farmers in the district used to cultivate onions five years ago, but due to price and irrigation issues, they switched to shallots. Thanks to the current crisis, horticulture department officials hope that farmers would resume onion cultivation.Vimala, Deputy Director, Horticulture department, Tiruchy said, For Bellary onions, it takes 90 to 100 days to complete a season, but it is much less for shallots. Due to maintenance costs, many farmers opted for shallot cultivation. Over time, almost all farmers in the district moved away from Bellary onion cultivation. We plan to encourage farmers to plant onions along with shallots.In the first phase, the department is planning to begin onion cultivation on 70 hectares, for which 700 kg of seeds has been brought to be distributed to farmers. Farmers can approach the horticultural office with their adangal to avail onion seeds for free. Farmers need 7 to 8 kg of seeds per acre.Rajendran, farmer in Thuraiyur, said, Most of us quit onion cultivation several years ago as prices were not enough to compensate us. As prices are high now, we are planning to cultivate some onions along with shallots."

The truck was released after seven hours as the recipient of the consignment turned up with the invoice for the purchase.The 21 tons were worth over Rs 27.3 lakhs. Onions do not come under the model code of conduct. But a driver must possess an invoice for such commodities as per the guidelines of the Civil Supplies Department. The truck driver did not have the papers. We also suspected that it could have been transported to be given to voters. So, we seized the onions and informed the Civil Supplies about taking over them, said L Premchandran, the special tahsildar who led the squad.The truck was from Solapur in Maharashtra and en route to a village named Thiitai near Sirkazhi. The officials became more suspicious after knowing the destination, which was not much of a vegetable hub compared to the likes of the markets in Sirkazhi or Mayiladuthurai towns.The squad took the truck to Sirkazhi Police Station and asked the driver named Nanthakumar, who hailed from Oothankarai to produce the bill, which he alleged, he had missed on the way. Big onions sell near Sirkazhi at a wholesale rate of around Rs 130 and the retail rate of Rs 140.According to civil supplies officials, they have the authority to seize onions over the permissible storage of 25 metric tons for a wholesaler and five tons for a retailer.The election flying squads and the static surveillance teams usually seize jewels and cash being transported without documents under the model code of conduct during election times on a suspicion that they could be distributed to voters.They are usually deposited in the local treasury in the taluk until the consignee produces the bills or until the election gets over. Since onions are perishable, the consignee was on a clock. The consignee eventually turned up with the invoice for the purchase.The truck of onions was released around noon on Sunday. According to the officials, the trader asked the truck driver to bring the consignment to his village before taking it to the market."

The home minister was piloting the bills -- CAB and the one on Article 370. Now the prime minister says that it is not a government agenda. Then who is speaking the truth and who is spreading lies?""If what the prime minister has said is true, then will the government stop working on an NPR? We demand that the CAA be repealed, the NRC not be extended to the entire country and the NPR process stopped,"" he said.Both the parties highlighted the discrepancies in Modi's statements and the earlier mentions of the NRC by Shah.They said Shah, during a debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Lok Sabha on November 9, had said the government will implement the NRC across the country, while asserting that ""not a single infiltrator will be spared"", while Modi had stated that it was not discussed.They also questioned how the prime minister said there were no detention centres anywhere when the minister of state for home affairs, in a reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on December 11, said instructions were issued to all the states for setting up detention centres to detain illegal immigrants or convicted foreigners, pending deportation.The Centre had, on January 9, sent consolidated instructions for the construction of detention centres to all states and Union territories, they said.The CPI(M), in its statement, said the Centre told the Karnataka High Court on November 28 that it had written to all the state governments in 2014 and shot off a follow-up letter in 2018 to have detention centres to house foreign nationals illegally staying in India.""During his 90-minute-long speech, Modi did not mention even once the growing miseries that his government and policies are imposing on people's day-to-day life. The economy is in a virtual recession, unemployment is at the highest in half-a-century. Distress suicides by farmers are growing, inflation is eating into people's lives -- people have stopped eating onions due to its exorbitant price.""Clearly, the Modi government's only agenda is to sharpen communal polarisation and divide our people through the spread of hate and violence.

The crop is cultivated in thousands of hectares in Pathikonda and Alur every Kharif and Rabi seasons.This year, it was cultivated in nearly 8,000 hectares.Every tomato farmer invests Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 per acre, including on fertilisers and farmhands. As the crop takes 10 months to yield, crop harvesting is done at least 10 times every crop season.From the first four harvests, they usually get Rs 25 to Rs 40 per kg at wholesale markets. The price decreases in subsequent harvests.Without government intervention, the price may dip further to 20 paise per kg by January, farmers feared.Bumper harvest is the main cause of decreasing rates of tomato crop. Also, this crop does not have a long shelf life. Tomatoes are regularly exported to Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra from here, officials said.Mangali Ramakrishna, a farmer from Gadderalla in Devanakonda mandal, said he cultivated the crop in an extent of five acres by investing Rs 1.5 lakh.After harvesting, the produce was transported to Pathikonda agriculture market in rented tractors. Upon reaching the market, middlemen said the prices have dipped to 50 paise per kg.

Today, with no remunerative price, farmers are in a fix. If the situation continues, it may lead to food shortage in the coming days, he said. Another leader cited onion crisis as an example of an unpredictable future."

Arrival of the fresh crops is expected from the second week of January. This is the end of the season and potato price will remain high till arrival of new crops to the market, Mishra added.However, the supply of potato from West Bengal is near normal with the city receiving over 200 tonne on a daily basis. The actual need of the city is around 250 tonne.The wholesale price of potato at Aiginia, the major mandi of the city, on Monday was Rs 2000 per quintal. However, traders in the retail market were selling at Rs 30 a kg.Though a margin of Rs 10 per kg is too high, retail traders argued that they will suffer loss as the damage of the vegetable in a packet is around 4-5 kg.The onion supply to the city on Monday was around 200 tonne, including 17 tonne from Turkey.The Turkey onion that landed in New Delhi has been despatched to Maharashtra, the major supplier of the vegetable, to many States including Odisha. The Centre had placed order to import 11,000 tonne of onion from Turkey in addition to 6,090 tonne from Egypt.However, prices of other vegetables in Unit-I daily market are moderate."

This, however, will eventually ease out once domestic arrival of onions improves.According to the report, provisional data revealed that India imported 7,070 tonnes of onion in this fiscal year. Of this, 50 per cent came from Turkey, according to traders. However, the price of onions in Turkey soared as a result of the rise in export of the bulb from the country.An agent operating in a wholesale market in Maharashtras Nashik, Suresh Deshmukh, confirmed that Turkey had to halt onion export as the prices there, too, had shot up. He added that they took the same step as India  which banned the export of the bulb to regulate the prices here  to check domestic onion prices.According to the data from the Ministry of Agriculture cited by the report, the area of land under onion cultivation has increased from 2.31 lakh hectares last season to 2.78 lakh hectares by November-end. This is primarily due to onions fetching a good rate in the markets, attracting more and more farmers to ditch other rabi crop for onions.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Onion traders, residents and hoteliers claim that retailers are taking advantage of the festive season and are hoarding onions, as the wholesale rate as of December 24 is only Rs 100.According to data released by the Yeshwantpur Market, onion prices range between Rs 8,500 and Rs 9,000 per 100 kg for large onions, which are of good quality, making it Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. However, the same onions cost Rs 150-Rs 170 per kg in the city.Its really sad that onion rates are not coming down despite wholesale rates being low. Residents have to cough up so much money for onions just before festivals. The quality of smaller, affordable onions is poor, said Pallavi Narahari, a resident of Indiranagar.According to Uday Kumar, an onion trader from Yeshwantpur, the retail rates are kept high as people do not know what the wholesale rate is. He says that people should question retailers regarding this, as it is not in favour of traders or farmers. People are not aware of the wholesale prices. Brokers take a commissioner of 5 per cent, and there are transportation and labour charges too. Waste needs to be accounted for too. Even after all this, the maximum a retailer can sell onions for is Rs 120 per kg, but this margin of almost Rs 70 is very unfortunate, he said.Interestingly, traders also claim that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, which have erupted all across the country, especially in Maharashtra and some cities in North Karnataka from where the major of stock arrives, have taken a toll on transportation of the larger onions.However, though onions have been imported from Egypt and Turkey, the demand for the same is low, despite them looking more appealing and being sold at high rates like the larger native onions, say traders. We hoped the price would come down this week after the government imported onions from Egypt and Turkey, but that has not been the case, a trader told TNIE.An official from Yeshwantpur Market said that onion prices are unlikely to come down in the next week too, as the demand right now is high, and the vegetable is used heavily in festive dishes. If supply does not improve, the price of onions is likely to shoot up further, he said.Local farmers wary as onions come from TurkeyBagalkot: With the local Agriculture Produce Market Committee receiving onions from Turkey, the farmers community is furious, as the price of onions fell drastically by 20 to 35 per cent per quintal in Vijayapura. In less than a week, the price of onions shot up at least eight times in local markets, owing to the drastic fall in its yield. The onion produce was badly affected due to the recent devastating floods in the border areas of Karnataka-Maharashtra. Onion prices went as high as Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 per quintal for top quality onions and poor quality onions were sold at a minimum price of Rs 5,000 per quintal. In Vijayapura, farmers have been standing in queues to sell their onions to traders at APMC, however with onions arriving from Turkey, it has worried the community."

However, there are a few enterprising individuals who have found a way to trump these setbacks.Solution? Growing food at home, something 65-year-old Ganapathy Iyer has been doing for the past nine months. Today, every inch of the 1,000 sqft terrace of his house is producing vegetables that his household needs. I am growing around 22 types of vegetables, said Ganapathy.Based in Kozhikode, Ganapathy has also begun cultivating exotic vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. With the onion price skyrocketting, I thought why not try growing some on my terrace? Ive sowed a row and expecting a good yield in four to five months, he said.According to him, the cultivation on his terrace farm is a continual process. While some plants have begun yielding, others are reaching maturity, said Ganapathy. According to him, he grows vegetables in grow bags and plastic cans that have been modified into pots.There are 200 such bags and cans on my terrace. I have begun getting yield from the ladys finger, cowpea, brinjal and ridge gourds, he said. There are various types of leafy vegetables like a particular variety of taro that has been developed for its edible leaves and stems. Besides the usually-grown vegetables, I also have cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, beetroot, tomatoes, snake gourd, bitter gourd, different types of chillies, ash gourd, bottles gourd, pumpkin and cucumber. I have herbs like mint and coriander along with curry leaves in my terrace farm, he said.Ganapathy also uses drip and wick irrigations. Also, he has used rain shelter to prevent his vegetables from rotting due to excessive rain. Ganapathy practises organic farming. I use coco peat, soil and cow dung to fill the bags and cans. To fertilise the soil, I use groundnut oil cake, he said. He uses neem seed cake to ward off pests and the rain shelter also acts as a pest deterrent. I spend a lot of my time at my terrace farm. My wife helps me out, added Ganapathy. With every inch of his terrace taken up by the grow bags and cans, he is now planning to make use of every inch of the 5.5 cents of land on which his house has been built."

Onion is cultivated in only around 31 hectares at Attappadi in Palakkad, while the commercial cultivation of garlic is in about 400 hectares, mainly in Vattavada and Kanthalloor and parts of Devikulam and Marayur in Idukki.In the case of onion, seedling preparation takes at least six weeks which can be done only in the month ofOctober as short-day condition is ideal for its growth in the nursery period, while it requires long-day condition in the time of bulb formation, that is in January and February.Dry condition is feasible for cultivation of onions but it can withstand up to 75cm rainfall during its 110-day growth duration, said KAU assistant professor Jalaja S Menon. In Kerala, November-December to February-March is the time best suited for onion cultivation, but heavy rain in October during the time of nursery preparation causes major trouble for the farmers.This has to be addressed for the commercial cultivation which can be addressed by fine-tuning technology and adopting new methods, she said.However, the unpredictability of the market price of onions dissuades the farmers, as it can go up to `200 per kg and nosedive to `1 per kg.Hence, more than commercial cultivation, homestead cultivation of onion is more feasible in Kerala through which each family can cultivate onions required for its daily consumption.The grow-bag model cultivation is ideal .According to a 2011 survey, a family consisting of four members requires an average 4kg of onion per month and this can be easily met through homestead cultivation.At the same time, garlic is cultivated on a commercial basis in the state. Dry hill condition is suited for its cultivation and farmers in Idukki are doing well on this front.Onion factsKAU has identified varieties best suited for the state and appropriate farming protocolsAgrifound Dark Red and Arka Nikethan, Arka Kalyan and Arka Pragati are found to be better-performing varieties in the plainsNovember-December to February-March is the time best suited for onion cultivationOpen land with porous and fertile soil is the bestSix-week-old seedlings should be transplanted after mixing soil with organic inputs and bio-control agentsA four-member family requires an average of 4kg onion per month"

The NGO attached with Iskcon, Bengaluru  launched its first kitchen in New Delhis Badarpur area which will cater to nearly 21,000 school children in 24 government schools in surrounding areas.The kitchen has been built with support from the ABB Foundation.Two more kitchens of the foundation will be functional by next week in the city taking the total children served to over 64,000 and covering 134 schools.It was our strong desire to be able to provide quality and hygienic food in the capital and we are happy to see this wish fructified, said the foundations vice-president Chanchalapathi Dasa on the sideline of the event that saw the inauguration of the kitchen by Delhis deputy CM Manish Sisodia.The NGO which had stirred controversy recently over insisting on providing food without onion-garlic in schools due to religious reasons in Karnataka and elsewhere will follow the same rule in Delhi as well. Our food is nutritious, safe and hygienic, Dasa stressed.He also said that while governments  Centre and state put together and pay Rs 7-8 per meal to the foundation, it adds around Rs 6 per plate on its own. A statement by the foundation said that all the new kitchens set up in Delhi are powered by green fuel.A hybrid solar water pump provides the water for cooking, with a capacity to heat 15,000 litres of water to 80C through the year.

Even at 4pm on Tuesday, shops were still open with few customers, unlike last year when most shops closed only late in the evening after clearing their stock.The chicken has turned dearer with prices going up from Rs 80 to Rs 110 per kg over a month. Vendors attribute the low turnover to the economic crisis and customers reluctance in spending money.Another reason for the poor sale at Palayam market is due to the faulty waste management system in place.People find it hard to walk through the market due to the foul smell from chicken waste piled up here. No waste management system has been put in place by the corporation. As a result, waste remain here till noon or night, said Senthil, a meat vendor.People find it more convenient to buy meat from supermarkets and cold storage shops as they can even get it delivered home from these shops. The rise in onion prices is another factor for the low sales this time as it is an essential ingredient in all meat dishes.There are 15 shop meat shop here. Whereas, only three such shops were functioning in the market about three years ago. So it is obvious that the sales will decrease, said Raj, another meat seller.Fish vendors too are a worried a lot. Elias Varghese, a fish vendor for the past 15 years, said he sold fish worth only `100 after sitting in the market for two hours.Two years ago, two hours of work on the Christmas eve could help me fetch `5,000. The fish called Chennavara costs only `250 in the market. But people buy the same fish from Matsyafed for `350. People have lost trust in Palayam market due to the constant raids by health department officials for formalin content. Those who buy fish from wholesale dealers from Vishakhapattanam and Chennai sell at alower rate. But we cant afford to do that as we procure fish from small-time sellers, he said."

Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness.Onion prices, at Rs 100-plus per kg in retail and an average of Rs 6,500/quintal even in Maharashtras Lasalgaon wholesale market, have made headlines in a year that is coming to a close. But its not just onions. There are many other farm commodities whose prices have been looking up, if not soaring, of late.Take pulses: Last year, at this time, arhar (pigeon-pea) was trading at Rs 4,500 per quintal in Latur mandi of Maharashtra. Currently, it is selling at Rs 5,000. Likewise, prices of urad (black gram) in Latur have crossed Rs 7,000 per quintal, compared to Rs 4,500-4,600 a year ago, while that of moong (green gram) in Rajasthans Sumerpur market has gone up from Rs 5,200 to Rs 6,000 levels in the same period. These rates are close to or even higher than the minimum support prices (MSP) of Rs 5,800/quintal for arhar, Rs 5,700 for urad and Rs 7,050 for moong.Read | These farmers who broke the mould point the road ahead for manyThe price increase in pulses would, in fact, have been higher, but for the stocks built from government procurement. During the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 agricultural years (July-June), the Central agencies  National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium  together bought 18.78 lakh tonnes (lt), 44.96 lt and 19.50 lt of pulses, respectively. While stocks in the Central pool with Nafed amounted to nearly 42 lt at its peak in June 2019, the apex agency is still holding 20.90 lt (as on December 21), mainly comprising 16.41 lt of chana, 2.19 lt of moong, 1.99 lt of urad and 0.29 lt of masur (lentil).Those stocks have come useful this year, which saw less area being sown under kharif pulses, courtesy poor monsoon rains till about the last week of July. That, along with excess rains thereafter up to early-November, causing significant damage to the standing crop, has resulted in a decline in kharif pulses production similar to that for onions. The only reason why dal has not gone the pyaaz way is the stocks with Nafed.The absence of such a buffer is now being felt not only in onions, but perhaps also in milk.Last year, around this time, dairies in Maharashtra were paying farmers Rs 19-21 per litre for cow milk containing 3.5% fat and 8.5% solids-not-fat. That same milk is today being procured at Rs 29-31 a litre. In 2018-19 (April-March), India exported 45,082 tonnes of skimmed milk powder (SMP), with the Centre even extending a subsidy of Rs 50/kg to enable dairies to ship out their excess stocks. But with output set to dip in 2019-20, due to the cumulative impact of sustained low producer prices and extended rains, SMP prices have doubled to over Rs 300 per kg in the last one year.Not having created a buffer stock, when dairies were saddled with surplus powder and forced to slash procurement as well as prices paid to farmers, may prove costly soon. The winter and spring months are the flush season for milk. Animals normally produce more during this time because of better fodder and water availability, besides reduced body stress on account of lower temperatures and humidity. This year, though, the onset of flush has been delayed by the late rains, which have not allowed the fodder to grow properly and accumulate sufficient dry matter. Most dairies have recorded negative milk procurement growth so far in 2019-20. It remains to be seen how much of this can be made up for in the next few months before summer, when flush gives way to lean and dairies would need to have sufficient stock of powder for reconstituting into milk.Onions, pulses and milk apart, even commodities such as soyabean, maize and bajra (pearl-millet) are showing some bullishness. Soyabean is quoting at Rs 4,000 per quintal in Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh), up from Rs 3,300 a year ago. Prices of maize at Davangere (Karnataka) have similarly risen from Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,900 and that of bajra from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100 per quintal in Chomu (Rajasthan). The current market prices are higher than the MSPs: Rs 1,760 per quintal for maize, Rs 3,710 for soyabean and Rs 2,000 for bajra.The above price recovery  even sugar seems to be turning around, thanks to a global deficit that has opened up export opportunities for Indian mills  should actually be welcome for an economy desperately looking for good news. The underlying factors here are partly structural (farmers reducing planting or investing less in yield-enhancing inputs in response to low realisations in the past few years) and partly weather-induced (early season drought followed by prolonged unseasonal rains). But to the extent these are helping bring back sentiment in produce markets, badly battered in the post-demonetisation period, there is a strong case for policymakers not to be unduly perturbed.In the days to come, there is bound to be lot of pressure for cutting duties or allowing more import of SMP and pulses. The Narendra Modi government, in its first term, was very hawkish with regard to food inflation. It would be interesting whether it will adopt the same approach in its second term as well  this has already been witnessed vis--vis onions  especially with consumer food inflation in crossing single-digits in October for the first time in almost six years.The one consolation, however, is the prospect of a bumper rabi harvest. The surplus monsoon and post-monsoon rains have recharged groundwater aquifers, apart from filling the countrys major dams close to their full reservoir capacities. That has, in turn, encouraged farmers to aggressively expand the area sown under most rabi crops.If the current price recovery trend holds and rabi production turns out good  there is room for optimism on that count  it would set the stage for a long overdue agricultural turnaround.

(Source: File Photo) More than a dietary change, macrobiotics is a lifestyle change. (Source: File Photo)The style of eating whole foods instead of processed or packaged foods comes from Japan and emphasises a mindful, seasonal approach to food. The macrobiotic diet was developed in the 1920s by a Japanese philosopher called George Ohsawa who believed that by eating a simple, healthy diet, one could live in harmony with nature. According to Cancer Research UK, Ohsawa also believed that a macrobiotic diet could cure cancer and other serious illnesses.As per a National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)s 2016 study, the analysis of a macrobiotic diet plan indicates the potential for disease prevention and suggest the need for studies of real-world consumption as well as designing, implementing and testing interventions based on the macrobiotic approach.Heres why you can count on the macrobiotic bowl*Its a perfect meal-in-a-bowl and completely nourishing depending on the toppings you choose.*You can easily see your food divided into carbs, proteins and healthy fats.ProteinHummus is a good source of protein.

The carriage van was carrying nearly 2500 kgs of onions, retailing at close to Rs 100/kg in the state. Needless to say, all of it was gone in a flash!The incident took place around 7am on Wednesday, when the carriage van carrying more than 50 packets of onions, each containing 50 kgs, overturned while on its way to Bokaro vegetable market from capital Ranchi. Police said the driver lost control while trying to avoid a speeding vehicle approaching from the opposite side near Kamlapur village, which led to its overturning.When the police reached the spot, they found the van, but there was no trace of onions valued at Rs 2.5 lakh.The police were later informed that villagers had rushed to the spot as soon as the news of an onion loaded vehicles overturning spread. They looted as many onions as they could.There were around 50 packets of onions loaded on the vehicle and they have been looted, said Kashmar Police Station in-charge Rajendra Kumar.The frenzy for the onions was so great that the villagers even forgot to rescue the injured driver stuck inside the vehicle, local shopkeepers in the area said.Police said the driver, Jethu Mahto, a resident of Ramgarh district, had received minor injuries and was admitted to a local hospital.We carried out a search operation to find out who looted the onions but they are yet to be nabbed, Kumar said.Ram Lakhan Prasad, a potato and onion wholesaler at Ranchis Pandra Krishi Bazar said, A kilogram of onion is being sold at Rs 70 to Rs 85 at the wholesale market on Wednesday. However, at retail markets, it is being sold at Rs 90 to Rs 110, depending upon the quality.The steep price of onions, a necessary cooking ingredient for most households, has adversely impacted the kitchen budget of the common people in Jharkhand.The high price of onions has increased our monthly budget by Rs 1,000. Our request from the newly elected government is to reduce the price of onions as it has become costlier than apple and petrol, said Smrita Dutta, a housewife from Ranchis Lalpur area."

2019-12-26,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/mumbais-slice-of-paris/article30404849.ece,Mumbai’s slice of Paris,"One step into Churchgates latest gastronomical addition, Souffl S'il Vous Plat, and were reminded of how constant change is. The same spot used to be Mocha (also owned by Riyaaz Amlani), while we were in college, and later at the woody Salt Water Caf. Kamling, which used to be next door is now Foo, a buzzing new property by the Tham brothers.Tipple ticklesFor co-owners Nick Harrison and chef Alexis Gielbaum, Souffl S'il Vous Plats location  surrounded by iconic Art Deco buildings and a stones throw away from the sea  was love at first sight. The outdoor seating area is right next to a footpath and reminded us of the street side cafs in Paris. There are hardly any other places in Mumbai who are privileged to have this kind of a set-up, says Harrison. And while everything on the menu is authentically French, Harrison has made an exception with the cocktail offering, case in point, the Frozen Jackfruit Margarita (590). We are a French bistro, but we are also in the tropics. And keeping the citys humidity and heat in mind, I have included icy, frozen cocktails, which can be had in the afternoon too, says Harrison adding that the place has been designed such that you can see the street even when you sit at the bar.Other icy cocktails include Froz All Day (650) made with Ros, Aperol, strawberry, honey and lime. The bar menu also includes certain reworked classics (Kaffir Mule, Lavender Pisco Sour, Jager Negroni) and wine cocktails. Harrison and Gielbaum first met each other while working at different hospitality properties in Delhi and had always wanted to open a relaxed authentic French restaurant. But when Riyaaz saw the location of Slink and Bardot [their flagship Worli establishment], he felt it works for a bar and lounge more, hence we ended opening Slink first, says Harrison. Plush upholstered booths, vintage lights sourced from Chor Bazaar, a huge still of Brigitte Bardot and Serge Gainsbourg from Bonnie and Clyde at the bar give the restaurant a chic old-Bombay vibe.French fareWhile Harrison had a fun time with the drinks, Gielbaum has deliberately stuck to French classics for the food  onion soup, coq au vin, ratatouille and boeuf bourguignon. And since the perfect, airy souffl (which means breath in French) is so hard to find in the city, the owners decided to name the restaurant after the dish and dedicate a section to it. The motif of a cherub blowing a kiss is seen on the cutlery, and even as a sculpture as a play on the name. While the dishes might be 100 per cent French, Gielbaum has tried to keep his food inventory as local as possible. We were conscious of keeping the pricing right and that can only be done when you source locally, explains Gielbaum adding that they source black rice from the North East, cacao from Auroville, brie from the city, and kadaknath chicken for the coq au vin. But the recipes are completely authentic, which was not easy to execute as local ingredients have different flavours, but theres no compromise on that, he says. The menu also has a good balance between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and certain dishes can also be customised to Jain versions. So while vegetarians can try the twice-baked Fromage Bleu blue cheese souffl (350), non-vegetarians could pick Le Henri IV (420), a chicken and mushroom souffl. A dish that Gielbaum seems to have had the most fun with is Carottes (420), where the chef presents carrots cooked in different ways, from cured to dehydrated, with carrot pesto. An appetiser that would work well with drinks is Pissaladire (380), topped with sauted onions, red peppers, arugula and olives. And if you are looking for the perfect winter warmer, try the Soupe  LOnion Gratine (380, can be made veg too), a rich classic French onion soup with a luxuriously velvety texture thats developed by simmering it for 12 hours, topped with croutons and Himalayan Gruyre.One thing you cannot miss is the Homard Thermidor (1,400), a classic French lobster dish where the delicate meat is enhanced by a silken cognac mornay sauce and Champagne sabayon. Leave room for dessert, as in addition to sweet souffl, there is Crme Caramel (280), Baba au Rhum (420, with pistachio buttercream and vanilla Chantilly), and Rocher Chocolat (420).Souffl S'il Vous Plat; noon to 1 a.m.; Churchgate; phone: 8657512648"

The poser of BJP to BJD president came a day before the celebration of the 23rd foundation day of the regional party.In the development index, Odisha is behind many States despite the BJD being in power since its formation. The State Government has not been able to fulfil the basic needs of the people, said State BJP vice-president Samir Mohanty.Twenty years is a long time but the BJD government has failed to keep its promise to provide irrigation to at least 35 per cent of arable land in each of the 134 blocks, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to convert all kucha houses to pucca with all facilities, including drinking water by March 2022.The State has to construct more than 30 lakh houses which seems impossible.He said the State Governments claim of achieving significant growth appears hollow as the people are still dependant on other States to meet their demands for onion, potato, egg and fish."
2019-12-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/how-to-turn-on-the-heat-with-food-especially-dessert/article30410623.ece,"How to turn on the heat with food, especially dessert","It was a cold and foggy night. I needed something that would warm my soul. And my thoughts naturally turned to food. I had been getting calls from a delivery outfit, and decided Id try their dishes out. To give away the conclusion of my story, the food was excellent, and I had a great meal that blew the winter blues away.The delivery outlet is called Heritage Food, and it has two subsections: Indian Heritage and Orient Heritage. It is based in Malviya Nagar, and delivers food to neighbourhoods in south Delhi (through Swiggy and Zomato). But it also runs a catering service, for which orders have to be placed in advance.The food came neatly packed in well-sealed boxes. I enjoyed their rainbow vegetarian sushi  nicely flavoured rice rolls with bits of veggies tucked into them. The rice was soft, and the veggies were crunchy. The Thai water chestnut dim sums were not bad either, though I think the casing could have been a bit thinner. But the filling was delicious, and I enjoyed their fiery chicken dim sums, too.Their menu is quite comprehensive and includes everything from the Andhra Chicken 65 to Chicken Ghee Roast, Vegetarian Chettinad, Aviyal and Thai Red Chicken Curry. I thoroughly enjoyed the curry, which had the delightful flavours of galangal and lemon grass. The gravy had been nicely thickened with coconut milk, and I actually had it with some flaky Malabar parottas.The catering service has on the menu dishes such as the Kashmiri Rogan Josh, Crispy Palak, Nadru and Haaq as well as Punjabs Sarson Ka Saag and Amritsari Fish. It has Delhis Chaat, Shami Kababs, samosas, Bedmi Kachori and Rajasthans Lal Maas, Dal Baati Churma and Mirchi Vada. Gujarats Bajrey Ki Khichdi, the Parsi Dhansak and patrani machhi it has the choicest of dishes from across the country, including many from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.I love southern Indian food, so I tried out the Mangalorean Chicken Ghee Roast. The chicken was soft and moist, and had soaked in the flavours of the spices and the aroma of ghee. But another old favourite of mine  the fiery Andhra speciality Chicken 65did not impress me much. I found the chicken a bit too dry and salty. The Lemon Rice was not bad, but it was a wee bit dry, too. I love it when the lemon rice is moist.The delivery services (Swiggy and Zomato) right now have the old menus, but I am told they will soon include all these delightful dishes  Sushi Rolls, Chinese Chilli Chicken with capsicum and onions, tempuras, Dim Sums, Chicken Korma, Dhaba Chjcken, Aviyal, Vegetable Chettinad et al.To end your meal, I would suggest that you get some Kheerer Singara  samosas prepared with sweetened and thickened milk  from New Annapurna Sweets near Yusuf Sarai. My brother-in-law sent some across, and I thought they were the most delicious sweets I had eaten in a very long time. That, to my mind, was the best way to end a meal on a cold winters night.The writer is a seasoned food critic"
2019-12-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/unusual-foods-that-thomas-zacharias-had-in-2019/article30402076.ece,Thomas Zacharias lists the dishes that surprised him during his Chef On The Road trips in 2019,"His Instagram feed is usually filled with posts of him travelling either through the country or abroad. His trips are typically centred around food; after all, they are the Chef On The Road trips that Thomas Zacharias, executive chef and partner at The Bombay Canteen, undertakes several times a year. These trips go on to inspire his innovative menus at the restaurant that has gone on to be voted as one of the best in the country.Here, he shares the five best foods he got to try this past year during his travels.Chicken sashimiChicken Sashimi at Kuchibashi Modern in KyotoId gone to Japan early this year, and one of the dishes that completely blew me away was a chicken sashimi I had at a yakitori place in Kyoto called Kuchibashi Modern. They have a special breed of poultry that is bred for sashimi; the bird is processed just before it is served to ensure freshness. It is typically eaten with wasabi and soy; and honestly, the dish made me rethink a lot of things about textures and flavours. Until then, I had never thought that chicken sashimi would be so enjoyable or that I would be wowed by it. But it was one of those dishes that I wanted to order again.Mushroom cevicheMushroom Ceviche at O PedroThis one was closer home; a delightful mushroom ceviche created by Chef Hussain Shahzad at O Pedro in Mumbai. It was a simple enough dish with some pickled oyster mushrooms, lima beans and a crisp tempura. However, the depth of flavour the dish boasted was something else. I simply loved it.Wild thaliWild Thali at AkoleBefore the monsoon season, I had gone with the guys from the OOO Farms to Akole in the Sahyadri hills. Here, I met tribals and got to sample their cooking. They use vegetables that are either foraged or locally found, like pendra, gharbandi, chai vel and mahua fruit. Their cooking technique itself was quite simple but flavourful. All they would use was some green chillies, onions and garlic. I realised just how little we know of local produce; it was a turning point for me and also paved the way for the evolving food at The Bombay Canteen. It was following this trip that we hosted Taste of the Wild, a two-month-long exploration of vegetables found in Maharashtra.Chhatu patra podaChhatu patra podaDuring my trip to Odisha, I happened to dine at the home of Alka Jena, where I had the chhatu patra poda. It is basically straw mushrooms, mustard, green chillies and onions that are wrapped in sal leaves and charred. I loved the technique and the way the different flavours came together. It opened my eyes to how different Odiya food is.Beet steakIn November this year, I visited the Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Helmed by Dan Barber, it is a modern farm-to-table restaurant. I have followed Dans work closely and to be able to talk to him was undoubtedly the highlight of my year. Towards the end of my week there, the team treated me to a 30-course meal that lasted four-and-a-half hours! It was here that I tried the beet steak; it was one of the last savoury courses. The beet was charred and sliced to look like steak; it was then served with some beet greens, beet pure and four slices of beef. The coolest part: the sauce basically looked like a candle and wed assumed it was part of the table dcor. The wax, however, was made of beef fat, which was then poured into a gravy boat. The meal was a re-look at how to achieve a balance on our plates, which are usually meat heavy with some starch and vegetables. Here, the vegetable was the star and the meat a mere accompaniment."

At least, that is what happened at a hotel at Kaithamukku here on Wednesday.Incensed by the reluctance of hotel staff to provide a second serve of onion with a dish they had ordered, a four-member gang vandalised the hotel and damaged its window panes. The hotel owner and staff suffered minor injuries in the attack.The youngsters, some of whom have police cases against them, got angry when the cook turned down their demand for more onion, whose retail price still hovers around Rs 150 in the city.Sources in the Vanchiyoor police said the group members, who were in an inebriated state, were having porotta and meat curry. Though they were served onion initially, they demanded more. When the hotel staff refused, they turned violent, said a police officer. The youngsters fled after the hotel owner alerted the police.We have identified three of the members. They hail from nearby places, said an officer. Though the owner had initially filed a complaint, he withdrew it later. The police said they will, nevertheless, take action against the accused for vandalising the hotel."

2019-12-27,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2019/dec/27/inflation-leaves-consumers-teary-eyed-as-pricey-onions-food-items-bite-in-2019-2081554.html,"Inflation leaves consumers teary-eyed as pricey onions, food items bite in 2019","By PTINEW DELHI: Onion literally brought tears to the eyes of consumers as retail prices touched Rs 200 per kilogram and tomato too turned pricier in the last quarter of 2019, leaving many scurrying for changes in dietary ways as costly food items pushed retail inflation to a more than three-year high.Though well below the price jump seen for the humble 'daily consumable bulb' and tomato, potato also become costlier as crop damages and disruptions stoked supply crunch.ALSO READ: Onion prices shoot up to Rs 165/kg; government says imported onions to arrive by January 20Albeit for a brief period during monsoon and afterwards, the retail price of tomato went up to Rs 80 per kg.Though trailing behind in the price race, potato joined its buddies of the 'TOP' priority grouping, selling for as high as Rs 30 a kg in the retail market for sometime in December due to supply disruptions before moderating to the current level of around Rs 20-25 a kg.Costlier vegetables slowly pushed retail inflation, which had remained well within the Reserve Bank's comfortable level of 4 per cent during most part of 2019, peaked to more than three-year high of 5.54 per cent in November.ALSO READ: After onions, edible oils to burn a hole in your pocketTomato, Onion, Potato (TOP) have been accorded 'TOP' priority by the central government in 2018-19 Union Budget and a Rs 500 crore Operation Greens was okayed in November last year to boost production and processing of these three commodities to check price volatility in these key kitchen staples.For the most part of 2019, the government was successful in price control but the party seemed to have lost the sheen later in the year, thanks to 'TOP' and other food items.Government action to rein-in rising onion prices came in very late, which contracted to import bulk supplies of onion from markets such as Egypt, Turkey and Afghanistan.Even as supplies have been hitting the Indian shores on a daily basis, onion continues to rule at over Rs 130 a kg in various retail domestic markets, potato at Rs 20-30 a kg, while tomato has come down to around Rs 30-40 per kg.ALSO READ: Not just onions, now tomatoes too will pinch your pocketAdd to this, garlic prices have now started to spike, touching as high as Rs 30-40 for a mere 100 gram.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which mainly gauges the retail inflation to arrive on its bi-monthly monetary policies, has set a medium-term target for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent while supporting growth.In its monetary policy review in December, it raised the retail inflation projection to 5.1-4.7 per cent for the second half of 2019-20 mainly on costlier onion, fruits, pulses, milk and cereals, from 3.5-3.7 per cent projected earlier.For the first half of next fiscal too, it has raised the projection to 4-3.8 per cent. Retail inflation hovered mainly in the range of 2-3.30 per cent from January to August and started to move up steadily post-monsoon as crop damage due to unseasonal rains hurt the supplies in a big way.It unexpectedly hit a pause button on cutting the key (repo) interest rate, giving more importance to prevailing inflation pressure and rising food prices over a worrying slowdown in the economy.The status quo came in after five consecutive cuts in repo rate since February, as the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, unanimously voted to hold the key repo rate at 5.15 per cent and reverse repo rate at 4.90 per cent. ""Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors.First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020,"" RBI said on December 5.ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar expects moderation in vegetable prices to a large extent by early 2020.""Healthy groundwater and reservoir levels bode well for rabi output and yields of various cereals.However, the year-on-year decline in the area sown under rabi pulses and oilseeds poses a concern, given the high inflation being recorded by some of these items,"" Nayar said.ICRA expects the CPI inflation to spike further to 5.8-6 per cent in December 2019. On the wholesale front, the 2019 inflation story was on a different trajectory with prices moving downwards from a high of 3.58 per cent in January to the lowest 0.16 per cent in October mainly on account of cheaper fuel and power.The up-tick of WPI inflation to 0.58 per cent in November was attributable to costlier vegetables, mainly onion as well as pulses.As per the government data, prices of onion in the wholesale market went up by 172 per cent in November from a year ago.On the WPI-CPI divergence, brokerage firm Anand Rathi said at 5.5 per cent in November, retail inflation was at a multi-year high while, in the same month, WPI inflation at 0.6 per cent was modest.""High food inflation contrasted with deflation in fuel and manufactured product inflation is creating this situation as the retail price index assigns much higher weights to food than does the WPI.Besides, the inclusion of services in retail but not in the wholesale index continued, as, despite being on a falling clip, services inflation was relatively elevated,"" as per Anand Rathi.CARE Ratings expects inflation to range in 4-4.5 per cent for the rest of the year (2019-20), adding the ""base effect will not be favourable in the coming months"".While the surge in vegetable prices will eventually reverse, the elevated inflation for pulses needs to be watched with caution, unless rabi sowing picks up pace, according to Nayar.""The RBI rate pause is likely to continue. The RBI targets retail inflation, which has jumped 240 basis points (bps) in the last four months and is now close to the upper end of the RBI's target zone. Consequently, despite low core and WPI inflation, as also deflation in fuel and manufactured product prices, the RBI is unlikely to cut the policy rate soon.

In Itanagar, the bulb crop was at Rs 150/kg.Imported onions have started arriving. About 1,160 tonne has reached India. Additional 10,560 tonne of shipments are expected to arrive in the next 3-4 days, a senior ministry official told PTI.Both red and yellow onions have been imported from Turkey, Egypt and Afghanistan. The shipments are landing at Mumbai port, the official said.State-owned MMTC, which is importing the key kitchen staple on behalf of the government, has contracted 49,500 tonne of onion so far. Some shipments will arrive next month.Onion prices have shot up sharply due to estimated 25 per cent fall in kharif production of 2019-20 crop year (July-June) compared to the previous year because of late monsoon and eventual excess rains in the major producing states.The prices have failed to cool down despite several government measures in the last few weeks. The government has already banned export of onion, imposed stock limits on traders and is also supplying buffer stock at a cheaper rate.Traders and experts are of the view that onion prices will continue to remain firm till January when late kharif crop will start hitting the market.The country had last imported 1,987 tonne of onion in 2015-16 when prices had shot up significantly.

2019-12-28,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-external-to-domestic-shocks/story-PuoagnMaGkn0nFpA0HGg2K.html,Decoding Indian economy 2010-19: From external to domestic shocks,"indiaUpdated: Dec 28, 2019 13:26 ISTBefore the global financial crisis hit the US economy in 2008, which soon converted itself into a global economic slowdown, the Indian economy had been growing at 8% (in constant dollar terms) for five consecutive years. At a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected Indias GDP growth to be 5% for the current fiscal year, and the economy has been losing growth momentum for six consecutive quarters, the pre-crisis economic performance seems like a dream run.Back then, however, most people believed that the best was yet to come for the Indian economy. In the years India was growing at 8%, the Chinese economy was accelerating at double digit rates. Putting the economy in a sustained double digit trajectory was the cherished policy goal, even after the global economic crisis had disrupted the global economy.The first challenge before us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9% and then find the means to cross the double digit growth barrier, the then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his budget speech in 2010.Such targets seem quite unrealistic today. Growth rates have gone down globally in the post-crisis world. The world economy has not been able to achieve its pre-crisis growth trajectory even a decade after the crisis. China, which was growing in double digits, grew at just 6% in 2018. Indias GDP growth in 2018-19 (in constant rupees) was 6.8%, the lowest since 2014-15. Most institutional and private forecasts, including that of the RBI, see the Indian economy growing at 5%, or perhaps even less in 2019-20.EXPECTATIONS MODULATEDEven the government seems to have moderated its growth expectations for the Indian economy. This years Economic Survey, for example, says that India needs to sustain a real GDP growth rate of 8% in order to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25.These stylised facts about the last decade raise a fundamental question about the Indian economy. Should India reconcile itself to the fact that it can never achieve the kind of economic growth it aspired for less than a decade ago? Answering this question requires a holistic assessment of how things have changed both within and outside the Indian economy.To be sure, the recent deceleration in GDP growth is not unprecedented in India. If the Indian economy ends up with a 5% growth in 2019-20, it will be similar to how it performed in the beginning of the decade. GDP growth was 5.2% and 5.5% in 2011-12 and 2012-13. However, there is a significant difference in the low growth phase at the beginning of the decade and the one we are facing today. This difference is inflation. The low growth phase during the beginning of the current decade was accompanied by double digit inflation. Notwithstanding the recent spike, inflation rates today are less than half of what they were eight-nine years ago. The difference is even starker if one looks at core inflation i.e. inflation without food and fuel.DEMAND DECLINEThe short point is that the challenges facing the Indian economy have changed drastically in a span of less than a decade. We started the decade with fears of stagflation  a low growth high inflation phase  and are finishing it surrounded by threats of a recessionary  a low growth low inflation phase  grip on the economy.This also means that the basic constraint facing the economy has moved from a supply side one to a demand side one. The main reason for high inflation in an economy is its inability to meet the demand for goods and services being used for economic activity. The reverse holds true when inflation starts declining, when economic agents; both consumers and producers (who also buy raw materials, etc) are not buying enough to clear the supply in the market. Core inflation trends are a better metric of the supply versus demand side constraint in an economy as it is immune from seasonal shocks to agricultural production, such as the current onion price spike due to crop destruction, and exogenous shocks such as crude oil prices.How did India end up with a demand side problem to growth within less than a decade of supply side bottlenecks bringing down growth and pushing up inflation? This is the most important economic story that has played out in the last decade.Three factors have played a major role in this.Export markets are not growing as fast as they used to. Annual export growth in dollar terms in the last decade was mostly above the 20% mark, it has more than halved for most parts of the present decade. This has almost killed an important growth engine for the Indian economy.Many entrepreneurs had overleveraged themselves in the hope that the pre-crisis boom would last forever. When the crisis punctured these hopes, these borrowers and their lenders; primarily banks, had a huge crisis on their hands, which created a vicious cycle of sorts. Already saddled with debt, the entrepreneurs could not borrow to invest more, and with their capital locked up in bad debt, the banks found it difficult to lend to even worthy borrowers. This is also referred to as the Twin Balance Sheet crisis in the Indian economy. While the primary trigger for the crisis was irrational exuberance, poor governance structures in banks, which created incentives for unscrupulous financial practices, also compounded this problem.MAJOR DISRUPTIONSAt a time when these headwinds were being generated in the Indian economy, political economy took a significant turn in India. In 2014, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government lost power to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The latter had exploited high inflation (as discussed above) and allegations of corruption against the UPA government to the hilt in its election campaign. So it was only natural that these two issues were crucial in driving its policy agenda. The BJP-led government adopted inflation targeting as the guiding principle of monetary policy and was particularly keen to control food prices, as can be seen by meagre increases in Minimum Support Prices for large part of the first Narendra Modi government.In 2016, the government announced demonetisation to purge unaccounted income stored in cash. While almost all of the money came back to the financial system, the policy inflicted a massive disruption to economic activity, especially in the cash-dependent informal economy. Even as the economy was recovering from this shock, the government rolled out the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017, which significantly increased the cost of doing business for informal and small businesses. As of now, the GST does not seem to have delivered on its promise of augmenting tax revenues. The Centres GST collections missed their target by Rs 1 lakh crore in 2018-19.Both these policies, however, dealt a big blow to the economy, which was slowly recovering from its supply side troubles which emerged earlier in the decade. This is best captured by the RBIs Consumer Confidence Surveys (CCS), which are conducted in 13 major cities in the country. The CCS shows that net perception on general economic situation and employment have gone downhill in the post-demonetisation phase. This eventually has also brought down demand, which can be seen from the decline in non-essential spending metric in the CCS.For India to make a recovery, the first pre-requisite is a policy realisation that reviving domestic aggregate demand in the economy is a bigger short-term challenge than controlling inflation or adhering to fiscal targets. Unless this happens, the ghosts of past stagflation and potential political gains from being perceived as tough on corruption would continue to drive policy in a direction where the Indian economy might be stuck with a recessionary environment"

Approaching the restaurant, which is located on the posh 80 Feet Road of Indiranagar, the first thing that I immediately noticed was the green theme. With palm leaves standing up to the ceiling, rock walls with pastel colours, chairs made out of bamboo and plants everywhere, Flax sends out a warm vibe to customers. Immediately after this, they are greeted with a hashtag  #redoyourfood -and doodles on the wall.Deciding what to eat was a confusing activity as the menu had some impressive, healthy options to choose from. I began my culinary treat with a drink called The Game Changer, which was a mix of almond milk, coconut sugar and cinnamon powder. This drink is said to boost up your energy and acts as an appetiser. Next, I had wheat bread sticks with hummus.The bread sticks were crispy and the hummus came in three vibrant colours, which also had a lovely flavour of garlic. The combination of the two was delicious.I was having a salad craving and ordered a whole grain pasta salad which comprised arugula, spinach, tomato, corn, spring onion, whole wheat fussili, grilled paneer, olives, and sun-dried tomato with basil pesto dressing. Not only nutritious, the salad was also quite filling.I decided on a Mexican Super Bowl and my dining companion went for an Egg and Avocado Sandwich for the main course. The Mexican bowl was more than enough for two people and included healthy ingredients like mixed beans, corn, and grilled paneer. It consisted of Guacamole, salsa crudo, greek yoghurt, ragi chips, chipotle with a mango dressing. The sandwich was thick, and had a blend of egg and avocado paste, which can leave one asking for more. Also, true to its name, most of the dishes had flax seeds as an important ingredient.For desserts, I ordered the Healthy Heart Smoothie, which had blueberry, mango, flax seeds and almond milk. The smoothie was heavy and delectable. Even with a filled tummy, I couldnt help but order their Belgian chocolate ice cream. It had no added sugar and was high on protein. This ice cream also promises to be less on calories. Being a caffeine lover, I also did not miss out Flaxs special cranberry expresso, which was a good end to the meal.Apart from these delicacies, the menu includes some interestingly named dishes like Bro Dont be So Mush Sandwich, Falafel Wrap, Hummus and Grilled Paneer Wrap, and Mediterranean Chicken Bowl.Cost for two: `1,200 (approx)"
2019-12-28,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/is-the-economy-in-really-bad-shape/article30421356.ece,Explained | Is the economy in really bad shape?,"The story so far: On November 30 this year, Indias statistical machinery revealed that growth in the quarter from July to September had slipped to 4.5%. This was the lowest level recorded in six-and-a-half years, with the 6.1% nominal GDP growth (real growth plus inflation) coming in as the slowest in a decade. Compared to the previous quarter when growth clocked 5%, the 4.5% print was not a dramatic downswing, but capped off a slow and steady dip in growth over six quarters in a row  following a robust 8.1% growth recorded between January and March of 2018. Growth in the first half of this financial year has been just 4.8%, compared to 7.5% in the same period of 2018-19. Fixed investment slumped to 1%, private consumption growth halved year on year, and manufacturing activity contracted by 1%.What do the numbers mean?The omens from high frequency economic indicators for the first two months of the third quarter do not augur well for the third quarters performance to improve much, if at all. Industrial output shrank 3.8% in October, the second straight month of contraction following a 4.3% dip recorded in September and belying expectations that festive demand may revitalise production activity. Manufacturing activity dipped for the third month in a row in October.But most telling was the 12.2% decline in electricity generation (the second month it had dipped) as it is a good barometer of demand generated by all economic activity, not just industrial production. Imports, merchandise exports, automobile sales, bank credit metrics one would usually look at to assess economic activity and consumption, are glowing red in official statistics. For November, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections crossed 1,03,000 crore, registering a 6% growth after two straight months of negative growth. It remains to be seen if this can be sustained, even as bank credit growth is expected to hit a 58-year low in 2019-2020.Amidst this gradual slowdown over the past year-and-a-half, the saving grace for the economy and consumers was that inflation had been friendly and benign. That is no longer the case with retail inflation hitting a 40-month high of 5.54% in November, more than double the 2.3% recorded a year ago. Food inflation hit 10%, led by vegetables (think of onions) and pulses. This has led to worries about India entering a phase of stagflation, where growth and employment are low but inflation is high  a difficult morass for policy makers to swim out of. Any further spike in inflation, that takes it closer to or over the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) tolerance limit of 6%, will take the option of cutting interest rates for spurring growth out of the equation, for instance. The official third quarter growth numbers will be out on February 28, weeks after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the second Union Budget. But an advance GDP estimate for the full year is expected early next month.Why is former Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Arvind Subramanian calling it Indias great slowdown?The economys seemingly sudden illness is unusually severe, Mr. Subramanian has noted in a new working paper co-authored with Josh Felman for the Harvard Universitys Center for International Development. This is not an ordinary slowdown. It is Indias Great Slowdown, where the economy seems headed for the intensive care unit, the paper stresses. Comparing indicators for the first seven months of this financial year with the past, the two have made the case that the current slowdown is closer in nature to what was faced as far back as 1991  the year India liberalised.While dissecting the slowdown, many have argued on whether this has been driven by a structural malaise caused by significant deficiencies in the economys framework, such as archaic rules governing factor markets. Several others, including some in the government, suggest that this is a cyclical phenomenon and will pass like the circle of life what goes up, must come down, et al. The World Bank has said this cyclical slowdown is severe. This camps rationale for the slowdown focuses on demand collapsing due to reasons ranging from poor rural income growth, the ghosts of demonetisation and a hastily implemented Goods and Services Tax (GST).Mr. Subramanians paper with Mr. Felman reckons that Indias current crisis is driven by both cyclical and structural factors  but problems in finance have exacerbated the slowdown.Demonetisation and GST may have hurt growth, but cannot be the reason for the precipitous fall in recent quarters. The preface to this crisis began in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, when slower growth threw out of whack bullish assumptions driving large infrastructure investments. That was the first stress point for banks, and investment and exports that had driven growth through the early 2000s stumbled. That Indias growth recovered without fixing these problems adequately, the paper ascribes to a series of fortuitous developments such as lower oil prices and a boom in credit from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) which may be partly driven by demonetisation sending more cash into the formal financial system.With the collapse of IL&FS in late 2018, that party has ended too. And now the twin balance sheet crisis (of stressed banks and corporates with infrastructure bets) that Mr. Subramanian flagged as a CEA, has become a Four Balance Sheet challenge (adding stressed NBFCs and real estate firms).The paper, titled Indias Great Slowdown: What Happened? Whats the Way Out? (https://bit.ly/2Ql2E3q), underlines: All major engines of growth, this time also including consumption, have sputtered, causing growth to collapse Something must be done to get India out of its current vicious cycle, in which low growth is further damaging balance sheets, and deteriorating balance sheets are bringing down growth.What are rating agencies and multilateral institutions saying?The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had already pared Indias growth estimate for this year to 6.1% in October from its earlier forecast of 7%, but is now expected to slash it further with the country in the midst of a significant economic slowdown. The World Bank had said in October that it expects 6% growth but even achieving this range (6% to 6.1%) would require a significant uptick in the second half of this fiscal.The most glaring downgrade for India came from global rating agency Moodys Investor Services which switched Indias sovereign rating outlook from Stable to Negative in early November, citing enhanced growth risks. A week later, it also lowered growth expectations to 5.6% (from an earlier 6.2% hope) for 2019, saying the slowdown is lasting longer than it expected. In October, Fitch Ratings lowered its growth estimate for 2019-20 to 5.5% from 6.6%. Similar revisions have come from almost every other global institution, including the Asian Development Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and rating agency Standard & Poors (S&P). These gloomy estimates still appear rosy compared to expectations from those closer to the ground. India-based, S&P-owned rating agency CRISIL has pegged down its growth hopes from 6.3% to just 5.1%, stressing that the slowdown has deepened.What can the Union Budget do to help?The government has rolled back several measures perceived to be deterrents for investors in the Budget for 2019-20 presented in July; in September, it even slashed corporate taxes significantly in a bid to attract fresh investments. The Finance Ministry has unveiled some packages for particularly embattled industry sectors such as NBFCs and real estate to salvage the situation even as it has hinted that the slowdown is not structural, but cyclical and driven by global growth pressures. On its part, the central bank has slashed its key interest rates by 1.35% or 135 basis points over the past year, in a bid to spur growth too. In an interview to this paper, the RBI Governor has mooted some countercyclical steps (read tax cuts and higher public spending) and continuation of structural reforms to revive the growth project.But the room for tax cuts  after those announced in September set the exchequer back by 1.45 lakh crore  is very limited. GST collections this year have also been tepid and below target, leaving little room for the Centre to spend its way out of trouble. Stoking of inflationary pressures also need to be avoided. Given the constraints, the challenge for the Finance Minister is unenviable, but a focus on fixing the core crisis afflicting Indias financial entities, creating a sense of certainty and predictability about Indias policy direction, be it in taxation matters or reforms of labour, land and other restrictive laws, could provide some salve to the bleeding economy. We will know in 33 days from now."

(File photo) The meeting comes in the wake of the recent Rs 2-3 per litre increase in pouch milk prices by Amul, Mother Dairy and other major brands. (File photo)The Centre has called a meeting of all leading dairies, both cooperative and private, next week to review the milk situation in the country.The meeting comes in the wake of the recent Rs 2-3 per litre increase in pouch milk prices by the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF, better known as Amul), Mother Dairy and other major brands. There are also reports of most dairies registering lower milk procurement this year, including in the flush period after October, when animals normally produce more because of better fodder and water availability as well as reduced body stress from high temperatures and humidity levels.EXPLAINED | Why milk supply is tight and prices are upThe meeting, to be held on January 3 and chaired by the secretary of the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, will discuss the overall availability of milk and also stocks of conserved commodities  mainly skimmed milk powder (SMP) and white butter  with dairies. It will also review the trend in procurement rates being paid to producers and consumer prices of milk and milk products, The Sunday Express has learnt.After the onion fiasco, where the extent of shortfall in production wasnt anticipated well in time and led to retail prices of the bulb crossing Rs 100/kg levels, the Narendra Modi government does not want to take chances with milk. Dairies usually convert the surplus milk they get during the flush season (October-March) into SMP and white butter/fat. These conserved commodities are then used or reconstituted into liquid milk for the lean summer and monsoon months (April-September). That is the time when demand for milk goes up  consumption of curd, lassi/chaach, ice-cream and other products is higher during summers  even as production, especially by buffaloes, drops.This year, however, has been different. Prolonged unseasonal rain beyond September has led to fodder not growing properly and accumulating enough dry matter. As a result, the flush season has barely taken off, with SMP prices currently ruling at over Rs 300 per kg, double their levels at this time last year. The procurement price paid by dairies for standard cow milk with 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent solids-not-fat (SNF) has also increased from Rs 19-21 to Rs 29-31 per litre in the last one year.Last week, ice-cream and frozen dessert manufacturers met the Union Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Minister, Giriraj Singh, seeking slashing of import duties on SMP and butter oil, which are now at 60 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively. Ice-cream contains around 21 per cent milk solids (10 per cent fat and 11 per cent SNF/SMP), while frozen dessert has 11 per cent SNF from milk and 10 per cent vegetable fat.Domestic dairies led by Amul have, however, opposed imports, while pointing out that farmers suffered low milk prices for three consecutive years from 2016-17 to 2018-19. Even retail prices for consumers went up by a mere Rs 4 per litre during this period. Opening up imports now, when prices are just recovering, will hit farmers hard, more so given that their cost of feed itself has shot up by roughly 30 per cent. All this will dis-incentivise production to the detriment of consumers. The dairies further claim that the onset of winter and the rains, too, stopping should help normalise milk supplies, thereby easing the price pressure on SMP as well.For the government, balancing the interests of milk consumers and producers is going to be a tough call.

However, onion and potato continue to hassle consumers. The price of cabbage has come down from Rs 50 per kg to Rs 25 per kg. Similarly, brinjal, which was selling for Rs 40 per kg, is now available for Rs 20 per kg. Price of pumpkin has gone down from Rs 35 per kg to Rs 20 per kg and tomato now available for Rs 20 per kg.Tapan Parida, a Government employee said prices of vegetables have fallen by almost 50 per cent. However, the price of onion and potato has remain unchanged. I am hoping it will come down in the next two weeks, he said. Even as consumers are glad that the prices of vegetables have come crashing by almost 50 per cent, it does not augur well for farmers. The farmers said with the dip in price, they are unable to make up for their expenditure on fertiliser and irrigation.Jiban Behera, a vegetable farmer from Chandol said traders from Cuttack and Bhubaneswar procure vegetables from the district and sell them for huge profit in malls. He said exploitation by middlemen is rampant in the district. Secretary of district unit of Krusaka Sabha Gayadhar Dhal said owing to lack of cold storage and food processing plants, vegetable growers of the district are forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices."

Though the yield of tomato is high, farmers are still facing losses due to the drop in market price. The price is at Rs 2 to 3 per kg. Farmers are suffering a lot. They need at least Rs 20 per kg to recover their cost of production, said Deepak Bhise, President, Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Bhise said a good crop was expectd in the days ahead. The transplantation of tomato will continue during the month of March and April and the yield will be high. But December and January will also see transplantation. So, there is a high chance that prices will fall again, added Bhise.Farmers planting cauliflower are also facing losses. The price of cauliflower, which was Rs 2,500 per quintal a month ago, has reduced to Rs 1,200 this week. What has worried the growers is the almost absence of cold, which they said could take a toll on the crop. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-farmers-disappointed-over-rs-2l-loan-limit-in-waiver-6189550/,Maharashtra farmers disappointed over Rs 2L loan limit in waiver,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a farm loan waiver for farmers who have up to Rs 2 lakh in pending loans between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019. (PTI) Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a farm loan waiver for farmers who have up to Rs 2 lakh in pending loans between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019. (PTI)A DAY after the government resolution (GR) on farm loan waiver was issued, laying down the terms and conditions of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shetkari Karj Mukti Yojana, it drew mixed reactions from farmers and farmers leaders in the state.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a farm loan waiver for farmers who have up to Rs 2 lakh in pending loans between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019. Earlier this week, the chief minister talked about extending the waiver to farmers whose outstanding loan was more than Rs 2 lakh, at a later date. A scheme will also be announced for farmers who are regular in their repayment schedule, he said.Unlike the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana, the farm loan waiver announced by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in 2017, multiple outstanding loans in the same family will be eligible for this scheme. Like the earlier waiver, elected members, directors of sugar cooperatives and agricultural produce marketing committees, and government officials (excluding class IV employees) will be ineligible for the waiver.But the decision not to include farmers with more than Rs 2 lakh outstanding loan in the current scheme has not gone down well, with farm activists calling it a betrayal on part of the government.Senior government officials, who spoke to The Indian Express on condition of anonymity, said it was expected that nearly 36 lakh accounts with a total outstanding amount of about Rs 26,000 crore will benefit from the scheme. Unlike the last waiver, farmers will not be required to fill any forms, and banks will have to provide the necessary data to the government instead.Since the state governments announcement, opposition BJP has been critical about the waiver, calling it a betrayal of farmers trust. Similar views were expressed by Dr Ajit Nawale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, Maharashtra, the farmers wing of the CPI-M, and farmers leader and former MP Raju Shetti.Nawale said the decision not to extend the waiver to farmers with outstanding loans of more than Rs 2 lakh was disappointing. The last loan waiver had at least given a blanket waiver of Rs 1.5 lakh to all outstanding loans this move is a betrayal of farmers trust, he said.The decision seems to have been been taken in a hurry, it requires re-thinking, added Nawale.Some farmers expressed disappointment about the waiver being implemented in installments. Sayaji More, a farmer leader from Sangli, said a waiver in installments will not help farmers. I have my doubts on whether this will pull the sector out of debt, he said.Abhinandan Patil, another farmer from Sangli, said the decision against extending the waiver to loans taken before 2015, and to limit the present scheme only to farmers with up to Rs 2 lakh outstanding loan, was problematic.Grape growers from Nashik also criticised the scheme over the Rs 2 lakh cut-off. Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Nashik, said the crop loan extended to grape growers was usually in the range of Rs 2.5-3 lakh per acre. We will not be eligible for the current scheme, he said.Gorade, who grows grapes and onions on a holding of over 1 hectare in Takli Vinchur village of Nashiks Niphad taluka, said they were aware that the governments financial resources were unlimited. But they should have extended some help to us also, he said.However, Shiv Sena farmer leader from Nanded, Pralhad Ingole, welcomed the scheme and said the government would make certain changes in it, if need be. To criticise the scheme, on the basis of certain technical parameters, is not right, he said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But so much has happened since then. HD Kumaraswamys coalition government with the Congress imploded in spectacular fashion, brought down by resignations and followed by a reality show-style herding of MLAs in airports and hotels. It was followed by BS Yediyurappas return to power. Elsewhere, the once-booming startup scene saw generous, but selective funding, separating the grain from the chaff. On the civic front, 2019 followed on from previous years, with citizens taking to the streets to express their displeasure at a variety of things  from potholes and pollution to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens. A slowing economy meant reduced consumer spending, and the price of onions hit the front pages of newspapers. Overall, 2019 was a year that any citizen who hoped for a stable government, reliable infrastructure, and a strong economy would choose to forget.Making predictions for 2020  predictions for any time, for that matter  is always fraught, but there are somethings to look forward to. Experts believe that the economy will improve, and the vocal protests of citizens unhappy with their lot may even result in some lasting positive change for the city.As far as the business front is concerned, the usual tech buzzwords still apply  blockchain, AI, big data, fintech, and so on. Traditional IT experienced a slowing down as well, and the big companies, focused on cost-cutting yet again, are streamlining operations  something thats expected to continue. And as far the citys cricket team is concerned, fans are keeping their fingers crossed  hoping that the Royal Challengers will cease to be challengers and be champions.The past few years have been tumultuous ones in the states politics, and it is unlikely that the coming year will offer a respite, despite there being no political storms in the offing. But while the leadership of all the major parties in the state continue to be in the hands of seasoned veterans, a distinct change is also under way. The old guard is expected to slowly take a back seat, giving way to newer group of politicians  younger, more dynamic, combining technocratic attitudes with a popular touch. In the Congress, the continued ascendance of DK Shivakumar, his brother DK Suresh, Priyank Kharge and the rise of Rizwan Arshad could mean a new lease of life for the Grand Old Party. The rising profiles of CN Ashwath Narayan, V Sunil Kumar, D Sudhakar, and BY Vijayendra  as well as the urban appeal of MPs like Tejaswi Surya and the JD(S)s Prajwal Revanna could lead to a different method of appealing to the masses and legislative focus.The BJPs biggest success story in the south in the past two decades has been Karnataka. Nowhere else has the saffron party been able to establish such a strong foundation. While it seemed that the partys progress could have been undermined as a result of the mining scam, it defied conventional wisdom, and returned to power with a combination of popular appeal and ruthless manipulation. With the Congress in a state of flux and the JD(S) in disarray, it looks like the BJP can only get stronger  and if it manages to deliver progress, it will be unstoppable.Once the first family of Karnataka, the Gowda family has seen its fortunes decline over the past decade. With age catching up with former PM HD Deve Gowda, the illhealth of former CM HD Kumaraswamy, and the failure of HD Revanna to become a viable alternative, coupled with the rise of Vokkaliga leaders in other parties, the JD(S) faces certain hard times in the year ahead. The JD(S) was always a family and caste party, and the emphasis on family may finally be its undoing, if it cannot reinvent itself.Almost as if in direct response to a long-pending need for pedestrian space and aesthetic roads, the governments decision to implement TenderSure, which has now been studied by authorities from various other cities, has certainly made parts of Bengaluru prettier than before. In February this year, TenderSURE project was featured in the Global Street Design Guide by C40 Cities. So far seven roads  St Mark's Road (0.9km); Cunningham Road (1.5km); Vittal Mallya Road (0.6km); Commisariat Road (0.6km); Museum Road (1.2km); Richmond Road (2.7km) and Residency Road (2km)  have been developed under this project, at a cost of Rs 115.3 crore. Further, the Palike, under phase II of the project has earmarked about Rs 86.5 crore for 8.3km of TenderSure roads. The roads identified for this phase are: Modi Hospital Road (1.1km); Siddaiah Puranik Road (2.5km); KG Road (1.1km); Nrupatunga Road (0.9km) and Jayanagar 11th Main road (2.7km).While in principle, TenderSURE roads are not supposed to be dug up because all utilities are under the footpaths, these roads have not been immune from the depredations of the BBMP or the BWSSB  St Marks Road was dug up four times in the two years after it was inaugurated. But by and large, the quality of these roads have more than made up for the inconvenience caused during their construction.Caste has always driven the way Karnataka and indeed, all of India votes. The conventional wisdom was that the forward castes  and Lingayats of all stripes voted BJP, the JD(S) was the preferred party for the Vokkaligas, and the Congress d e p e n d e d on Dalits, minority groups, and backward castes) to take them to power. But things are changing, with the BJP making a concerted effort to cut into the JD(S)s Gowda base  an effort which saw them break into the JD(S) bastion of Mandya. Meanwhile, the Congress needs to come out of its funk, and broaden its base of appeal.The BBMP has a hard job, granted. But its continuous failures  whether dealing with potholes, encroachments on public lands and lakes, or even transfer of officials has seen it take a beating from the Karnataka High Court . 2020 is bound to see the corporation being taken to the court more, unless the BBMP drastically ups its game, and makes a dramatic improvement to the quality of life for the citys residents  which, at this point, seems unlikely.Karnataka has the highest number of reported cybercrimes in the country. In fact, a whopping 38% of reported cybercrimes come from Bengaluru alone. Its not surprising, given the role technology plays in the city. But the citys sole cybercrime police station had to be shut because of a software glitch. The police have announced that opening a specialized CEN (Crime, Economics, Narcotics) Police Station in each of the citys 8 divisions early next year. This should see a greater spike in cybercrime cases registered  and hopefully, faster resolution.Bengaluru has always been at the cutting edge of tech trends in India  and not far behind anywhere in the world. And the biggest buzzwords among the citys recruiters is DevOps  a portmanteau word linking development and operations. DevOps isnt new, but is the evolution of what was once known as agile infrastructure and agile operations. A recent StackOverflow survey showed that DevOps professionals made the highest salaries  both in the US and India, and what seems to be a new buzzword could actually prove to be quite remunerative.The city may have gotten short shrift in recent years as some of the top musical acts to visit India  U2, Katy Perry and others  have given it the go-by, but not so Khalid Donnel Robinson  aka Khalid. The Grammy-nominated singer will be visiting India as a part of his Free Spirit Asia Tour  and he will be stopping over in Bengaluru. For the citys music fans, the concert will be a welcome event  especially since it has been so long since a worldclass act visited.On November 15 this year, a pilot project for bus priority lanes was kicked off on the Outer Ring Road (ORR), and reduced bus travel time on ORR by 16 minutes during peak hour. Despite poor enforcement and absence of a physical barrier along the stretch, BMTCs daily ridership on ORR increased by 12,000 after the launch. And Bengaluru is hopeful of emulating this elsewhere in the city. Twelve other high density corridors in the city have been identified for priority lanes, some of which are likely to be made operational in 2020. This could provide a huge boost to public transport in the city.Critics may have had their reservations, but moviegoers flocked to KGF in droves. The movie ended with an obvious sequel hook  and the question is  will KGF 2 manage to stick the landing? Whatever happens, whatever the critics say, it seems likely that KGF 2 will be a blockbuster, with viewers waiting to see how the story of Raja Krishnappa Bairya pans out. The original film grossed close to Rs 250 crore at the boxoffice and made history. Will its sequel, coming out in April, repeat the feat  and outdo the first film at the box office?2018 saw the closure of iconic Bengaluru haunts like Monkey Bar and B-Flat, a result of a combination of circumstances  from activist residents associations to a labyrinthine system of licences and permits. Of the many hundreds of restaurants, only 55 are believed to have the Public Entertainment License, required for playing music. Pub owners say that sales are down and talk of retrenchments. Meanwhile, residents associations, enraged at the transition of quiet areas into party zones, show no signs of letting up the pressure.Karnataka was the first state to have an e-vehicle policy  Electric Vehicle and Energy Storage Policy, 2017  aimed at promoting e-vehicles. The city has more than 10,000 electric vehicles plying on its roads, while BMTC is likely to induct 300 electric buses replacing its diesel buses in a phased manner. Bescom will also set up public charging stations and the transport department is planning to offer subsidies for new electric autos and converting existing LPGrun four stroke ones to run on battery. Who knows, maybe 2020 will be cleaner and quieter.The central governments ambitious Sagarmala project, attempting to improve the countrys ports will see a Rs 843 crore investment in the New Mangalore Port Trust, and a capacity increase of 18 MTPA. In addition, the coastal economic zone of Dakshin Kanara should see investment and greater economic activity in the districts of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Mysuru.The pioneer was FlipKart, followed by Ola and Swiggy and Mu SIgma and others. The third wave of Bengaluru startups will be the ones that manage to survive and thrive, despite a sluggish economy. Possible contenders include Cure.Fit  which combines app-based services with a bevy of offerings  gyms, health food, and mental wellness under the .Fit umbrella; Dunzo, the app based errand service; Ather Energy, which hopes to capitalise on the growing importance of electric vehicles, and Bounce, the bike sharing startup.RCB are probably the IPLs equivalent of the Boston Red Sox, at least the ones before 2004. To watch a supremely talented team fail to live up to its potential time and time again was a cause for annual heartbreak.But this year, RCB has a revamped team, a new coach and management.Commenters and pundits found much to criticise about RCBs actions, but many of the same commenters dismissed Dhonis winning 2018 CSK team as a group of has-beens. And as for the fans, theyll be hoping that Virat Kohlis winning ways find translate to a first IPL trophy.As far as 2019 was concerned, it could well go down as the darkest year in Karnataka cricket history. The on-field achievements  title triumphs in Vijay Hazare and Syed Mushtaq Ali  were all eclipsed by the Karnataka Premier League match fixing and betting scandal which rocked the Karnataka State Cricket Association in September 2019.Players, officials, KPL team owners, the number of stakeholders who have been arrested or are under the CCB scanner, has scarred the image of not just the cricket body but the sporting fraternity of the state. Karnataka, famed for producing stalwarts known as much for their talent and dedication as their integrity, will take a long time to come out of the current situation.Hopefully 2020 will ring in a new beginning which will ensure sorely-needed clean and fair cricket in the state.For 36 years, Bengaluru has been waiting for a dedicated suburban service like in Mumbai and Chennai. The 148km suburban rail project with four corridors has finally been approved by extended railway board and is now waiting for the Union cabinet approval. With BJP both at the Centre and state, the suburban rail project is likely to get a fillip. Every day, more than 1.5 lakh passengers are travelling on the existing skeletal services. Although most of these services are during odd times and non-peak hours, it is gaining favour since it is cheaper and faster than other modes. The clarity on whether suburban rail system gets implemented or not will be revealed by the end of 2020. The wait since 1983 could be finally over. Among other things in the pipeline, the suburban rail project also envisages to offer Metro-like services on its network.In its two seasons in the Indian Super League, Bengaluru Football Club were runners-up in the first year, and winners the second time, cementing their reputation as one of the finest football clubs in the country. As nothing succeeds like success, another Bengaluru win could mean a great deal for the club  and the sport. But as the popularity of football rises, so does the quality of the competition The question that Karnatakas football fans will be asking is Will they win again?Most people in India would not have heard of Cambridge Analytica  or would not care if they did. But the scandal  where the political consulting and strategic communication firm was able to gather personal data of millions of Facebook users  and that information was used to feed misinformation and conspiracy theories to users  and thereby influence the results of the 2016 US Election. Similar misinformation was spread on social media ahead of the Brexit vote in the UK. This led to a firestorm in the West, culminating with Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg being eviscerated by the US Congress.In India, however, people are much more relaxed with their attitudes towards their personal data. A recent survey by Accenture found that Indians were much more willing to share personal data in exchange for benefits like faster loan approvals, discounts and personalised offers.But that may be changing. Given the constant stream of news reports on data security breaches, and the introduction of the Personal Data Privacy Bill  currently referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for examination, it looks like privacy and security of personal data will become much more important to Indians in the year ahead  and beyond. More importantly, for the citys tech companies, especially for the foreign ones, it could have wide ranging implications of how they do business here  especially as it could mean additional costs for local data centres, and greater effort to work with local legislation."
2019-12-30,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-the-a-to-z-of-2019-6192337/,Maharashtra: The A to Z of 2019,"Protests broke out over the felling of over 2,000 trees to make way for the Metro car shed in Aarey Colony, Mumbais green lung that stayed in the news all year round. Protests broke out over the felling of over 2,000 trees to make way for the Metro car shed in Aarey Colony, Mumbais green lung that stayed in the news all year round.A is for Aarey Colony, Mumbais green lung in the suburbs that stayed in the news all year round. First it was for a series of protests against the proposed felling of over 2,000 trees for a Metro carshed at the site. In October, the Bombay HC dismissed petitions opposing the cutting of trees. Overnight, the MMRCL cut nearly 2,000 trees in a surreptitious operation, fuelling fresh protests and arrests of protesters. A Noida-based law student wrote to the Chief Justice of India seeking a stay on cutting of trees on the 33-hectare plot. The court accepted his letter as a PIL. By then, the court was told, Whatever has to be cut is cut. A rethink was ordered when the Sena took the reins of the state government, and the final word on Aareys future could come in the new year.B is for bodies, in bags and suitcases, about four of which discovered in the last few months of the year. The most grisly was the case of a musician from Vakola, allegedly killed and dismembered by his adopted daughter and the latters boyfriend, both minors. They disposed the body in suitcases dumped in the Smitha river. A man in Kalyan also killed his daughter, apparently angered by her insistence upon marrying a Muslim man. He allegedly cut her body into multiple parts and stuffed these into bags that he dropped into the Ulhas river. Earlier in the year, a man killed his friend in Virar, chopped the body into several parts and tried to flush these down into the septic tank.C is for the Coastal Road, a 33.5-km highway along the sea that will connect Nariman Point with Kandivali, a much-needed additional arterial road alongside the Western Express Highway. By the end of 2018, parts of the coast had already been barricaded in anticipation of work. In 2019, protests by fishermen and residents of neighbourhoods that it will directly impact, and litigation led to a stay by the HC. The stay was lifted on December 20 by the Supreme Court and work on the highway resumed at once. The BMC has said it will cost the taxpayer a few additional crores because of the six-month delay.The Coastal Road project was protested by fisherfolk and residents of neighbourhoods that it will directly impact. The Coastal Road project was protested by fisherfolk and residents of neighbourhoods that it will directly impact.Climate change could lead to large parts of Mumbai and other coastal cities going under the sea, as per a paper in the journal Nature. According to the study by New Jersey-based non-profit Climate Centrals Scott A Kulp and Benjamin H Strauss, Mumbai in 2050 will look a lot like Mumbai in 1700, with the sea reclaiming the landfill that is the base of the city.D is for disease, which reared its head this monsoon in a particularly nasty way. After unusually heavy rains this monsoon, at least 2,000 Mumbaikars were laid low by dengue fever in just the first fortnight of October. The cases of leptospirosis and malaria also saw a spurt in the post-monsoon months, along with the usual outbreaks of gastroenteritis and other rain-related ailments. Earlier in the season, the civic body conducted three rounds of intensive screening in slums surveying 23.2 lakh houses from July 3 to 5, July 30 to August 1 and August 5 to 7. At least 1.9 lakh people were administered preventive medicine (doxycycline). A large number of them were children and pregnant women, who are at highest risk of getting infected. This had actually helped keep the disease numbers lower in the first half of the monsoon.Following the PMC Bank scam in September, at least seven depositors died in the months since a cap was imposed on their withdrawals, of causes ranging from cardiac arrest to suicide. Following the PMC Bank scam in September, at least seven depositors died in the months since a cap was imposed on their withdrawals, of causes ranging from cardiac arrest to suicide.E is for Economic Offences, the PMC Bank scam the biggest of them. In September, the banks large loans to the troubled HDIL were being examined by the RBI even as accounts were frozen and lakhs of small depositors found they could not access their own money. By December, a preliminary audit report by the RBI found funds were distributed to the HDIL promoters Sarang and Rakesh Wadhawan in a casual manner. The Economic Offences Wing of the police in the last week of Friday filed a nearly 33,000-page chargesheet against managing director Joy Thomas, the banks chairman Waryam Singh, former director Surjit Singh Arora and HDIL promoters Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan for causing a loss of Rs 4,700 crore to the bank through loans extended to the HDIL Group. The chargesheet includes statements of 340 witnesses, of whom 90 are investors who lost their savings, 10 are employees of the bank, and five are senior RBI officials. Meanwhile, at least seven depositors of the PMC Bank died in the months since a cap was imposed on their withdrawals, of causes ranging from cardiac arrest to suicide, together a reflection of the trying times some of these families continue to face.F is for the farmer, who found himself oddly forgotten during the summer election campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, when the then ruling combines candidates made national security the only issue, derived from the terrorist strike on a CRPF bus in Pulwama killing 40 jawans, and Indias air strike in Balakot inside Pakistan. Coming out of a drought year, credit access and continuing water scarcity were major concerns for rural voters and farmers families, but the results suggested that they had put aside their problems and had bought the argument that they needed to vote for a leader who stood for muscular nationalism. The BJP and Shiv Sena, which fought the election as an alliance, won all eight Lok Sabha seats in north Maharashtra and seven of the eight in Marathwada, where the drought was the most acute.G is for garbage. From 9,600 metric tonnes daily to 7,700 tonnes, the city has managed to reduce how much waste is sent daily to the dumping grounds, but the long term issue of plastic waste that is clogging rivers and nullahs and other water bodies remains a concern. Nudged by Sena scion Aaditya Thackeray, the Senas then environment minister Ramdas Kadam ordered a ban on all single use plastic and thermocol products, sending everyone from the average roadside fish vendor to small grocers to garment manufacturers and retailers into a tizzy. Milk pouches will also now require a buyback mechanism and a buyback price printed on them. The move was welcomed by environmentalists and many citizens also switched to cloth and reusable bags for grocery shopping, etc, but the plastic ban has not really taken off, nor has the buyback mechanism.H is for Hindutva, the word that Shiv Sena did not insist on including in its Common Minimum Programme with its new alliance partners, the Congress and NCP, as it went about forming a government with them. The CMP statement in fact described their alliance as an attempt to form a secular government. Sena chief and CM Uddhav Thackeray defended the omission with some sleight of word, declaring in the Assembly that his Hindutva could never be separated from him, and that it also made him deeply honest, a dig at former CM Devendra Fadnavis who he has accused of lying about the Sena-BJPs power-sharing talks.I is for the alleged multi-crore irrigation scam. Seven years after allegations surfaced of extensive irregularities in dam projects, tenders, revised estimates and cost escalations, and then irrigation minister Ajit Pawar had to resign, the scam is back in the news. Soon after being sworn in as deputy chief minister in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government that only lasted 80 hours, Pawar got a clean chit in probes dating back to 2011-12. ACB officials said the timing was dictated only by a calendar of court hearings into two PILs filed in 2012 before the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC, and was unconnected to his decision to join hands with Fadnavis at the time. According to a statement from the ACB, it had initiated open enquiries into a total of 2,654 tenders of 45 projects of Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC), completed open enquiries in 212 tenders out of which FIRs have been registered in 24 cases. Chargesheets have been filed in five cases. Departmental enquiries have been recommended in 28 for administrative lapses and these have been sent to the VIDC over the past year and a half. Forty-five open enquiries had been closed as no offence was disclosed during the enquiry.Rendered jobless after Jet Airways closed down, several staged agitations that got aggressive after a senior technician, who worked for the airline for 15 years, committed suicide on April 26. Rendered jobless after Jet Airways closed down, several staged agitations that got aggressive after a senior technician, who worked for the airline for 15 years, committed suicide on April 26.J is for Jet Airways, which abruptly stopped flying in April this year after running into serious financial troubles. It was admitted for insolvency on June 20, after lenders failed to sell the grounded airline. But the 180-day deadline as stipulated under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act, 2016, for the resolution of the airline also ended on December 16. By late December, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) allowed the resolution professional for Jet Airways to extend the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of the grounded airline by 90 days. Until April, the airline had over 14,500 employees  1,500 pilots, 3,000 cabin crew members, and 7,000 ground operations and technical staff. While at least 600-700 pilots and a similar number of cabin crew later joined other domestic airlines, those rendered jobless, staged several agitations in the city that got aggressive after a senior technician, who worked for the airline for 15 years, committed suicide in Nallasopara on April 26.K is for the King Edward Memorial Hospital where three-month-old Prince, a native of Uttar Pradesh, died due to fire injuries in the intensive care unit after an ECG machine caught fire on November 7. Prince suffered 20 per cent burns on scalp, shoulder and arms. The boy was forced to undergo amputation of hand due to infection four days later. He eventually succumbed to septic shock towards November end. Currently the Bhoiwada police is awaiting report from Veermata Jeejabai Technological Institute on forensic details of the ECG machine to assess how fire was sparked. Princes parents have returned to their native village in UP after his cremation.L is for another loan waiver that will burden the state exchequer further by an estimated Rs 30,000 crore, right on the heels of the Rs 18,000 crore already paid out in the ongoing 2017 loan waiver scheme. This time, the Uddhav Thackeray government capitulated to populism just weeks after taking charge, and approved a farm loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh per farmer. However, the government resolution says farmers having outstanding loans of more than Rs 2 lakh as on September 30, 2019, will not be eligible for the waiver. The farm loan waiver scheme, named Jyotirao Phule Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme, is likely to benefit around 40 lakh farmers. Several farmers leaders and Opposition BJP criticised the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government, saying it has betrayed the farmers as a majority of them will not be able to get the benefit of the scheme due to the condition that principal loan along with interest should not exceed Rs 2 lakh. Also, farmers who had availed loans from nationalised, district and cooperative banks as well as cooperative societies will be considered for the scheme.M is for Mahul, in suburban Mumbai, where residents indefinite protest started last October with demands of safe housing and living conditions. About 3,000 families live in Mahul, rehabilitated from various sites as project affected people. With Mahul engulfed by chemical factories and oil refineries, air and water pollution has led to a series of protests by locals. A High Court order directed the BMC to provide rent to residents. With Uddhav Thackeray now the CM, residents are pushing the new government to implement court order.N is for fugitive diamond jeweller Nirav Modi, who once again hit the headlines after he was spotted in the UK, sporting a moustache and a 10,000 ostrich jacket, for the first time since the Rs 13600 scam at Punjab National Bank (PNB) came to light in January 2018. Following this, Modi was arrested in London, by Scotland Yard after a local court issued an arrest warrant against him in response to a request by the Enforcement Directorate for his extradition in a money laundering case. Modi is lodged at Wandsworth prison in south-west London, one of Englands most overcrowded jails, since his arrest in March 2019. He has been denied bail four times by a local court there. The Westminster Magistrates court will hear the extradition plea against Modi from May 11, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Earlier this month in India, a special court declared Modi a fugitive economic offender (FEO). Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are the main accused in the PNB fraud case, which pertains to alleged fraudulent issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) that caused a loss of over Rs 13600 crore to the public sector bank.O is for onions, the bulb that causes tears. Prices hit record highs in October-November after rising slowly since September. Average trading prices in the Nashik wholesale markets, the largest onion trade in the country, hovered around Rs 6,000 a quintal for the latter part of the year. The crisis was fuelled by the failure of the new kharif and the late kharif crop of onions in the state, the latter on account of the unseasonal torrential rains in November. The January harvest is expected to be more plentiful but this crop has a high moisture content and cannot be stored, putting a premium on the produce from the March harvest. As prices rose, a concerned government put the brakes on onion exports, and also promoted some imports. More than 18,000 tonnes of the bulb were imported, but prices remained high in a state that consumes 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes per day. For once, farmers were rejoicing at the marketplace.P is for the Pawars, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and nephew Ajit Pawar, former deputy chief minister twice over and now minister in the senior Pawar-engineered Sena-Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra. At Satara, Sharad Pawar gave the state one of the most enduring images of the state election in October, as he stood in pouring rain to address a large election rally. It was symbolic of the NCPs spirited campaign led almost alone by him, in the face of a Congress that appeared eroded and exhausted. Later, after saying with seeming finality that the NCP would sit in Opposition amid speculation that he could extend a helping hand to the BJP after the Sena dug its feet in on its demand for the chief ministerial post for half the government tenure, he began and oversaw negotiations between the three non-BJP parties for government formation. The brief high drama in between was provided by Ajit Pawar, who appeared unhappy during the negotiations as it emerged that the Congress would not be a bit player in the government. On November 22 morning, the former deputy chief minister took oath once again as deputy CM, this time in a cloak and dagger operation that involved whisking off some of his supporters to Raj Bhavan in an early morning operation. He resigned three days later, triggering the collapse of the government. Fadnavis too resigned as it became clear that this political adventure would not clear a floor test. As the three parties welcomed Ajit Pawar back as they set out to form the government, former deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal described it thus: Subah ka bhoola shaam ko ghar aaye toh use bhoola nahin kahte.Sharad Pawar addressing a rally amid heavy rain in Satara became the defining image of the Assembly polls. (File) Sharad Pawar addressing a rally amid heavy rain in Satara became the defining image of the Assembly polls. (File)Q is for queues, as Maharashtras voters lined up not once but twice to exercise their franchise. The Assembly elections recorded a 60.46 per cent turnout while the Lok Sabha elections recorded a 61,02 per cent turnout.Mumbai recorded an all-time high of 109.3 mm rain in the first eight days of November. Mumbai recorded an all-time high of 109.3 mm rain in the first eight days of November.R is for rain  record rain. After a more than 30 per cent shortfall in June, the season ended with 10 per cent excess rainfall, the first time such a thing has happened in Mumbai since 1931. In addition, the state witnessed record breaking post-monsoon showers in November. In Mumbai, an all time record of November rain in 1979 at 101.3 mm was broken when the city recorded 109.3 mm of rain in the first eight days of November this year. Cyclones, a sign of rising sea surface temperatures, also made an appearance with the Arabian Sea witnessing the highest ever Cyclonic Disturbances (CDs), seven  four cyclonic storms and three depressions or deep depressions, in 2019. In the past, maximum six cyclonic disturbances were witnessed over Arabian Sea in 1998. The cyclones brought some rain too. Out of the four cyclones  Vayu and Hikka were very severe cyclonic storms, Maha in October was an extremely severe cyclonic storm whereas Kyarr, which brought unseasonal rains to Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, was a super cyclonic storm.S is for warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, in whose honour the state plans to build a grand memorial statue. But it appears that the Maharashtra governments Public Works Department (PWD) may have misled the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) while applying for environmental clearances for building the statue in the Arabian Sea off south Mumbai. An investigation by The Indian Express showed that while the government received environmental clearance from the Centre in February 2015 for building the memorial within the CRZ, these clearances were obtained by inaccurately stating the distance of the proposed site from the Gateway of India. Also, the MoEF appeared to flout its own norms by considering a different set of sites, including two that had never been examined by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority. Work on the statue is currently halted after a Supreme Court stay in January 2019 in a special leave petition filed by the Conservation Action Trust (CAT) that has challenged MoEFs decision to not holding a public hearing for the project. By the year end, despite adverse comments from a preliminary CAG probe on the work of the consultant firm for the Shivaji memorial project and its fee, the state governments Public Works Department (PWD) initiated the process to pay a further installment to the firm. Sources in the government said that despite the remarks of the CAG, the state PWD had initiated the process to make payment to the consultant on its request for Rs 5 crore.T is for Tadvi. On May 22, a postgraduate medical student at TN Topiwala National Medical College, attached to civic-run BYL Nair Hospital, Payal Tadvi committed suicide in her hostel room. Tadvi, belonging to the Tadvi Bhil community, a Scheduled Tribe in the state, also left a suicide note  a photograph of which was found only after the forensic science laboratory examined her phone  where she wrote how the harassment she was facing from her three seniors was making it unbearable for her to continue. She named Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehare and Ankita Khandelwal as the three seniors responsible for her death. Based on the complaint filed by Jalgaon resident Abeda Tadvi, Payals mother, an FIR was filed against the three seniors and they are booked under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act, abetment of suicide, destruction of evidence and common intent under the Indian Penal Code. The incident led to widespread protests in the state demanding strict action in cases of discrimination and harassment by students from marginalised communities in institutions of higher education. The three accused who were arrested for the incident were granted bail by the Bombay HC on August 9. The HC, however, has set conditions on them including suspension of their medical licences till the trial ends, bar on entering the premises of their institution. The three have sought relaxation of these conditions.From the somewhat reluctant political heir of the Shiv Sena to taking on the BJPs might, Uddhav Thackerays political moves drew surprised reactions. From the somewhat reluctant political heir of the Shiv Sena to taking on the BJPs might, Uddhav Thackerays political moves drew surprised reactions.U is for the unruffled new chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray. From being the somewhat reluctant political heir of the Shiv Sena to taking on the might of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the CMs latest political moves drew surprised reactions, especially when he refused to relent after taking a stand that a half-half sharing plan between the BJP and Sena for the chief ministers office had been discussed, promised and is non-negotiable. On being selected as the CM candidate by the three parties, Thackeray was suddenly addressing press conferences, visiting the Pawar residence Silver Oak, and thanking the Congress for its support to the unlikely alliance. I feel regret and surprise about one thing  the people with whom we had allied for 30 years didnt trust me, but the people against whom we fought for 30 years showed trust in my leadership. I have learnt today what I gained and what I lost Three parties of different ideologies have come together, keeping trust in each other and giving a new direction to the country, he said. Without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, After forming the government, I will go and meet my elder brother in Delhi. A photography enthusiast and famously soft-spoken leader, he minced no words as he hit out at his erstwhile ally: Fadnaviss statement at todays press conference that nothing had been decided on the CM post pained me a lot. I am ready to speak on any issue at any time. Those who came to Matoshree went on to speak lies outside. Is this their respect for Matoshree? I will not support lies. Lies are not part of my Hindutva. A little overwhelmed as CM on his first day in the hall of the Legislative Assembly, by the time the Nagpur session came up, he was ready with repartees to the heavyweights now seated on the Opposition benches.V is for the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, which finished at the general election with the sizeable vote share of about 14 per cent in Maharashtra and sent one victorious candidate to Parliament, journalist-turned politician Imtiyaz Jaleel. The alliance of the All India Majlis e Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owasi and Prakash Ambedkars Bharatiya Republican Party Bahujan Mahasangh placed a decisive role in the victories of Shiv Sena-BJP candidates in as many as seven Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, prompting many to repeat the accusation that the VBA was the B team of the BJP, much to Prakash Ambedkars chagrin. In these seats  Buldhana, Gadchiroli-Chimur, Hatkanangale, Nanded, Parbhani, Sangli and Solapur  its candidates polled more votes than the margin of victory. The Nanded candidate of the VBA contributed significantly to upset former chief minister Ashok Chavan, who minced no words about the splitting of the secular vote. In all, VBA candidates polled over 41.30 lakh votes across 48 seats. In at least eight seats of Maharashtras 48, the VBA candidates vote share exceeded 10 per cent, and in 13 seats its candidates polled over 1,00,000 votes. But the sheen wore off rapidly, and the outfit failed to impress at the Assembly elections later in the year. First the AIMIM pulled out of the alliance, and then the outfit failed to win a single seat, its vote share also falling significantly from its Lok Sabha performance.W is for the Wadala custodial death case. Vijay Singh (26), a Wadala resident, died after he was rounded up by the police and taken to the Wadala police station on October 27. He had been taken to the police station after he had a tiff with a couple while parking his bike. There were no CCTV cameras at the police station in spite of a court order. Five policemen from the police station were transferred soon after the incident. The case is now being investigated by a crime branch SIT that will submit a report on whether Singh was beaten to death by the police.X is for the X-factor that could spell coalition death for the Maha Vikas Aghadi. The government was cobbled together in a display of politics as the art of the possible. The country watched in amazement this year as the Shiv Sena broke its nearly three-decade old alliance with the BJP, after their saffron alliance won the election, and taught its erstwhile national partner some lessons in coalition arithmetic by tying up with the NCP and the Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi and the new Maharashtra government. But veterans in these parties themselves concede that there are deep internal fissures and contradictions, and any one of them could prove to be the final nail in the coffin. Outside the common minimum programme, the parties are chalk and cheese. Ajit Pawar, now deputy chief minister to Uddhav Thackeray, is a maverick leader capable of the entirely unexpected. One former chief minister is now just another Cabinet minister. The young faces in the Cabinet could trip on their inexperience.Y is for Yavatmal, home of the radio-collared sub-adult tiger TWLS-T1-C1, who has logged an incredible 1,700 km in seven months since it began its long walk. The tiger is from the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary and has walked back and forth across eight districts in Maharashtra and Telangana, only once attacking a group of men in Hingoli. The radio collar data shows the tiger has visited more than 5,000 locations in his travels. Officials are still trying to ascertain the reason for the long journey.Z is for the zoo, which could be visited by the stork soon. According to news reports, all seven Humboldt penguins at the special enclosure in the Byculla zoo, which have been a star attraction since their arrival, have completed molting. The completion of the molting signifies the birds readiness for breeding, and the zoo officials couldnt be happier at the prospect of good news. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

After remaining reluctant for merger of Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) with Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) yojana since the polls, the State gave in to the convergence of the two schemes towards the end of the year as it was burdened under financial constraints.The convergence will benefit the State with a net saving of Rs 3,060 crore taking the number of beneficiaries to 51 lakh.Eligible farmers will continue to get Rs 10,000 (Rs 6,000 from the Centre and Rs 4,000 from State). However, the State will take care of the landless agricultural households as promised before the election.Farm politicsWith farm politics taking the centre stage after political parties promised moon in their election manifestos during the elections, the farmers started asserting their rights.The Naba Nirman Krushak Sangathan (NNKS), which has been spearheading a movement on its demand over price, prestige and pension, is slowly but successfully emerging as a force to reckon with.Organising its second national mega convention of farmers in the Capital City in November, the NNKS went beyond the demand of price, prestige and pension asking for a right in policymaking.Cyclone Fani & BulbulProne to natural disaster, the State was visited by cyclone Fani in May and Bulbul in November causing considerable damage to the farm sector.Fani took away the livelihood of over 50,000 farmers in six coastal districts of Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Jagatsingpur and Kendrapara by uprooting around 14 lakh coconut trees.The untimely rains under the impact of cyclone Bulbul damaged standing kharif crops mostly paddy in several coastal districts including Balasore and Bhadrak. The Centre came to the rescue of the affected farmers for its prompt and timely assistance.The great onion crisisOnion crisis is not new the state. However, never before the pungent edible bulb has tormented the people so much as it did this year. Considered poor mans diet, onion went beyond the reach of middle-class families for nearly two months with its price skyrocketing to Rs 150 a kg.This great onion crisis thoroughly exposed the inefficiency of the State Government with people asking What happened to the Onion Mission in Odisha? which the ruling BJD announced a couple of years ago to achieve self-sufficiency in production. Similar is the story of State Potato Mission which ended 2017-18 with a miscarriage.Token System under P-PASCentralised token system for paddy procurement, a first of its kind in any part of the country, ran into rough weather with loud protest from farmers of western Odisha demanding its withdrawal and restoration of the old method of physical token issued by PACS.Realising that vested interest groups led by rice mill owners are behind the agitation, the State Government put its foot down and refused to accept any changes.The new system proved to be more efficient with less error and less time consuming for the farmers who used to wait at Mandis for days to sell their surplus paddy."

It was decided that higher buffer stock of about 1 lakh tonne will be created for next year,"" the official told PTI.Cooperative Nafed, which had maintained the buffer stock of onion on behalf of the government, will continue to do so next year.It will source the rabi (winter) onion crop -- which has higher shelf life -- between March and July directly from farmers, the official added.ALSO READ: After onions, edible oils to burn a hole in your pocketThis year, onion prices rose sharply due to 26 per cent fall in kharif and late kharif (summer) production due to late monsoon and later untimely rains in key growing states especially Maharasthra and Karnataka.To check rising prices, the government took several measures to boost the domestic availability including a ban on exports, stock limits on traders besides the sale of onion at subsidised rates from its buffer stock and imports.Already, the government has exhausted its buffer stock of onion which was disposed at a subsidised rate in the local market. Now, it is selling imported ones.ALSO READ: Not just onions, now tomatoes too will pinch your pocketMMTC, which is importing on behalf of the government, has contracted about 45,000 tonnes of onion from Turkey, Afghanistan and Egypt.

About 700kg onions worth Rs45,000 were stolen from a farm on the outskirts of Vadal village in Junagadh The crime was committed between the nights of December 24 and 25, the complaint filed by farm owner Himanshu Hirpara on Saturday says.This season, burglars appear to have put onions on the top of their list of targets in Gujarat. On November 28, 250kg onions were stolen from a shop in Patel Park next to Zoroastrian Bank in Palanpur Patiya of Surat.On December 7, thieves targeted Khanderao Market in Vadodara and stole bagfuls of onions worth Rs7,000. On December 6, around 14 bags of onions containing 50kg each were stolen from Bhavnagar marketing yard."
2019-12-30,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/holding-a-mirror-to-our-face/article30435874.ece,Holding a mirror to our face,"For some time now, in political and bureaucratic circles, a smugness has crept in that India has arrived, that it is no longer impoverished and that whatever be the problem, be it scarcity of onion or shortage fighter jets, it can buy itself out of trouble.In reality, India is desperately poor; it is a country where malnutrition is rife, where children continue to drop out of school in alarming numbers every year and where millions of untrained young people enter the workforce unfit for anything more than manual labour of the hardest kind. In a brake-less hurtle, Indias potential demographic dividend is morphing into a nightmare.All this is best captured in the UNs Human Development Index (HDI) rankings where India is a lowly 129th out of 189 countries. China, by contrast, occupies the 85th spot and Sri Lanka an even better 71st position.Low per capita PPPOne of the reasons for the illusion about Indias wealth is a seductive but dubious country-to-country comparison. In GDP (PPP), India comes a flattering third after China and the United States. The rub is when we start measuring per capita GDP (PPP) as the latest IMF figures indicate.Indias GDP (PPP) is 43% that of China and only 59% that of Indonesia. It is only slightly higher than that of Vietnam, a surprising star in education, which will get past India sooner than expected. At 118th place, the country is already ahead of India in HDI.In terms of per capita GDP (PPP), India is much behind France and U.K., each with no more people than Tamil Nadu or Rajasthan. The GDP (PPP) of ASEAN is 80% of Indias, while its population is less than half. Once we strike off its poorest (Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam) the regional groupings stellar performance shines more lustrously.India of course, has the strength of numbers. A recent issue of The Economist states: as a single country, it has tremendous negotiating power. But all this will cease to matter as other economies in Asia pick up.Common sense doesnt prevailIn a recent essay, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Raghuram Rajan observed that the present government, instead of building gigantic statues to national or religious heroes, should be building more modern schools and universities that will open its childrens minds, making them more tolerant and respectful of one another, and helping them hold their own in the competitive globalised world of tomorrow. But when did common sense ever prevail in a country that for decades has shown a tendency to pursue the trivial and the unimportant with indefatigable vim?As Asia integrates, India is busy painting itself into an isolationist corner. Talking about a $5-trillion economy is not going to get us there but a larger vision of what can be achieved e.g. one which envisages embracing Asian economic integration, should help pay attention to things that are enabling East Asian countries to fire  educating and skilling their young and creating infrastructure that works for all.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which India refused to join after years of negotiation, is a case in point. It is precisely the kind of programme India should have joined with one of the most vibrant economic regions in the world, one with the potential to bring immense prosperity to not just itself but South Asia as well. But then, as Ramesh Thakur writing in the Japan Times on the countrys refusal to join the RCEP observed, India has an unmatched capacity to look an opportunity firmly in the eye, turn around, and walk off resolutely in the opposite direction.The writer teaches at IISc.

In this scenario, travel comes last in the list of priorities. It is a costly affair. I would rather spend my New Year by eating out or hanging out with friends than spending on flights, hotels, food, shopping and what not.Shamnath Krishnamurthy, owner, Sanman Travels, said, The number of people who have booked trips with us for New Year has not been great so far. Although we did receive a lot of travel enquires, very few customers booked travel packages.With the cost of hotels and flights increasing around this time of the year, some travel enthusiasts have advanced their bookings.Muskaan, a student, said that her family booked a week-long trip to Dubai before New Year as it cost less. She said, Weve always wanted to visit abroad, but looking at the skyrocketing prices of flight tickets, we thought that it would be better to go before the holiday season.Safety factorMany people said safety reasons affected travel plans as there is a risk due to the ongoing unrest in the country.A travel enthusiast told The Hindu that a group that had planned a visit to north east India was quite scared to go now because of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.Mahika, a student, who was planning a trip with friends within India, said, Looking at the current political scenario, I am thinking it is better to avoid travelling now.Budget category hitThose in the tourism industry state that not all sections of society are affected.Sanjar Imam, president of the Karnataka Tourism Forum, said that tourism in the budget category has gone down while mid and high-end travel has not changed. He said that not only has the volume of tourists reduced, but people who chose to travel are cutting down the number of days they plan to travel.Kumar Pushkar, Managing Director of KSTDC, said they had seen no impact of the economic slowdown."

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has reduced the stock holding limits for retailers from 5 MT to 2 MT.dWith retail prices of onions soaring above Rs 100 per kg in most cities, Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Ram Vilas Pawan said Monday that about 42,500 metric tonnes (MT) of onions is available for supply. He asked states to send their requirements for onion to his department and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED).As per target fixed, consignments of imported onion have started arriving from 15 December onwards and approx 42500 MT of onion stock is available. I request State govts to send their demand to Department of Consumer Affairs and NAFED to augment the Onion supply in their State, Paswan said in a tweet.According to data available on the portal of Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the movements in retail and wholesale prices of 22 commodities, retail prices of onion on Monday were recorded at more than Rs 100 per kg in several cities, including Delhi, Kolkata, Patna, and Bengaluru.In a bid to arrest the rising prices of onions, the government had directed public sector undertaking MMTC to import onions from countries such as Turkey.Apart from this, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has reduced the stock holding limits for retailers from 5 MT to 2 MT.Moreover, Paswan had written a letter to all chief ministers asking them to carry out immediate anti-hoarding operations to ensure that supplies in markets are augmented and stock holding limits are strictly enforced.Earlier this month, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said that a shortfall in production has led to the spike in onion prices and the Centre has taken several measures to deal with the issue.States had given an estimated production of over 69.9 lakh tonnes of onion by November 30 in this season, but the actual production is likely to be 53.67 lakh tonnes, Tomar told the Lok Sabha on December 12.

Even though its population increased by 100 since 2014, Madhya Pradesh pipped the state. As per the NTCA report, Indias count stands at 2,967, of which Karnataka and MP house 524 and 526 of the striped animal respectively. With an annual increase of 7.5 per cent, the state registered a 29 per cent increase in the period. Bandipur, Nagarhole and BRT continue to be high tiger holding reserves. Signs of a healthy population were also recorded at MM Hills and Cauvery sanctuaries. For the first time, areas outside tiger reserves were also assessed, which will help the department chalk out better conservation plans to curtail rising cases of man-tiger conflicts.40 days, 3 lake breachesLakes breaching in Bengaluru is not new, but for the first time, three lakes in different parts of the city breached in a matter of 40 days. While officials defended the BBMP, calling the incidents mere coincidences, locals and experts said improper management is to blame. Hulimavu Lake breached on November 28, Hosakerahalli Lake on November 10 and Doddabidrikallu Lake on October 10. In all three cases, initial reports and statements from the BBMP showed that contractors were involved. The civic body also set up a committee to investigate the incidents.Sharavathis boon and baneWhile the boundaries of Sharavathi Valley Wildlife Sanctuary were extended and renamed Sharavathi Valley LTM (lion-tailed macaque) Sanctuary, the state government gave permission to the Energy Department to carry out field survey to set up an overhead storage tank in the region to pump water and generate electricity. These two decisions showed that CM B S Yediyurappa to be in a tight fix, as he holds the energy portfolio and is also the head of the state wildlife board. Sharavathy was declared as a LTM conservation reserve in January and permission for survey was given in September on a condition that no vehicles can be used inside and that the eco-system should not be disturbed. The survey permission earned the state government a lot of criticism from greens as they said that this was the key to exploitation of the reserve. The Energy Department has shown hope as this will help them generate up to 1,000 MW of electricity.NEERI studies water bodies;state orders artificial lakesA division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka ordered the BBMP to conduct a methodical survey to ascertain illegal constructions in Bengaluru. The bench made the state government appoint National Environmental Engineering Research Institute to study waterbodies in Bengaluru and directed it to create artificial lakes to compensate for disappeared lakes that were converted into layouts, bus stands and other civic amenities in the capital city.Going fast & digitalIf waiting in line on a highway to pay toll fees gets your goat, the Centres decision to make payments electronic and automatic should come as a relief. The move to introduce FASTags, however, has left many concerned, while the others are plain confused on how to go about getting them. The system is expected to be put in place by January 15.When more people got wingsEleven years after Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) began operations, the airport in 2019 got a slew of facilities  from inauguration of second runway to construction of a swanky new second terminal. While the new south parallel runway was opened on December 6, the second terminals deadline is March 2021. Also, a new south access road to the airport was opened in June as the original road was closed for widening to cater to the surge in passenger traffic expected after opening of the second terminal. BIAL is also building a new railway station near Devanahalli and BMTC buses will be made available from this station to the terminal. While Kalaburagi got its first flight in November 22 (to Bengaluru), other Tier-II cities like Mangaluru, Belagavi and Hubballi also got more flights in 2019.Lunar landing:A failure that was notHopes of the entire nation crashed to the ground in the wee hours of September 7 when Indian Space Research Organisations Chandrayaan-2 lander Vikram crash-landed on the moon. Had the operation succeeded, India would have been the first country to make it to the south polar region of earths only natural satellite. NASAs Artemis programme for manned mission aspires to land astronauts in the region by 2024. Vikram carried a rover, Pragyan, which was to roll out from the lander and explore the lunar surface in a 500 m radius. Still, the larger part of the Rs 987 crore project is on track, with orbiter Chandrayaan-2 remote sensing the moons surface. It continues to send valuable data to ISROs Deep Space Network Station.A solid waste problemFrom being called the Garden City, Bengaluru has slowly earned the tag of Garbage City. But now, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is striving hard to change this image. It has floated tenders for solid waste management for 178 of the 198 wards. This year, the NGT also came down heavily on the civic body for improper waste management.Namma Metro chugs along, but slowlyNamma Metro came closer to its long-promised ridership of 5 lakh commuters per day by clocking its highest-ever ridership of 4,83,103. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation fare revenue crossed Rs 1 crore daily. The last train departure time has been extended to 12 am, and will be extended by 35 more minutes from January 1. Work related to Phase-II of Namma Metro continued throughout the year, with construction work taking place across the city.A bus lane of its ownBengaluru is known for its slow traffic, but most commuters are reluctant to give up using private transport. In a bid to make taking a bus more popular, the city saw a much-needed bus priority lane come up in one of its busiest areas - Outer Ring Road. Though there have been initial glitches with several vehicles encroaching the exclusive lane, fines and awareness programmes may help improve the system.Tears all the wayWhat with its price soaring to Rs 170 a kg, onion brought tears to customers even as they purchased the much-loved,extensively-used vegetable.When all eyes were on Mintos slip-upThe state-run Minto Ophthalmic Hospital botched several cataract surgeries in July, affecting 24 patients, with some even losing their eyesight completely. Some went partially-blind, while one person also lost their life. The botched surgeries were allegedly due to the adverse effect of a particular batch of drugs, as revealed by a team of experts, who found that a new batch of intraocular gel (Occugel 2%) had caused the reaction.

2019-12-31,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firefighting-on-economy-front/story-ORztBKOe3JWLVAodaN1DLO.html,Firefighting on economy front,"indiaUpdated: Dec 31, 2019 06:19 ISTIn the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, held earlier in December, when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was asked whether the economy had already bottomed out (in terms of falling growth rates), she displayed guarded optimism. Id like to believe that [the economy has bottomed out)] and Id like to believe that thats true of some sectors in specific. But in some other sectors, may be they would want some more helpIf it happens, so be it and Ill be happy for it. But I think my attention will be only on making sure that all is done through a greater stimulus, she said.Her remarks capture the dominant sentiment 2019 evoked on the economy front  that of constant fire-fighting to keep it on track.The Indian economy has lost growth momentum for six consecutive quarters up to September 2019. This is the longest recorded deceleration phase for the economy from December 1999 onwards, the earliest period for which quarterly growth data is available. This deceleration has continued despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cutting policy rates, raising questions about the efficacy of one of the most important policy instruments in the economy. In fact, RBI itself has been bringing down its projected growth rates in successive Monetary Policy Committee meetings.RBI has not been the only one trying to revive economic activity. The government, too, has taken several measures. In November, Sitharaman informed Parliament that the government had taken 32 measures to revive growth and address issues faced by the various sectors. These included a cut in corporate taxes, a real estate fund aimed at reviving incomplete projects, the merger of banks, and a large-scale disinvestment exercise.Addressing reporters immediately after announcement of the GDP numbers for the July-September quarter, department of economic affairs (DEA) secretary Atanu Chakraborty and chief economic adviser (CEA) KV Subramanian said consumption and investment were expected to pick up in the subsequent quarters. The economy has bottomed out, Chakraborty said, adding that the fundamentals of the Indian economy were very strong, as reflected in factors such as low inflation, macro-economic stability, low fiscal deficit and good foreign reserves.Low growth has not been the only problem for the Indian economy this year. 2019 has also been a year when Indias economic statistics faced a serious credibility crisis.In June 2019, Arvind Subramanian, who was the Chief Economic Advisor under the first Narendra Modi government, published a paper arguing that Indias official GDP (gross domestic product) figures had a large overestimation bias. While the new GDP series has been criticised by independent economists, a former CEA questioning its validity triggered a fresh debate.Earlier in February, months before the general elections, leaked findings from the first Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report, the successor to the earlier Employment Unemployment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), were published in the Business Standard newspaper. PLFS findings showed that unemployment rate was at 6.1% in 2017-18, the highest in four and a half decades. The leak was preceded by two non-government members of the National Statistical Commission resigning in protest against the withholding of the NSSO data. The data controversy erupted again when leaked findings of NSSOs Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES), showing a real decline in average consumption between 2011-12 and 2017-18, were published in November. Unlike PLFS, which was released formally after the elections, the government decided to scrap CES. These entire set of events made critics question the credibility of Indias official economic statistics, which have traditionally been considered to be among the best outside the developed world. The controversy over official statistics and a perception that the government might be unwilling to release data which does not show the economy in good light has spooked not just academics but also international organisations and rating agencies. For example, the International Monetary Fund has raised objections over Indias GDP methodology earlier this month and Moodys downgraded Indias rating in November.Even as the economy is hoping to revive itself, high food prices, especially that of vegetables, have begun to pinch family budgets after many years. Large-scale crop destruction due to untimely rains has triggered a huge spike in prices of vegetables such as onions, forcing the government to use measures such as export bans and even order imports. Trends in food inflation have seen a sharp reversal in the course of the year.The developments in the real economy, however, do not seem to have affected wealth creation in the stock markets. Stock markets are at an all-time high in the country and have gained 14.6% this year (till December 30, 2019)."

The average wholesale price was around Rs 7,000 per quintal in the first week of December, but dropped to Rs 4,700 per quintal on December 9.The average wholesale price shot up again in following days and recorded an all-time high of Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 due to shortage of supply against demand. The average price then dropped by around 40% to Rs 5,200 per quintal on December 23. However, the average wholesale onion price again shot up to Rs 6,901 per quintal on December 27.The supply of onions was around 10-12,000 per quintals a day around a fortnight back, but fresh kharif onion arrival crossed the 20,000-quintal mark a day at Lasalgaon for the past two-three days. This led to a drop in the wholesale prices, said APMC officials.Incessant rain between July and October damaged around 75% of the kharif onion plantation in major onion pockets of Maharashtra , including Nashik , which is one of the major onion growing area.The harvest of onions on the remaining 25% of the acreage has begun now, but the yield has reduced a lot. Moreover, there has been adequate plantation of kharif onions, the harvest of which has now begin but in a low quantity.The harvest of late kharif onions will pick up in a week or two, which result in higher supply and lower prices. The average wholesale onion price is expected to drop again by another Rs 1,000 per quintal to Rs 3,500 per quintal in the period."
