Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: At the time when indications are that the Centre is devising a financial package to quickly address the issue of farm distress, the agriculture ministry has stepped up efforts to roll out some new measures. It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities."
2019-01-02,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/get-fit-for-that-trekking-trip/cid/1680540,Walk the walk,"Buy a good pair of hiking shoes, high at the ankle and with a firm grip. Put these on along with a long pair of socks and walk for at least half an hour daily. Its best if you can walk in a grassy field or on non-metalled roads. If you dont have access to these, walk on a padded treadmill. iStockI took up trekking well past the age of 50, so I make an effort to keep myself in shape. I stick to a healthy diet and go jogging. I also work out at the gym at least four days a week. Recently, I undertook the rather difficult trek to Sirolsar Lake near the Jalori Pass in Kullu, Himachal Pradesh. At a height of 10,800 feet, it was quite an achievement when I managed to tackle the trek without any trouble.Many of my younger teammates  some of them half my age  had a hard time negotiating the last few miles. The leader of our pack and seasoned trekking guide, Shubhasish Banerjee, was not surprised. These guys are all Internet pundits, stuffed with information off their smartphones. When we took up trekking, we blindly followed our leaders advice, he said.In the old days, seasoned trekkers would first interview all aspiring ones. They would ask: Will you be able to survive sub-zero temperatures? Are you used to walking at least five kilometres at a stretch? Is it okay if you dont get to bathe for a week? Do you smoke? The answers would scare off most, barring the really enthusiastic ones. Even some of them would lose interest after just two or three expeditions, says Banerjee.According to Banerjee, one needs to condition the body and mind before setting off on a tough trek.Get fitHow do you make sure you are physically fit for a trek? Here are some suggestions from orthopaedic surgeon Dr Kiran Kumar Mukherjee, who is also an avid trekker.If you are over 35, get yourself thoroughly checked by a doctor. Find out whether you may have problems at a high altitude and in low temperatures.If you are anaemic or obese, get these issues sorted. Otherwise, you may have breathing trouble or your knees may give up.Buy a good pair of hiking shoes, high at the ankle and with a firm grip. Put these on along with a long pair of socks and walk for at least half an hour daily. Its best if you can walk in a grassy field or on non-metalled roads. If you dont have access to these, walk on a padded treadmill. Keep increasing the speed to prepare your lungs for an arduous journey. But dont climb steps for conditioning, as this can ruin your knees. This is also the reason you should not walk on the treadmill in an inclined mode.To strengthen your quadriceps (muscles of the thigh), you need to train with special iron shoes. If you dont have a trainer, decide on the weight of your shoes after talking to an orthopaedic doctor.Try the leg curl to strengthen your hamstring muscles. Also try the tip toe exercise to make your calf muscles stronger. Do it at least 10-15 times at a stretch, three times daily.Quit smoking because it may make you breathless. Cut down on alcohol as this gives you an apparent feeling of warmth but actually lets out heat from the body.Make eating light a habit. You have to eat enough to keep you going but not too much. If you are diabetic, talk to the doctor and prepare a diet chart.Seasoned trekker Manas Ray believes that only after physical conditioning can you work out the logistical details, such as whether youll have to hire a porter, make arrangements for tents, or, whether you have to carry all your food. He says, You must be prepared for inclement weather and remember that you may not be able to abandon your journey, if you feel like it. So prepare your mind for the worst possible situation.Bag itMake a list of all the clothes, woollens and waterproof garments you need. Tick each off as you pack. You may have to miss a bath most days so carry enough toilet rolls, face tissue and sanitiser. Consult your doctor or a seasoned trekker about the medicines you need to pack. You will need a multi-chamber rucksack with properly-padded shoulder and chest straps to pack your stuff in. Make sure it does not weigh more than 15 per cent of your body weight.Trek rightEven if you are fit, youll need two-three days to get used to the high altitude, and possibly low temperature. Ideally, amateur trekkers must climb about 2,000ft per day, acclimatise and then move upwards. According to Banerjee, it is safest for amateur trekkers to not visit places where the temperature goes down below -20 Celsius and one needs to stay in a tent.While walking, buckle the pelvic strap of your rucksack tightly to prevent pain in the back or shoulders. If you are not used to walking with a heavy backpack, hire a porter.Dont hurry or walk quickly. Enjoy the beauty of your surroundings. Remember, the journey is often more fascinating than the destination. Also, hurrying can get you exhausted, which you want to avoid at all costs. When you cross a steep incline, climb steadily. You can take the help of a walking stick. If you are not too fit, avoid shortcuts  these are likely to be steep  and stick to the usual path.If you feel exhausted, theres nothing wrong in resting for a while. Do a few stretches before you start walking again to prevent muscle pulls.Eat lightAfter you ascend 8,000ft, be extra careful about what you eat and drink. Canned meat or other tinned food may cause indigestion in some people.Have a carbohydrate-rich breakfast before setting out in the morning as you will need a lot of energy through the day. Our breakfast of choice was rice with butter, boiled potatoes and eggs. Sometimes we had khichdi, bread and boiled eggs.Make sure you stay hydrated. Drink at least three litres of fluid, including warm water, soup, tea, instant soupy noodles and, occasionally, oral rehydration solution. This will help keep exhaustion and muscle pull at bay.To keep yourself energised, munch on high-calorie food  dates, almonds, nuts and chocolate.Its better to avoid consuming alcohol on treks. But in case of freezing temperatures, you can have a peg or two of brandy. Exceeding two pegs is dangerous as it can lead to dehydration and related problems.Try to go to bed early. You may initially have problems falling asleep at high altitudes but it will get better as you get acclimatised.Have a great trip."

Cold weather is not good for the vegetables like potato and carrot, while garlic and green peas can withstand it.The punishing climate mostly felt on hill-top regions, including major villages like Kookal, Pambarpuram, Observatory, Kavunjii, Mannavanur and Poondi. I am seeing a colour change in my garlic crops. If the climate remains for a few more days, the crop can withstand. We have started sprinkling water on them to save the crop, said K Vivek a farmer, from Mannavanur.Kodaikanal resident M Michael said he has changed their daily routines a bit to adjust to the cooler weather. People avoid outing mostly after 7 pm as the weather becomes unbearable. Similarly, people wake up a couple of hours later. We start our days only by 10 am due to cold season. We avoid visiting marshlands where the frost and chillness is felt more, he said. Kodaikanal has witnessed the worst weather in previous years, said scientists from meteorological observatory from Kodaikanal. The lowest temperature recorded this year so far was 8.3 degree Celsius. Last year, the temperature was much lesser with January 5 and 6 recording the lowest of 5.3 degree Celsius,"

Jakhar has even forgotten that the poster boy of the promised farm loan waiver scheme, Budh Singh, belongs to his constituency, Gurdaspur, which he represents in Parliament. Did Jakhar even ask chief minister Amarinder Singh why Budh Singhs loan was not waived as promised. This itself shows that Jakhar has no interest in raising a voice for the people and is simply indulging in sycophancy of the Gandhi family to save his post, he said.Sukhbir said nearly 600 farmers committed suicide in Punjab in the last two years, but the state government was least bothered.Jakhar along with other Congress MPs on Friday sold potatoes outside Parliament House in Delhi and claimed that Punjab had waived loans of Rs 3,445 crore of 4.17 lakh farmers."

The hotel, Dream Downtown, has unveiled a magical oracle that will answer your questions about your future. Every year, the hotel creates its annual lobby installation, inspired by the famous NYC holiday windows displayed across the citys department stores, with an interactive feature for those who happen to step in.Visitors who head into the hotels trendy lobby will step into the winter wonderland forest scene and a giant oracle called Mother Nature waiting to answer questions about the future with the tap of a button. The display was created in partnership with theory11, a magic collective made up of some of the best magicians in the business and the minds behind the popular The Magician performance held at the NoMad Hotel.To get their fortune read, visitors can head to the installation each day between 4 pm and 1 am. They must tap on the iPad screen in front of the display to hold down a button and ask the oracle a question of their choice. The response appears on the screen minutes later.As magicians, we are always leaning on technology and the latest and greatest to demonstrate to people things that they think are impossible to make them dream a bit, said Jonathan Bayme, theory11s CEO, to Travel + Leisure. The experiential pop-up adds a touch of magic to the holiday season.Tim Burton's original art pieces, dark set designs and massive installations from his film sets are part of an exhibition in Los Angeles. ShutterstockDark designsIf you are a Tim Burton fan, you are in for a treat. For the first time, there is an exhibition in Las Vegas at the Neon Museum to view the artists work up close. Burton brought us films like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks! and The Nightmare Before Christmas. The exhibition will run for four months and include original art pieces, dark set designs and massive installations from his film sets.Before this, Burtons art and the memorabilia from his films found their way through metropolitan museums from 2009 to 2013, ending up in often sold-out runs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and Pariss Cinmathque, among others. But in the Las Vegas exhibition, pieces will be spread across the iconic museums campus: the outdoor exhibition space, its adjacent North Gallery and the visitors centre.The Neon Museum is quite different from previous exhibition spaces for Burtons work. The massive neon signs outside it certainly complement the art. This exhibition will be a collaborative showing that features site-specific staging. To say were flattered that Mr Burton has chosen our museum for this exhibition would be an understatement, the Neon Museums president, Rob McCoy, said in a press statement. But when you think about it, Tim is one of the few artists who can match the great imagination of Las Vegas.Quality controlWhen you think of good food, you may not think of airlines food. However, recently people have been taking pleasure in critiquing, ranking, and even hating airplane food on social media. Brian Kelly, the founder of The Points Guy, indulged in this pastime recently by posting a photo of a rather unappetizing plate of pasta served to him on an American Airlines first-class ticket. He invited his followers to caption the photo, which led to some caustic remarks that probably would cause a public relations nightmare.Kelly is not the only one calling out airlines for their soggy food.Popular Instagram accounts such as @inflightFeed and @airplanefoodselfie feature frequent flierss meals as a form of culinary entertainment. The latter account crowdsources photos and then invites followers to rank each offering on a scale of one to 10. It includes the flight number and route to make clear where the dining experience  whether it was great or terrible  happened.But the critics are not limited to dedicated accounts only. A Malaysian chef took to Instagram to lash out at AirAsia, the Malaysian low-cost airline, for allegedly serving poor quality sambal tumis (stir-fried chilli paste) with nasi lemak in its Premium Lounge. He also uploaded another video of a sambal prawn dish which he whipped up himself, describing it as nice and thick, and said it does not look like the AirAsia premium nasi lemak sambal.Steep dropNew Year is famously about the drop of the crystal ball in NYC. But this year there has been a lot more of things dropping in different states around the country. In Key West, Florida, the city rings in the new year with a high-heeled shoe dropping from the balcony of a popular Duval Street bar. Mt Olive, North Carolina drops a pickle every single year, but not at midnight. They drop it at 7 pm Eastern Standard Time because that is midnight on Greenwich Mean Time. In Georgia, a giant peach  the states official fruit  drops in the middle of fireworks. The rain in Atlanta did not stop thousands from turning up to watch.Bethlehem, Pennsylvania drops a 400-pound illuminated Peep (the popular branded yellow marshmallow candy) each year. They do this because Peepss parent company, Just Born, is headquartered in the town. Mobile, Alabama drops the marshmallow-stuffed moonpie every year. But it is electronic and weighs nearly 600 pounds. Boise, Idaho drops a giant, glowing potato, now in its sixth year. Viewers can watch the famous 17-feet, 800-pound GlowTato drop right in front of Idahos capitol building each year.FootnoteNew Year means it is time for resolutions. According to MarketWatch, about four in 10 Americans make resolutions each year  eating healthier, getting more exercise and saving more money top the list. This year, one of the biggest trends is leaning towards veganism. A record 1,70,000 people across 14 countries have signed up for Veganuary, in which people pledge to go vegan in January."

The thorny plants make the process arduous; he has already suffered cuts and scratches. But if he wants to protect his valuable crops, there is little choice. He cannot afford a wired fence.For farmers like Vijay Rawat in Uttar Pradesh, stray cattle are turning into a source of huge loss: the animals raid fields in large numbers, trample on the crops and devour whatever they find.

Cow slaughter is as important to us as homicide. Now you can estimate [by the number of stray cows] how much illegal slaughter was taking place under the previous governments, said the Minister.To regulate the population of the male calf in the long-run, the government has started a sex-sorted scheme under which the chances of a cow producing a female calf would be as high as 90-95%.

Around 5 lakh packets of potato , with each packet weighing 50kg, are stored in cold storage centres of Agra district The last date determined by the district administration for withdrawal of potatoes stored at the cold centres was December 31. However, most of the 270 centres in Agra still have stock of potatoes stored in them.Mohammad Aamir, general secretary of Potato Producers Association said, Cold storage centres have stopped preservation. Farmers have been asked to take away their produce within the next week. Farmers are not interested in taking away their produce due to prevailing low market rates. They are not even able to retain their investments. The government has failed to take cognizance of the matter. Sudarshan Agarwal, president of the Cold Storage Association of Agra said, Machines at the cold storages have been stopped. The entire facility needs proper cleaning and maintenance for the next crop. Around 5 lakh packets of potato are still stored in the centres. Farmers have been requested to take them away within a week.Not able to get fair price, farmers have decided to distribute their produce free of cost as mark of protest.Rajveer Lawaniya, district president of Aloo Kisan Vikas Samitti said, Farmers are not able to get even 50% of their investment, which is Rs 700-800 per quintal. We had demanded that the state government declare Rs 1,000 per quintal as minimum support price for potato, which was not done. Farmers will set up counters to distribute potatoes for free in different parts of the city.Last week, TOI had reported about money order of Rs 490 sent to PM Narendra Modi by a potato farmer who saved the meager amount after selling 19,000 kg of produce."

Sources in the party said Rajya Sabha MP P L Punia, the partys well-known Dalit face and also architect of the Chhattisgarh win, has already been frequenting Lucknow for drawing-room talks with SP renegade Shivpal Yadav, after he floated an outfit, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) two months ago.Besides, with nearly 50 former MLAs, MPs, MLCs in Shivpals fold, Sharda Pratap Shukla, Shadab Fatima, Kamal Yusuf Malik, Jai Prakash Yadav, Shivpal is threatening to become a potent force in UP.This will shoulder our burden when seats are to be divided as the bulk can be taken care by Shivpal, while we can put our thrust on big candidates, said a senior Congress leader.There are already murmurs that SP rebels Amarmani Tripathi and Vijay Yadav who fought as independents may join him as well.Partys senior leader in west UP, Imran Masood, too has been tasked to camp in Dalit-majority areas in Saharanpur , Meerut, Bulandshahr and hammer out a poll pact with SC activist Chandrasekhar Azad, who was released by the BJP government three months ago.Azad, though has expressed reluctance to contest, but with his ongoing tours across India, he has been a social media sensation. His acerbic swipes on Dalit atrocities have cut ice with leading Dalit ideologues except BSP supremo Mayawati, who publically turned an offer to align with him."

She dared the State government to reveal the population of each caste under the OBC in U.P.Her statement came with reference to the silence maintained by the Adityanath government over the report submitted by a four-member Social Justice Committee formed to review the situation of different castes under OBC.If the U.P. government has not done any such study [caste census], then on what basis is the SJC carrying out the sub-categorisation? You cannot snatch ones share and give it to another, Ms. Patel said, accusing the State government of injustice towards the OBCs. The Apna Dal (S) is based on Kurmi (an OBC caste) support.The BJPs other ally, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, issued a 100-day ultimatum to Mr. Adityanath to implement the sub-categorisation, or else it would consider separation from the National Democratic Alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.

Of these, nine fall under Backward Class, 37 under More Backward and 33 under Most Backward categories.Listed under the Backward Class  those who will be restricted to 7% quota  are castes like Yadav, Kurmi and Jat. The panel says that these castes are socially, economically and culturally strong and have been recruited in government jobs more than the ratio of their population, while also enjoying political representation."

The sudden surge in price has been attributed to a severe shortage due to crop failure in both Karnataka and Maharashtra.The tomato growing areas  Kolar-Chikkaballapur  are reeling under drought and, hence, the yield has been severely hit.Crop failureUsually at this time of the year, tomatoes come to Bengaluru's market from Nasik in Maharashtra. But the crop has completely failed in Maharashtra due to drought and a rain deficit, said a senior HOPCOMS official.Most of the farmers have not even sown tomatoes this season, as there was a severe rain deficit and many borewells have dried up. Those who sowed tomatoes saw their crop drop to less than half, said G. Sanna Munigowda, a vegetable farmer from Chikkaballapur, who added that the situation with other veggies is no different.There is a severe water shortage, which when coupled with falling temperatures, have adversely affected short-term crops. The yield is so less that prices have shot up, he said.But farmers say their profit margins are not good.Most of us are not even able to recover the input costs due to the low yield, said Papareddy, a farmer from Kolar district.A silver liningThe price of other vegetables, too, have been rising steadily over the last two weeks. Beans, carrots, brinjal, ladies finger and most other vegetables have crossed the Rs. 45 mark. The silver lining is the price of onions and potatoes, which are still in the affordable range of of Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kilo.December  January is that time of the year when vegetable yield is comparatively low due to winter. But the prices do not rise as avarekai (field beans) dominates the platter during these months. However, a severe hit in the supply of avarekai as well this year, has made the situation bad, said a procurement official of a leading retail chain in the city. He added that the situation is expected to continue to be bad for consumers at least for the next one month."

In fact, it was an opportunity to sell packed food to some local labourers for a few days that got him thinking about 10 years ago. Thanks to the overwhelming response he received  especially for the variety rice items  S Siva immediately quit his autorickshaw riding business and started a roadside food stall called Sri Chellayi Tiffin Centre on Thanjavur Road near Old Palpannai.Right from the word go, the locals started loving his food with sambar rice being in high demand. The food stall is open from 11.30am to 3.15pm every day and serves at least 150 customers. According to Siva, his mother used to sell idlis for close to two decades and that was how he got to know the basics of food sales. The local labourers knew about his interest when they gave him a chance to try out his culinary skills by packing lunch for them for a few days. They loved what I sold. I learnt cooking from a person named Krishnamoorthy. Hes my guru who taught me everything that I know now, he added.Siva said that adding chickpeas in sambar rice worked wonders as several people loved the idea. In sambar rice, he also adds multiple vegetables including carrot, beans, drumstick and potato. In the beginning, when I used to sell sambar rice, it used to get over within 2pm itself. It gave me confidence that my eatery would be a success in the longer run, he said. Along with sambar rice, he serves coriander-mint chutney and pickle. Apart from this, people also get medhu vadai and they say that the combo tastes really well, Siva said.Kuska, lemon rice, tomato rice and curd rice are the other variety rice items that are sold at his food stall. While kuska costs Rs 25 a plate, other items are available for Rs 20 each. Siva said that apart from him, his wife S Moogambigai and mother S Gnanavalli also help him with cooking. Its only because of them that Im able to manage the demand, he said. Siva said that about 100 of the roughly 150 customers he served every day got their food parcelled. Those who buy parcels say its for their families. It gives me happiness that Im able to reach all kinds of people, he said. Though he also serves breakfast from 8.30am to 10am, he said it receives lukewarm response. Siva is also opening a tea and coffee stall near his food stall after Pongal.What: Sambar riceWhere: Near Chellayi Amman Temple, Thanjavur Road, Old PalpannaiWhen: 11.30am to 2.30pm"

Four stalls are earmarked for Italian, American, Indian and Chinese cuisine, coffee and bakery items will be sold in the fifth stall.Deputy general manager, public relations, KRCL, Baban Ghatge says, The Konkan Railway will generate additional revenue through the annual licence fees from the food court and the coach restaurants, but the objective of the idea was to offer passengers and locals quality food in a hygienic environment."

The department is emphasizing on low-cost technologies which can be adopted at farm gate and household level.Giving information about the same, head of department of food science and technology Poonam Sachdev said Punjab stands sixth in potato production in India, contributing to 5.3% of total production. She added that since potato is a perishable commodity, inadequacies in its storage, handling and non-availability of processing grade potato in our country has resulted in frequent gluts in the market causing economic loss to the farmers and wastage of food.In view of the above situation, the department of food science and technology, PAU, Ludhiana, has developed inexpensive technologies for the production of low-cost diverse potato products (aloo wari, potato flour, aloo bhujia, potato papad, potato chakli and potato-maize chips) which can help the farmers to get out of financial crunch. We have also developed snacks in which one-third portion of potato is used. We are working on the technology for preparation of potato starch from non-commercial potato varieties. From this starch, soups and custard powder will be prepared. The department is also working on the technology for preparation of potato noodles and pasta. Canning facilities for preparation of ready-to-use canned potatoes (whole cubes or curried) and frozen facilities for preparation of french fries, frozen cubes and frozen ready to fry potato based snacks have also been developed. Farmers, farm women, rural youth and progressive entrepreneurs are provided with hands-on training and facilities on processing and value addition of potato in Food Industry Business Incubation Centre, PAU. Moreover, the processed potato products will serve as a means to increase its use in off season along with their high nutritional value, said Dr Sachdev."
2019-01-13,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/arts/when-m-f-husain-annoyed-legendary-architect-b-v-doshi/cid/1681570,When M F Husain annoyed legendary architect B V Doshi,"The artist and legend M.F. Husain met Balkrishna Vithaldas Doshi and asked him to build a gallery for him. Doshi agreed but then Husain annoyed him by calling him a traditionalist. The 92-year-old Pritzker laureate  Pritzker is the Nobel equivalent for architecture  told his tale in a quivering voice that evening, even as his hotel-hall audience in Calcuttas Salt Lake strained their ears to catch every word he said. On the dais with him was his interviewer, architect Partha Ranjan Das.Doshi continued: I told him [Husain] I will build something where you cannot paint. And Gufa was born  one of Doshis experimental designs. The underground art gallery in Ahmedabad has domed structures that are propped up by irregular columns. Husain tried to hang his works, but they just wouldnt stay. Says Doshi, And that is how he decided to paint the ceiling.Das teases out a neat linear tale. He eggs Doshi on to elaborate on his experience of working with Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect who is known to have prepared the master plan for Chandigarh, among other things.Doshi had dropped out from the school of architecture at the end of the third year. He says, When I wrote to Corbusier requesting him to let me work with him, I got a letter saying I could join him as a trainee but there would be no pay for the first eight months. Doshi accepted the offer and from 1951 to 1954 worked with the maestro.And what did you learn from him, asks Das. In broken English he would describe how people move, as one would observe ants on the ground. Then he would create obstacles  walls, columns. He would explain the minds of men. When you look at temples, buildings, you will see that there is a pattern of movement that is dictated by our moods. We never think of that. Architectural spaces create moods, dimensions and thoughts. They create stories and you begin to think of architecture as another living entity. That was my most significant learning from Corbusier, Doshi replies.Big names recur right through Doshis life, experiences and anecdotes  Husain, Vikram Sarabhai, Louis Kahn  but then it is a giants life. Kahn, with whom Doshi worked on the design for the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, was apparently an austere man.Says Doshi, He would have only boiled potatoes and fish. If he bought a fabric for his wife, he would examine it to see how simple and clear it was. You see, he was thinking the other way round. You practice austerity and you find from that the zen. Doshi turns to Das and tells him that Kahn considered Corbusier his guru. He came to see the Chandigarh Assembly and remarked, How can anyone freeze a dream like this?Das himself is a conservation architect. He has worked on the restoration of the Town Hall in Calcutta and is currently restoring St. Pauls Cathedral in the city.He gets Doshi to talk a bit about Sangath, the design studio he built in the 1980s. Says Doshi, I thought of doing a sustainable building and I wondered should the office look like an office? Or can the building help people experience what I want to say?The audience listens with rapt attention, the specifics, the architecture-talk is important, but more important is the philosophy that is its foundation. And thats how it is with every talking point that evening.Doshi starts to talk about Aranya, a low-cost housing society he has designed, but the point he makes is this: Social change can be brought in, we can enhance social cohesion, we can enhance relations between generations. And I think that is a possibility with architecture. The Aranya housing in Indore fetched Doshi the Aga Khan award in 1996.Aranya, which is a definite departure from his other townships, was built to replace slums. Doshi conceived it as a balanced community of various socio-economic groups. That day he spoke about how, over the years, Aranya has morphed from being a sprawling red brick architectural spread with its streetscape, small balconies and front steps, into something quite different. He said, That is because once you give people a chance and once they think they have the opportunity to earn more or live better, they will invent.From the balconies of Aranya, the audience is transported to the sprawling greens of IIM Bangalore, one of Doshis favourite projects. He apparently managed to convince the authorities into building the institution like a south Indian temple. He said, The stone building is now covered with vegetation and green. It has changed the temperature and climate [of the place] but more than that, when students walk into this space, there is an unknown inner transformation.In his closing speech, Das said, You cannot add or take away anything from Doshis creations they are simple, yet they are deep. Talk done, as the frail elder rose from his seat, the audience rose in a hushed and venerable silence, obviously moved by the architects words and perhaps a tad in awe of the spaces he had unlocked  in their minds."
2019-01-13,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-picnic-with-fish-fingers-and-a-dj-anyone/cid/1681565,"A picnic with fish fingers and a DJ, anyone?","The Bengali word for picnic is choruibhaati. Chorui means open space and bhaati, feasting. In my mind, somehow, the term had come to be punched with a passage from Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyays Pather Panchali. A teenaged Durga whispering conspiratorially to her little brother: Choruibhaati korbi, Apu? Will you join me for a picnic, Apu? Brother and sister then collected some wild potatoes, stole a fistful of rice, a little bit of oil from their mothers kitchen, and then gleefully stirred it all in a pot on a wood-fire.Now I realise that it was less than a frugal meal even, much less a picnic  but all through my childhood the image held a different flavour for me.This winter, after ages, my husband and I went on a picnic with some friends from the neighbourhood. I had not been to attend the meetings in the run-up to the big day; all I knew was that I had to pay a certain amount and that we would be going to a resort in Baruipur in South 24-Parganas.On the appointed day, the car arrived at 7am. It was still misty and the sun was mellow. I slipped into a corner seat and nodded off. Time was when the very utterance of picnic worked like a magic spell, suggested a flurry of activity. A big bus would ferry a whole bunch of us to some nondescript spot. Anxious mothers would carry with them half their households  sheets to sit on, a medicine kit for emergencies, tiffin carriers heavy with snacks and flasks of tea. There would be skipping ropes, carrom boards, badminton racquets and half a dozen shuttle cocks for us.The fathers, smartly dressed in their pullovers, would holler at each other imperiously as they loaded (rented) utensils and cutlery, crates of soft drinks and bags full of grocery for the grand cookout.The car stopped and I woke up. We had reached the resort and someone was playing Bidi jalaile Bewildered, I checked my phone; it was 8am. I was told later that a picnic without a DJ is unimaginable now, as is a wedding, a thread ceremony, a birthday  so far funerals are out.The current day picnic is a completely outsourced affair Telegraph pictureWe had barely settled down, when uniformed catering staff started to serve breakfast  fish fingers, French fries, boiled eggs, sandwiches and tetrapacks of fruit juice. In the old days, it used to be singara with cauliflower stuffing or kochuri-alur dum or luchi-bonde and jilipi.Breakfast done, the DJ played Bryan Adams Summer of 69. The kids headed for the swing, the teenagers for the badminton court for some net flicks, some others just sat glued to their phones, earphones in place  their parents said they were overwhelmed they had deigned to come along. The adults sat around, drinking beer, chatting, stealing covetous glances at their phones, some got up to shake a leg.In the golden days, this was when the adults would get busy prepping for lunch. The women would chop and peel. The men would get the clay oven started, fetch more firewood; oftentimes, they would cook. But now there is no work to be done. Everything has been taken care of, paid for. The DJ started to play Pretty Woman and I got up to admire the flowers, but ended up tripping over a pair of canoodling teens, falling and flattening three dahlia plants.The picnic menu used to be really basic. Bhaat, beguni (fried brinjal slices in batter), labra  a vegetable mix. There would be some gooey chatni  tomato  and papod, finished off with mishti doi and rosogolla. But the pice de rsistance and possibly the only thing the men actually cooked, when they did, would be the fiery mutton curry. For days on end after the picnic, they would congratulate each other on the curry, its fine balance of spices, its chilli kick, the way the meat came off at the bone, till it moved their better halves from indulgent to sour to bitter.After lunch, the children would return to their play. The gaggle of mothers would bring out their knittings from their bottomless carrybags. The men would be busy with the cleaning up, the winding up. A quick round of tea and the picnic was over, everyone was bone tired but satiated.That day lunchtime came and went and people barely noticed. We sat at individual tables and ate off La Opala plates. The menu was elaborate  two kinds of fries, a dal, a sabzi, fish, mutton, chatni, papod, rabri. It was good cooking. But adults and children alike were busy, first clicking and then posting photographs of the food on social media. The eating was hurried, even incidental. Only the DJ played away persistently  Samundar mein nahaake aur bhi namkeen ho gayi ho."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Ludhiana: Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh could not inaugurate the Skill Development Centre here Punjabs first agricultural programme under the Agriculture Skill Council of India on Tuesday  as he got late due to an official meeting. Though PAU officials were disappointed with that, they were satisfied that Punjab got its first skill centre dedicated to agriculture. With competency standards, development of national occupational standards, and sector-specific jobs, the centre will cater to youngsters on agriculture-related career opportunities.Jaskaran Singh Mahal, director, Skill Development Centre, PAU, will take up the task of imparting skills to farmers and youngsters, unemployed youth, and extension functionaries for creating and starting new enterprises. He said: We have a dedicated faculty with the support of all departments of the university.TS Riar, associate director, Skill Development Centre, said: People between 22-40 years of age can enrol in this centre, and their qualifications can be uploaded on the portal. A total of 15 job roles have been approved by the Agriculture Skill Council of India, like gardener organic grower, quality seed grower, baking technician, tractor operator, and green house fitter.Admissions have already begun for this centre this month, with 40 students applying for Agriculture Extension Service Provider, but as there are only 20 seats, the other 20 will be registered in February. The eight-day course has international recognition, in which a trainee will get Rs33 per hour. Saturday will be dedicated to practicals. More than Rs4 crore has been sanctioned for this centre, with five laboratories, 10 classrooms, one staff room, one computer room, one store, and one library. The centre will have three smart classrooms.CM opens state-of-the-art vet hospital in GadvasuMehak Jain|TNNLudhiana: Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh inaugurated a state-of-the-art Multi-specialty Veterinary Referral Hospital on the premises of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Gadvasu) at a cost of Rs14.50 crore to provide world-class medical and surgical care to small animals, including dogs, cats, and other domestic and wildlife species.The CM called for tie-ups with world-class companies for technology transfer of sexed semen to improve the quality of milch cattle, especially buffaloes and cows, in the state, while reviewing the progress of Gadvasu and Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) here at Thapar Hall.The chief minister said the sexed semen technology would help dairy farmers ensure the production of only female calves, which would eventually put an end to the practice of abandoning male buffaloes, as that was posing a major threat to human life in the form of the stray cattle menace. Animal husbandry minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said they were making concerted efforts to explore the possibility of making sexed semen technology available to farmers through the worlds leading US-based company Sexing Technologies.The chief minister further asked the animal husbandry department to collaborate with the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), as well as world renowned veterinary institutions and companies, to bring improvements in Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) so as to ensure production of quality livestock. ETT could help in speeding up breed improvement, which would in turn fetch better prices to dairy farmers due to higher milk yield, he added.The chief minister noted that livestock had a huge potential to double the incomes of farmers through improved efficiency of production, quality, food safety, and economics. He called for a roadmap of Livestock Revolution-2030, and stressed the need for trained human resources as well as continuous research and technology back-up to achieve and sustain livestock revolution.Fisheries sectorFor the development of the fisheries sector, the chief minister suggested that the Fisheries department, in association with Gadvasu, work out a plan to encourage fish farmers in southern Punjab to go for shrimp and pangas farming in a big way, as they fetch better remunerative prices than traditional varieties of carp. The chief minister asked the fisheries department to procure good quality shrimp seed from Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Puducherry, as the water in the southern belt was brackish and conducive for this variety. He also asked the fisheries department to ensure supply of certified shrimp seed, feed, and marketing/processing support.Conceding a proposal put forth by agriculture commissioner to make power charges for the livestock sector on a par with the agriculture sector, the chief minister asked Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to examine the issue and come out with financial implications in this regard. Animal husbandry advisor Dr VK Taneja suggested the establishment of 4-5 state-of-the-art rendering plants across the state for organized disposal of carcasses. He also stressed the need to start mobile OPD services to provide the best diagnostic and treatment services on the doorsteps of farmers.Shift to allied farmingThe chief minister further asked the animal husbandry department to prepare an action plan to encourage farmers to shift from traditional to allied farming as they could get better returns from dairy, bee-keeping, goatry, piggery, fishery, etc. He said food safety, quality, and zoonotics should be made an integral part of livestock food production, processing, and marketing network, besides adding value to livestock waste for better economics and environment.The chief minister said it was the need of the hour to motivate a group of farmers to become entrepreneurs, form self-help groups and production companies for processing, value addition, and marketing. He exhorted the animal husbandry minister to ask his department to focus on extension services so as to provide technologies and services at the doorstep of farmers, especially the small and marginal ones. He also suggested that a cluster of 11-12 villages, along with 7,500 breedable bovines, be adopted by the departments of animal husbandry and dairy development of Gadvasu and PAU.On a proposal of the agriculture commissioner to bring Milkfed under the administrative control of animal husbandry department instead of the cooperation department, the chief minister asked his principal secretary to get it thoroughly examined before taking a final decision.Potato seed hubThe chief minister also asked PAU to focus on developing short duration varieties of paddy, water-saving technologies for crop production, and equally remunerative alternatives to the water-guzzling paddy crop. Chairman of Punjab State Farmers Commission Ajay Vir Jakhar suggested Punjab be developed as a potato seed hub, as it was ecologically benign to produce high quality potato seeds.PAU vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon informed the meeting that the institution had already taken up with the Government of India the matter of getting Geographical Indication (GI) tag for potato seeds in Doaba region. The chief minister said an appropriate legislation should be brought to regulate the quality of certified seeds of potatoes and other vegetables.The chief minister impressed upon the VC to work on frontier technologies  bio-technology, nano-technology, big data analysis, and climate change  to improve the sustainability of state agriculture in future. He assured the VC that paucity of funds would not be allowed to hinder research and development initiatives."
2019-01-16,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/food-that-is-best-for-baby/cid/1681929,Food that is best for baby,"Children need time to accept new foods. Do not offer them milk if they initially refuse to eat iStockThe World Health Organization has recommended that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months. This means no top-up bottle feeds with cows milk, formula or water. Breast milk gives the baby a power boost in life, with heightened immunoglobulin levels, protection against many common infant ailments (especially respiratory tract infections) and reduction in sneezing, wheezing, allergies and diarrhoea. It also protects the mother against excessive post-partum weight gain and cancer of the breast.Exclusive breast-feeding is possible if the mother is encouraged, motivated, spared stress and tension, given a healthy diet and 500ml of water before and after feeding.Once six months are over, solids can be started. We have traditional weaning foods in India such as ragi, rice and wheat, which can be washed, dried and powdered in a mixer, either as a mixture or individually. They can be stored in airtight containers in the fridge till required. A tablespoon or two of this mixture should be cooked in water, cows milk added to it and boiled again. It should be a little semi-solid (like the dough used to make dosa). Salt need not be added but a little sugar can be. Babies do not like food which is too sweet.Two weeks after the baby was started on semi-solid food, a mashed banana or a cooked apple can be offered. By the eight-month, rice, dal, potato, carrot and other vegetables can be cooked in a pressure cooker and then mashed. Minced fish, chicken or meat can be added to this mixture. The rice can also be cooked in bone soup for additional nutrition. By the first year, the child should be eating the same food as the rest of the family, perhaps with the spices reduced. They should have three meals a day, with a snack or fruit at 10am and again at 5pm. Home-cooked vada, bonda, halwa, puri or chapati can be given as snacks. After the age of one, a child does not need more than 400ml of milk a day.Children need time to accept and adapt to new foods. Panicking when they do not eat and offering them milk instead is not a solution. Milk does not contain enough calories to sustain ideal growth.Cooking food for a child takes time. Everyone is busy, and a lot of attractive, ready-made weaning products are available in the market. A hot favourite are milk biscuits that are powdered and mixed in milk. They are inexpensive but lack calories and contain preservatives and trans fats. They should be avoided.Preprocessed, precooked, packaged weaning foods are also available in many flavours  wheat-apple, wheat-vegetables, rice-dal. Milk is often preadded. You just need to add boiled, cooled water. No added preservatives or artificial flavours, say the labels. They are tempting and time-saving.If you try mixing milk powder with scraped apple and powdered wheat and leaving it out for some time, even if refrigerated, it becomes mouldy very fast. Preservatives have to be added to keep the processed food viable until the expiry date.Very high temperatures are necessary to process the ingredients of the weaning powders. This destroys not only the flavour but also the vitamins and micronutrients. These are then artificially added. Many of these flavouring chemicals and preservatives are sodium based and sodium is an electrolyte that a babys immature kidneys are unable to process.There are no shortcuts to bringing up a healthy child. The early years need time and effort from parents and caretakers.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.If you have any questions on health issues, please write to yourhealthgm@yahoo.co.in"

2019-01-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/china-moon-landing-far-side-plants-5543766/,Chinese sprouts,"The China National Space Administrations Change-4 lunar mission is calculated to make headlines, while raising the bar in space science. The first mission to send a lander to the dark side of the moon, it also includes a little garden supporting a flourishing ecosystem  some sprouting cotton seeds, yeast and a few fruit flies. It will not survive when the water supply runs out, and it was grown on good Chinese soil in a 3 kg canister, rather than lunar dust. Which means that Chinas search for croplands in Africa will not end anytime soon. Even so, this is the first time that humans have grown anything on another world, and set up a working ecosystem. It signals the tentative beginning of an era long-anticipated by science fiction, when the human race would be able to colonise planets.AdvertisingBut scientifically, the achievement is unspectacular. Lunar gravity is 17 per cent that of the earth, while plants have been grown in the apparent weightlessness of the International Space Station (ISS) for the last eight years, to see if they can serve as a food supply and regulate the cabin atmosphere on long-haul space flights. Geotropism, which causes roots to grow down and shoots to grow up, has been controlled, and use of artificial lighting in photosynthesis understood. In fact, in 2017, part of a crop of Chinese cabbage was eaten with relish by the crew of the ISS.But every part of the first biological experiment on the moon is not a success. The potato seeds have proved to be tardy in sprouting, calling into question the plot of Andy Weirs The Martian, in which a marooned astronaut keeps himself alive by growing potatoes on Mars. He could have been better equipped with a pack of Chinese cabbage seeds to see him through his long ordeal."

Cut consumption of sugar and red meat by 50%, and increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, and nuts  that is the top recommendation of a worldwide diet plan according to a special report released on Thursday by the journal Lancet . Such a diet would not only be healthier but also more environment-friendly.The EAT-Lancet Commission, an independent non-profit consisting of 19 scientists and 18 co-authors from 16 countries, was tasked with developing global scientific targets for a healthy diet and sustainable food production.The experts on this panel from India included Srinath Reddy of the Public Health Foundation of India and Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment.The Commission recommended that the average adult, whose daily requirement is about 2,500 calories, must strive to source around 800 calories from whole grain (rice, wheat or corn), 204 calories from fruits and vegetables, and not more than 30 calories from red meat (beef, lamb or pork). It also suggested that the ideal diet should have no added sugar or added fat. Unhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill-health worldwide, and following this healthy diet could avoid approximately 11 million premature deaths a year, the report said.UN goalsThese global targets define a safe operating space for food systems that allow us to assess which diets and food production practices will help ensure that the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement [on Climate Change] are achieved, said a press statement accompanying the report.Though the Commissions recommendations for a healthy diet do include red meat, it emphasises that global targets ought to be applied locally and must keep in mind cultural sensitivities. That means the protein requirement from meat can be substituted, with, say, legumes or equivalent substitutes.People in North American countries eat almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, while those in South Asia eat only half the recommended amount. All countries are eating more starchy vegetables (potatoes and cassava) than recommended, with intakes ranging from between 1.5 times above the recommendation in South Asia to 7.5 times the optimum level in sub-Saharan Africa.Dramatic changeThe worlds diets must change dramatically. More than 800 million people have insufficient food, while many more consume an unhealthy diet that contributes to premature death and disease, said co-lead Commissioner Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University. To be healthy, diets must have an appropriate calorie intake and consist of a variety of plant-based foods, low amounts of animal-based foods, unsaturated rather than saturated fats, and few refined grains, highly processed foods, and added sugars.The researchers also modelled the effects of a global adoption of such a diet on deaths from diet-related diseases.Three models each showed major health benefits, suggesting that the new diet could globally avert 10.9-11.6 million premature deaths a year.The report shared a road map to help global populations move towards such a diet by 2050. These include re-orienting the focus of agriculture from large-scale production of a few crops to a diverse range of nutritious foods from biodiversity-enhancing food production systems."

Amid lower output of potato in the state, cold storages are pinning hopes on produce from other states to fill their facilities.Rajiv Tuteja, owner of a cold storage said, Over 20 per cent capacity of cold storages will be left unutilized this season because production of potato has dropped.This is the peak season to store potatoes in cold storages and storing will extend until March. Farmers usually take out the produce when prices go up in the retail market. A drop in output of carrots this season will further raise worries of cold storage owners who were contemplating to negate the loss by storing carrots.MP Cold Chain Industries Association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, Potato output is down. Industry will look for carrots for which storage will gain pace from February.The storage capacity in Indore has almost doubled in the past years due to new facilities and expansion, said industry players.Tuteja said, For the past three years, rates of cold storages have been stagnant owing to protest from farmers.Cost of storing potato in cold storage is Rs 190 per quintal for the season (7 months), he said.The association said there are 130 cold storages in Indore and Ujjain district with a total capacity of 10 lakh tonne. Indore has the maximum number of units in the state over 100 while in the state there are close to 250 cold storages."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.KOLKATA: Ace table tennis player Soumyajit Ghosh, who after patching up with his then girlfriend got married barely five months ago when she withdrew rape charges against him, has landed in legal trouble again.His wife of five months has now filed a case of physical and mental torture , criminal breach of trust and threatening to give false evidence against the Olympian. But Ghosh has dismissed the allegations levelled by his wife as false and vowed to deal with the charges against him in the court of law.According to the FIR lodged on Wednesday evening, problems in their marital life began right after they tied the knot on August 3 last year. They (Ghosh and his family) misbehaved with me and, at times, even assaulted me. They forced me to sign a few blank legal documents. Their behaviour worsened after the Table Tennis Federation of India lifted the ban (in December) which they had imposed on him earlier (following her first complaint).It was in March last year that the 18-year-old girl who was a minor at that time  had accused Ghosh of raping her and also forcing her to undergo an abortion in a complaint filed at the Barasat womens police station. The girl had then moved the high court against him.The Arjuna awardee had initially denied the allegations and claimed the girls family was blackmailing him. However, after months of turmoil, he decided to tie the knot with her in August.On Thursday, Soumyajits wife said: A few days ago, I was assaulted and bled from my finger, but they claimed I had cut myself while peeling potatoes and that I was attempting suicide. His family members turned so abusive and intimidating that my brother had to come and take me home from our Baghajatin house. Having thought over the situation for the past two days, I decided to lodge a complaint last night.A senior police officer said: An FIR has been registered under IPC sections 498A (physical and mental torture), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 195A (threatening to give false evidence) and 34 (common intention). The FIR names Ghosh, his parents Harishankar and Mina, Ghoshs uncles Sanjib and Manas Ghosh and cousin Arindam Das.Ghosh denied the allegations. I am shocked. Even two days back, she told me normally that she wanted to go home. And then she decided to go to police station. I will seek legal help. I need to take bail, I guess. Even today, she spoke to me, Ghosh said.If anyone has been blackmailed and tortured in this relationship, it is me. But who will listen to me? added Ghosh, who returned to action in the Senior National table tennis championships held in Cuttack earlier this month.Senior criminal lawyer Sekhar Basu, who argued the case in the HC then, said: Given the fact that both got married, the matter was disposed of by the HC."
2019-01-18,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/go-easy-on-potatoes-not-proteins-international-panel-says/cid/1682080,"Go easy on potatoes, not proteins, international panel says","The report says that South Asians on an average eat 1.5 times the recommended amount of potato while sub-Saharan Africans consume 7.5 times this amount. ShutterstockAn international panel has released the first scientific targets for healthy diets worldwide through sustainable food production that will require Indians to increase their protein consumption and curtail their intake of potatoes.The panel, the EAT-Lancet Commission, has determined that daily healthy diets should contain at least 35 per cent calories from whole grains and tubers, protein sources mainly from plants but including up to 14 grams meat per day, and 500 grams of vegetables and fruits.A global shift from present-day diets towards the proposed target diets could likely avert about 11 million premature deaths a year, the panel has said in a report published in The Lancet on Wednesday.This shift to healthy diets will require a 50 per cent reduction in global consumption of unhealthy foods, including red meat and sugar, and a doubling of healthy foods such as fruits, nuts, vegetables and legumes.But the changes needed would have to vary from region to region. For instance, North Americans on average consume 6.5 times the recommended amount of meat, while people in South Asian countries eat only half the recommended amount.People in all countries now eat far more starchy vegetables such as potatoes and cassava (a tuber similar to yam) than recommended under the target diets, but the margins vary from region to region.The report says that South Asians on an average eat 1.5 times the recommended amount of potato while sub-Saharan Africans consume 7.5 times this amount.Indians should increase protein intake from plant sources such as pulses and legumes and with fish, fowl and meat in that order as part of a non-vegetarian diet, if preferred, said K. Srinath Reddy, a cardiologist and president of the New Delhi-based Public Health Foundation of India and a member of the commission.The focus for India should be on improving the production, preservation, supply and consumption of fruit and vegetables while increasing the availability of plant protein sources like pulses. Reducing sugar consumption should be a universal goal.The panel has estimated that about 820 million people worldwide currently have insufficient food and many more eat unhealthy diets that contribute to health disorders and premature deaths.The food group ranges we suggest allow flexibility to accommodate various food types, agricultural systems, cultural traditions, individual dietary preferences  including numerous omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets, Walter Willet, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University and the panels co-lead, said in a media release.The changes will require policies that give incentives to producers to grow nutritious, plant-based foods, improve access and demand for healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, and discourage the consumption of unhealthy foods.The panel has also said that improvements in production practices and large reductions in food loss and waste would be needed to implement the target diets.Panel members said the target diets would help feed the anticipated global population of 10 billion by 2050 through sustainable food production while addressing issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss and land use."

Also, we wish to build a system whereby potato growers of UP can sell their produce directly to traders in Jharkhand for a fair price, pitched in Pankaj Kumar, also a deputy director of horticulture posted in Meerut.On the sidelines of the meet, Yadav said UP had grown around 160 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of potatoes this time like every year. Around 45 lakh MT ends up being surplus and we sell these to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Jharkhand, and also countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka, besides those in West Asia. If growers can send their produce straightaway to potato dealers in these places, they may make more profit, he added.Devendra Tyagi, a farmer from Agra, told this reporter that surplus produce meant he often didnt get reasonable rate for his potatoes. I grow around 500MT a year and am able to sell only 90 per cent of it, sometimes at a throwaway price. Wholesalers pocket the maximum profit. Selling to a direct market or a cooperative society in another state will not deprive me of my share of profit, he said.Madan Prasad, vice-president of Jharkhand Alu-Pyaaj Bikreta Sangh, said Jharkhand bought potatoes mostly from Bengal. We are keen on getting better produce straight from growers. If quality is good, buyers in the retail market wont mind paying Rs 2 extra a kilo, he said when asked if increased transportation charges would discourage buyers.Surendra Singh, managing director of Jharkhand state vegetable marketing federation (Vegfed) that has 451 co-operative societies affiliated to it, said as of now, they were dealing only in green vegetables. But, we can consider buying potatoes from UP.Manish Kumar, CMD of Dynamic Tarang, said he had a food-processing unit in Baharagora where potato products could be made. We came here to explore possibilities of using good quality potatoes from UP, he added."

Officers said four cases were registered by the Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) of the Mumbai Crime Branch and the fifth by the Powai police.Accused falls illAccording to the Powai police, its patrolling unit spotted Asgaribegum Ali (65), a repeat offender, in Morarji Nagar and questioned her. She claimed she was selling onions and potatoes. Senior police inspector Anil Pophale said, When we searched her bag, we found two kg of cannabis. We then took her to the police station and registered a case against her. She started complaining of high blood pressure before she could be placed under arrest. We have admitted her to the hospital and will arrest her when she is discharged.ANC officers said the first of the four cases was registered by the Worli unit. Nafis Khan (49) was arrested from Indira Nagar in Kurla after he was allegedly found with 21 grams of mephedrone. Deputy Commissioner of Police Shivdeep Lande said, Khan said he bought the drugs from a supplier identified as Sarfaraz Khan (32). Our team laid a trap near Dnyaneshwar Vidyalaya in Sewri and arrested him. He is a major supplier of mephedrone in Kurla.Mr. Lande said the second case was registered by the Ghatkopar unit. The officers seized 2.10 kg of cannabis from two men identified as Ram Mupnaar (45) and Arjun Rethe (34). They were intercepted during patrolling in Mankhurd and drugs were found in their bags. The duo was then placed under arrest.Young offendersIn the third case, the Azad Maidan unit of the ANC arrested Rajesh Potsul (21), a Nagpada resident, found carrying 60 grams of mephedrone near Moon Motor Training School in Dongri.In the fourth case, the Kandivali police arrested Rajesh Wange (38) and Suraj Jadhav (19) from Kurar village in Malad with 1.20 kg of cannabis.

While potato is grown here, chips are made here and consumed here, the money goes abroad to few multinational companies, he said.Highlighting that there was a sound local economy with manufacture of certain products unique to a region like Thanjavur dolls and Tirunelveli halwa, he said that such region specific economy must be revived.In a reference to the recent protests in Thoothukudi that resulted in the closure of Sterlite Copper, he said that the closure had resulted in India importing hundreds of tonnes of copper from abroad, which, he argued, was not good for the economy.Ashwani Mahajan, national co-convenor of SJM, said that four key resolutions were to be passed as part of the convention.Elaborating on the resolutions, he said that one was to urge the Union government to withdraw from the ongoing negotiations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed free trade agreement between 16 Asia and Asia-pacific countries, which, he said, would adversely affect the Indian economy and increase trade deficit, particularly with China.Arguing that e-commerce websites were killing businesses of smaller vendors across the country, he said that the second resolution would demand immediate restrictions on unfair trade practices of these companies. The companies are trying to prevent some regulations coming into force from February 1, 2019. However, we want the government to go ahead with it, he added.Similarly, he said that SJM would highlight the need for rethinking the present model of development, followed by both the present and previous Union governments, which gave importance to foreign direct investment (FDI). Instead, our economy must be strengthened through locally available resources, he said.Lastly, he said that SJM would demand stringent control on illegal entry of migrants from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh.It is resulting in unemployment and stagnation of wages for Indians, he added.Arun Ojha, national convenor, SJM, V. Chidambaram, grandson of renowned freedom fighter V.O. Chidambaram Pillai, R. Sundaram, national co-convenor, SJM, and V.R. Muthu, managing director, V.V.V and Sons Edible Oils Limited, also spoke."

This year, the theme of the exhibition is scientific answers to life problems. After excelling at the taluka-level, students from different schools are now gearing up for the district-level competition.The exhibition is showcasing simple yet effective models which can be implemented to address issues related to drought, energy sources, solid waste management, health and agriculture.Students of Kailash Laxmanrao Patil Vidyalaya from Shivna Village near Ajanta Caves assembled a water purification system using pebbles, coal and soil seeking the help of Youtube videos.In another model, Class IX student Nutan Shirbhaiyye from Khuldabads Sadguru Janesh Madhyamik Vidyalaya has found an answer to growing nutritious feed for cattle in a short time using minimum resources. Through a method called hydroponic, I have grown 20kg maize crop for cattle feed without soil in 6 days using corn, said Nutan.Students of Elloras Gurudev Samantbhadra Vidyamandir used corn starch, glycerine, potato starch, orange peel powder and vinegar to produce bioplastic, an eco-friendly alternative to plastic.In order to avoid accidents on hilly roads, a team from Ganoris Zilla Parishad school suggested that rolling pillars made up of steel and foam be used as road railings. If the vehicle hits the railing, instead of falling into the gorge, the vehicles will be redirected on the roads due to rolling pillars, said the students."
2019-01-19,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/love-food-hate-waste/cid/1682196,"Love Food, Hate Waste","We should try and follow Denmark, a country that has achieved a national reduction of food wastage by 25 per cent in five years (Shutterstock)When I was a kid, every Sunday my mother would cook chicken curry. It was greatly relished by us brothers and sisters. In fact, we would fight among ourselves to be able to lick the last morsel; a smattering of rice over the remnants of the gravy would be polished off instantly. My mother would smile at this knowing that what she had instilled into our minds about wasting food had taken root.The leftovers would be packed up and refrigerated for the next day. In fact, whenever she made aloo dim sheddho (boiled eggs and potatoes) for a meal, the leftovers would inevitably find their way into our sandwiches for the next days tiffin!My parents taught us that we should worship food and never waste it. In fact, my mother would make delicious preparations with lau khosha (bottle gourd peels), aloo khosha (potato peels), and kumro khosha (red pumpkin peels)  all things that most people throw away.Those waste not want not days are only a memory now. Today, the scenario has completely changed. The wastage of food now is an injustice of colossal proportions. Global food loss and waste amounts to about one-third  that is about 1.3 billion tonnes  of all food produced every year.When we talk of food wastage, we dont talk about rotten food or food that has taken a turn. We talk about good fresh food going into the trash can on a massive scale.Recently, I was in New Delhi to give a talk on the wastage of food and the quality of food served in restaurants in our country. I was shocked to learn that nearly 21 million tonnes of Indias entire annual wheat production goes to waste.Around 67 million tonnes of food, valued at Rs 92,000 crore, is wasted in India every year. The country ranks 63rd among 88 countries in the Global Hunger Index. We live in a Third World country where people are dying of hunger and malnutrition. And yet...!People love food. In fact, its a social event as we celebrate or mark every occasion with food  from the time we are born to the point when we die.Our culture and traditions play a big role in this wastage. The bigger the wedding, the larger the party, the more massive the wastage is expected to be.As a teenager, I used to love going to these big fat weddings because I loved to gorge on the myriad delicacies laid out before me. What always puzzled me was that my father showed no such interest in attending these social functions.It was only later that I learnt that he could not bear to see how people wasted food on such occasions. His mantra used to be: Dont waste food. Live simply so that others may simply live.When I first joined the hotel industry, all my pre-conceived notions about food is worship went for a toss. We should not follow the trends of the American economy because food wastage there amounts to between 45 million tonnes and 103 million tonnes per year.And most of it accounting from food services. Most of the double-sized burgers and the huge glasses of Coke find their way into dustbins, probably why the trash cans there are so much bigger than ours.As a restaurateur having respect for food, I have given a proper mandate and guidance to my restaurant staff to educate the guests on food wastage. Hence, we at Speciality Restaurants have redesigned our menu to include Regular and Large portions, so that our guests can eat smaller portions and order more if required instead of wasting it. Sometimes, the eyes are larger than the stomach!Even in my office I have various measures to control food wastage by making weekly visits to the cafeteria to check on the dishes and if the standards of quality and hygiene are being met. We had started distributing extra food to the poor, but then stopped due to food safety norms. We are all aware that wastage of food and a supply of unhygienic food can cripple a countrys economy.We should try and follow Denmark, which is one of the few countries that have achieved a national reduction of food wastage by 25 per cent in five years. Every baby step taken in this direction will count. We may not be able to reduce food wastage during production, but we can certainly reduce it at the personal level. If every individual takes care, we can achieve wonders.So, it is time for all of us, especially restaurants, to step up and prevent this colossal waste. Just dont forget the adage: Love food but hate waste. As George Bernard Shaw succinctly put it: There is no sincerer love than the love of food.Anjan Chatterjee is the chief of Speciality Restaurants"

The platform seeks to help farmers in getting better market access, find more buyers/traders for their produce and earn higher income. Small Farmers' Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) is the lead agency for implementing eNAM under the aegis of the Union agriculture ministry.Trade in 585 mandis is currently taking place on the electronic network, which helps discover price in real time in a transparent manner. The government aims to integrate 200 mandis this year and another 215 next year with the e-NAM platform. There are about 2,700 APMC mandis and 4,000 sub-market yards in India.Earlier, trade used to happen within the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) mandi or between two APMC mandies situated in the same state.Recently, the first inter-state transaction in tomatoes was carried out between a trader of Bareilly e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh and a farmer of Haldwani e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand.On the same day, another transaction in potatoes was carried out between a trader of Rudrapur e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand and a farmer of Moradabad e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh. In both the cases, e-payments have been made through e-NAM portal.Further, inter-state transactions happened between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The interacting mandis were Gadwal mandi from Telangana and Kurnool mandi from Andhra Pradesh.The latest development is from the Palanpur mandi of Gujarat which sold green gram to Sumerpur mandi of Rajasthan, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Though the volumes of inter-state trade on e-NAM platform are low currently, the programme will prove to be a giant leap in reforming the agriculture market in India, the official added.The ministry has integrated 585 wholesale regulated markets/ (APMC) markets in 16 states and 2 Union territories (UTs), who have carried out requisite reforms in their state APMC. Currently, seven states -- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand -- are working on the modalities to establish inter-state trade.Farmers can access the information on e-NAM easily through their mobile phone from anywhere. This online trading platform aims at reducing transaction costs, bridging information asymmetry and helps in expanding the market access for farmers.eNAM is a virtual marketplace with a physical market (mandi) at the backend, networking the existing APMC/mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities for pan-India electronic trading. Mandis handle huge volumes of farm produce. eNAM provides quick quality assaying solutions to promote online trading.Logistics providers' information is also being provided on the e-NAM portal to traders from outside the state which will facilitate transportation of commodities.The agriculture ministry is in the process of developing a separate dashboard to promote inter-state trade among e-NAM states.There are also discussions ongoing among the officials of the ministry, SFAC and state governments on dispute settlement mechanism. Initially, the dispute has to be settled by the mandi of origin where the e-trade is going to be executed. MJH HRS"

They cant even differentiate between a brinjal and a potato. Those born with commandos around their cradle out of fear that they would be kidnapped or something untoward would happen.Vaghani then had his foot in the mouth when he went on to say: I am not sure if the commandos were around when they were being fed milk. I am not a witness to it, drawing cheers from the party workers.The state Congress was quick to slam Vaghani saying that his choice of words smacks of BJPs utter disrespect for women.Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Amit Chavda said, BJP is so flustered by the entry of Priyankaji into active politics that its leaders have relinquished all morality to make such crass statements.Jairaj Parmar, Congress spokesman said Vaghani had a penchant for puking filth even without any provocation. He has insulted the sacredness of values imbibed in the cradle and the piousness of mothers milk. Gandhi family had security cover as their members had become victims of terrorism. Had Vaghani got good values in the cradle, he wouldnt have made such crass remarks.Surat Congress leader Ashok Jirawala also threatened to blacken Vaghanis face if he did not apologise to the women of the country for his remarks.However, when contacted, Vaghani told TOI that he did not mean any disrespect to women. I only talked in the reference of Gandhi family members born with a silver spoon and who are exploiting this country thinking its their ancestral property. BJP has emerged as a party by imbibing Indian values and we give utmost respect to women. Women leaders in our party have grown on their abilities and not because any family surname.''"

He was ready with a plan for the purpose even before he took over as the CM. Hamne loan waiver ki baat hawa mein nahin ki thi. There was a planning on how Rs 55,000 crore would be arranged to waive off loan of 53 lakh eligible farmers. I had the plan ready before I actually became the CM. There was a possibility of me becoming the CM and I had done my homework on how to go about it. By the time the model code comes into force next month, we would have waived off loans of 35 lakh farmers, he said.He further said that farming must be seen in a fresh perspective. Seventy percent of population in MP is based on agriculture. They are not farmers alone. Grocery shops, automobile shops, textile. They also largely depend on agriculture sector for good sale. . Only boost in production is not enough. Production increased during the previous regime as well, but what about marketing of those products? Farmers had to pay for increasing production of commodities like tomato, potato or garlic. Ironically, farmers earlier used to demand increase in support price, now they are forced to demand that their produce is at least sold on support price, he said."

Over two months later, a bloody clash broke out between police and the group when the former had gone to evict them. Though the encroachers were removed, the clash claimed 29 lives.According to prosecution, 45 people were found guilty in the assault case, of which 43 were convicted on January 21.Speaking to TOI, prosecution lawyer SP Singh said, A close aide of Yadav, Chandan Bose, was convicted on Monday. The court has also imposed a fine of Rs 7,000 on him.

However, the group went on to occupy the sprawling public park for over two years. The squatters were evicted after a high court order."

Parul Trivedi, a Congress councillor, leading the agitation, said, We wanted to felicitate Vaghanis wife for tolerating this kind of man for so many years.Vaghani had courted controversy while addressing party workers on Sunday in Radahnpur town of Patan district . Vaghani had said the Gandhi scions were born amid security cover of commandos. They cant even differentiate between a brinjal and a potato . Those born with commandos around their cradle out of fear that they would be kidnapped or something untoward would happen.Vaghani then went on to say: I am not sure if the commandos were around when they were being fed milk. I am not a witness to it, drawing cheers from the party workers.The women Congress workers held a protest in front of Vaghanis house at Iskon Mega City. However police didnt allow the women to enter the house and detained nearly 20 of them. They were taken to A division police station, from there they were released later in the day.In Rajkot, women Congress workers burnt Vaghanis effigy outside collector office to register their protest. They also submitted a memorandum to the district collector demanding action against Vaghani for his statement.Vaghani on his part explained that he did not mean any disrespect to women. I only talked in the reference of Gandhi family members born with a silver spoon and who are exploiting this country thinking its their ancestral property. BJP has emerged as a party by imbibing Indian values and we give utmost respect to women. Women leaders in our party have grown on their abilities and not because any family surname, he had said."

High production depresses prices and farmers are left in the lurch.Production of high-focus TOP (tomato, onion and potato) is estimated to be higher than the output of these crops in 2017-18 with potato at 52.58 MT recording 6% growth, followed by tomato (2% higher) and onion (1.5% higher).Records show that horticulture production has been consistently rising since 2012-13. Production is up. Producer is down. Thats the story of Indian agriculture, tweeted Yogendra Yadav , national president of Swaraj India who has been raising farm related issues.The remarks summed up what other observers too feel about growing production of not only horticultural produce but also of foodgrains. Record production of horticulture crops is the result of favourable weather and expectations of higher income based on past experience. But record production is not translating into higher returns, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said.Panwar, a farm expert and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, cited two major reasons for it. First, the central governments policy of containing inflation in food items and second, over-dominance of middlemen in supply chain of fruits and vegetables, specifically corporates, in some segments, he told TOI.Initial efforts of government such as price stabilisation funds and boost of food processing industry could not be rolled out because of budgetary constraints and lack of focused approach, he added.Actual production figures of horticultural crops in 2017-18 show that fruits recorded slightly higher growth than vegetables. Production of fruits in 2017-18 was estimated at 97.35 MT which was 4.8% higher than the previous year. Vegetables output at 187.5 MT in 2017-18, on the other hand, was 3.5% higher than 2016-17."

But, with three years of research at a private college here, students of first and second year Hotel Management and Travel and Tourism departments have come up with more than 100 varieties of halwa pizza.Have you heard of halwas like paan, maize, butterscotch, crunchy caramel, rum ball, coffee? These were among the jaw-dropping ones for world-renowned food critics and chefs who were there to taste them at an event in the college on Wednesday. Then, there were halwas catering to exotic tastes and mouth-watering ones for kids, prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables. And what about non-vegetarian halwas? Gotta be kidding! Well, well, they are those made of egg, theres also Shahi Mutton Halwa, and Chicken Halwa, to name a few.It is very difficult to convert mutton into a sweet dish, and cook it without onion and garlic. It took me almost six hours to prepare it, as it is a slow cooking procedure, said Hritik Rawar, student of first year hotel management at the college. Dev Kartik, another first year student, said: Egg bhurji and egg toast are passe in breakfast. When it comes to sweets, one can have egg halwa with mix fruit. Consuming a lot of time, rajma halwa was prepared by Aditi, another first year student. She said: Instead of sugar, I have used stevia leaves and rajma. This halwa is rich in protein content, but it took me almost three hours to cook.Halwas of fruits like mango, pomegranate, dragon fruit, coconut, papaya, cheeku, guava, apple, caramel, banana, plum, raw mango, blueberry, strawberry, and water chest were made by students with the puree of fresh fruits. Same goes for vegetables like potatoes topped with sweet French fries, spinach, cauliflower, and raddish. Bitter gourd  a vegetable that has less demand in the market  was also used to make halwa.Halwas for kidsKeeping nutritional values alive and the varying mood of kids in mind, students have also made halwas for children from cherry, gems, toffee pudding, and custard vanilla halwa.Payal Bassi, a first year student, used multi-vitamin bread, jam, nuts, and desi ghee to make halwa. She said: I have used this because my nephew loves jam, but he gets bored of carrying bread and jam to school on a regular basis. Thus, I chose this ingredient so that they can remain healthy by eating this halwa.Anirban Gupta, dean, Hotel Management and Aviation & Tourism at the college, said: In todays generation, everyone is after fast food. It is especially difficult for parents to feed them nutritious food like spinach, gooseberry, broccoli, woodapple (bel), bitter gourd, and pumpkin. We have made them in the form of halwa with a pizza base.Exotic halwasOther exotic halwas include dry fruits like pista, almonds, rawa kesari, mix fruit, khuskhus, walnut, khajoor, sesame, kaju, and kiwi, which were inspired by the Mughal period, as these ingredients are known for valour and strength.For health-conscious people, there were halwas made of oats and cornflakes, and mix root halwa (made of red and black carrot, and beetroot). Sweets with high sugar like chamcham, mix barfi, gulab jamun, milk cake, rabri, panjiri, balushahi, white rasgulla, and cottage cheese were also used with a donut base, so that they can relish both the sweet and the halwa.To make it to the international market, students have come up with innovative ideas like use of orange brownie, cookies, red velvet, cheese cake, tiramisu, Kit Kat, Oreo, fudge cake, and chocolate. Simran, a second year student, said: I have a bakery, but I am unable to serve an Indian sweet dish like halwa to people. So, to make it to the international market, I have tried an orange brownie.Students have also attempted acid-based ingredients like pineapple for making halwa. As milk gets curdled due to high acid content, they found processing could be done by tossing it into a sugar cane syrup or stevia leaves. The same process goes for lemon and orange.With their hard work to push a typical Indian dish into the international market, students have planned to sell it in the open market. They said hotel chefs could also approach them for recipes. Interestingly, these halwas will be served in the campus at reasonable prices through canning.WAH! KYA HALWA!* Some of the varieties included Exotic Halwa, Rasgulla Halwaizza, Cornflax Halwaizza, Pan Gulkand Halwaizza, Tiramisu Halwaizza, Mughal Gosht Halwaizza, Orange Brownie Halwaizza, Sarso Ka Saag Halwaizza, Murg Halwaizza, and Karachi Halwaizza.* The guests at the event were Kavita Bahuguna, famous food and hotel reviewer-writer, chef Sudhanshu, general manager from Maharaja Grand, celebrity chef Neelu Kaura, chef Shibiraj Saha, executive chef from Park Plaza, and chef Paramjeet Singh, executive chef from Keys Hotel.* The students showcased a lot of creative and innovative ideas for the event, where Hritik Rawat from BHMCT first year bagged the First Prize for Gosht Halwaizza, followed by Aditi from BTTM first year who bagged the second prize for Rajma Halwaizza, and the third prize was bagged by Gurkaran from BHMCT second year for Pan Gulkand Halwaizza."

Tribals wanted the male tiger, around nine years old, to be shot dead as it had killed three men in just over a month in the border areas of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in Dodda Byrana Kuppe, HD Kote taluk,Tribals were enraged at foresters after the tiger killed Jenu Kuruba tribal Mara aka Kencha, 55, from Macchur-Hosuru Haadi on Thursday evening when he entered the forest to graze goats and to dig up sweet potatoes. The tiger had recently killed another tribal youth sleeping outside his house in Macchuruhaadi.Forest staff traced the tiger to Hosuru, a few kilometres from Machhuru Haadi. Forest veterinarian Dr Mujeeb and staff Akram Pasha successfully tranquillised the wild cat and put in a cage. Dr Mujeeb found the tiger had sustained injuries on its front right leg and hind left leg, believed to have been caused in territorial fights with another male.Angry tribals had blocked the road HD Kote  Bavali Road, which passes inside the tiger reserve -- till Thursday midnight.Foresters had taken up combing operation in the region with five camp elephants to trace the tiger after the death of tribal Madhu, 28, from Manimoolehaadi in DB Kuppe range in December last week. They assured protesting tribals they had received orders either to capture or kill the tiger as it was turning into a maneater.Foresters confirmed the injured tiger had come from Metikuppe Range into DB Kuppe as was evident in videos captured in camera traps, on Friday, and took up the operation using camp elephants Arjuna, Abhimanyu, Krishna, Sarala, Gopalaswamy and Bhima. The operation was led by PCCF (Wildlife) Jairam and APCCF B P Ravikumar.Tribals protestTribals blocked the HD Kote  Kerala road on Friday by burning vehicle tyres and demanded foresters kill the captured tiger.

Currently unavailable, said the message below the productdescription for each item in the AmazonBasics collection.For most young shoppers like 31-year-old Subhajyoti who are used to bargain hunting online for everything from pyjamas to potato wafers, it was an e-retail Black Friday like they have never known as new foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations took effect, forcing Amazon and competitor Flipkart to pull down a humongous inventory of products from their virtual shelves.I was looking for a iPhone charging cable that used to be available as an AmazonBasics spin-off for around Rs 700. I was forced to buy a cable from a City Centre store that cost me nearly Rs 1800, Subhajyoti, a stockbroker, said.In the morning, Amazon had taken down even its own range of Echo speakers. These were back in the online marketplace by evening via other sellers on the platform.The new regulations prohibit online retailers from selling products of the companies in which they have a stake, as also their own brands. Both Amazon and Flipkart, which became a Walmart subsidiary last year, have been hit the hardest.The FDI rules also stop online retailers from making deals with manufacturers of various products to sell these exclusively on their platforms. Discounts and cashback promotions for these products are also gone.Amazon alone pulled out nearly 4,00,000 products, including its Presto-branded cleaning goods, AmazonBasics items like cables, chargers and batteries and clothing from Shoppers Stop, in which the Jeff Bezos-founded company has a 5 per cent stake. Currently unavailable. We dont know when or if this item will be back in stock, said the message that popped up each time one clicked on a garment sold by Shoppers Stop.Sanjana Agarwal, a 28-year-old software engineer, said she would even make her grocery and other household purchases online. On Friday, she couldnt buy a Presto glass cleaner she had been looking for on Amazon.The government should not decide how people buy things and who they purchase from, she said.A search for an Amazon Exclusive phone on the e-commerce website drew a blank. A search for headphones under the same category did not yield any result either. Flipkart also had no exclusive product on sale.Flipkart was forced to take down nearly a fourth of the products that it sells online, sources said.Regular online shopper Partha Sarathi Chakraborty, 31, fears that the new regulations for foreign e-commerce players would make buying on platforms more expensive.Now that sales by affiliated companies of the e-commerce websites are prohibited, several products have disappeared and others will get pricey as those will only be sold by small traders, who possibly cannot negotiate low wholesale prices with manufacturers, the Accenture employee said. Both Amazon and Flipkart will lose their edge if this continues. They will transform into sites listing products for a fee where quality cannot be assured.Garima Singh, a 35-year-old interior designer, said all she wanted was hassle-free shopping online and discounts. The rules clearly aim to protect the smaller traders but dont take into account the fact that consumers like us will have to shell out more. Discounts will shrink, if they havent already."

He has also directed the department to start steps for export of potato crop, with the help of freight subsidy which would soon be released to the Punjab Agro Industries Corporation.Amarinder has already asked the departments of school education and jails to purchase potatoes from the farmers for use in preparing meals. The chief minister said farmers were also suffering because of the Centres failure to help out the farming community across the country.Around 25 lakh tonnes potatoes are grown on about one lakh hectares in Punjab every year. The potato farmers have been facing problem because of the subdued prices of the crop for the last three years.Amarinder has also sought the industrys support in coming to help potato growers. Additional chief secretary for development Viswajeet Khanna said two potato processing plants would soon start processing the produce with a target of about 35,000 tonnes this season."

Farmer leaders said the announcement of Rs 6,000 yearly handout to small farmers ahead of the general elections was like giving a lollipop to them. As a mark of protest, they crawled up to the district headquarters and licked a lollipop.They also demanded fair compensation of land acquired for Inner Ring Road project.Rajveer Lawaniya, district president of Aloo Kisan Vikas Samiti, said, The central government has made fun of small farmers by proposing a payout of Rs 500 a month to each family. The scheme is aimed at wooing farmers ahead of the Lok Sabha elections by offering them peanuts. The entire Budget has no significant announcement for the farmers in distress.District president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rashtrawadi) Somveer Singh said, We are totally dissatisfied by this Budget. Farmers are distressed with not getting the right price for their crops. Government will give Rs 6,000 per annum to small farmers. This will not be enough to pay the electricity bills for irrigation .Block Baroli Ahir-based farmer Pradeep Sharma said, We had expected the government to declare minimum support price (MSP) for potato and wheat. But there was no word on it. A sum of Rs 6,000 is too meagre a sum. It cannot be considered an income.Alleging corruption in land acquisition for Inner Ring Road, farmers handed a memorandum to additional district magistrate (city) KP Singh for fair investigation and a time-bound action to benefit farmers with suitable compensation.Farmer leader Shyam Singh Chahar said, We have been continuously protesting for the last 26 months, demanding fair compensation for land acquired for the development of the Inner Ring Road. We have handed a memorandum to the ADM-city with clear evidence of injustice done to farmers. He has assured us a time-bound investigation and suitable action in the matter.In 2011, district administration under the inner ring road project of the state government had acquired land of around 150 farmers in Guthila and several other nearby villages.Farmers alleges that they were handed only partial compensation in 2013. The rate of compensation was not determined as per the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. And two years of interest on compensation was also not paid."

Besides, GST is being charged on products being used by farmers for agriculture. The crop insurance scheme announced by the Union government has already proven to be a failure as well as a scandal, he said.The state government has also been failing the farmers on various counts, from debt waiver to pending payments of sugarcane and initiating diversification to addressing the issue of potato glut. Their focus on stopping farmers from burning paddy stubble is now causing problems as the experiment of happy-seeder has also failed at several places, he added."

In horticulture, farmers have option to sell produce every 2 months and get remuneration.In Indore district, acreage under horticulture crop has risen to about 20 per cent of the total cultivable land.Horticulture crops are mostly 45-50 days crops and about 4 to 5 crops can be cultivated in a year unlike agriculture crops that are long duration with two main season kharif and rabi.Experts said in coming years cultivation of horticulture crop is seen expanding further with advancement in improvement in logistics facility and growing market locally and nearby.Kailash Agrawal, an agriculture expert said, The weather and soil of the region is well suited for horticulture and at the same time lot of units are coming, who are directly purchasing crops on advance demand from farmers for bulk supply and consumption in processing units."

The rates will continue to be low for another three to four weeks, said Panaji vegetable vendor, Jafar Mokashi.Another seller Rafiq Saigal said that the stock mainly arrives from Belagavi to Goa. The rates have decreased in Belagavi, going at Rs 15 per kg, due to which we have also reduced the wholesale prices here, he said.Besides onions, the sale of other essentials like tomato, coriander and potatoes also brought forth enthusiastic customers.With prices of most commodities being at an all-time high, it had become problematic for the average middle-class family to manage finances. The declining prices of vegetables has come as a welcome relief for us, said a housewife from Porvorim.Another buyer, Yesha Madan, from Panaji said that while the low prices are a good trend, efforts must be made by the horticulture department to ensure that vegetable rates remain pocket-friendly throughout the year.There must be more focus on organic vegetables, otherwise theres no point in buying vegetables that are cheap, she said."

The Sena chief also criticised the letter from the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), which conveyed good wishes to the activist, as condemnable and laughable.Hazare said, The Modi government is nearing completion of its full tenure, but it has not shown any inclination towards appointing a Lokpal. It is merely giving false promises to the people, said Hazare.Hundreds of villagers visit the Yadav Baba temple at the main square of the village every day to express their solidarity with Hazare.The veteran activist slammed the governments latest move of allocating Rs 6,000 per year to small farmers in the recently presented interim budget, saying it was trying to woo the community ahead of this years general elections. We have been demanding that the government start a monthly pension of Rs 5,000 for farmers who are aged over 60 and do not have a source of livelihood. The Rs 6,000 allocation is paltry as farmers will get only Rs 500 per month. How can they benefit from this amount? In fact, it is a bribe to the distressed farmers to get their votes in the upcoming elections, he said.Hazare said the NDA government has neither introduced progressive policies nor has taken positive decisions to resolve farmers issues. But at the same time, the government has exempted lakhs of crores of tax and loans of businessmen, he added.Such moves clearly show that the Modi government is more worried about businessmen than farmers. Even after 72 years of Independence, farmers are committing suicides, he said, alleging that the government was lying by claiming that it has given good prices for farm produce. If that is so, then why are farmers throwing their produce like onions, potatoes, tomatoes and milk on the roads? he asked.Hazare said the NDA government has not considered the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission. He also took a dig at other political leaders saying that they are now trying to project themselves as clean in a bid to gain political mileage in the elections.Earlier in the day, Hazare told the media that he was losing faith in chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as he had not fulfilled the promises he had made while convincing him (Hazare) to withdraw his fast on March 29 last year at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi. The CM has not fulfilled any of his promises relating to mitigating the problems of farmers and the appointment of Lokpal/Lokayukta, he said.On Sunday evening, state minister for water resources Girish Mahajan, who has been acting as an emissary between the government and Hazare, visited Ralegan Siddhi and had a closed-door meeting with Hazare for almost half an hour.Speaking to TOI, Mahajan said, I apprised Anna about various welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat health scheme and the subsidy on drip irrigation. I also explained that the state government has implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and has bought farmers produce with 1.5 MSP in the last few years. As far as appointment of a Lokayukta is concerned, I told him how it has got delayed due to various administrative issues and how the government will implement it at the earliest.Hazares personal secretary Datta Awari told TOI, The minister assured Anna that the state government will accept all his demands including implementation of the Swaminathan commissions recommendations. He also spoke to the chief minister over the phone for five minutes and discussed the same issues. As far as the central government issues are concerned, the minister promised that the PMO will soon communicate to the activist by Monday.Leader of the opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and former state agriculture minister Balasaheb Thorat met the activist and urged him to end the hunger strike considering his age and health issues. They also assured that they would put pressure on the government to consider Hazares demands, Awari said.Hazares office has, meanwhile, issued a statement calling upon his followers to intensify their agitation across the country."

MP Cold Chain Industries Association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, Storage capacity has doubled, but production of potatoes has dropped. This has disturbed the market owing to which many cold storages are ready to stock at much lower prices than agreed by the association.Gandhi said, at present there are close to 140 cold storages in Indore and Ujjain districts with a total capacity of 10 lakh tonnes.The association has fixed the rate for potatoes storage for this season at Rs 190 per quintal for 7 to 8 months, but, cold storages have decreased their rates by 30% due to lack of supplies and a steep competition, industry players said.A cold storage owner Rajiv Tuteja said, Cold storages are offering as low as Rs 130 per quintal for the entire season because there is limited supply and options are numerous. The new ones are the most-hit because they do not have a customer base to support their facility.Potato is the key commodity that is being stored in cold storages presently, but, adverse weather condition in the region is apprehended to have spoiled the produce by 15%.The flow of potatoes has gone up in the past few days and so far over 40% of the new season potatoes have come to cold storages.The association has not increased the rates from past 2 years because of poor market prices for potatoes.Farmers keep potatoes in cold storages to increase shelf life of the commodity and usually take out the produce when prices go up in retail market."

The rise is likely to make packaged chips dearer.Amid higher prices, chips manufacturers have pushed back bulk purchases and are buying only hand to mouth to keep the operation running, industry experts said.According to market participants, chips variety potatoes are offered at Rs 10 per kg to Rs 13 per kg as against Rs 8 per kg to Rs 10 per kg a year ago in the same period.Potato prices have gone up this season after output dropped by over 15 per cent in the state due to adverse weather condition, experts said.Large companies are not buying much. They are purchasing only as per their current demand because this year potato prices are higher, said Pradyumna Singh, procurement manager at an agri firm. Indore is a huge market for savories and potato items manufactured in the region and sold in other states such as Rajasthan Maharashtra and Southern India.Singh said, procurement this season will start at a slow pace and is likely to remain less than a year ago as cost of operations of chips manufacturers has risen by about 10 per cent.Experts said, potato prices may go up further once supplies will slow down in summers.Bhagawati Prasad Mukati, a raw potato chips maker from Koderiya said, Our margins have gone down this season. We will wait for some time for prices to cool down otherwise the price rise will be passed on to customers.Mukati said, raw potato chips are offered at Rs 50 per kg to Rs 90 per kg in the wholesale market. Though branded chips companies refrained from commenting on the price rise.Exports of premium quality potato from the region are also likely to drop this year because of poor availability and higher prices, experts said."

While Coca Cola India will invest Rs 500 crore, state sources said PepsiCo would pump in around Rs 300 crore.Finance and industries minister Amit Mitra announced Cokes investment plans in Siliguri in the presence of Coke India and South West Asia President T Krishnakumar.However, PepsiCo did not disclose its investment figures in West Bengal. Later, sources in the state government said that Coke has a plant near Siliguris Rani Nagar, which will be expanded. Sources said that a new product line would also be implemented.In a statement later, Pepsi-Co India reaffirmed its commitment to West Bengal and announced plans to expand its operations in the state. According to the cola major, it will invest in a new production line at its snacks manufacturing facility in Kolkata, while increasing its agricultural sourcing from farmers in the state. The fresh investment for expansion is in line with PepsiCos plans to double its snacks business in India by 2022 and has the potential to generate over 300 additional employment opportunities.As part of this expansion, PepsiCo India intends to increase its potato sourcing from West Bengal by 50%. The move supports the states industrialization led growth focus and will create broader socio-economic opportunities for farmers here, especially potato farmers. The business expansion will also provide a thrust on the transport sector.Reiterating PepsiCo Indias commitment to the state, Ahmed El Sheikh, president & CEO, PepsiCo India, said, West Bengal is an important market for us and our snacks manufacturing facility here plays a significant role in the larger success of our snacks business in India. As we expand our operations in the state, we have plans to significantly increase our potato sourcing from our farmer friends programme in West Bengal. Neelima Dwivedi, vice-president, PepsiCo India, represented the firm at BGBS.According to the US giant, potatoes used in Lays and Uncle Chipps are sourced from Indian farmers. Through its 360-degree farmer connect initiative for potato cultivation, PepsiCo provides training and seed support, advanced plant protection projects, and assured buy-back with reasonable returns.

The government has released Rs 5,450 crore towards the farm loan waiver scheme, he added.To counter Prime Minister Narendra Modis recent promise to give Rs 6,000 per acre a year to 12 crore farmers, Kumaraswamy announced a new scheme called Raitha Siri to offer farmers financial assistance of Rs10,000 per hectare to encourage farmers to grow millets. The government plans to increase the area under millet cultivation to 10,000 hectares.Keeping in view diminishing paddy yield and cultivation area in recent years, especially in coastal and Malnad districts, he announced the Karavali Package, financial assistance of Rs 7,500 per hectare to motivate farmers to cultivate paddy.Another new scheme, Raitha Kanaja, will provide minimum support price to 12 notified farm produce. A permanent collection centre is planned to be opened through the year in all Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees through a revolving fundThe government will also offer remunerative support price to six important minor millets, besides providing marketing facility and platform (Hopcoms, Nandini and other outlets) to sell their produce directly.With agriculture at the mercy of the monsoon, Kumaraswamy announced the implementation of the Israeli Model of Micro Irrigation System (IMMIS) with a corpus of Rs 145 crore and Zero-Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) with a corpus of Rs 40 crore. While both were envisaged last year, theyre being implemented this fiscal to grow crops profitably by using less water and promoting natural farming methods.To prevent distress sale of onion, potato and tomato when prices crash, the government will announce a base price and provide incentives under Price Deficiency Payment Scheme if produce is sold below it.The government has also decided to set up a Debt Relief Commission on the Kerala model to receive complaints from farmers about private monet lenders and redress their grievances. Itll shortly bring in the Gruhalakshmi Crop Loan Scheme for small and marginal farmers who will get a crop loan on their ornaments at an interest rate of 3%.Karnataka has the most dry land after Rajasthan. Our state has been affected by drought for 14 of 18 years since 2001. Farmers have become desperate due to repeated losses. While Malnad and coastal areas, including Kodagu, have suffered due to heavy rain, 156 taluks have suffered from drought.A glaring omission was the Raitha Belaku scheme announced by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government. Under it, farmers in drought-affected areas will get Rs 5,000 per month per hectare if the monsoons fails. The scheme has been scrapped in favour of the loan waiver scheme. It also means that Rs. 3,500 crore earmarked for the project last year will not be released, said a senior Congress leader.* Milk producers will get incentive of Rs 6 per litre* Rs 15,000 crore for interest subvention on farm credit* Rs 5,500 crore for crop insurance* 50% subsidy for agri startup entrepreneurs* Two world-class permanent farm demonstration centres at VC Farm, Mandya and Sindhanur, Raichur* Special package of Rs 150 crore to improve condition of pomegranate and grape growers* Mango processing units in Ramanagara and Dharwad districts under PPP model* Tomato processing units in Kolar district under PPP model* Mobile veterinary clinics in 15 districts* Fishing jetty for development of fishing at Malpe harbour in Udupi district* Smart weighing machines in all 162 APMCs"

While 1) and 2) may or may not be true all the time, 3) is a fact.The best example of this is Delhi University, an area which is now bursting at the seams with restaurants. You get all kinds of food there, from Naga and Assamese to Tibetan and Korean to American and Italian. Even Jawaharlal Nehru University is surrounded by several big and small eateries. And if you are in Old Rajender Nagar, you will find a whole new township of students  and a spate of restaurants.I was there last week  with an old friend, Raj  and thought I should try out one of the eateries that I had been hearing about. A part of Old Rajender Nagar is a hub of students  young men and women seeking to sit for the civil-service examinations. There are coaching centres all around, and students from across the country have taken rooms here. Eateries that serve regional food have sprung up in a market square next to the residential area, which is also the main market area.Old Rajender Nagar is on the right of Shankar Road if you are coming in from Connaught Place. I went there some months ago and had good Maharashtrian food at a place called Marathi Katta. This time, I wanted to try out an eatery called The Canteen. But it turned out that it had downed its shutters, so we went looking for other eateries, and came across Sri Annapurna, which serves Andhra cuisine.This is the place you should visit if you like your food hot. We saw the menu card and decided to get our lunch packed. I asked for a plate of tamarind rice (Rs. 90), two of upma (Rs. 60 a plate), one plate of chicken fry (Rs. 190) and another of chicken curry (Rs. 170 for half a plate). While the food was being readied, we shared a masala dosa (Rs. 80). The potato sabzi in the dosa was light but delicious, and the dosa itself was soft at the centre and crispy at the edges. Excellent.The young man at the counter urged us to wait for the chicken biryani, which had just been placed on the stove. But that was going to take another 30 or 40 minutes, so we reluctantly left without trying out the Andhra dum biryani (Rs. 150).We carried the lunch back home  and I must say I enjoyed the meal. The tamarind rice was nice and tart, and the chicken fry was hot and spicy. I enjoyed the thick gravy of the chicken curry, flavoured with onions and tamarind. I liked the upma, too, which was neither too oily, nor too dry. It had bits of peanuts in it, which added to the taste.I was right: Where there are students, you are bound to find food. Go try out Old Rajender Nagar. Its young and vibrant, just like its residents."

2019-02-09,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/a-homage-to-the-high-priest-of-haute-couture/cid/1684025,A homage to the high priest of haute couture,"As the exhibition, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, devoted to the French fashion icon, opened last week at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, I noticed people were standing in silent homage in front of the haute couture garments on show as though they were in a temple. Christian Dior made an immediate impact with his New Look, when he founded his fashion house in Paris in 1947. He died, aged only 52, from a heart attack in 1957, but was succeeded as creative director by his talented 21-year-old assistant, Yves Saint Laurent, and subsequently by the rational style of Marc Bohan, the flamboyance of Gianfranco Ferr, the exuberance of John Galliano, the minimalism of Raf Simons....If there is one image which captures the exhibition, it is that of Princess Margaret, photographed by Cecil Beaton in a Dior ball gown in organza for her 21st birthday. The exhibition presents over 500 objects, with over 200 rare haute couture garments alongside accessories, fashion photography, film, vintage perfume, original make-up, illustrations, magazines and Diors own possessions.On his travels, Dior picked up ideas, most notably from India, as the label to what looks like an embroidered sari dress makes clear: From embellishment techniques to the vibrant fabrics of the sari, the rich textile traditions of India inspired Christian Dior. Saris and draped fabrics of the Indian subcontinent are evoked in his 1953 evening dresses, some named after cities such as Agra and Soire de Lahore...In 1962 under the direction of Marc Bohan, the House of Dior staged its first fashion show in Mumbai and Delhi. Bolan would later create The Indian Year collection at Dior... Gianfranco Ferr, who had lived in India, paid homage to a country he loved in his Indian Passion collection of 1996. The following year John Galliano featured dresses inspired by the jewels of the Maharajahs.V. S. Naipaul The Telegraph pictureFraught relationshipDiana Athill, who died in London on January 23, aged 101, was a patrician lady and one of Britains most distinguished literary editors. For close to 50 years, she was based at the publishing house, Andr Deutsch, where she looked after many famous authors, including VS Naipaul, whose career might not have taken off had it not been for her support.He was never our biggest selling writer, she once said. We hung on to him because in those days we could afford to, if we admired someones writing. If it was today, I doubt he would have had a career like that, because publishers cant support writers who dont sell.She said she found the future Nobel laureate easily the most difficult writer Ive ever worked with. When she expressed mild reservations about one character in his 1975 novel, Guerrillas, Naipaul was so offended he walked out on her. It was as though the sun came out, she rejoiced. I didnt have to like Vidia any more.When Athill became an author herself and wrote several candid volumes of memoirs  I very much enjoyed her thoughts on growing old in Alive, Alive Oh! And Other Things that Matter  Naipaul said unkindly about her literary efforts: My publisher, who was so good as a taster and editor, when she became a writer, lo and behold, it was all this feminine tosh... I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me.Old connectionLord Swraj Paul has just been offered the honorary fellowship of the Zoological Society of London. This is the organization that runs the London Zoo and which he rescued from bankruptcy in 1990 with a gift of 1 million. This was in recognition of the happy times he had spent there with his four-year-old daughter, Ambika, in the closing days of her life in the 1960s.Pleasantly surprised  especially [considering] the company I am in, says Swraj. The elite list of fellows includes the Duke of Edinburgh (1977), Emperor Akihito of Japan (1991), Sir David Attenborough (1998), and, going back in time, Charles Darwin (1839).Perhaps this latest honour will remind the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, that she had asked Swraj to help with the modernization of Alipore Zoo  which, he tells me, he is more than willing to do, provided he is presented with specific proposals  financially or otherwise.Strange caseFrom lengthy experience, I can attest to the fact that The Daily Telegraph in London is a very cautious newspaper, where in-house lawyers scrutinize  and often cut out  anything potentially libellous. But it has apologized unreservedly to Melania Trump and agreed to pay her legal costs plus substantial damages after carrying a not-especially- scurrilous article about the First Lady of the United States of America, suggesting she did not have much of a modelling career until she met Donald Trump in the 1990s.What is odd is that the magazine cover story by the US journalist, Nina Burleigh, is based essentially on her book, Golden Handcuffs: The Secret History of Trumps Women, which has been published in the US without attracting action from Melanias legal team.'Sweet potato biriyani' Amit RoyFootnote"

The budget also proposes Rs 247.60 crore for maintenance and construction of gaushalas in the rural areas.Malkhan Chauhan, a small farmer in Darveshpur (Barabanki), some 55 km from here, told IANS how his 3-bigha farm land had been devastated by stray cattle. ""I spent a lot of money for seeds and fertilisers, and now the cattle menace have forced me to shell out another Rs 10,000 to fence the field to protect the crop,"" said an upset Chauhan.A frustrated Ranjeet Maurya (40) in neighbouring Kanhaipur who lost his crop to the menace criticised the Yogi Adityanath government for his troubles. ""Yogi ordered closure of slaughterhouses, now see what's happening,"" he said and added cow vigilantes and Hindu outfits should ""adopt ten cows each"". Crops of potato, wheat and mustard have been destroyed by the stray bulls and cows in his village, he said.Many cattle has also been abandoned due to growing mechanisation of farming. Rizwan Ahmad, a dairy owner in Hariharnagar, said once the cows go dry (stop giving milk) they are thrown out by farmers. ""What else do we do of them?"" he asked.Many Muslim milk sellers like Ahmad Ali, a dairy owner in Chinhat, said his community is scared. ""We hear stories about members of the community being roughed up for transporting cows,"" he said. They can neither keep a large number of animals nor abandon them, he added.That the cattle menace has taken centre-stage for many farmers can be gauged from the fact that in many parts of the state, angry farmers have locked up cattle in schools, hospitals, community health centres. Their demand: fix this menace. Their threat: face music at the hustings.The government has expedited building cattle shelters and 'gau shaalas' but the bureaucratic inertia seems to have retarded the pace. Thus the state missed the January 10 deadline set by the Chief Minister Adityanath for district magistrates to shift stray cattle to these shelters. Penal action has also been sought against cattle owners who abandon or lock them up in public properties.""The chief minister is serious about the issue. Many steps are being taken to tackle the problem"", additional chief secretary (Information) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told IANS.There are 510 registered cow shelters in the state. According to a 2012 government data, there were around two crore cows in the state. Adityanath has also called for a fresh census and allocated funds for that.Animal Husbandry Minister S.P.

However, he pointed out that the number of stray cattle was also a reflection of the staggering number that was being slaughtered before the ban.""Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesman Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said the BJP government has ""misplaced priorities"" and predicted that farmers' anger ""would cost them dear"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The state government has also levied a 0.5 per cent tax Cow Protection Cess on eight government departments, including the cash-rich excise department."
2019-02-10,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/scaling-fish-and-other-grand-lessons-from-a-grandparent/cid/1684097,Scaling fish and other grand lessons from a grandparent,"A slim ray of the Fall afternoon sun cut diagonally through the stainless steel platter. Five healthy tilapias lay on it, dressed in turmeric and salt. She had spent the last half hour by the kitchen window scaling the fish and cutting them into Bengali style steaks for the maachher jhol or fish curry.Thats not how you do it, Ma, shrieked her 14-year-old daughter. With a gentle shove, the otherwise chore-averse teenager took the knife from her mothers hand and holding it tangentially along the shimmering length of the fish, kept scaling away with natural dexterity. Learnt it from the master: you know who, she said as her eyes beamed with pride. Dadu, of course!She did remember. Her daughter was just about seven. Going to the Chinese fish market was a regular Sunday afternoon activity. Post-lunch tea in hand, they would set out  her father with his two grandchildren on the rear seat of a second-hand Toyota Corolla and she, the chauffeur.He talked about his friend, Jibainya, and his cataclysmic pranks: rowing the boat in the Padma river with him and a huge jackfruit on board. All Dadu had wanted was to taste the fruit, an expensive wish for a schoolteachers child. Jibainya, the village chiefs prodigal son, acquired a whole jackfruit to fulfil his friends wish. Eat it, or else Ill sink the boat, came Jibainyas sermon in the middle of the Padma. Dadu laughed and shivered. Along the way, the Toyota Corolla sometimes stopped at a shoeshine, where her father and the children merrily gave themselves the gift of a brown/black polish, and quibbled about not having the luxury of a rickshaw in America! After all, no Toyota could beat the fun of riding a rickshaw that could stop anywhere and everywhere.Her father was very particular about his fish: the roe had to be separated and deep fried, the heads cooked in Bengali style murighonto with onions, potatoes, and fine gobindobhog rice brought back from Calcutta every year. All through the fish-cutting and dressing ceremony came cups of tea from the kitchen, the first long dip of the teabag reserved for her father, followed by a series of quick dips of the recycled teabag for two dolls house-sized cups. Fried fish roe, anyone? Dadu would call out to the children, and the two would come running out of their pigeonholes.Every summer theyd go on long drives, sometimes to the Upper Peninsula, where the Great Lakes meet, and sometimes down south, in their seven-seater van. Dora the Explorer and Scooby Doo backpacks were filled with colourful towels, board games, and the hot and spicy Kurkure snacks pirated from India. Baba, why do you load your suitcases with junk food, she would complain, and the brother-sister duo would quickly exchange silent, this too shall pass glances with their Dadu.On these trips, her father was in charge of two big flasks  one filled with black tea, the other with milk tea. Every hour they would stop for a ceremonial tea break. The children got their share of milk tea in Chhota Bheem cups, served with Parle-G biscuits that came in yellow and red striped packages from the Indian store.Dadu had taught Momo the surya pranam mantra. At first, those hard ss in Sanskrit just wouldnt sit on the third graders American tongue. Then one afternoon as the twilight was hiding behind the trees, the little girl spotted butterflies. She started chasing them, dandelions laughing at her feet, her skirt dancing in the wind, and arms trying to catch the sky. Thats when she heard Dadus voice carried by the wind Om Japakusum Sankashang Kashyapeyang Mahadyutim It was not the time for the surya pranam mantra, or perhaps it was. For at that very moment the hard s magically came to her! At the end of one summer, it was time for Dadu and Didaan to return. Momo entered middle school that Fall, but Dadu never came back from that trip to India. The scrapbook he had started for Ujaan lay incomplete.It is the day of 14 lamps today, a day of remembrance. She has spent the entire day cooking an all-fish meal. Later, when the crisp Fall afternoon will roll into the evening, she will prepare 14 cotton wicks with the children, fill the painted clay lamps with oil and place them out in the porch facing the stars. The children will know their Dadu by the brightest star shining in the distant firmament. At night, Momo will light the lamps in a path to the sky, and together brother and sister will fall asleep dreaming of Dadu riding his favourite rickshaw on the Milky Way."

While some areas, including Delhi-NCR, could get hailstorms, most places may just receive light rain,"" said B P Yadav, head of the IMD's regional meteorological centre here.The fresh forecast comes close on the heels of the damage caused by last week's hailstorms. Experts said places such as Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and the adjoining Dabwali area of Haryana suffered heavy damage to standing mustard crops.Elsewhere in Haryana, the damage was restricted to four-five districts in the south. These districts (Bhiwani, Rewari, Mahendragarh, Dadri and parts of Mewat) reported 5% to 10% crop loss. It affected mainly bajra and mustard, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director in the state agriculture department.Yadav said a number of factors made last weeks hailstorm activity unusual  including a confluence of winds coming from opposite directions and jet stream winds in the upper levels, which lead to strong cloud formation.The western disturbance was much stronger last time and we had winds from Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea coming, and meeting on top of the northern plains, leading to such a phenomenon. While there is an active western disturbance this time around as well, the other factors are not present this time around, said Yadav.There were reports of potato and other vegetables taking a hit in Punjab, where CM Amarinder Singh has ordered a special survey to assess crop losses due to the storm. Most of the wheat crop may have escaped damage because the plants have not yet attained much height. The moisture could, in fact, be beneficial, some experts said.Temperatures in the region had plummeted by almost eight degrees in some parts of NCR after the hailstorms, and the chill is likely to continue till Monday.While Delhis minimum temperature was recorded at 6 Celsius on Sunday, officials from the regional met department say it could rise to around 13 Celsius as the rain spell approaches. The western disturbance (WD) scheduled to hit the region this week will be the third this month. In January, seven WDs impacted north India, higher than the normal number of four to six, leading to rain and heavy snowfall across the western Himalayas. The high frequency of WDs hitting the region continues.Meanwhile Delhis air quality deteriorated to the poor category on Sunday with an overall Air Quality Index of 276  an increase from Saturdays reading of 158 (moderate). Agencies say air quality is likely to deteriorate in the next few days before it improves after a spell of rain.Air quality in Delhi is in the poor category now and the clam night situation and strong surface inversion has led to almost doubling of the pollutant concentration. The air quality can further degrade in the next three days, said SAFARs daily forecast on Sunday.In Video: Heavy rain, hailstorm lash Delhi-NCR"

A total of 40 breeds were paraded around three rings from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.A total of 253 dogs were registered from across the State, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. Foreign breeds such as Afghan Hound, Fox Terrier, German Shepherd, Doberman, St. Bernard, Rottweiler, Pug, Golden Retriever, Beagle, Min Pin, Bulldog, French Bulldog and Bull Mastiff took part in the event.The competition was divided into three rounds for each breed. Dogs were also adjudged in sub-categories based on their age. A Best of breed dog was selected in each round based on their upkeep, health and movement and they competed in the finals for the overall trophy.This is the first time we are conducting the native breed contest in Madurai and it has evoked a good response from many parts of south Tamil Nadu. This is heartening, said S. Ramanathan, secretary of Madurai Canine Club.Mr. Ramanathan said Indian breeds piqued the interest of youngsters after the jallikattu protests in 2017. They have realised the importance of preserving native things, he said.Dog owners from rural parts of Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts had brought ferocious dogs to the event. Breeders in cities sell native breeds for at least Rs. 25,000 because of high demand. However, villagers end up selling them for a meagre Rs. 5,000 because they are unaware of the market trends. Events such as this will give them exposure and a chance to socialise with fellow breeders, he said.G. Nellaiappan from Sattur, whose dog won a gold medal in the junior category, said he gave special fitness training for his dog every day. We do not feed the dog biscuits as advertised in the media. We stick to rice and meat and puree of carrots, potatoes, milk and eggs to improve the sheen of the coat, he said. He rears 20 other dogs at his farm and said that many of them take part in shows.Shijesh Joseph from Alleppey, Kerala, said his two Labrador and Pug competed at the event.

As chief guests, Girish Vyas and Hemant Gadkari were present who distributed the curry free of cost among public.Even after toiling for months our farmers dont get sufficient economic benefit of their produce. To promote healthy and organic produce we procured vegetables from them and prepared this curry, Manohar told TOI. Organic produce tastes deliciously different as well, he added.The preparation included 1,300 kgs of vegetables like spinach, methi leaves, carrots, potatoes, onions, black chana, tomatoes, carrots, eggplant, coriander leaves, curry leaves, ginger garlic paste and drumsticks.Spices and oil constituted remaining 200 kgs. Cooked in organic groundnut oil, the curry was cooked in a vessel of 2000kg capacity and was lip smacking good by popular demand.I had come earlier when he was still cooking, then I came back again to take it home for my husband. We didnt prepare lunch at home when we came to know that vegetables are all organic. It tastes just delicious, said a homemaker R Laxmi as she put lid on steaming hot dabba of curry.The vegetables were made available to Manohar by a food delivery group Farm2Fridge that promotes organic farm produce and eco-friendly things.We have tied up with farmers who provide us with organic produce from their farms, which we then deliver door-to-door after booking done on our mobile app, said the city business head Pallavi Pandit."

Please meet Lalitesh Tripathi, Imran Masood, Ajay Kumar Lallu, Annu Tandon, Deepak Singh ... Rahul would tell her and she would briefly engage them in a quick conversation.There were 44 halts in the roadshow and district Congress presidents from 80 constituencies had to be accommodated.But as each leader would stick around, she and Rahul ensured that they must be rotated so that most leaders get a chance to be on the truck with her. Those leaders who could not initially find space, she ensured a separate bus behind her truck, said a senior Congress leader. The route was strategically kept in a way that it would cross most offices of political parties for her acquaintance, said party officials.While the halt at Gandhi statue and Sardar Patel statue ensured she took a long view of the BJP party headquarters that stands right next to the Lok Bhawan, the halts on Mall Avenue here meant she passed by the Samajwadi Party (SP) minority wing office, SP rebel Shivpal Yadavs residence and BSP supremos Mayawati residence. At one juncture, Priyanka had an eyeful of the public works department (PWD) building, known as Nirman Bhawan, when many government employees came out in the balcony and waved at her.She was seen making polite enquiries from random potato farmers who came from Agra and Kannauj over the glut crisis.There were occasions when the siblings would lift a kid in their arms or a identify the most animated supporter and collect memorabilia from them. Rahul, however, remained protective of her sister as much as she did as they would promptly kneel down or crane their necks from dangling electric wires as the rath made its way through streets of Burlington Chowraha and Odeon Hotel and Chedilal hotel.As the supporters continued to mob them in narrow lanes of Lucknows old city, the two took took their gig to an SUV where they sat atop together. Their acts were aped by senior Congress leaders like Pramod Tiwari, P L Punia, and RPN Singh. Often, Rahul would bring Congress West UP joint secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia and UP chief Raj Babbar into a discussion.The recent crisis over the hooch tragedy in UP that has left more than 40-odd deaths between Saharanpur and Kushinagar remained the top of Priyankas concern.She expressed desire to meet the Kushinagar families where hooch has killed many people. This of course is a sham that cow cess has imposed on liquor on one hand, while the hooch is killing people in UP. We told her the incidents, said Congress legislative party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu."
2019-02-13,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/the-best-way-to-lose-weight-is-portion-control/cid/1684442,The secret to weight loss: portion control,"Heres some good news for a change: the publication of an eminently sensible approach to weight loss, Finally Full, Finally Slim, written by a leading expert on portion control, Lisa R. Young. Unlike the myriad diet fads that have yet to stem the ever-increasing girth of American men and women, what Young  a registered dietician and adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University in the US  describes is not a diet but a practical approach to food and eating that can be adapted to almost any way of life, even if most meals are eaten out or taken out. It is not prescriptive or even proscriptive. It does not cut out any category of food, like carbohydrates or fats, nor does it deprive people of their favourite foods, including sweet treats.And it works. I know, because more than half a century ago I lost 40 pounds [18.1kg] in two years following Youngs approach, and Ive kept the weight off ever since without dieting or deprivation. It fills me up with delicious, nutritious foods and allows me to enjoy a frequent nightcap of ice cream  half a cup (measured) at 150 calories or less. Youngs emphasis is less on what you eat and more on how much you eat of any food, including those considered healthful.If youre serious about losing or maintaining weight, youd be wise to learn the size of a healthful portion of various categories of foods and treat what is typically served in restaurants to individual diners as servings for two or more. My lean and mean son and daughter-in-law in Los Angeles,US, routinely order one entree for two people, and often have leftovers to take home for lunch the next day. In fact, my daughter-in-law usually requests a to-go container when the meal is ordered and packs up the excess food even before they dig in.Still, Young insists  and I agree  that its far more helpful to prepare and eat most of your meals at home. Youll know whats in them (was that grilled fish you ordered prepared with a tablespoon of butter?) and how much lands on your plate. In fact, start by downsizing your dinner dishes to salad-plate size, and you can save nearly 600 calories a meal. Use measuring cups to dole out reasonable portions until you are able to eyeball them accurately. You might also invest in a kitchen scale to help you keep meat, poultry and fish servings to three or four ounces (85 to 113gm).I know youve heard this before, but it bears repeating: Fill half or more of your plate with low-carbohydrate vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, green beans, carrots and Brussels sprouts, and have a side salad with a dribble of dressing. Limit starchy vegetables like white and sweet potatoes (baked, not fried) and grains (whole, not refined) to a half-cup serving, one-cup max.Young urges people to get over their fear of carbs  if youre eating the right kinds of grains in the right amounts, they dont make you fat. They make you full  and provide you with a battalion of disease-fighting nutrients, she wrote. But watch out for those oversized New York bagels, whole grain or otherwise, that are the caloric equivalent of six slices of bread.Many people are unaware of how much, or how often, they eat. Keeping a food diary, recording everything you consume and where for a week or so, can help you recognise sources of mindless or excess consumption and their relationship to your feelings and circumstances.Be wary of nutrition halos  foods deemed healthful but loaded with calories, albeit from healthy fats. A friend who moved to California gained 25 pounds [11.3kg] in a year eating avocados from the tree in her yard. A serving of avocado is 1/4 cup. Same for nuts, which, along with air-popped corn, are my favourite snacks.At the same time, Young and I recognise the dangers inherent in feeling deprived of cherished, not-so-good-for you foods. When I was shedding those 40 pounds, I included one small treat a day  a few tablespoons of ice cream, a small cookie, a slice of quick bread, or sliver of cake or pie  lest after weeks of no treats I break down and devour half a cake or a quart of ice cream at one sitting.Young suggests incorporating treats and sweets into your food plan, a few times a week, though perhaps not every day while youre trying to lose weight. And, as Dr Sylvia R. Karasu, clinical professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine, US, points out in her fun and fact-filled new book, Of Epidemic Proportions: Expanded Edition 2019, it helps to keep those treats out of sight and easy reach."

2019-02-15,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/7-floors-of-organic-yield/cid/1684609,7 floors of organic yield,"The West Bengal State Agricultural Marketing Board has tied up with the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) to start an organic market between the Harley Davidson showroom and Eco Park. The name of the market will called Joibo Haat meaning organic market in Bengali.Minister of the agricultural marketing department, Tapan Dasgupta, laid the foundation stone on January 17 in presence of ministers Sujit Bose and Purnendu Basu.The plot, that has been leased from NKDA, measures around 14.77 cottahs, the building will be a G+6 one and the project should take two years to complete. The estimated cost is Rs 11.40 crore and funds are being raised from the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.People are falling sick these days due to chemicals in fertilisers. Going organic is a much safer option, Dasgupta told The Telegraph Salt Lake. Also, we wanted to give a platform to those involved in organic farming.According to an official of the state agricultural marketing board, they have already called for a tender to build the market. We expect construction to start within the next few weeks, said the official.Organic supermarketThe market will have separate floors for a variety of organically grown fruits, vegetables, rice, pulses, flowers and even honey. The idea is to create an organic hub in New Town. According to the officer, the organic produce will not only taste better but will also be healthier.We want to give a super market-like experience to shoppers who come here. Everything stocked will be organically produced with zero use of chemical fertilisers or pesticides. All racks will be properly labelled, the official said.Organic produce growers and self help groups from all over the state will be welcome to showcase and sell their produce too.The farmers markets organised in Calcutta get good response from both buyers and sellers so we believe there is a ready market for organic products. Organic farming is being undertaken in large scale in North and South 24-Parganas and weve observed that people of New Town are ready to pay higher prices for quality products. So setting shop in New Town would guarantee more buyers, the officer said.The ground, first and second floors will house the organic market. The third floor will house an organic food court. The fourth floor will have training centre for skill development. The fifth floor will house an advanced laboratory and office. The sixth floor will have a guesthouse.Gourds hanging from the overhead structures. The Telegraph pictureTower planters on the terrace of Karigori Bhavan, maintained by Owl Spirit. The Telegraph pictureCrates of vegetables waiting to be taken home from the Hari Mitti farm behind Sector V. The Telegraph pictureThe laboratory will not only conduct research on organic farming but also verify whether a vegetable is organic or not.This will be the first laboratory in the state to conduct such tests. Currently, to conduct such tests samples are sent to other states. This adds to expenses.The laboratory will also work to develop organic fertilisers and the facility will have regular workshops to encourage farmers from the villages to shift to organic methods.Sikkim has managed to become Indias first fully organic state by implementing organic practices of farming on around 75,000 hectares of agricultural land. It had taken Sikkim around 12 years to achieve this feat and Bengal is now taking baby steps towards organic methods.Farm on your rooftopDebashis Sen, the chairman of NKDA, said such a market in New Town would give plenty of opportunities for residents to buy fresh produce and also motivate them to have roof-top gardens where vegetables can be grown.We are already in talks with agencies to develop rooftop farms on individual plots and buildings. Farming and gardening on the roof of a building will enhance the look of the terrace and provide quality food to residents. It will also keep the building cooler in summer, said Sen.NKDA runs a farm on the terrace of CB Market near Novotel and Sen says hydroponics and other alternative methods for container gardening are being used there extensively. This farm was started by Owl Spirit, a company formed by the NGO Uthnau, in 2017. They grew gourds, spinach, beans, cucumbers, carrots, brinjals etc in baskets up there.At present, they are working on tower planters at Karigori Bhavan opposite Uniworld City. These are containers stacked one above the other and they are growing brinjals, chillies, gourds and spinach on trial basis there.We have been approached by the NKDA to help residents grow organic food in their balconies and terrace, says director of Owl Spirit, Kunal Deb. Chemical use in commercial crops has spread to such an extent that even if you have money today you cant buy healthy food. Its best if you can grow your own food then.Hari Mitti is another agency that has been approached. This Sector V-based company prepares crates of fruit, vegetable and herbs to sell to residents. The nascent stages of plants are the most delicate. We shall look after the plant at this stage and hand them over when they are older and hardy. We also provide lifelong maintenance of the plants, says Suhrid Chandra, the founder.That there is a demand for organic farming is clear from the fact that Hari Mitti has started managing 82 rooftops over the past two years. If a family takes in 30-35 crates, it won't need to buy any vegetables from the market besides potatoes and onions.Both the agencies try to avoid using soil. Instead they use coco peat, vermin compost, hydroponics etc. These options are lighter than soil and also, if we use soil, no matter where we source it from, it will be contaminated with chemicals, says Chandra.But the agencies are wary of practical problems. In 2014, Owl Spirit had started an urban farm on the terrace of Siddha Town in Rajarhat. They had to discontinue after nine months after residents refused to pay for its maintenance. Residents can also complain about insects, those living on the top floor may complain of disturbance, says Deb. So we have requested minister Firhad Hakim to allow us to carry out urban farming atop government buildings.Residents are keen to give organic farming a shot. I shall be retiring in six months and thereafter would love to indulge in gardening. When I moved to New Town I had about 25 pots but most of them didnt survive. With help from these experts I would love to grow lemons, chillies and other fruits and vegetables, says Chaita Mukherjee, a resident of Sree apartments.Inputs from Sudeshna Banerjee"

The condition affects the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy.Addressing the gathering, S. S. Jegaram, orthopaedic surgeon, and Veena Jegaram, obstetrician-gynaecologist, came out with various myths and facts about Type 1 diabetes, and explained how parents could come to terms with the diagnosis.If one is able to keep the sugar levels under control, there is no limit to what one can achieve, said Dr. Jegaram.The entire family must be involved in helping the diabetic child feel at ease with his or her medical condition. Being overprotective only adds to their sense of social isolation, he added.Said Dr. Veena: For the past few years, we have been seeing cases of young Type 1 diabetic women undergoing a lot of emotional turmoil to bear children because every time the sugar goes out of control, it will directly affect the baby. Once they cross the abortion risk, these mothers also face the danger of the child having congenital deformities.Both doctors said a healthy diet based on ethnic food choices was essential to keeping blood sugars under control.We have to avoid giving children pre-packaged snacks like potato chips or sweetened drinks, and street food. It is better to go for home-cooked traditional fare like idlis, idiappams and millets, said Dr. Veena. Theres a lot of misinformation about what is beneficial for a diabetic diet, so we must check with a medical professional and also test at home to decide on what is okay for a patient to eat.The workshop was organised by Sakthivel Sivasubramaniam, endocrinologist, and Abhirami, homeopathy consultant.

2019-02-20,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/learn-to-burn-fat/cid/1684963,Fat free,"Food was scarce in prehistoric times. Whenever humans ate well, a portion was stored as fat to be used in times of starvation ShutterstockWould you like to turn your body into a fat-burning machine? Then even if you did put on a little weight, it would melt right off you. And no, you dont have to follow any extreme diet or exercise regime for that; just a few simple instructions.First, you have to figure out why your body stores fat. In prehistoric times, there was no guarantee that humans would get food every day. Whenever they found an abundance of food (an animal hunted down, an orchard of fruit), the body stored the extra calories as fat  especially in the abdominal region  to use in times of starvation. These days, of course, the stored fat is never broken down until there is an acute calorie deficiency.The only way to avoid fat deposits is to eat only as many calories as you can burn. If you do not want to restrict your diet, make sure you take enough exercise.Diet dos and dontsCarbohydrates: Avoid simple carbohydrates such as sugar, sweets, maida, soft drinks and fruit juice. Keep a tab on starchy food items like rice, chapattis, bread, pasta and noodles. Brown rice, brown bread and unpeeled potatoes are friendlier carbs. A healthy, moderately active adult needs about 150g of carbohydrate every day. As staples you can have about 100g rice, chapattis or bread. In addition, have 50g lentils, 500g vegetables, 300g fruits and a cup of milk.Dont have starchy food after sunset if you dont move or work hard after 6pm. Its better to have low-calorie items such as green vegetables, salad, clear soup, fish, chicken, paneer or lentils for dinner, which you should have by 7-8pm. Take a walk or do light household work after dinner to allow the glucose in your food to burn. Go to bed at least two hours after your meal.Fats: If you want to get rid of flab, you dont need to give up fat altogether, assures Priyanka Rana, a consultant nutritionist in Calcutta. Just give up food that is fried, processed and categorised as fast food. Such foods are loaded with trans fat that not only aids deposition of fat in the body but also leads to a host of diseases. Eat nuts, avocados, whole eggs, oily fish, non-skimmed milk, butter and olive oil in salads or sauteed vege-tables. Fatty foods keep you full for longer, helping you restrict your calorie intake.Proteins: If you eat enough protein, you dont feel hunger pangs and are energised. Also, the processing of protein burns loads of calories. If you are a moderately active adult, you can have as many grams of protein as your ideal weight in kilograms. For instance, if your ideal weight is 65kg, have 65g of protein. You can increase the amount of protein based on how rigorously you exercise. Theres about 20g of protein in 100g of fish, meat or lentils. In 50g of egg, youll get about 6.5g of protein and 100ml of milk or curd has 4g.Fibres: You need 12-14g of fibre a day, which you can get from whole grains (brown rice, lentils, chapattis) and green vegetables. The fibre keeps you filled up, enabling you to eat at least 10 per cent less calories. If your diet does not have enough fibre, you can have 2-3 spoons of isabgol two times a day.Fluids: You can have coffee or tea without milk and sugar 3-4 times a day. Drink at least eight glasses of water every day. If you can tolerate chilled water, have a few glasses daily. Every glass of cold water forces your body to shed a calorie to bring the water to body temperature.Focus on exerciseIf you have been doing a lot of exercise, dont think that you can gorge on food, especially food that is fried or processed. Be careful about oil, ghee, alcoholic drinks and starchy food. Also, you must focus on those work-outs that burn a lot of fat. However, dont start an exercise regime until you have consulted a doctor, says Ashok Das, a bodybuilder and fitness coach.You must work out under the guidance of an expert for at least five days a week. Never exercise on an empty stomach. If you have half an hour in hand, eat two egg whites and a boiled potato. If it is 45 minutes, have oats. In case you have had a heavy and fat-rich meal, you must wait for at least two hours before you work out. You can have a cup of black coffee before you start your workout routine.Warm yourself up in 5-10 minutes through walking, running or cycling before the workout. After light stretching, do weight training for 20-40 minutes. Then do core exercises, which should be followed by a cardio workout for 30-40 minutes. This helps burn a lot of fat. Then do cooling exercises and take some rest. You can also take a shower in hot water.If you follow this schedule, you will not only burn a lot of calories and fat but strengthen your muscles. Strong muscles help shed calories when you rest (resting calories). This will prevent deposition of fat and aid in burning calories, adds Das.Last but not the least, get enough sleep. It helps prevent the deposition of unhealthy fat."

The members appraised the House that about 80% of potato crop had been damaged and farmers were facing huge losses. They urged the House to get a survey conducted to ascertain the exact quantum of losses.Gurpreet Singh Wadala of SAD said that potato was being sown over 1 lakh acre across Punjab and farmers had invested around Rs 70,000 per acre. The extent of damage is so high that the farmers will not be left with seeds for the next year, said Wadala. Acknowledging losses and damage, Randeep Singh Nabha of the Congress said that the farmers were in distress and the government should help by compensating them. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders also raised the issue and demanded compensation for farmers.In the budget, Punjab government had announced a Potato Seed Village Scheme for which a provision of Rs 2 crore had been made. The scheme had been planned with an aim to improving the quality of seed potato and expand the area under seed production.Raising the issue of three persons being crushed to death by a private bus in Ferozepur on Wednesday, members demanded enactment of law to punish owners of private buses involved in fatal accidents. Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, Congress MLA, said that the buses of the same private transporter had been involved in five accidents in recent months, killing 11 persons. Demanding action against the transporter, Warring said that he would protest against his own government, if no action was taken. Why cant we take action? Are we so helpless? he questioned.Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema called for the need to book those involved in fatal accident under Section 304 ( culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the of the IPC instead of 304-A (causing death by negligence). There is no deterrence. The accused gets bail immediately, said Cheema.Punjab transport minister Aruna Chaudhary informed the House that rules in this regard were in place but need fine tuning to make them more effective. She further said that training would be given to all drivers to avoid such incidents."

To make them even more dependent on the wheat-paddy cycle is the acceptance of demand for increase in MSP by the Centre almost every year.Raising the issue of muchneeded diversification of crops in the state, former power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjeet Singh on Friday said in the Punjab legislative assembly that the maize grown during the monsoon season, potato and beetroot (chukandar) could be the best substitutes to the wheat and water-guzzling paddy crops.The minimum support price (MSP) for wheat and paddy has always been a political issue in Punjab.The Centre fixes MSP for 25 crops every year but the Punjab government has only undertaken procurement exercise ofwheat and paddy on behalf of the Food Corporation of India for distribution through public distribution process(PDS).Though the state machinery thinks that Maize could be an alternative to motivate farmers to come out of the wheatpaddy cycle and to implement diversification, but the state government is reluctant to undertake Maizes procurement despite the central government fixing its MSP. It reasons that Maize cannot be used for supply in the PDS.Since 2009-10, MSP of wheat has increased from Rs 1,080 per quintal to Rs 1,735 per quintal in 2018-19. In case of paddy, it was Rs 1,030 per quintal in 2009-10 and has gone up to Rs 1,770 per quintal in this fiscal. The Union government in October 2018 had increased the MSP on wheat by 6% to Rs 1,840.Experts point out that the Centre calculates MSP after considering all the aspects, including the farm input cost, but farming is not now a viable option for at least marginal farmers having land less than 2.5 hectares. Sher Singh Sangwan, retired professor (SBI chair) at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRIID) at Chandigarh, says though the Centre fixes the MSP for over 20 crops implementation is tough.We cannot compare the per year increase of MSP with the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission report since the commission did not specify the cost of production, he said.In order to ensure fair price to the farmer and save him from distress sale of agriculture produce, Sangwan suggests regulating the production of various crops on the basis of domestic and export demand like developed countries USA, UK and Australia.On the basis of various expert suggestions and his own experience in the field, Kahan Singh Pannu, secretary of the state agriculture department, has compiled one such list.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) council has levied 12% - 18% GST on the agriculture machinery and it various components in 2018. This has not only resulted in the machinery becoming costlier but also increase in the agriculture input cost. The GST on the PTO shaft as well as the gear boxes used in agriculture machinery has been levied at the rate of 28%. Pannu is of the opinion that this GST should atleast be reduced to 4%.Punjab government has a proposal to diversify around one million hectare of paddy out of a total of three million hectare to alternative crops, mainly maize. This has been planned after taking note of the fact that groundwater being used for cultivation of paddy is going down every year. As many as 110 blocks out of a total of 135 have already gone into dark zone and 45 blocks out of these have become critical.The Union government had in June 2018 allowed the conversion of Maize into bio-ethanol for blending it with petroleum products. Ethanol to the tune of 20% can be blended with petrol and upto 5% with the diesel.Pannu feels that the national policy on biofuel-2018 requires amendment to allow conversion of corn or maize as a source independent of other food grains otherwise it could lead to issues with regard to maize cultivation.It is required to de-link corn from other food grains for the production of bio-ethanol, he said."

Leaving behind her two of her four kids back home in Manatu village of Keredari block, Sita is among the thousands of tribal men and women from all over the state who are marching to Ranchi with one demand  implement the Forest Rights Act of 2006.In our village, we survive largely on forest produce and farming done on cleared forest land. But now, the forests have become off limits for us, forcing us to come out on the streets to demand handover of the forests. I have brought two of my younger children with me on the march as they are both too young to spend a week without me. It is a fight that we all are forced to take part, because without our jungles, we dont exist, Sita said.In all, nearly 10,000 tribal community members from over 20 districts have been taking part in the march to demand handover of Individual and Community Forest Rights across the state, covering 12 to 15 kilometres on foot daily. The marchers are sleeping under the open sky, covering 12 to 15 km per day  all for the cause of reasserting their right over the jungles that these communities have been dependent on for centuries. From young men in their prime to nursing mothers to older members, the tribal people are braving the hardships to reach Ranchi and draw attention to their cause.It is overwhelming how every village we reach is coming forward to help us. From providing gas cylinders to cook food to finding open spaces to allow us cook  their support shows how this fight for our forest rights is getting support everywhere. As more people join the march, we are expecting to have at least 20,000 people with us by the time we reach Ranchi next week, said Birendra Kumar, a state-based activist working on forest rights issues.Like Sita, Ajay Kujur of Danto village in Hazaribag, who lives from hand-to-mouth, is finding it extremely difficult to take part in the march, but he had sacrificed taking care of his kids during the period. He has left behind his children with his parents. Speaking to TOI, the 40-year-old Oraon community member said: It is a question of asserting our rights and protecting our way of life. I am not making money for one week but the fact that 200 people from my village alone are with me in the fight is huge. We have brought in five kg of rice and one kilo potato per person to survive through the march."

We are on high alert since an improvised explosive device (IED) was found in a state transport bus at Raigad, MD R S Deol said.Sources said the drivers charge a small fee ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 200 depending on the parcel size. The sender hands over the cash to the driver, who accepts the sealed parcel without checking its contents. The driver informs the receiver about the approximate time he will reach the destination depot. As the bus nears the destination, the driver telephones the receiver and asks him to collect the parcel, said a source from MSRTC. The exchange is done before the driver reports to the depot.Parcels travel regularly from Mumbai to Konkan , including Ratnagiri, Nashik , Pune, Kolhapur, and vice versa, said the source.Another staffer at the Nalasopara ST depot said right from spices to dry fish to sacks of grain, onions, potatoes are parcelled illegally on ST buses. The parcels are placed in the luggage compartments or near the conductors seat. The cash is shared equally by the driver and the conductor."

They are staring at losses for third consecutive year. They were first stung by demonetisation in 2016, the ripple effect of which is still continuing.Punjab has over 96,000 hectare under potatoes and Doaba region remains key producer of potato seeds for supply in the entire country.In 2014, prices were fine, but in 2015 prices fell. We expected to get reasonable profit in 2016, but demonetisation was announced when trading of potatoes was just about to pick up. Major part of the potato trading is in cash and as cash flow dried up, there was no business and potato growers were almost doomed. In 2017 and 2018, the ripple effect of demonetisation continued and prices were again at rock bottom, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.The prices of potatoes touched a new low in December 2018. According to farmers, potatoes were selling at Rs 3 per kilo, while the cost of production ranges from Rs 6 to Rs 8 per kilo.Several growers are even unable to pay interest to the banks. Potato is a heavy investment crop and damage to the crop or low price impacts the growers badly, said Sangha. According to him, the area under potato cultivation was reduced to almost 50% already. Now, looking at the fresh losses, we may either move out or would further reduce the area, he added.Harvesting has started, but exact extent of damage would be known only after the harvesting is complete, said Gupreet Singh of village Ahmadpur Chhanan, district Kapurthala , who has sown potato crop in over 80 acres. He pointed out that the delay in the harvesting would have adverse impact on the next crop  maize or melon. If maize is sown in February, then yield is good. But if there is delay, its yield will come down. There is also no certainty that farmers would get remunerative price for maize too, he said.Harpal Singh of village Seechewal, who tends to over 30 acres, pegged the damage at 25-30% in Malsian and Lohina and nearly 50% in Nakodar and Kala Sanghia. Apart from incurring losses from potatoes, the next crop will also be affected due to the delay in sowing. Our future appears bleak, he said.Confirming that potato growers did suffer huge losses for three consecutive years, Ranjit Singh, deputy director of horticulture department, said that the damage caused by rain would be varying in different areas depending on the quality of the soil and quantum of rain in that area. As there is still uncertainty about the weather in the next one week or so, it is still not sure if farmers would be able to complete harvesting. The delay is also set to have adverse impact on the next crop. The only thing that can mitigate their suffering is better price for the crop, he said."

Therefore, reducing the requirement for land, as compared to a conventional solar photovoltaic layout.With its application in precision agriculture, the brainchild behind this project, Harish Hirani, director, CSIR-CMERI said: Special attention has been given to make it shade-free for achieving higher efficiency as well as to provide a better aesthetic look. The farmers do not need any roof to install solar panels. It is designed keeping in mind the power requirement of irrigation pumps for agricultural purposes.Highlighting the issue of wastage of water and electricity, he added: Farmers always require water and electricity. Most of the times, the government is unable to fulfil this need. Often water and electricity are provided free, so a few people do not care, and utilise water resources recklessly. To avoid the wastage of water, moisture sensors can be installed in the fields to know how much quantity of water is required.Daljit Inderpal Singh, chief engineer of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), said: All farmers are given free electricity and water, and the government pays the tariff to PSPCL on behalf of farmers. This technology is better for consumers who pay us in cash and are charged under meter reading. However, ordinary farmers hesitate as the capital investment is more, but with help of cooperative panels, farmer groups paying more than Rs15,000 per month can get group benefits.Dr Malay Karmakar, senior scientist and Partha Sarathi, scientist from CMERI Department of Energy Research and Technology, said: A sustainable level of groundwater withdrawal with precision agriculture, by scheduling irrigation or using soil moisture sensors provides the potential to enhance irrigation efficiency and reduce groundwater depletion.Baldev Singh, chief agriculture officer, Ludhiana, said: This solar tree and panels are only going to benefit areas which have water levels less than 35 feet, otherwise if the water table is further down, the motor does not work. A few farmers have opted for solar pumps, but in general, motors are the main equipment for pumping of water. However, farmers of Machiwara have also installed solar panels and pumps, and they are of great use. We can promote the solar tree after going through the project outline and calculations. Now, farmers will not think of buying from their own pocket as both the things (water and electricity) are free.One 8kw solar power tree (named as Solar Chakra) and two 3kw solar power trees are installed at the Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery, Ludhiana, and Extension Centre of CMERI at Gill Road. The 8kw installed capacity at CSIR-CMERI centres provide power to operate the agriculture irrigation pump. The electricity generated from the Solar Chakra is currently utilized for running irrigation pumps  which includes a 7.5 horsepower capacity submersible pump, and a 5 horsepower monoblock pump  for irrigating five acres of land. Apart from this, 10-12 hours of power supply to the institute guest house and campus streetlights is provided by the solar energy stored in batteries. This initiative by CMERI helps reduce the carbon footprint and provide a sustainable solution to farmers.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said: PAU is also exploring options. As far as solar power is concerned, everybody is in agreement. But for doing agriculture underneath solar panels, we are exploring it at our research farm in Ludhiana as well as KVK Samrala. We are working on crops like turmeric and sweet potato. We will recommend any technology once we have tested it out for about three years and worked out its cost-benefit ratio. For doing agriculture, the solar tree designed by CMERI looks much better than a usual solar panel.PAU Kisan Union president Manpreet Singh said: Farmers are keen to adopt such technologies, but cost recovery takes a lot of time and farmers do not have any risk-taking capacity. They cannot wait for payback periods. Initially, there were loans from National Horticulture Board for farmers who only grow cash crops. The main issue is that subsidy is less in Punjab as compared to farmers of Haryana and Rajasthan, which is 70%. But this is a welcome step not only due to space utilisation, but also security, and it is hardly a one-time investment.COST & SUBSIDYA 3kw solar tree, in which there are 10 panels, the cost is approximately 3.75 lakh. An 8kw solar tree, in which there are 25 panels, the cost is approximately 8 lakh. However, officials say government is working out a subsidy plan for the solar trees, which will benefit farmers. CSIR-CMERI is utilizing these panels in 5 acres of farmlands and to light up streetlights in the campus."

In a bid to attract promoters for setting up cold storage, the Government had announced several incentives. ""However, all the cold stores are on the verge of closure due to high capital cost and interest burden, huge electricity bill, under-utilisation of capacity and lack of warehouse receipt finance,"" rued Secretary of the Odisha Cold Storage Association Janardhan Sahoo.All the promoters have eroded the entire working capital of their units during the last four years of operation. The units are on the verge of shutting down. We have lost our hope of revival, Sahoo said adding, the farmers who think that the units were going to provide them a safe landing for their produce and provide security to their earnings are also at stress.In order to revive the industry, the owners of the cold stores have been demanding a revival package which includes waiver of entire outstanding of term loans or grant of Rs 2 crore for 5000 tonne capacity cold store, credit linkage at low rate of interest (3 per cent on term loan and working capital), 50 per cent subsidy on electricity bills, subsidy on transportation and storage, and formation of farmers producer groups, seeds production through cold storage promoters and research and development in potato production, engagement of technical and qualified post harvest management staff for monitoring.Each cold storage of 5000 tonne capacity provides direct and indirect employment to 300 individuals and serve 10,000 farmers for storage of their agricultural produce. Neglecting this industry affects the livelihood of at least 10,300 farmer families in the catchment area and an overall impact to around four lakh farmer families throughout the State, Sahoo said.Earlier, the association had given several representations to the State Government but to no avail, he alleged."

The tweets followed a letter Amarinder Singh wrote to Harsimrat Badal on Sunday to get Punjab included in Operation Green Top for the benefit of potato growers.In his tweet, the CM wrote: Unfortunate that despite being Indias 6th largest producer of the crop, Punjab is not in list of selected states for promoting potato production cluster. Have written to Union Minister Harsimrat Badal to rectify that, and help the potato farmers of the state (sic).In response, Harsimrat posted two tweets, Help is irrelevant as you dont want to act. You let potato crop rot despite the Ministry of food processing industry (MOFPI) sanctioning 19 cold chains in Punjab, of which 4 deal in potatoes. The Ladhowal MFP, which you are stalling, can also help potato farmers.You let the potato crop in Punjab rot. You refused to procure it through state agencies. You refused to give freight subsidy to farmers to transport seed potato. Pl dont play politics. Help the potato farmers even now. Give them compensation @ Rs 20k per acre.Potato growers in Punjab are not enthused by the twitter war. Potato grower Mohinder Singh from Kararwala village near Rampura, a big cluster of potato, said, We are suffering loses but no government, earlier the Akali Dal now the Congress, is really concerned. If the governments are really concerned both state and Union governments must help out the growers as earlier the demonetisation crushed us and now the rock bottom prices of potato are putting us down. Another grower Balwinder Singh said if the trend continued, they may move away from potato. In the previous season we could not lift the crop from cold stores due to rock bottom prices and do not want a repeat, he added."
2019-02-26,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/midlife-fitness/cid/1685756,Midlife fitness,"Hot flashes. Raging moods. Theyre symptoms typically associated with midlife hormonal bedlam. But hormones control so much more, from our energy and metabolism to how we build muscle. Hormonal changes are an inevitable part of ageing but these can be influenced by the choices we make. Namely, how we move and what we eat.As we get older, exercise is key, says Dr Richard Quinton, consultant and senior lecturer in endocrinology at Newcastle University, UK. Hormones are important to physical fitness but while they change with age, exercise can have similar benefits to what hormones do and help make up for some of those age-related changes.Tackle insulin resistanceAs people get older, they get more resistant to insulin, says Dr Quintan. This means your cells are less able to use this hormone effectively, leading to high blood sugar, weight gain around the middle, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Exercise, however, can be transformative for insulin resistance, he explains. A study published in the Journal of Obesity and Weight Loss concluded that not only did exercise help insulin resistance, it also influenced the way our muscles use glucose.Can diet help? Research suggests that eating more in the morning, followed by smaller meals as the day progresses, may be more favourable in terms of insulin sensitivity, says Rick Miller, a clinical and sports dietitian. This is especially important as we get older and insulin sensitivity goes down.Plan for perimenopauseIf youre perimenopausal  the decade prior to the menopause your oestrogen levels fluctuate dramatically, says Miller, which is going to affect your weight.As oestrogen levels fall, muscle cells become less sensitive to blood glucose changes, leading to insulin resistance, says Miller. This leads to an increase in appetite, especially for sweet and carbohydrate-rich foods, making the cycle worse. So, what to do about it?Choose smaller portions of starchy and wholegrain carbohydrates such as sweet potatoes, rice and quinoa, healthy fats such as avocados, olives, olive oil or nuts or seeds and a source of protein such as meat, fish, eggs, lentils, beans, pulses or tofu at each meal.Master the menopauseOnce your menopause hits, oestrogen levels fall off a cliff edge. The two most important effects of this are weakening bone mineral density and the loss of the heart-protective effects of oestrogen, explains Greg Whyte, a sports scientist. Exercise can impact both, particularly walking or jogging, with a couple of sessions of circuit training that gets you sweaty with some weights.Indeed, resistance training twice a week has been shown to help strengthen bones, as a 2017 study on 101 women found.Katherine Brooke-Wavell, senior lecturer in human biology at Loughborough University, UK, said the study provided evidence that brief circuit training exercises involving weights or jumping can improve spine and hip bone density in postmenopausal women, so may have a role in prevention of osteoporotic fracture. Racket sports such as tennis are great for bones and the heart, too, Whyte explains.Handling the MANopauseWe talk a lot about the menopause but men go through a similar process, something we term the somatopause, says Whyte. Falling testosterone is important, but another key hormone responsible is the reduction in human growth hormone middle-aged men are experiencing.Human growth hormone (HGH) is important for muscle growth and fat metabolism. Levels of HGH begin to decline in our mid-20s, but according to Whyte, declining levels in middle-aged men has a profound effect. This combination in men over 40 of reduced testosterone and falling HGH affects things like strength and mobility, along with central adiposity. In fact, that belly traditionally attributed to beer is in fact linked with this fall in HGH, Whyte asserts.Men and muscleAs men age they should lift more [weights], Whyte explains. They also need to increase their aerobic activity to help deal with the increase in fat mass and also to protect their hearts, he adds. Ideally, a couple of sessions of heavy lifting, a couple of sessions of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and a couple of sessions of longer duration aerobic activity at lower intensities for 45 minutes or more, like running, cycling or swimming.Food for thoughtAs HGH goes down, muscle tissue starts to develop an anabolic resistance, which means it becomes more resistant to muscle building, says Rick Miller. This means that whatever amount of protein we used to eat when we were younger has less impact on maintaining muscle than before. So eat more protein in midlife, aiming for 1g per 1kg of body weight.The stress factorMiddle age is also the time most of us face a peak in stress hormones, especially cortisol. Increased cortisol levels over a long period can contribute to weight gain, says Dr Quintan. Cortisol starts to get destructive when its levels are chronically raised, due to a grinding, underlying stressor that doesnt seem to have an endpoint. Think a bad marriage or thankless job.Exercise raises cortisol levels in the short-term, bringing them back to normal after recovery. But thats healthy, because it provides your body with a stressor to which its forced to adapt by becoming stronger and fitter.Much of that occurs during sleep and rest, Whyte says. Thats why recovery is essential for over-40s exercisers. The older we get the more seriously we should ensure that were sleeping enough, rehydrating properly, eating enough protein, and taking 48 hours off between bouts of heavy strength training to help muscles recover. You can do active recovery during these times, with low-intensity walks or swims, but you have to let muscles rest and recharge."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Lucknow: Development projects to the tune of over Rs 800 crore are lying in a limbo in Kannauj , the parliamentary constituency of Dimple Yadav, Samajwadi Party MP and wife of partys national president Akhilesh Yadav.As many as three projects, estimated to be worth around Rs 800 crore, are hanging in balance, depriving livelihood and employment to farmers and youth.One of the three projects in Kannauj includes a cow milk processing plant which is ready since November last year, but has not been inaugurated, while a dairy plant in Gorakhpur, completed last week, was inaugurated by prime minister Narendra Modi on February 24.Whether it is the Rs 500-crore first-of-its-kind Perfume Park in Kannauj, the Rs 100-crore cow-based dairy plant or the Rs 200-crore potato-based food processing plant, the projects are either in cold storage or moving at a snails pace even three years after former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav conceptualised and laid foundation stone for the same during his government.Akhilesh Yadav, as chief minister between 2012 and early 2017, had showered a series of development works in Kannauj, a constituency he had once represented as MP.The projects also included solar light-powered villages and agriculture and medical colleges.The proposed Perfume Park, spread in over 100 acres, was to be developed as a perfume industry hub and to take Kannaujs traditional itr (perfume) to global level by inviting best perfume manufacturers from France to set up their units in Kannauj.Akhilesh Yadav, along with UPSIDC officials, had visited France to invite perfume makers. The project would have not only generated employment but also enhanced the income of local farmers, mainly of whom are involved in floriculture, said a UPSIDC official.The Perfume Park project has virtually been abandoned and not taken up since 2016.The project, envisaged in the previous government, was faulty. We are taking a fresh look at it. A new DPR is being prepared, said UPSIDC joint managing director TK Pandey.The cow milk processing plant was started by Akhilesh to process cow milk only at an estimated cost of over Rs 100 crore, with the intention of enhancing cow-rearing and to increase farmers income.While the plant was to be inaugurated in November last year, it was the plant at Gorakhpur that got inaugurated first.The potato-based food processing plant in Kannauj would have benefitted farmers in and around Kannauj, which is known as the potato belt because of the high produce.The glut in potato production often pushes potato growers to go for distress sale and sometimes they are forced to abandon tonnes of potato on the roads as prices go as low as 50 paise a kg in peak season.Akhilesh conceptualised a potato-based food processing plant by UPSIDC in 2016, which would have sourced potato from local growers that would have fetched them impressive price. The project was completed in April, 2016 but has not started production. Rama Kant Pandey, director of Mandi Parishad which now looks after the project, said it would be completed by the end of this year."
2019-02-27,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/house-okays-democrats-bill-blocking-trump-emergency-on-wall/cid/1685833,House okays Democrats' bill blocking Trump emergency on wall,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accompanied by Representative Joaquin Castro (left) and others, speaks about a resolution to block Donald Trump's emergency border security declaration on Capitol Hill on Monday. APDemocrats ignored a veto threat and rammed legislation through the House on Tuesday that would stymie President Donald Trump's bid for billions of extra dollars for his border wall, escalating a clash over whether he was abusing his powers to advance his paramount campaign pledge.The House's 245-182 vote to block Trump's national emergency declaration fell well below the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override his promised veto. Top Republicans worked to keep defections as low as possible  13 backed the Democrats' resolution  underscoring their desire to avoid a tally suggesting that Trump's hold on lawmakers was weakening.The vote also throws the political hot potato to the Republican-run Senate, where there were already enough GOP defections to edge it to the cusp of passage. Vice-President Mike Pence used a lunch with Republican senators at the Capitol to try keeping them aboard, citing a dangerous crisis at the border, but there were no signs he'd succeeded.""I personally couldn't handicap the outcome at this point,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's planning a vote within the next three weeks. He even said Republicans remained uncertain about the legality of Trump's move, telling reporters, ""We're in the process of weighing that.""Senate passage would force Trump's first veto, which the House vote demonstrated that Congress would surely fail to overturn. But the showdown was forcing Republicans to cast uncomfortable votes pitting their support for a President wildly popular with GOP voters against fears that his expansive use of emergency powers would invite future Democratic Presidents to do likewise for their own pet policies.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he can't say whether the Republican-controlled Senate will approve a resolution to block Trump's emergency declaration. APHouse Republicans who joined all voting Democrats to support the Democratic resolution included moderates from competitive districts like Fred Upton of Michigan and libertarian-leaning conservatives like Thomas Massie from Kentucky.The White House wrote to lawmakers formally threatening to veto the legislation. The letter said blocking the emergency declaration would ""undermine the administration's ability to respond effectively to the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border"".Republicans said Democrats were driven by politics and a desire to oppose Trump at every turn, and said Trump had clear authority to declare an emergency to protect the country. They also defended the President's claims of a security crisis along the boundary with Mexico, which he has said is ravaged by drug smugglers, human traffickers and immigrants trying to sneak into the US illegally.""We are at war on the Southern border with the drug cartels,"" said Pete Olson.Trump has asserted that barriers would stop drugs from Mexico from entering the US. In fact, government figures show that 90 per cent of drugs intercepted from Mexico are caught at ports of entry, not remote areas where barriers would be constructed.Democrats said Republicans repeatedly accused former President Barack Obama of flouting the Constitution, which gives Congress control over spending, but are ignoring Trump's effort to do the same.""Is your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to the Constitution?"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Republicans.Trump's push for the wall reflected a continuation of the anti-immigrant views that helped fuel his election, some Democrats said. ""Since when do we call human beings in need a national emergency?"" said Mexican-born Jesus ""Chuy"". ""Is he running out of insults for people like me?""Democrats also said the crisis is a fiction manufactured by Trump to dance around Congress's vote this month to provide less than $1.4 billion for barrier construction. That was well below the $5.7 billion Trump demanded as he futilely forced a record-setting 35-day federal shutdown.""The President does not get to override Congress in a raucous temper tantrum over his inability to broker a deal"" with lawmakers for more money, said Hank Johnson. Joaquin Castro, sponsor of the one-sentence measure blocking the declaration, called Trump's move ""constitutional vandalism"".Trump used a 1976 law to declare a national emergency and ordered the shift of $3.6 billion from military construction projects to wall building. Citing other powers, he intends to shift another $3.1 billion from the defence department anti-drug efforts and a fund that collects seized assets.The money would be used to build steel barriers up to 30 feet tall and other barriers and for ""law enforcement efforts,"" said a White House statement.In the Senate, three Republicans have said they will back Democrats' drive to block the emergency declaration: Maine's Susan Collins, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and North Carolina's Thom Tillis. One more GOP defection would provide enough votes to approve the Democratic measure, assuming all Democrats and their independent allies back it.Republicans said senators asked Pence numerous questions about which projects Trump would divert to pay for the wall, with Senator Richard Shelby, saying the discussion was ""hearty.""Shelby, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, which controls spending, said his panel would quickly ""backfill"" money for military construction with other funds he did not identify. ""That issue won't stay alive long,"" Shelby told reporters.Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chief GOP vote counter, said there may be GOP attempts to amend the House measure, saying Republicans ""think they have amendments that would improve it"".That suggests that McConnell may try finding a way to add language that could sink the Democratic resolution or, perhaps, make it more palatable for Republicans. The law requires the Senate to vote on a measure within 18 days of receiving it from the House.Though presidents have declared 58 emergencies under the law, this is the first aimed at acquiring money for an item Congress has explicitly refused to finance, according to Elizabeth Goitein, co-director for national security at New York University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice. This is also the first time Congress has cast votes on whether to annul an emergency declaration, she said.Even with Democrats' effort near-certain to ultimately fail, several lawsuits have been filed aimed at blocking the money, including by Democratic state attorneys general, progressive and environmental groups. Those suits at the very least are likely to delay access to those funds for months or years."

Due to drop in price, most of the farmers started cultivating alternative vegetables and other crops leading to drop in cultivation area of cabbage this year.Harvesting of cabbage had begun and at present, cabbage was being purchased by the traders at a reasonable price, said S.

(Shutterstock)The plight of farmers is unlikely to change despite the income support scheme unveiled with much fanfare by the Narendra Modi-government in the interim budget.Prices of potato and turmeric have tumbled because of over-production this year, while extended winter rain has ruined the corn crop which could result in imports of up to 1 million tonnes.Deflationary trend in food prices along with over-production is leading to huge price swings and consequently distress for Indias farming community, said Biswajit Dhar of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University.In value terms, the farm sector has grown just 1.2 per cent in April-December 2018 against a growth of 5 per cent last year despite a good crop year.Prices of potatoes have tumbled 25-30 per cent to Rs 700-750 a tonne in Uttar Pradesh, which is set to produce a bumper crop of 145 lakh tonnes. In Bengal, the rates have come down 40-50 per cent to Rs 500-550 per tonne despite intervention by the state government. Bengal is set to produce about 120 lakh tonnes of potato, about 20 per cent more than last year. While prices have fallen to Rs 700-750 a tonne in Uttar Pradesh, they have fallen to Rs 500-550 in Bengal.Turmeric prices in south India have similarly fallen 25 per cent, leading to distress in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. On the other hand, corn prices have jumped 30 per cent, mainly because of the crops being damaged by armyworm insects that had devastated Africa two years ago.Though the government is yet to allow import, state-run MMTC has issued a circular seeking to learn from starch manufacturers and animal feed producers the quantity of corn they need this year.Analysts said this was the first step to calculate whether imports would be allowed. India could allow corn imports of 4 lakh tonnes to 1 million tonnes.The government in the interim budget had announced a Rs 6,000-a-year basic income support to poor farmers owning up to 5 acres. However, the scheme has been criticised as being too little, too late, besides throwing up questions over identifying the beneficiaries and the predicament of landless farm workers and tenant farmers.The scheme promises just Rs 16.43 a day of income to a farmer family or about Rs 4 per head, taking an average family of four. It is unlikely to yield much results besides good optics, said Dhar.The scheme comes on the back of a summer of discontent over the last two years with leaders such as Rakesh Tikait and Raju Shetty of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan leading farmers into demanding loan waivers and the implementation of the Swaminathan formula for crop pricing.The movements resulted in a series of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh but could not bring the government to address the basic problem of unremunerative prices and lack of storage facilities which forced crop sales at distress rates.Farmers have been witnessing intense rural distress after prices collapsed in the wake of money being sucked out of the rural economy when the government demonetised around 86 per cent of the currency by value in November 2016.Loan waivers did not help as these were meant for those who had taken loans from banks, mostly large farmers.According to NSSO data released in 2016, while 60 per cent of the total farm loans were taken from banks and state agencies, 40 per cent were from unregulated lenders such as money lenders and grain buyers."
2019-03-04,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/loss-spurs-government-to-focus-on-insurance/cid/1686146,Loss spurs government to focus on insurance,"The potato fields were damaged by rain in the last days of February. (Shutterstock)The Mamata Banerjee government has shifted its focus from direct procurement of potato from farmers to compensation payment as the production could be hit hard in many south Bengal districts after rain damaged the crop in the midst of harvest.We are yet to ascertain the exact loss as potato grows beneath the ground. Until the harvesting is complete, the total damage cannot be calculated. But we are trying to ensure that all the 5 lakh potato farmers who have insured their crops submit claims by Monday, said a senior government official.The comment makes it clear that the government is not in a hurry to start procurement of potatoes. A notification was issued on February 28, announcing that the government would buy 10 lakh tonnes of potato at Rs 5.50 a kg from farmers.The decision to procure potato was taken after farmers were forced to sell the crop at Rs 3 a kg following a bumper production. But it appears that the damage to the crop is serious as price of the spud has shot up following the rain, which recorded between 75mm and 95mm in various districts in three days. Farmers in many areas are selling their produce at Rs 6 a kg. So, its important to ensure compensation for them right at this moment, said another official.The potato fields were damaged by rain in the last days of February.According to officials, the farmers, who had insured their produce, need to submit claims within 72 hours after the rainfall stopped.As per that calculation, farmers need to submit claims by Sunday But we are trying to extend the deadline till Monday by holding discussions with three insurance companies, which have insured the crop in Bengal this year, a senior Nabanna official said on Saturday.Although details of the crop loss are yet to be ascertained, primary reports sent to the agriculture department hinted more than 1 lakh hectares of potato in five south Bengal districts  Bankura, East Burdwan, Birbhum, East and West Midnapore  have been affected.As we are yet to receive a report from Hooghly, known as a major potato producing district, we apprehend the loss could go up to about 1.5 lakh hectares, said an agriculture department official.Sources said the total loss of production could be around 15 lakh tonnes, which could give the state a relief as it was worried over surplus production this year.The state had initially estimated that the potato production could reach 120 lakh tonnes against an averageannual yield of 100 lakh tonnes.The surplus production was forcing farmers to go for distress sale pushing the state to prepare a procurement plan The untimely rain has made the situation easy for the government as the farmers will now be able to get proper price for their produce, an official said.Realising that it would hardly need to intervene in the market following the untimely rain, the state government has put all its efforts to ensure that all farmers who insured crop get compensation.We will keep our shops open for the farmers But the early signs hint that farmers will get better price for their produce in the market, said an official."

But, according to mental health experts, this is a real problem among those who exercise regularly.Are you one among those who gets restless if you miss your session in the gym, find your mood linked to whether you have exercised or put yourself through strenuous physical activity for several hours at a stretch? Mental health experts point out that you could be a risk of exercise addiction.A study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) pointed that 5.8% of the 1,743 individuals who were exercising regularly were found to fall under the risk category of exercise addiction. All the people surveyed were those residing in East Bengaluru localities.While 2,755 people were surveyed to explore the pattern of exercise behaviour in the Indian context, only 1,743 participants reported to exercising regularly. Unmarried people were at a higher risk. The finding has been accepted by an Indian peer-reviewed journal and will be published soon.One of the authors, Manoj Kumar Sharma, professor of clinical psychology who heads the Service for Healthy Use of Technology (SHUT) at the NIMHANS said some of the characteristics of addiction include a preoccupation with exercising and inability to control the urge to exercise leading to increased time spent on physical activity.Its common for addicts or those susceptible to it to plan their schedules around exercise sessions leading to neglect of other day-to-day activities.The survey also found that age, number of members in the family, years of marriage and psychiatric distress have a negative correlation with exercise addiction. Around 63% of all the 1,743 participants who exercised regularly showed some of the symptoms. Not all, however, were at risk. The mean age of the sample was 36.48 years.Researchers pointed out that individuals at risk were found to be experiencing craving for exercise, loss of control, compulsion to indulge in exercise, reduction in other activities and consequences in relation to exercise. It was also found that exercise deprivation had an effect on sleep patterns. People were found to be irritable and prone to negative mood states when denied the opportunity to exercise. Most people may not be aware of the problem: only 0.01% of the sample felt the need to change their exercise patterns.The authors cautioned that this should not be used as an excuse to not exercise. While physical activity is important for a persons well-being, people should be conscious of what they are doing and make sure that other activities do not take a back seat, said Dr. Sharma."

It is necessary to develop drought-resistant varieties of food crops.Mr. Mohapatra said that the farmers should also be trained in climate-resilient farming practices. Stressing on the need to adopt shrewd water management practices in cultivation of paddy, he said that, instead of traditional water-intensive method of transplantation of the saplings by flooding the fields, the farmers should be motivated to opt for Direct Seeded Rice or System of Rice Intensification methods that are less water-intensive. Similar modifications should be adopted in cultivation of other crops also to face the challenges posed by climate change, he said.Appealing to the agriculture graduates to become job-providers instead of job-seekers, he said that agriculture graduates with entrepreneur skills can venture into the agro-processing sector. Sericulture, mushroom cultivation, floriculture, and apiculture activities are fetching lucrative income for farmers. Barring sugarcane and rice, the potential for agro-based industries in India has not been fully realised due to lack of infrastructure. Tuber crops such as yams, sweet potato, and tapioca can be used as source of nutrients not only for human consumption, but also for animal husbandry sector, he added.Stressing on the need to develop an inter-disciplinary approach towards agriculture, he said that innovations in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Data Analytics should be used to enhance agriculture productivity.Shivashankara Reddy N.H., Minister for Agriculture, and M.K. Naik, Vice-Chancellor of UAHS, Shivamogga, were present."

This is what passes for a scandal in Canada.U.S. President Donald Trump has been engulfed in allegations involving possible collusion with Russia and secret payments to buy the silence of a porn star. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a controversy that seems trivial by comparison, but it could topple him in elections later this year.Two high-profile women ministers in Trudeau's Cabinet, including Canada's first indigenous justice minister, resigned in protest, and his top aide and best friend quit too.The former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and senior members of his government pressured her in a case involving a major Canadian engineering company accused of corruption related to its business dealings in Libya. Trudeau reportedly leaned on the attorney general to instruct prosecutors to reach the equivalent of plea deal, which would avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, because he felt that jobs were at stake.In this Feb. 27, 2019, file photo, Jody Wilson-Raybould speaks with the media after appearing in front of the Justice committee in Ottawa, Ontario. Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, says Trudeau and senior members of his government inappropriately pressured her in a case involving a major Canadian engineering company accused of corruption related to its business dealings in Libya. (Photo | AP)""People south of the border would be astonished to think that this is the type of scandal that they have in Canada,"" said Eddie Goldenberg, a former adviser to former Prime Minister Jean Chretien.Many countries would be jealous of a scandal that went no further than a prime minster asking another minister to do something she is legally entitled to do, Goldenberg said.""I just don't really see it as a scandal,"" he said. ""There is a political correctness here. Nobody wants to go after an indigenous woman minister. It's become politically incorrect to question the former minister.""Trudeau has said he asked Wilson-Raybould to revisit her decision not to instruct prosecutors and said she agreed to consider that. He denied applying any inappropriate pressure, saying he and his officials were only pointing out that prosecution could endanger thousands of jobs.SNC-Lavalin has pleaded not guilty to fraud and corruption charges related to allegations it paid about $35 million (CA$47 million) in bribes to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011.""It's a pseudo-scandal. It's crap. What the hell? You are doing business in Libya and you are not bribing?"" said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. ""It does suggest to me that the director of public prosecutions ... is also nuts. And so is Wilson-Raybould. These people are delusional.""Wilson-Raybould was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister in January as part of a Cabinet shuffle by Trudeau. She has testified that she believes she lost the justice job because she did not give in to ""sustained"" pressure to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin.That solution would have avoided a potential criminal conviction that would bar the company from receiving any federal government business for a decade. The company is a major employer in Quebec, Trudeau's home province. It has about 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.ALSO READ | Battling political crisis, Justin Trudeau denies wrongdoingThe company publicly led the lobbying charge for a law that allows for deferred prosecution agreements as a way to resolve the criminal charges it faces. The new attorney general has not ruled out approving a settlement.Wilson-Raybould has said herself that the pressure from Trudeau and others was not illegal and that she was not explicitly instructed to do a remediation agreement.Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary and best friend who resigned, said nothing inappropriate was alleged until after Wilson-Raybould left the Cabinet, suggesting she felt sour grapes about losing her dream job.Opposition Conservative Andrew Scheer leader has demanded that Trudeau resign, saying he tried to interfere in a criminal prosecution. Canadian media have covered the story as intensely as American networks have covered Trump, noted Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto.""Trudeau would not be able to get away with what Trump does because the political cultures and the state of political polarization of the two countries are still quite different,"" Wiseman said.The differences among Canadian media outlets, for example, are ""relatively narrow compared to the chasms between Fox and MSNBC or CNN. The American media are reporting on two different worlds. The Canadian media are reporting on the same Wilson-Raybould-Trudeau story,"" Wiseman added.Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trudeau has framed himself differently than Trump. Trump said sympathetic things about Russia during the campaign and was elected despite that and other controversies, giving him ""the sense that he can do anything and his base will still follow him.""Trudeau, meanwhile, promised transparency while describing himself as a feminist who was also determined to right the wrongs against Canada's indigenous people. Women make up half of his cabinet.""He depicted himself as a feminist, as someone who believes in indigenous reconciliation, and then you have two of his top female Cabinet ministers resign, and they are depicting him in a very different light,"" Beland said.Trudeau said he tried to foster an environment where his lawmakers can come to him with concerns, but one of his female Liberal party colleagues, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, took issue with that, tweeting, ""I did come to you recently. Twice. Remember your reactions?""""When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised,"" she also tweeted.Caesar-Chavannes, who is not running for re-election, has issued messages of support for Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, a respected Cabinet minister who said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair.""It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,"" Philpott wrote in the resignation letter to Trudeau.Other Liberal lawmakers have expressed confidence in Trudeau. The federal election is in October.Antonia Maioni, McGill University's dean of arts, said citizens of every democracy will look at the Trump scandals and say everything else is small potatoes.But, she added, ""I'm not sure Trump is a good reference point here. Leaders fall in parliamentary systems for many other reasons beyond personal scandal."""

He alleged that the drug was selling like potatoes in a vegetable market.AdvertisingBains, who is MLA from Atam Nagar of Ludhiana, went live on his Facebook around 9 am Monday. Bains purportedly showed live on his Facebook page how a friend of his was able to buy two packets of drug, for Rs 300 each, from an alleged chitta mandi (drug market) near Cheema Chowk. Then he again sent the person to buy two more packets, which he again claimed that he was able to buy without any hindrance.Then he went to office of Ludhiana police commissioner where he submitted three packets of drug with a written complaint and kept one for self saying that he himself will get it tested to know purity of the drug.Ludhiana Police Commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill said that samples of chitta submitted by Bains will be sent for forensic testing. We dont know yet what is the actual composition of that powder. We will get forensic testing done and take action accordingly.

When he returned, I sent him again to buy two more and even then he was able to get them without any hindrance. The entire world was watching it live on my page, but police was nowhere to be seen even when my friend went for second time, he told The Indian Express.Bains alleged that SAD and Congress will be using drugs to get votes in Lok Sabha polls and thus he will be filing a written complaint with Election Commission, demanding immediate transfer of Ludhiana Police Commissioner and dismissal of SHO in whose area his friend purchased the drug.If this is how drugs can be openly sold and bought in Ludhiana city, then it wont be a surprise if they are used in entire Punjab to get votes by these political parties, he said.Bains also displayed documents regarding information about 677 drug peddlers which he claimed that he had submitted to Special Task Force (STF) and CMs office but action wasnt taken against a single one. We received these 677 complaints giving complete information about drug peddlers from peopleEntire information was compiled and submitted to STF and CM office. Action has not been taken against a single one and then Captain claims he has broken back of drug trade, said Bains."
2019-03-12,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/post-rain-vegetable-prices-go-north-in-calcutta/cid/1686658,"Post-rain, vegetable prices go north in Calcutta","Vegetables at the Gariahat market in Calcutta. Picture by Bishwarup DuttaPrices of vegetables have gone through the roof following the unseasonal rain in the last week of February.Large swathes of low-lying cultivatable land in North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Nadia and East Midnapore remained inundated for days following the downpour, which continued in phases for four days, striking a blow to the farmers who were about to reap their produce.A section of farmers said unlike paddy, most vegetable-bearing plants would turn grey and begin to wilt if water accumulated at the base.The period between end-February and early-March is the harvesting season for several vegetables, such as green chilly, ladies finger and potato.Among the worst-hit are ladies fingers, which sold at Rs 100-120 a kg across the city on Monday. Vegetable sellers said ladies fingers would usually sell at Rs 25-30 a kg around this time of the year.Bottle gourds, which would sell at Rs 10-15 a piece during this time, sold for Rs 30 at Lake Market and Gariahat on Monday. The price of pointed gourds shot up from Rs 40 to Rs 100 a kg at some of the markets.Traders and farmers blamed the rise in vegetable prices on the rain between February 25 and 28.According to the weather department, areas in some of the south Bengal districts that grow vegetables received more than 100 mm of rainfall during the period.Calcutta on those days received 159.1mm of rain.The TelegraphI went to Koley Market in Sealdah to buy vegetables. I spent a little over Rs 8,000 on my usual stock, which usually costs around Rs 4,000, said Madan Mohan Ghosh, a retailer at the Gariahat market.Around 60 per cent of the ladies fingers sold in Calcutta is sourced from the Diamond Harbour sub-division in South 24-Parganas.Some of the pockets in the sub-division that grow the vegetable are Mathurapur, Mandirbazar and Kulpi.Ladies fingers, farmers said, are sensitive and need to be reaped twice a day. Else, they loose tenderness.You can understand what happens if water collects at the base of the plants, said Bimal Kumar Das, a farmer in Mathurapur.The end-February rain also resulted in a sudden fall in temperature, which prolonged the wintry spell to the delight of most people but delayed the harvest of pointed gourds, especially in parts of the Bongaon sub-division in North 24-Parganas.The yield of pointed gourds is directly proportional to heat. The warmer, the better, said Kamal Dey, a trader at Koley Market, a wholesale hub. Just when the wholesale markets were expecting a bumper harvest of pointed gourds, the fall in temperature delayed the yield by several weeks. As a result, the price shot up.Farmers and agro-producers said the prices of some vegetables, including green chillies and onions, might increase in the next few weeks. The green chilly plants in Kakdwip (South 24-Parganas), Basirhat (North 24-Parganas) and parts of Hooghly district lost their flowers in the rain.Bengal has had a huge harvest of onions  around 9 lakh metric tonnes  this time and prices would have dropped. But the dampness caused by the rain came in the way of preserving some of the produce.The rain in the last week of February and a sudden change in weather have taken a toll on the prices, said Pradip Majumder, advisor to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on agriculture and agro-produce. Hopefully, things will look up in the next few weeks."

It's the Dahi Chowki market of Unnao, an outlet for locally grown vegetables. However, it turns into an impromptu TV studio-like debate forum, when sellers find a reporter in their midst. Just as it happens in studios, 'panelists' here also are sharply divided in their allegiances.So, in Dahi Chowki, it's the BJP vs the Samajwadi Party. And what about the Congress which sent Anu Tandon to the Lok Sabha from Unnao in 2009 before the Modi wave swept everything away? Is Priyanka Gandhi a 'game-changer'?Tomato grower Sunder Lal is not impressed by the presence of Priyanka Gandhi at the helm of Congress affairs in UP. What will she do? She is Indira Gandhis granddaughter, not Indira Gandhi. We have seen the 10-year rule of Manmohan Singh. He did nothing. Here no one -- neither Priyanka Vadra nor Rahul Gandhi -- will be able cast a spell, he says in a definitive tone.FOLLOW OUR ELECTION COVERAGE HEREThe fanfare with which the Gandhi scion was launched in Lucknow last month finds little traction here. While Sunder Lal says he would vote for a strong nation, his fellow trader Rajendra Yadav vouches for the development work carried out by Akhilesh Yadav during the SP rule in the state.In Shuklaganj, about 20 km away, Raju Mishra, a trader, seconds Sunder Lal. ""Whatever presence the Congress has here is because of its candidate Annu Tandon, who has maintained her links with the constituency in the past five years,"" says Mishra who owns a showroom of readymade garments. He claims nothing will change in the Congress. Here Priyanka Gandhi will have no impact in the current election, claims Mishra.A first-time voter, Anukriti Singh seems to be smitten by Priyankas personality but doubts her effectiveness this time. Few people are familiar with her here. Like Rahul Gandhi, she too is likely to say that the PM is a thief. She will not have any impact, says Anukriti, a second-year student pursuing BA in a local college.If the Congress has pinned its hopes on the Priyanka factor to lift its fortunes in UP, no impact is visible yet. Similar trends can be seen in neighbouring Kanpur, which has a sizeable number of Congress voters and elected the party candidate in 2004 and 2009. Sri Prakash Jaiswal, a former minister in the Manmohan Singh government, had finished runner-up during the sweeping Modi wave in 2014.In the era of social media, when WhatsApp and Facebook shape public opinion, it is difficult to find a neutral person who can talk without showing his political leanings. Kanpur's Atul Seth, the vice-president of the Provincial Industrial Association, UP, is one who speaks quite objectively. Despite being critical of the Congress and its dynastic politics, he has genuine concern for the Grand Old Party.He accuses Congressmen of lacking guts to stand against a family which is no more relevant to run the party. Congress is headed for doom under the present leadership. This dynastic streak has to stop if the party has to be revived. Priyanka is a better politician than her brother but how far she will be able to assert herself under his leadership is debatable, says Seth, ruing the fact that the Congress is imposing Gandhi scions on the nation despite having other deserving leaders.Although few doubt her potential as a future leader, if she takes a full-fledged plunge and doesn't limit herself to the family bastion, there are doubts galore about Priyanka working any magic in these elections.Even a traditional Congress supporter like Saud Ahmad, a leather exporter, feels that Priyankas appointment is too late. She has not been there on the ground even after being appointed on January 23. Congress could have capitalise on the euphoria created subsequent to her appointment and launch. But it is too late and that impact has vanished in the post-Pulwama airstrike narrative now, adds Ahmad.However, Amarjeet Singh Manu, manager of the famous Gurdwarabhai Bannu Sahib in Kanpur, feels the people's pulse favours the Congress after Priyanka Gandhi was given charge of the party in UP. At least she will speak the truth unlike PM Modi who is nothing but a jumlebaaj, says Manu, believing that Priyankas appointment will win Muslim support back for the Congress in the elections.Anoop Kumar Gupta, an advocate and member of the Kanpur bar association, sounds hopeful that Priyanka Gandhi will be able to move the Congress in a positive direction but certainly not now. In this election, people will vote on the basis of the candidate. For Priyanka to be effective, the Congress will have to change the president and hand the baton over to her, claims Gupta.Dr Vivek Dwivedi, principal, Bramhanand Degree College, affiliated to Kanpur University, feels that Priyanka Gandhis impact may give a boost of 1-2 per cent to the vote share of the Congress in UP but nothing more. If they think that by pitching Priyanka Gandhi in the fray now, they can compete with Modi, they will be proved wrong, says the academic.Most also point out that she has been missing in action for a whole month after the Lucknow roadshow.Vishal Agarwal, a prominent jeweller of the city, feels the Congress as an organisation is too weak. They dont have dedicated cadre in booths. The first task Priyanka Gandhi has in hand is to put the house in order. She needs to re-organise the party and re-orient the party worker, which is not possible now with elections knocking at the door, he says."

The order had been issued on February 27.After hearing the case in detail, Justice Debangshu Basak said: It seems the state government has taken the decision for the benefit of potato farmers. At the same time, the government has taken the decision in the interest of cold storage owners too. So, it is not necessary to interfere in the states decision.Moving the petition on behalf of the cold storage co-owner, senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya told the court: On February 27, my client received a notice from the state agricultural marketing department directing him to purchase Jyoti variety of potato of the size between 55mm and 100mm in diameter directly from farmers at the rate of Rs 550 per quintal.After hearing the plea, the judge had raised a question whether the state has the legal authority to force the cold storage owners to buy potato directly from farmers.The judge had asked the state additional advocate general, Abhrotosh Majumdar: Which law empowers the state government to issue such a notice? How can the government dictate cold storage owners to buy potato from farmers.Majumdar had prayed for time for giving reply to the judges queries.On Tuesday, when the matter came up for hearing again, Majumdar informed the court that the government, in the same order, had announced that the cold storage owners would get loan for purchasing potato from the farmers.The government had also announced a package of compensation for the cold storage owners if they suffer loss due to the governments directive, Majumdar told the court.After hearing Majumdar, the judge decided not to interfere in the governments decision."

His men had picked up the animal from the road after the Uttar Pradesh government asked the police to set an example by adopting stray cattle - the latest twist in Indias age-old tension between Hindus, who worship cows, and Muslims, who eat beef. Reports of clashes between the two groups have surged after a clampdown on cattle trading and illegal abattoirs prompted dairy farmers to abandon unwanted livestock on the streets. No one cared about stray cows before, said Khan, wearing his service revolver and police radio. Now people call us to help if a cow needs to be protected.The tightening of rules by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, backed by Hindu nationalists, has created a media storm in the country just as politicians begin campaigning for a general election. The rising population of strays has been blamed for trampling crops, causing road accidents and setting off a spate of extra-judicial killings.The issue has polarized a country of 1.3 billion people that is almost 80 percent Hindu and also home to the worlds third-largest Muslim population. Cow vigilantes have killed at least 44 people in the past three years, according to Human Rights Watch. While cow slaughtering is banned in most states, including Uttar Pradesh, previous administrations never strictly enforced the laws.The difficulty of selling cows for slaughter has angered some dairy farmers who relied on the sales for extra income and disrupted the countrys leather and meat industries. Damage to fields by wandering cattle has also hurt crop farmers, a key voting bloc for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party, which faces a general election between April 11 and May 19.So-called Gau Rakshaks, or cow protectors, have taken to the Internet to ridicule those in the cattle trade and convince people to look after cows.Its already creating mistrust in the country, said Himanshu, who goes by one name and teaches economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. He said unproductive cattle have to be disposed of as they are not giving farmers any return, but cow shelters are not enough as the number of stray animals will keep increasing. The government should find a long-term solution.Many of the headlines are from the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, ruled by Modis BJP, where about 40 million Muslims make up almost a fifth of the population. Police in the state, home to the Taj Mahal, registered a case against 24 people for evicting students and teachers from a primary school so they could use the building to house stray cattle, according to a report in the Indian Express in January.Modi has his electoral district in Uttar Pradesh, which sends more lawmakers to parliament than any other state and is likely to be a key battleground in the election. The region is ruled by the BJPs saffron-clad Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath and was the scene of one of Indias worst religious clashes when Hindu mobs razed a 16th-century mosque in 1992 in Ayodhya, triggering deadly riots that killed at least 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.Modi has to find a balance between appeasing hard-line Hindu supporters and the nations more than 260 million farmers who are already upset about falling commodity prices and lower wages. The prime minister has promised to pay 6,000 rupees ($86) a year to farmers who have less than 2 hectares of land, a $10.6 billion gift that will widen the fiscal deficit.The cow issue will dethrone the current government, said Jagvir Singh, 50, a wheat and millet farmer in Uttar Pradesh. Stray cows are everywhere. They have made our life hell.One in five of the worlds cattle and buffalo are reared in India and the nation is the worlds second-largest beef exporter, after Brazil. Exports dropped 20 percent to 1.67 million tons in 2018 from the record shipments of 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The South Asian nation also produces 2.5 billion square feet of leather a year, 13 percent of global output, much of it for a large domestic footwear and garment industry.Dairy cows live for 12 to 15 years, but typically produce milk only for about 7 years, when they are bearing calves. Millions of cows become unproductive each year, and many, along with unwanted male calves, are simply abandoned. According to the latest livestock census, there were some 5.3 million stray cattle in 2012 in India.To stop strays entering fields, some farmers have erected fencing or hired guards to shoo the animals away, but for many the cost is prohibitive. Fencing costs about 50,000 rupees an acre, while guards charge 500 rupees a day.In a village about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Khans police station, 50-year old Ashok Kumar is waving a stick to drive a herd of stray cattle out of his potato field. The animals depart and cross the road into the field of Sunahari Lal, an older farmer, whose crops are trampled. Its a common sight now in agricultural communities in India, a country ranked 103rd out of 119 in the Global Hunger Index.The government has made our life miserable, said Kumar, who also grows wheat. If we beat cows for destroying crops, we might go to jail and wont get bail for months. Its the people abandoning the cows who should be behind bars.But cows are deeply embedded in Hindu mythology. Kamadhenu, the mother of all cows, emerged from the churning of the oceans after a battle between gods and demons, fulfilling the needs and ambitions of all and providing milk for food used in religious rituals. Paintings of Lord Krishna with cows are common in Hindu households.Cow is our mother, Modi said in February in a holy town of Vrindavan where Lord Krishna is believed to have spent his childhood. No one in India can forget the debt of cows milk.Few practical solutions have emerged. The Madhya Pradesh government said it plans to acquire 6,000 acres of land to build shelters, according to the Hindustan Times. But this would only accommodate about 100,000 animals. In February, the federal budget allocated 7.5 billion rupees for a cow program.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath proposed using taxpayers money to fund shelters. Officials plan to tag strays with barcodes to build a database and are trying artificial insemination technology to ensure only female calves are born.There should be enough shelters to protect cows, but right now they are being built only on paper, said Ramvir Singh Ponia, a 50-year old farmer from Sujat Nagar who grows mainly wheat and potatoes on his 12-acre farm. The problem is people quietly abandon their unproductive cows in the night.Mostly, the country is relying on volunteers like Akhil Manglik, who runs a bovine shelter for some 350 injured animals. This place is like a hospital for cows, he said. Once a cow enters here, it never leaves.It costs about 60 rupees a day to keep a cow in India, translating to about $1.6 billion to accommodate all the nations strays, not counting the cost of lost agricultural land. That leaves Modi with a dilemma summed up by farmer Trimohan Singh in Uttar Pradesh. A home without a cow is a devils place, he said. But the main problem in our lives now is cows. They are destroying our crops and we cant do anything about it."
2019-03-16,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/screen-shots/article26550953.ece,Screen-shots,"The case for DeliteMost single-screen theatres in Delhi that boast a rich past dont have a functional present. Delite is different. It's thriving despite the multiplex onslaught, even as most of its competitors in the vicinity ( Golcha, Ritz, Minerva) have shut shop. And, it's drawing 'houseful' crowds.Situated at the cusp of Old and New Delhi, Delite provides the best of both worlds. You can watch the best of Hindi cinema without burning a hole in your pocket. Of course, it doesnt have the frills that many theatres of Central and South Delhi provide, but it doesnt compromise on the quality of the cinema-viewing experience. The screen provides a vivid image and the sound is ambient. There are no recliners but the joy of the communal experience is refreshing. Yes, the whistles, sharp comments on performance still exist in this part of the city. You invariably know the box-office result much before the critics put their stars down on a film.The place has history. It was the destination of politicians and film stars. The corridor leading to the exit gate is lined with photographs of Nargis, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Jawaharlal Nehru who were regular patrons of the theatre. Even now, filmmakers and actors turn up to check the pulse of the mass. The staff is cordial and unobtrusive, and you'll often find the manager watching the film with the audience. If you nudge him, he'll share a piece of nostalgia or nuance on the film business that you will never find in glossy halls.The wooden staircase leads to a cosy eating area where again the timber panels create an old-world charm. Like the theatre, it's clean, not sanitised. It provides ample space to have an adda, where you could dissect the film over a cup of masala chai. Here, the vada and burger don't come out of a machine. In multiplexes, there are plenty of options on the menu but I often fail to find tasty food, guilty pleasures that go perfectly with a movie, like the jumbo samosa, filled with potatoes and dollops of paneer and peas. A film might fail you, but a jumbo samosa never will.Anuj Kumar heads to the nearest cinema hall when life gets melodramaticThe case for PVR PlazaThe detractors have been keen to run it down. The fans will have none of it. Early in this millennium, when Plaza downed its shutters after the record-breaking run of Anil Sharma's Gadar , the naysayers assumed it was time to write its epitaph. The cinema though had downed its shutters to undertake major renovation work.Gone was the single screen with a big hall. Instead, there arrived a 300-seater that played the best of Bollywood to the best of viewers. No cat calls, no loud whistles, no buzzing mobile phones. No stinking toilets. Plaza cared for the movies it showed; its viewers cared to watch the film here. After all, the cinema comes with history resting on its walls.Established in 1933, it had been designed by Robert Tor Russell with a balcony on the first floor and columns on the ground floor. Sholay , hailed as the greatest spectacle on earth also opened here and Plaza was the only cinema to have a 70 mm print on the films release. When it reopened as PVR Plaza in 2004, it more than just survived. It gave us the multiplex experience in the heart of the city.You didnt need to go to a mall to blend shopping with the movies. You could shop to your hearts content in Connaught Place and then walk down to Plaza to catch up with the latest Bollywood or Hollywood release. With the best projection technology and sound, where you could listen to the raindrops even as dinosaurs scowl in front, it has opened a new cinematic experience. The cushy red seats and on-seat food service make it seamless and festive without being in your face.Unlike Delite, where you'll just see pictures of the movie stars, here, your favourite actor may actually put in an appearance at the regal corner of the hall. Plus, your sushi comes to your seat.Ziya Us Salam likes his movies stirred (not shaken) with coffee and nostalgia, definitely not with oversized samosasWhere we pit iconic Delhi things against each other"

Congress is free to field its candidates in all 80 LS seats in UP. The SP-BSP alliance is capable of taking on the BJP, Mayawati had tweeted.The former UP chief minister made it clear that the SP-BSP combine had no poll understanding with the Congress anywhere in the country. Our supporters should not fall for doubts being created by the Congress, she said.The Congress had on Sunday announced that it will not field candidates in constituencies of Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati and their close relatives and aides, in response to the SP and BSP not fielding candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli.The Congress offer came a day ahead of Priyanka Gandhis three-day tour of UP, which started from Prayagraj on Monday. The UP east in charge for Congress took a steamer ride from Prayagraj to Prime Minister Narendra Modis constituency Varanasi as part of her campaign tour.The 140km ride lasted for about three days before culminating at a Holi Milan function in Varanasi.Gandhi said she was here to make false promises. We do what we promise like we waived off loan of farmers in all the states we formed our government recently. I have come here to listen to the problems of the people.In her address at Dumduma Ghat, Priyanka promised to have a separate ministry for fishermen. After listening to your problems, I ensure you that once our government comes to power we will have a separate ministry for Fishermen of the country for their overall development, she said.On Sunday, Priyanka wrote in an open letter that as a soldier of the Congress, it is my responsibility is to join hands with you for changing the current politics of Uttar Pradesh. The youth, farmers and working class are facing problems and we want to share their pain.During her day-long stay at Lucknow, Priyanka met delegations of potato farmers, Urdu teachers, Anganwadi workers and employee unions who have been strongly demanding the old pension scheme for government employees."

I could have also sat at home. I sat home for many years ...Why have I come out today? I came out because the country is in danger; our Constitution is under threat. Recognise this and wake up to it, Ms. Vadra told a gathering during a halt at Sirsa ghat on her 100-km journey from Prayagraj to Varanasi, via Bhadohi.To VaranasiAfter an overnight halt in Sitamarhi, the Congress leader will resume her campaign that will culminate in Varanasi, the Prime Ministers constituency, on Wednesday.Ms. Vadra began her unusual campaign with prayers at the Hanuman temple at the Sangam (confluence). The Congress promptly shared on social media an old photo of former Prime Minister and Ms. Vadras grandmother Indira Gandhi at the same temple with the caption  tradition and customs never change.Sitting cross-legged on the motorboat, the Congress leader listened closely as people living along the riverbank shared their problems.Making several halts to interact with people, at the Dumduma ghat, Ms. Vadra took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for calling himself Chowkidar (watchman). Ms. Vadra narrated what potato farmers from western U.P. had told her.One farmer, a brother, said something important. Farmers dont have any chowkidar ; only the rich have chowkidars . The farmers are their own chowkidars , Ms. Vadra said to loud applause.Targeting the Modi government at several small gatherings and interactions, Ms. Vadra said the main problem facing the youth and the farmers was that instead of working on solving problems, the government was raising issues that had nothing to do with the livelihood or future of the people.Common man ignoredThrough her speeches, Ms. Vadra tried to project the Modi government as being sympathetic to a few industrialists, saying their debts were waived off easily, while the common people who raised their voice for their rights were suppressed under this government.You are going to take a big decision in this election. This election is not just for your interests, but of the whole country, said Ms. Vadra.Like you, I too am sick of this government which undermines our Constitution, institutions and does not care for the people ... Responsibility is yours. Chunao nahi, chunauti hai (It not just an election but a challenge), she said."

Wholesale traders said the prices of vegetables normally go up during mid-March. But, this time around, the spike in demand for some vegetables has driven up prices earlier.Cold storage facilitiesBuilding more cold storage facilities would help control such spikes, said traders.Beans are among the vegetables whose prices have soared at the wholesale market. One kg of beans was sold for a between Rs. 85- Rs. 90 on Monday, which is more than double the price in February. On Sunday, it was sold for Rs. 100 a kg, traders said.S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Licensed Merchants Welfare Association, said there is a slight variation in price daily according to arrivals and demand. The cost of vegetables like chayote and carrots has also doubled now because of low yield. The prices would stabilise only after July, he added.Spike in demandMoreover, the demand for seasonal vegetables like lemons and cucumber had also pushed up prices. Only a few vegetables like potato, drumsticks and onions are available at relatively affordable prices.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the price of vegetables was up 10% compared to February. Lack of adequate rainfall and the resultant poor yield had meant fewer lorry-loads arriving at the market. It was only getting an average of 300-350 lorry-loads daily compared to the normal of 400-420 loads daily. Several merchants were eyeing markets further north like Ranchi and Ahmedabad to source vegetables such as beans and broad beans at a lower rate. There was a need for more cold storage facilities to store vegetables, many said. While potatoes could be stored for up to six months, cabbage and beans could only be stored up to 10 days to stabilise prices, one merchant said. The facility maintained by the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited in Koyambedu did not have sufficient capacity, traders said.The market was only getting an average of 300-350 lorry-loads daily compared to the normal of 400-420 loads dailyP.

I am one of those, but I am even luckier because one of those is Zoroastrianism which celebrates not one, but two New Years in a year. Imagine that.This Navroz in March was just slipped in to give us an excuse to celebrate and give free legal reign to our gaiety and to one of our tenets: to go forth, eat, drink, be merry. Also, to guffaw out loud, talk about food, fast cars, Freddie Mercury and Frederic Chopin.Jamshedji Navroz, as the festival is formally called, is the start of the New Year as per the Shahenshahi Calendar of ancient Iran. It coincides with the spring equinox. Named after King Jamshed of Iran, who was powerful, wise and just, the festival also encapsulates the joy of the coming of spring after a long, cold winter.The Parsis, who are the Zoroastrians of India, celebrate this festival even if they live in Bombay, where the concept of winter belongs to the stage of Comedy Central. The thresholds of houses are decorated with rangoli, torans (fresh flower garlands) are hung across doorways, and breakfast is usually a sweet affair of Rava, which is semolina prepared in milk, sugar and egg, or Sev, which is thin vermicelli prepared in milk and sugar.Then off to the agiyary (fire temple) we go, dressed in new clothes, doing a lot of kissi-koti (kisses-hugs) to wish everyone. Some pray to Ahura Mazda for health of their family; a considerable portion also prays for the well-being of their cars and motorcycles.The much-anticipated afternoon meal can be either Dhandar patiyo, which is rice, plain yellow dal made with just turmeric, and a tangy fish or prawn gravy usually made from tomatoes, cashews, tamarind and jaggery, or even mutton pulao and dal. Of course, this will all be washed down with beer or gin and tonic. The evenings are meant for more merriment that includes going out for a Parsi naatak or a play and then for a meal. If you really want to celebrate Navroz the Parsi way, befriend a Parsi now and get invited.If youre not that quick, get a taste of Navroz at SodaBottleOpenerWala, the funky restaurant thats brought the cool to the humble Irani caf. Theyre doing a month-long celebration. . Theres a thali that also comes in a vegetarian option. Borderline blasphemy, but since we live in a world of nonsensical political correctness, oh well. (At various locations in Delhi; Rs. 695 for the real and glorious option, Rs. 625 for the vegetarian; Rs. 1,200 will get you the thali plus bottomless sangria.)Rustoms in the Parsi Anjuman will be shut on the 21st but will serve a special Paatru (meal on a banana leaf) on 23rd and 24th. This will have those lip-smacking delicacies that are served at Parsi weddings (Rs. 1,350 for the non-vegetarian option; Rs. 1150 for the unfortunate option).The Parsi Anjuman, at the end of Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, near the Delhi Gate, has a private function planned. You can gain entry as a guest of a member, but if you cant order from Dhun Bugli (9810788287), who will be catering, and pick it up after 8 p.m. Savour chicken pulao, Dhansak dal, mutton mince and Salli, thin and crispy fried potato straws, and Rava and chapatti."

Surendran in Pathanamthitta, the national leadership chose to defer its announcement for the contentious seat. As expected, former Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharn would take on Shashi Tharoor (UDF) and C.

Krishnadas.RSS demandAnother national executive member, Sobha Surendran, who had evinced interest to contest from Palakkad has been moved to Attingal and C.

Alphons, who had also lobbied for Pathanamthitta, has been named for Ernakulam.Former Kerala Public Service Commission chairman leader K.S. Radhakrishnan, who switched loyalties from the Congress to the BJP recently, will contest from Alappuzha.Rumours were rife that former Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan, who joined the BJP last week, would be fielded from either Ernakulam or Chalakudy, but the party chose A.N. Radhakrishnan for the Chalakudy seat.With the CPI(M) fielding former Kannur district secretary P. Jayarajan and the UDF K. Muraleedharan, MLA, the fight in Vadakara is one of the keenly watched and intense political contests in the State. The BJP has pitted V.K. Sajivan against the two major candidates of the rival fronts.Sabu Varghese (Kollam), Prakash Babu (Kozhikode), V.T. Rema (Ponnani), V. Unnikrishnan (Malappuram), C.K. Padmanabhan (Kannur) and Raveesh Thantri Kuntar (Kasaragod) are the other candidates figure in the list.Pathanamthitta has virtually become a hot potato for the State as well as the national leadership. Since the ball is now in the court of the national leadership, it may not ignore the claim of Mr. Surendran who was in the forefront of the Sabarimala agitation.But that would again lead to more dissent. For, the national leadership seems to have ignored the lists for various segments furnished by the State unit and decided to have its way. This would only deepen the differences in the party, sources said."

We have not created new employment. We have in fact eaten into the employment base we already had. So, today the real challenge is how do we create new jobs,"" he said.Pitroda said employment has been affected by factors such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).""If you don't focus on employment there will be a major crisis,"" the technocrat-turned-politician warned.On whether the Congress has been able to take up the issue of employment in its campaign and narrative, Pitroda said: ""You will see it in the manifesto."" He expressed confidence that Congress will finish the process of stitching up alliances in various states and its tie-ups will become clear soon.Asked if Congress president Rahul Gandhi was matching up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of being the prime challenger, Pitroda said he doesn't see the contest as a challenge between two individuals.""I think it is a challenge between the idea of India. It is about what kind of a nation you want to build going forward, what are the real challenges you have on employment, inclusion and all that, he said Pitroda also said it was a fight of ideologies and a fight between politics of hate and politics of love.He asserted that ""agrarian distress"" is also a major issue.""I was told that there is a problem of excess supply of onions and potatoes, and the prices are way down and that hurts farmers,"" he said.Pitroda, who is credited with being the architect of the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi, also alleged that science and technology had been on the ""back burner in a big way"" under the Modi government.Asked how the Congress will bring the narrative back to real issues such as employment and alleged agrarian distress post the Balakot air strikes, he said the party will raise key issues on the ground among people.Pitroda is part of the 19-member Manifesto Committee set up by the Congress to come out with the party's manifesto for the general elections.Pitroda has worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule."

Farmers get the saplings from different States and some firms import them, too.Short-duration cropIt is a high-value, short-duration crop and the strawberries picked from the Nilgiris gardens are sold across the country, adds Premchand, director, Samberry Exotics Pvt. Ltd.. He has 7-8 acres under strawberry cultivation and plans to get into contract farming and organic strawberries this year.Even the varieties grown in Europe and California can be raised in the Nilgiris, it is learnt. The demand for strawberries is high in the southern States and there are farmers who sell in cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai also, says Mr. Premnath, who has two acres under strawberry.Better awareness among consumers about the nutrient-rich fruit is driving demand, he says. After June, when production declines in the other States, strawberries from the Nilgiris are sold across the country, he adds. A majority of the strawberry produce in the country comes from Mahabaleshwar.No value additionHowever, there is no harvest in that region from June to November. The fruit is harvested throughout the year only in the Nilgiris. Farmers and companies that are into strawberry cultivation in the Nilgiris prefer selling the fruit rather than going in for value addition, he says.The fruits are of better quality if the crop is grown under controlled conditions. The initial cost of investment is high, though that varies depending on the variety. Farmers should have a polyhouse and take up mulching. They should be able to tie up directly for marketing, adds Mr. Samraj.The Tamil Nadu government had come out with a scheme to support strawberry farmers. However, the farmers have sought higher financial support from the government, he says.Mr. Premchand points out that the annual harvest from one acre is almost 10,000 kg. About 30,000 saplings can be planted in one acre and the investment required is Rs. 3 lakh.The Horticulture Department officials in the State visited my farm recently.I requested them to provide at least 50% subsidy to farmers for initial investment and financial support to go in for hydroponics and mulching. This will make the strawberry attractive to more farmers, he says."

Why would the farmers commit suicide then?""Assailing the state government, Mitra said when distressed farmers throw their produce like potato, chillies and vegetables on the highway, then the state ministers remain mum.""Due to the inefficiency of this government, the famers do not get the minimum support price and are forced to sell their produce at a very low price to middlemen backed by the Trinamol.""Regarding unemployment, Mitra accused the state government of resorting to statistical jugglery to downplay the number of jobless people in the state.""But any discerning observer would find the real situation diametrically opposite to the government's projections. School Service Commission candidates are on indefinite hunger strike. Our youths are getting killed in other states where they had gone in search of jobs. If there are adequate job opportunities in Bengal, then why are they being forced to move to other states?"" he asked.Referring to Congress President Rahul Gandhi's speech at an election rally in Malda district's Chanchal, Mitra said he has highlighted the true picture of the state.On Hakim's criticism that Gandhi was ignorant about the state due to the state Congress'ss failure in feeding him the proper data, Mitra said ""Firhad has also commented that Gandhi's allegations will strengthen the hands of the BJP.""Nothing can be further from truth. The leader who is giving sleepless nights to BJP across the country, and under whose leadership the Congress has defeated the BJP in three key states, is now being given a bad name. Nothing can be more unfortunate."""
2019-03-28,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/politics-of-prohibition-a-double-edged-sword-for-nitish/article26658332.ece,Politics of prohibition a double-edged sword for Nitish,"We resolve to have a liquor-free, dowry-free  child marriage-free nation, says a huge election poster outside the Janata Dal(U) office in Patna. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumars ambitious prohibition movement has been a plank for the party in the Lok Sabha election.But, travelling across the Aurangabad, Gaya and Nawada constituencies, which go to the polls in the first phase on April 11, it appears that prohibition may backfire for Mr. Kumar and his party. But the BJP could save the day for them.By imposing prohibition, Nitish Kumar has done more damage to families like ours which earn Rs. 400-500 daily by doing casual labour here and there  liquor still is available in our village, and those who were drinking earlier are doing so, but have to spend three time more  it has its adverse impact on such families, says Jitendra Kumar, 28, of Raniganj village in the Madanpur block in Aurangabad district.He and a group of villagers are playing cards on a post-Holi Sunday afternoon. What kind of prohibition is this? ... It has burdened those who drink but they still drink, wasting their hard-earned wages, says Sarpat Singh, 60, a farmer of the village.Nodding in agreement, Dinesh Kumar, a daily wager, says, Only policemen and those in the business of illegal smuggling of liquor are flourishing  the common man has been the worst hit.But Mr. Nitish Kumar says prohibition has been a revolutionary step which has transformed the social atmosphere in villages. Yes, it has transformed the social milieu in villages, but for the worse, a villager says.The Chief Minister is going to make prohibition an election issue. Will you people vote for him? You write it down, this [prohibition] will ruin him [in election]  the alliance with the BJP can be a big redeemer for him. If he contested alone, he wouldnt win even Nalanda, his home constituency, another says.People at Ganjas, Bandhua and Fatehpur villages in Gaya too are enraged with the Chief Minister for this nakli darubandi (fake liquor ban).Let Nitish Kumar first ban liquor in Patna  many of his officials drink liquor daily  the condition in villages is more pathetic  well teach him a lesson in this election, said Dharamveer Singh at Fatehpur village.At Madho Bigha and Akbarpur villages in Nawada too, the reactions were similar.Jadu Sao and Sarekan Mehta of Patanwa village of Aurangabad added, The liquor ban will boomerang for Nitish Kumar in this election.The Nitish Kumar government had enforced total ban on liquor in the State from April 5, 2016 through the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016. Later, in June 2018, the government made amendments to some stringent provisions of the Act. However, liquor bottles continue to be seized from trucks and vans laden with oranges, potatoes and gas cylinders from different parts of the State. About 15 lakh litres of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and 8 lakh litres of country-made liquor have been seized in the State since April 2016.The JD(U), though, is not contesting the upper caste dominated Aurangabad seat as under the NDA alliance, the BJP candidate Sushil Singh is trying his luck for the third time. The grand alliances Hindustan Awam Morcha (Secular) has fielded a light-weight Upendra Prasad, a former MLC. For the first time since the first general election, the Congress has not fielded a candidate from Aurangabad.Former Congress MP Nikhil Kumar was denied ticket this time and it has caused some resentment among voters in some pockets of the district. Mr. Sushil Singh had defeated Mr. Nikhil Kumar in the 2014 election by over 66,000 votes. The upper caste Rajputs comprise 17.5 %, Bhumihars 6.75% while Yadavs and Muslims comprise 10% and 8.5% of the population."

2019-03-30,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/travel/snow-and-sashimi-in-magical-japan/cid/1687823,Snow and Sashimi in magical Japan,"Intriguing, mysterious, bizarre and bustling. These are words that spring to mind every time I think of Japan. With the most polite people with smiling faces, the country unfolds itself in more ways than one. My first brush with the Land of the Rising Sun in the summer of 2017 left me awestruck, wanting for more. But little did I know that two years later I would be on yet another Japanese odyssey. This time, to experience winter.When one pictures Japan, its usually in hues of cherry blossom that spring brings and then autumns bounty of fiery-red leaves. Since the Japanese winter is not much spoken of, I didnt know what to expect. Will it live up to the expectation? Will it be as beautiful as it had been the first time? Armed with the warmest clothes a Calcuttan could think of, I boarded a flight on an invitation from the Japan National Tourism Organisation.A cold gush of wind  the kind that chills your bones  hit me as I stepped out of New Chitose Airport, and I immediately knew what I was up against: -11C read the weather app on my phone.Skiing is a popular sport in Japan and Hokkaido is a paradise for winter sports because of the powdery texture of the snow Nandini GangulyThousand torii gates lead to the sacred Mount Inari Nandini GangulyWrapped in a white blanketOne of the things that stands out about Japan is its cuisine. Bold yet subtle flavours, fresh ingredients, and the care with which each item is made and presented, is something that one needs to learn from the Japanese. The art of creating food, theatrics that are often involved in it, aesthetics and manners of eating, will make you sit up and take note.After spending nearly a day in airports (thanks to long layovers), dinner at a traditional Japanese seafood pub  Sapporos Seafood Robata Nemuro Hamaichiban  comprising some sashimi, Japanese grilled fish and glasses of Yuzu Shochu (a distilled alcoholic beverage typically made from rice, sweet potato and barley) was what I needed to replenish.After a hearty meal and an ice-breaking session with my fellow travellers, we headed to Keio Plaza Hotel Sapporo in Chuo ward. 12.30am, I tucked myself in bed, smiling at the thought of what awaited me.We made an early start the next day. A one-and-a-half-hour scenic drive later from Sapporo, we arrived at our first stop in Hokkaido  the Kiroro Ski Resort in Yoichi district  to experience the majestic snow-covered tourist spot.A quick inspection of the resort before heading out in the snow: -15C on the outside. Battling strong, bone-chilling wind, I couldnt help but stare at the stunning sight. For someone who comes from a place where 10C is peak winter, all the snow with a touch of dull green in the form of trees was nothing less than a fairy tale. I felt wrapped in a white blanket.Skiing is a popular sport in Japan and Hokkaido is a paradise for winter sports because of the powdery texture of the snow (a result of cold air blowing in from Siberia) here.Apart from skiing, theres also snow rafting, tubing and other activities that families can indulge in at the resort.Traditional sushi platter  Nigiri, maki with squid, salmon, uni, tuna along with miso soup and a hot cup of matcha  at a sushiya in Otaru Nandini GangulyThe famed red-brick Sapporo Beer Museum is lit up during the winter months Nandini GangulyStopping by a sushiyaAlmost an hours drive later, we stopped for lunch at Otaru Nihonbashi in Otaru. Even though theres more to Japanese cuisine than sushi, a trip to Japan is incomplete without tucking into the delicacy. The port city of Otaru that lies north-west of Sapporo has a canal running through it with old offices and warehouses adding a character that will remind you of a bygone era. It is also known for fresh seafood thats used to make sushi and Otaru Nihonbashi is one of the most popular sushiya (sushi restaurant) in the harbour city.The traditional setup at the restaurant with tatami mats (a straw floor covering in traditional Japanese homes, also found in restaurants) and low seating in the warmth of a spacious room, is what made the difference for me. Nigiri, maki with squid, salmon, uni (gonads of sea urchin), tuna along with miso soup and a hot cup of matcha, well satiated my hunger and craving for traditional Japanese sushi and not the hybrid version served in India.I remembered Otaru being completely different than what I was seeing this time. The colours were now muted with a snow cover. What remained the same were the streets filled with tourists and shops selling everything, from knick-knacks to silver jewellery, pretty-as-a-picture desserts, clothes and souvenirs. The sides of the famed Otaru canal were lined with snow. The harbour city looked like a picture postcard.Apart from ski resorts, fresh seafood and hot spring, if theres anything else that Hokkaido is known for, its Sapporo beer. The beer museum housed in the same compound as Sapporo Beer Garden in Higashi ward, still retains its red brick walls that once played host to a sugar factory and then a malting plant. Enriched with a history thats more than 100 years old, this Hokkaido Heritage site lets you drink draft beer directly from the brewery while relishing some Genghis Khan  fresh Hokkaido lamb and veggies that you can grill on your own on a special metal skillet. The meat is accompanied by a sauce with lemon and apple accents.Sagano Bamboo Grove in Arashiyama district of Kyoto Nandini GangulyThe penguin walkDay Two took us from one prefecture to another, Hokkaido to Osaka on a two-hour-long flight. But before that, we had one more stop to experience. It was time to tap the child in me.Asahiyama Zoo in Asahikawa district is the northernmost zoo in Japan and one of the most popular ones. Large glass windows, bubble domes and open spaces let you take a peek into the natural behaviour of the animals. Penguins swimming overhead while you walk inside a glass tunnel, spotted seals taking a dive in the aqua tunnels and polar bears playing among themselves, cold climate species live in a habitat thats closest to their natural ones in Asahiyama Zoo. One of the most popular attractions at the zoo is the penguin walk that lets you take a closer look at the penguins as they waddle through. You can almost imagine the tiny army posing for the cameras and waving at the excited tourists and locals alike. Their black backs glistening in sunlight made for quite a sight.Day Two of our trip done and it was time for Osaka  Japans third-largest city to welcome us with its trademark flashy billboards, a variety of street food, neon lights and kitschy pubs. Upon reaching Osaka (Itami) International Airport, we had dinner at the Osaka Umeda branch of Banjara  a restaurant serving Indian food. Osaka was going to be our home for the rest of the stay in Japan.Universal Studios Japan (USJ)  the first theme park in Asia built under the Universal Studios brand  is easily accessible from Osaka by train. With nine sections  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Hollywood, Amity Village, Jurassic Park, New York, Minion Park, San Francisco, Universal Wonderland and Waterworld, a trip here can take an entire day, at least!The young girl in me was excited all over again at the thought of revisiting the nostalgia that had filled me up the last time I visited USJ. Be it sipping on butter beer, lunching at Hogsmeade, or experiencing the exhilarating Flying Dinosaur Ride, USJ is for the young and young at heart. Rain played spoilsport but it couldnt dampen my spirit because our day was still not over.Evening at Osaka was reserved for the vibrant and engaging Dotonbori, the downtown area with a canal through it. With countless restaurants, food stalls and shopping arcades, it wont be wrong to say that this is the heart of the large harbour city. Day Four over, it was time for me to look forward to the place that had my heart  Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.Kimono-clad women with Fushimi-Inari-Taisha as the backdrop Nandini GangulyKimono experienceKyoto is what you imagine Japan to be, quintessentially... a time warp that is culturally rich with the kind of charm that pleases and soothes your senses. By road, the journey from Osaka to Kyoto was roughly an hour. Before heading to the sites for the day, we were taken for a quick Japanese makeover  a kimono experience, complete with accessories and hairdo.The strict step-by-step and complicated process of wearing the kimono almost took me to a meditative state but what was interesting to watch was the kind of precision and discipline that was being followed in making someone wear a piece of clothing!What we usually see, the outermost layer of the Japanese costume, is the kimono with different colours, vibrant patterns and materials like silk, brocade, cotton and satin along with an obi belt which helps in securing the kimono and lending good posture. What one wears underneath is as elaborate  undergarments called a shitagi and juban, along with sheets of cloths and belts to secure everything in place.Interesting fact: Kimonos are wrapped around the body from left to right while those of the dead are wrapped right over left. Also, kimono is usually worn during winter while in the summers, yukata, a more comfortable version of the kimono made with cotton, is preferred.Dressed and feeling like a local, off we went to Fushimi Inari-Taisha, a beautiful shrine known for its thousands of torii gates stretching till the forest of the sacred mount Inari. Famished after climbing up the stairs and clicking tonnes of pictures, we headed for lunch at Minetora in the Fushimi ward. The Kaiseki (traditional Japanese multi-course meal) had it all  from udon to unagi (freshwater eel) with sticky rice to miso soup, tempura, sashimi phew! My second-last meal in Japan turned out to be the best. Its the nuanced flavours in Japanese cuisine that are unmatched.Next stop? Sagano Bamboo Grove in Arashiyama. Travelling to Kyoto is slow, its like going back in time. The tall bamboo trees give you a sense of calmness and make you wonder what stories would they tell us if they could talk. A short walk through the groves and then back to Osaka by road brought an end to the five-day trip.From the powdery snow in the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido, the energetic city life in Osaka to the cultural and tranquil beauty of Kyoto, the Land of the Rising Sun is a bag of surprises during winter. The white cover on the streets makes you look at the country in a different light. In one word, its magical.There are no bins on the road because you are expected to carry your trash with you. You will find people queuing up  on platforms to board trains, on the escalator and so on. People are mindful, polite and respect each others space. Trains run exactly on time and when I say exactly, I mean not even a second late. You can also lie down on a street corner and not be bothered about someone stealing your belongings.Japan is an experience. Maybe with Japan, forever isnt enough."

Three years is a long time to achieve self-sufficiency in potato production, but the Government has no such intention, he said.While launching the State Potato Mission in December 2014, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had promised to construct 112 cold storage within three years ending March 2018. Claiming that 26 cold storages were constructed in private sector in the last four years, Harichandan said all of them are on the verge of closure owing to lack of Government support to promoters who are reeling under the burden of high capital cost and interest.Apart from under-utilisation of capacity, the cold storage owners have to pay electricity bill as per commercial rate, he said.All the promoters have eroded the entire working capital of their units during the last four years of operation. The units are on the verge of shutting down.While they have lost the hope of revival, the BJP leader said the farmers who thought that the units were going to provide them safe landing for their produce and provide security to their earnings are also at stress.Though the mission seeks to ramp up tuber output in the State to 11.2 lakh tonne by 2017-18 up from 2 lakh tonne, four years down the line, Odishas potato production has gone down, Harichandan said and warned the Chief Minister that the farmers will give a befitting reply to his party in the upcoming elections."

Raghavarao on Saturday said a centre of excellence and an incubation centre on millets would come up on the CFTRI campus, at a cost of 15 crore and in collaboration with the State government. The centre will work on bringing out millet-based technology for promoting millets.Speaking after inaugurating the 27th annual general body meeting of the CSIR Pensioners Welfare Association and Convention on Food and Wellness at the IFTTC auditorium at CFTRI, he said the institute was also working on a turnkey project for developing a value-added product from silkworm pupae, a waste product in the silk industry. The State government has allocated a grant of 10 crore towards the project, he said.The CFTRI director said the second phase of the incubation centre for encouraging innovations and startups among entrepreneurs, in collaboration with the Department of IT and BT, is expected to be launched after the general elections. Many ventures at the incubation centre are turning out to be successful and a project fetched the highest grant of 50 lakh. MoUs will be signed for more projects after the polls, he added.He said more than 60 industries have used the technology on virgin coconut oil developed at the institute and most say the technology has been smoothly transferred for commercial production.Mr. Raghavarao also said that pilot plants in the area of food processing on tomato, onion and potato were coming up near Tumakuru and there are also talks to have a similar plant for turmeric. He added that some private hospitals in Mysuru had come forward to offer healthcare services on credit to retired CFTRI staff.The inauguration was followed by sessions where experts in the field of food processing and technology spoke on various subjects."

It was Singur that brought Trinamool to power and Mamata Banerjee became CM. But you got nothing in return.Clad in a pale red sari, Lo-cket and her campaign team reached Singurs Ratanpur along Durgapur Expressway around 11.25am. Getting off her car, she discussed the days campaign plan and asked some party workers to drive ahead of her. The convoy then headed for Gopalnagar.All along the way from Ratanpur, BJP supporters lined both the road to greet Locket. Two of them, Raju Mal and Sekhar Ghosh, told her: We had given our land to make way for the Tata car factory. We had also got a contract to supply sand for construction. But the contractor never paid all our dues.Locket said: As far as I know, chemicals were poured all over the land acquired for the factory to facilitate construction. This has made the land unfit for agriculture. If I win, I will highlight your grievances in Parliament. I will ensure industries start functioning in Singur. You will also find work when the wheels of industry start rolling here.From Gopalnagar, her campaign trail stretched to Dewanbheri. Though a debut candidate, Locket carried herself like a seasoned politician, walking and holding peoples hands, sitting on the back of a bicycle and boarding her campaign car. Spotting some women on the roadside, Locket got off and held one of their babies in her lap.Most of the women, joined by some men, told her: Didi, we were promised by this state government that our land would be returned. But our plots have not been demarcated. Many like us dont get the monthly dole of 16kg rice and Rs 2,000 cash as we dont support Trinamool.Locket replied: You were used by Trinamool. To rewind the clock, vote for us to ensure (Narendra) Modiji becomes PM again.She then sat on a bicycle to traverse a narrow road. Some farmers standing along the way showed her their land just outside the car factory project area. They told her: We had grown potato on our plots but have been unable to realise our production cost. Locket told them: The BJP government at the Centre has already started a pension scheme for you. If BJP comes to power, the face of Bengal will undergo a sea change.She ended the day with a roadside meeting just outside the project area at Baraberi."

2019-04-01,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/alexa-is-making-us-all-couch-potatoes/cid/1687899,Alexa is making us all couch potatoes,"Sir  The population of couch potatoes is set to explode in the future. The credit must go to smart assistants like Amazons Alexa which have flooded the market seemingly with the intention of doing away with domestic chores. As it is, employees spend most of their time hunched in front of computers at work. Mobility is now endangered at home too; a voice command is enough to get work done. Are companies fiddling with artificial intelligence concerned about the health of consumers?Manabendra Sanyal,CalcuttaDeadly weightSir  The decision to reduce the weight of school bags was long overdue. A survey conducted two years ago by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India under its healthcare unit found that over 88 per cent of school-going children between the ages of 7 to 13 bore more than 45 per cent of their weight on their back.Is there any need to carry books to school? The teacher is expected to give lessons to students. The latter can refer to books when they are studying at home. It would be enough if children carried a few exercise books to schools for class work. School authorities should provide students with lockers to keep art kits, geometry boxes, swimming costumes and sport equipment.Rabindranath Sarkar,CalcuttaSir  The Telegraphs report on school bags is relevant to every school-going child. I have weighed the school bag of my daughter who studies in standard V; it weighed eight kilogrammes. These days, publishers change a chapter or two every year, forcing students to buy new books, thereby adding to the weight of their bags. The practice of offering commissions to schools is also on the rise. Putting pressure on students, literally or figuratively, is an archaic proposition.Viresh Agarwala,KurseongMale fiefSir  India has been an utter failure when it comes to womens representation in Parliament. Sadly, India occupied the 103rd spot out of 140 countries with a representation of only 12 per cent some years ago.The plight of women leaders in Arunachal Pradesh, much like the rest of the Northeast, is similar. Arunachal has only three women in a state assembly that has 60 seats. The candidature list of the Bharatiya Janata Party has three women as well. Meanwhile, Jarjum Ete, a renowned activist, has resigned from the Congress.Etes resignation is much more than an expression of disenchantment.

The second list touched areas of central UP and Bundelkhand, parts of which go to the polls in the fourth phase on April 29.In Shahjahanpur, the BSP has fielded Amar Chand Jauhar who is associated with the education business, in place of Umed Singh Kashyap who stood second in 2014 with 2.89 lakh votes.Neelu Satyarthi, who stood second in the Balamau Assembly seat in Hardoi in 2017 election, will be the BSP's candidate in Misrikh. In 2014, the BSP's Ashok Rawat had secured 3.25 lakh votes in the seat to achieve a runner-up spot.In Farukhhabad, known as a potato hub, the BSP has fielded former MLC Manoj Agarwal.In Akbarpur, which comprises of rural Kanpur, the BSP has fielded a Kurmi (OBC), Nisha Sachan. Ms. Sachan recently joined the BSP.

We have witnessed how people from the minority community were attacked and killed by saffron goons in Peda of Bijnor in 2016, she alleged during her first media interaction after she was fielded on Aonla seat on behalf of BSP. Veera has been SP MLA from Bijnor in the 16th UP assembly.Veera expressed her gratitude to BSP chief Mayawati for showing confidence in her. It has been a great responsibility which is given to me by my leader to contest from a constituency which is new for me. But I am highly grateful to Mayawati and leader of our alliance parties  Akhilesh Yadav and Ajit Singh, she said.Asked why she was denied ticket from her stronghold Bijnor, Veera said, Anyone can contest from anywhere. When Modiji contested from Varanasi in 2014, it was a new constituency, even outside his home-state Gujrat. I am confident as we have a very strong base in Aonla also.Veera also criticised the incumbent MP and former MPs for neglecting the constituency, terming Aonla as backward so far as development was concerned. Since no sugar mill was set up here, farmers in Aonla are forced to grow potato, wheat and paddy only. They have no direct road to reach Meerganj in the absence of a bridge on the river Ramganga, she said.While countering a question related to appeasement politics in regard to the Peda riots which broke out in 2016 in Bijnor, Veera said, The people of the minority community were attacked. I stand with the victims without considering their caste or religion. Since BJP came to power at the Centre and after that in UP, the atmosphere of communal harmony has been destroyed to a large extent. They have been doing politics in the name of god and the armed forces, which is very disgusting."

The credit must go to smart assistants like Amazons Alexa which have flooded the market seemingly with the intention of doing away with domestic chores. As it is, employees spend most of their time hunched in front of computers at work. Mobility is now endangered at home too; a voice command is enough to get work done. Are companies fiddling with artificial intelligence concerned about the health of consumers?Manabendra Sanyal,CalcuttaDeadly weightSir  The decision to reduce the weight of school bags was long overdue. A survey conducted two years ago by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India under its healthcare unit found that over 88 per cent of school-going children between the ages of 7 to 13 bore more than 45 per cent of their weight on their back.Is there any need to carry books to school? The teacher is expected to give lessons to students. The latter can refer to books when they are studying at home. It would be enough if children carried a few exercise books to schools for class work. School authorities should provide students with lockers to keep art kits, geometry boxes, swimming costumes and sport equipment.Rabindranath Sarkar,CalcuttaSir  The Telegraphs report on school bags is relevant to every school-going child. I have weighed the school bag of my daughter who studies in standard V; it weighed eight kilogrammes. These days, publishers change a chapter or two every year, forcing students to buy new books, thereby adding to the weight of their bags. The practice of offering commissions to schools is also on the rise. Putting pressure on students, literally or figuratively, is an archaic proposition.Viresh Agarwala,KurseongMale fiefSir  India has been an utter failure when it comes to womens representation in Parliament. Sadly, India occupied the 103rd spot out of 140 countries with a representation of only 12 per cent some years ago.The plight of women leaders in Arunachal Pradesh, much like the rest of the Northeast, is similar. Arunachal has only three women in a state assembly that has 60 seats. The candidature list of the Bharatiya Janata Party has three women as well. Meanwhile, Jarjum Ete, a renowned activist, has resigned from the Congress.Etes resignation is much more than an expression of disenchantment. It is a reminder of the grim reality that politics is not accommodating of women leaders. We have been conditioned to believe that war and politics are more effectively managed by men.

What will one earn after working for 14-15 days in a year under MNREGA? When we ask the panchayat head about MNREGA jobs, he says there is no work, she says.MNREGA is a labour law and social security measure that aims to guarantee the right to work.It aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.The village has more than 500 houses where over 2,500 dwellers reside. Majority of families do not have adequate land to earn their livelihood and are dependent on daily wages. Some of them go to Purwa for jobs while those who have farm land are forced to be in fields to guard it from stray animals.Some families have, however, benefitted from various other central and state government schemes. We got LPG connection under Ujjwala scheme but we could not get the cylinder refilled as we did not have money, says Chhedana of Atwa village near Mirjapur Sumhari, in Unnao,.According to MNREGA labourers, wages under this scheme are always delayed and now the work is not available easily. We only get Rs 174 under MNREGA and I have to feed the family of four with this amount, Ram Aasare, 48, says.Earlier, we used to get enough work under MNREGA without long gaps. But there are weeks when we have no work to do, says Manju of the same village.MNREGA strengthens our economi condition as women of the villages got work. Now, we are back to square one, she adds.Like Manju, many others have been tilling farms on contract and getting Rs 200 per day.We are getting Rs 200 but it will not last long. There will be no work on this land after some days and we will have to search for new work, says Minnati of the same village.Rajesh Kumar, 18, of Atwa village, says: You will not find many people in the village during day time as most of them go to Purwa in search of job.Atwa village got pucca houses and toilets built under central schemes but the question of livelihood still stares at them.Asked if MNREGA is helping or not, he says: Hum koi badi naukari nahin maang rahe. Mazdoori karna chah rahe hain aur vo bhi nahin milti. (We do not aspire for big jobs but are ready to do work as a daily wager. But we do not get even that), he says.What does government data say?In Uttar Pradesh 2018-19 2017-18 2016-17Women Person days out of total(%):35.27 53.53 56.16Average days of employment per household (per year): 41.57 45.69 46First Published: Apr 02, 2019 08:54 IST"

2019-04-03,https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/cloud-over-farm-fortunes/cid/1686128,Cloud over farm fortunes,"Prices of potatoes have tumbled 25-30% to Rs 700-750 a tonne in Uttar Pradesh, which is set to produce a bumper crop of 145 lakh tonnes. (Shutterstock)The plight of farmers is unlikely to change despite the income support scheme unveiled with much fanfare by the Narendra Modi-government in the interim budget.Prices of potato and turmeric have tumbled because of over-production this year, while extended winter rain has ruined the corn crop which could result in imports of up to 1 million tonnes.Deflationary trend in food prices along with over-production is leading to huge price swings and consequently distress for Indias farming community, said Biswajit Dhar of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University.In value terms, the farm sector has grown just 1.2 per cent in April-December 2018 against a growth of 5 per cent last year despite a good crop year.Prices of potatoes have tumbled 25-30 per cent to Rs 700-750 a tonne in Uttar Pradesh, which is set to produce a bumper crop of 145 lakh tonnes. In Bengal, the rates have come down 40-50 per cent to Rs 500-550 per tonne despite intervention by the state government. Bengal is set to produce about 120 lakh tonnes of potato, about 20 per cent more than last year. While prices have fallen to Rs 700-750 a tonne in Uttar Pradesh, they have fallen to Rs 500-550 in Bengal.Turmeric prices in south India have similarly fallen 25 per cent, leading to distress in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. On the other hand, corn prices have jumped 30 per cent, mainly because of the crops being damaged by armyworm insects that had devastated Africa two years ago.Though the government is yet to allow import, state-run MMTC has issued a circular seeking to learn from starch manufacturers and animal feed producers the quantity of corn they need this year.Analysts said this was the first step to calculate whether imports would be allowed. India could allow corn imports of 4 lakh tonnes to 1 million tonnes.The government in the interim budget had announced a Rs 6,000-a-year basic income support to poor farmers owning up to 5 acres. However, the scheme has been criticised as being too little, too late, besides throwing up questions over identifying the beneficiaries and the predicament of landless farm workers and tenant farmers.The scheme promises just Rs 16.43 a day of income to a farmer family or about Rs 4 per head, taking an average family of four. It is unlikely to yield much results besides good optics, said Dhar.The scheme comes on the back of a summer of discontent over the last two years with leaders such as Rakesh Tikait and Raju Shetty of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan leading farmers into demanding loan waivers and the implementation of the Swaminathan formula for crop pricing.The movements resulted in a series of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh but could not bring the government to address the basic problem of unremunerative prices and lack of storage facilities which forced crop sales at distress rates.Farmers have been witnessing intense rural distress after prices collapsed in the wake of money being sucked out of the rural economy when the government demonetised around 86 per cent of the currency by value in November 2016.Loan waivers did not help as these were meant for those who had taken loans from banks, mostly large farmers.According to NSSO data released in 2016, while 60 per cent of the total farm loans were taken from banks and state agencies, 40 per cent were from unregulated lenders such as money lenders and grain buyers."
2019-04-03,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/loss-spurs-government-to-focus-on-insurance/cid/1686146,Loss spurs government to focus on insurance,"The potato fields were damaged by rain in the last days of February. (Shutterstock)The Mamata Banerjee government has shifted its focus from direct procurement of potato from farmers to compensation payment as the production could be hit hard in many south Bengal districts after rain damaged the crop in the midst of harvest.We are yet to ascertain the exact loss as potato grows beneath the ground. Until the harvesting is complete, the total damage cannot be calculated. But we are trying to ensure that all the 5 lakh potato farmers who have insured their crops submit claims by Monday, said a senior government official.The comment makes it clear that the government is not in a hurry to start procurement of potatoes. A notification was issued on February 28, announcing that the government would buy 10 lakh tonnes of potato at Rs 5.50 a kg from farmers.The decision to procure potato was taken after farmers were forced to sell the crop at Rs 3 a kg following a bumper production. But it appears that the damage to the crop is serious as price of the spud has shot up following the rain, which recorded between 75mm and 95mm in various districts in three days. Farmers in many areas are selling their produce at Rs 6 a kg. So, its important to ensure compensation for them right at this moment, said another official.The potato fields were damaged by rain in the last days of February.According to officials, the farmers, who had insured their produce, need to submit claims within 72 hours after the rainfall stopped.As per that calculation, farmers need to submit claims by Sunday But we are trying to extend the deadline till Monday by holding discussions with three insurance companies, which have insured the crop in Bengal this year, a senior Nabanna official said on Saturday.Although details of the crop loss are yet to be ascertained, primary reports sent to the agriculture department hinted more than 1 lakh hectares of potato in five south Bengal districts  Bankura, East Burdwan, Birbhum, East and West Midnapore  have been affected.As we are yet to receive a report from Hooghly, known as a major potato producing district, we apprehend the loss could go up to about 1.5 lakh hectares, said an agriculture department official.Sources said the total loss of production could be around 15 lakh tonnes, which could give the state a relief as it was worried over surplus production this year.The state had initially estimated that the potato production could reach 120 lakh tonnes against an averageannual yield of 100 lakh tonnes.The surplus production was forcing farmers to go for distress sale pushing the state to prepare a procurement plan The untimely rain has made the situation easy for the government as the farmers will now be able to get proper price for their produce, an official said.Realising that it would hardly need to intervene in the market following the untimely rain, the state government has put all its efforts to ensure that all farmers who insured crop get compensation.We will keep our shops open for the farmers But the early signs hint that farmers will get better price for their produce in the market, said an official."

It was minus, says the 30-year-old from Sultan Bathery in north Kerala. On March 17, the day he timed 2:13.39 to qualify for the World Championships, the temperature in the South Korean capital ranged from 2 to 15 degrees. But in tropical Sultan Bathery, anything below 15 degrees is called minus.AdvertisingIt was unusually warm in Bangalore where I was training. As marathoners, we have to travel around the world and compete. But frankly, I have never experienced such cold during a race. I wore arm-sleeves and gloves when I started the race. Believe me, it was freezing. It was the first time I raced in gloves, Gopi said.The first 10 kilometres was hell. He started feeling discomfort in both feet because of the cold. However, he managed to record the second fastest time ever by an Indian, and wasnt too far from Shivnath Singhs time of 2:12.00 set in 1978.In Seoul, Gopi was up against more than just the elements and a field of Ethiopian and Kenyans. The Seoul Marathon was the first time Gopi had travelled abroad on his own for a race; no coach, no physio, no pace-setter, no fellow Indian runner.AdvertisingBeing self-reliant is not new to Gopi. For nearly a year, he has been training without a coach after his name was struck out from the list of national campers.Visa-related issues only added to his woes. A fortnight earlier, he couldnt travel for the Tokyo Marathon, an event he had trained for and set his sights on for breaking the national record, because the visa didnt come on time. Missing the race in Japan disrupted his training schedule.For one week after knowing that I hadnt got the visa, I was mentally disturbed. I didnt train. In the last 10 days before a marathon, we cut down on our mileage. If a marathoner does 180 to 190 kilometers a week during peak training, in the last week to 10 days it comes down to about 50 to 60 kilometres. So there was not much time for me to get back to full shape. I had just one workout of 30 kilometers after I missed Tokyo and before Seoul, Gopi said.Travelling alone to Seoul meant Gopi had to take care of the pre-race nitty-gritties, matters which a coach usually looks after while the athlete rests before the race. Stuff like preparing my personal drinks and handing it over to race organisers, collecting my chest number if there is someone with you, it becomes easier. It can happen that when you have a scheduled time for rest, it clashes with the time when chest numbers are distributed. These are small things but can make a difference, Gopi said.By now, he has got used to fending for himself. After failing to meet qualification times for last years Asian Games, he has been without a coach and training without support staff.Gopi, an Asian Marathon Champion from 2017, knocked on the doors of the Athletics Federation of India asking them to send his entry. The gold at the Asiad went at 2:18.22, which was within Gopis range.At the New Delhi Marathon last year, I had clocked 2:15.16. I was disappointed that I could not participate at the Asian Games because I could have won a medal. I saw the timing of the podium finishers and was crushed. But as I didnt meet the qualifying timings, I guess I should not talk or complain. Fair enough.Struggle of a non-camperFrom being an elite athlete, Gopi was relegated to a non-camper. He could train at the Sports Authority of India track at Kengeri, on the outskirts of Bangalore, but could not stay at the hostel.So he took a room on rent nearby. From being served meals on time at the athletes mess, Gopi had to start buying groceries and cooking. He had to fix appointments with private physios and masseurs and find time between training sessions to travel through traffic to consult them.Brown rice, boiled vegetables, mutton, sweet potato. This is basically my diet. I have four eggs a day and non-vegetarian meals three times a week. Carbohydrates are important for marathon runners, so I had to get my diet chart right. Once you are removed from the national camp, you have to take care of everything on your own.Things are looking up since he qualified for the World Championships. On Wednesday, Gopi was packing his bags and preparing to join the national camp in Ooty.My aim has been to break the national record, which is the oldest in India. I feel that I could have done it in Tokyo because my preparation was perfect. In Seoul, my right calf muscle did cramp a bit with five kilometres to go. I have regained my confidence now as I have improved my personal best.The marathon at the Doha World Championships will begin at midnight to protect the runners from peak summer temperatures.It will be a challenge for the athletes to adjust their body clock for a 12 am start on a fully lit-up race course.AdvertisingI have never participated in a race that starts at midnight. There are a few unknowns. But I am ready for it. Maybe the track will be fast maybe a national record"

Of all the games Ive written about, Rhino Hero has the easiest, shortest and most accurate elevator pitch  its Uno crossed with Jenga.In Rhino Hero, 2-5 players will take turns adding floors to a single tower made up of cards. On your turn, youll need to first place wall cards standing up on the previously-played roof, and then add a roof card of your own to the top of the walls you just played. Like Jenga, youre trying to not knock the tower down; and, like Uno, the cards you play can mess with your opponents. The first player to play all of their roof cards wins the game or, if the tower falls, the player with the fewest cards in hand will win.Many roof cards have an icon in a corner, and their effects may be familiar to Uno fans  skip a turn, reverse direction of play, draw one extra roof card etc. However, theres one card thats unique to Rhino Hero and it has a rhino symbol on it. When that card is played, the next player must put up the walls as normal but  before placing their roof card  they must pick up Rhino Hero from wherever he is and place him on that rhino icon.Now, Rhino Hero is a small wooden figure of a rhinoceros wearing a cape and so can easily destabilise a structure thats already teetering in all likelihood. It gets better, though. The first time a rhino card is played, you take Rhino Hero from the table and place him. Every subsequent time, youve got to first remove Rhino Hero from wherever he is in the tower and then place him on a higher floor; which is exactly as precarious as it sounds.For sheer hilarity, few games can match Rhino Hero. Youre building a common tower, which adds a somewhat cooperative feeling, but the roof cards bring back that competitive edge. Above all, people dont want to have the tower fall on their turn  because that immediately disqualifies them from winning so it becomes a laugh-out-loud game of hot potato where a player places their roof card and jumps back yelling Your turn now! as quickly as possible.To show just how funny this game can be, there was one instance when the tower had reached an unprecedented height but was starting to wobble. The player whose turn it was managed to place his roof card successfully, and then sighed in relief  which caused the tower to collapse. The laughter went on for minutes and, to this day, we havent let him forget about this."
2019-04-05,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/back-to-bengal/article26744281.ece,"At Kolkata's Kopai, get a taste of Tagore's family recipes","I havent holidayed in Santiniketan, though the university town has often figured on our list of must-visit year-end getaways. But I came pretty close to it during an extended food fiesta in Kolkata some days ago. I went to a restaurant called Kopai, which is the name of a river that flows past Tagores idyllic town. And I had quite a memorable meal there.For folks who visit Kolkata, I write about occasional restaurants in the eastern megapolis. I love Kolkata for very many reasons, chief among which (apart from the fact that some of my dear friends live there), is its food. Kolkata is not squeamish about food. You get everything there: from pork and beef, to lamb and fish, to say nothing of greens and sweets. So, while in the city, I thought I would try out a restaurant that I had been reading about. I landed up there one fine afternoon, with friends and family.Kopai is off Sarat Bose Road, near the localitys post-office. It is a small place, with a basic but pleasing dcor. The food is touted as Thakurbarir ranna, essentially dishes that the Tagore family was known for. I could tell they had a mild West Bengal touch. Food in Bengal is either East Bengali or West Bengali, depending on whos cooking it. The former is  largely  spicier; the latter has a bit of sugar in its gravies.Dhokar dalnaWe asked for a plate of begun bhaja (fried brinjal: 50), badaam jhurjhuri aloo bhaja (crispy fried potato with peanuts: 50), luchi (maida puris (80 for four), light masoor dal (70), chholar dal (channa dal: 90), shukto (a light vegetable mix: 90), dhokar dalna (steamed lentil cakes: 140), mutton curry ( 300), chingri malai curry (prawns in coconut milk: 250), rice and kacha aam (green mango) chutney (90). For desserts, we had mishti doi (50) and chhana bhollobhi (80).I really enjoyed the food. The chholar dal was a bit sweet, but I dont mind that any more. I enjoyed the masoor dal more, which was light and fragrant. We had the luchi with the fried brinjal, and the rice with the delicious wispy and crispy potato fritters. The shukto  a mlange of vegetables in a light, mildly bitter sauce  was rather nice and I loved the dhokar dalna, steamed lentil cakes in curry. I didnt have the prawn, which I was told had been cooked just right, with coconut milk thickening the gravy. The mutton curry  the way its cooked at Bengali homes  was delicious. I was left licking my fingers.The desserts were out of this world, too. I think the sweets of Kolkata are special because of the quality of the milk there. Most halwais use cows milk, and that, to my mind, makes all the difference to a sweet. The mishti doi wasnt red, but white and creamy. The chana ballavi was a soft square of chhaina that had been fried brown and dipped in sugar syrup. And the mango chutney was a delectable mix of sweet and tart tastes.There was a time when you couldnt get Bengali food in Kolkata. Then, a womens cooperative called Suruchi opened up, Peerless got known for its Bengali restaurant, and a well-known resident and feted cook opened a small eatery in her house. Now there are scores of Bengali restaurants in the city. I must go and visit some of the small dhabas that I have heard so much about. In these eateries  called Pice hotels  you get authentic, home-cooked Bengali food. Its no coincidence that the word for food in Bengali is similar to that for news. The first is khabaar, the second is khobor. Ki khobor translates into What news? and Ki khabaar, into What food!"

They have a basement seating area too with plush sofas and a snooker table! The restaurant is open from 12 pm to 2 am.The first dish we were served were the Peri Peri Pizza and the Keema Pizza, made by their in-house outlet Festa. They were one of the best pizzas we had ever tasted. The crust was thin and crunchy, the toppings perfectly spiced, and it was not possible to stop at one slice.When asked about the secret behind the fresh taste, the proprietor, Arijit Yadav, said that they made the crust from scratch from carefully selected wheat. Next came offerings from the Dosa Company that included Mutton Keema Dosa and Chicken Keema Dosa. The dosas, served with three kinds of chutneys, were too spicy for me, and telling the chef beforehand to reduce the spice level will help. Next came the chicken wings which were succulent and perfectly spiced. This place is that it has a Fish and Chips outlet. The star of the continental fare, however, was the Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, the fish melted in gooey goodness in the mouth.It was the time for main course and pasta. The Pasta Alfredo was creamy and loaded with crunchy vegetables. If you are looking for something pakka local, then go for the Sambar Rice Bowl or the Telangana Chicken Bowl from the Good Bowl. They serve dosas and vadas too with Telangana chicken curry. The sambar and chicken curry tasted authentic and was food for the soul. The second best part about this drive-in is that the popular Punjabi food outlet, Punjabi Affair, has a branch here.For desserts, we were served fruit frosties which use real fruit and no flavours. Muskmelon, sitaphal, jamun were delicious. kakoli_mukherjee@newindianexpress.com @KakoliMukherje2"

Excerpts from his interview with Rajesh Kumar Thakur:Your government at the Centre faces sharp criticism on its failure to create jobs. How far is it justified?It is far from the truth. You can counter facts, not lies. Over one crore new jobs have been created through entrepreneurship, and by filling earmarked vacancies. The opposition has nothing to show on this count versus what NDA has done in just five years as opposed to its 60.Today, over 14 lakh youth get financial support under the PM Mudra Scheme and more than 6.5 lakh youth have jobs in 268 new IT companies. In Bihar alone, 11 BPOs have been set up at Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya, in which 2,210 youths are employed.What difference can you claim between India of 2019 and India of 1990?The years before NDA were periods of scams. Today India is skilling and confident, whether in science, defence, space, economy or human development. Today, the world listens to us. Earlier, we listened to the world. Then India was demoralised; today, India has the guts to claim its space.Then, India was practising mass defecation; today 5.5 lakh villages have 10 crore toilets built under the Swacch Bharat Yojana, the PMs revolutionary step, which today China is emulating.FOLLOW OUR FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HERETo sum up: Congress stands for Corruption, Compromise, Concessions. BJP is Bharatiya Jan ka Pride and NDA is short for National Development Assured. This poll is about mature vs immature, hope vs regret. Choice is yours.Has acceptance of NDA, especially BJP, in electoral preferences in south India increased, including Kerala, where Congress president Rahul Gandhi is trying to consolidate?Rahul Gandhi, by opting for Wayanad in Kerala, has shown himself up as an escapist with no regard to nationalism, or vision to make the nation vibrant. He says his is a gesture to show that India is one.Have there ever been two Indias? He is, in fact, playing with the political culture of South India, sensing imminent defeat in Amethi.The NDA remains the only hope for Indians, whether in the south, north, or the Middle-East. When the masses come alive, politicians like Rahul Gandhi or any other, get kicked out. Tour across South India, including Kerala, and you will find out how the BJP has gained mass acceptance and is emerging as a strong alternative to non-BJP governments.In Tamil Nadu, there are today several parties ready to accept us as valued allies.The Congress has offered a lot of sops in its poll manifesto, including Rs 72,000 per year to the poorest. How do you take all this?You have to see the Congress manifesto in a larger perspective. Its a document to break India. It is a conspiracy to weaken the morale of Indias armed forces by proposing a review of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). The promise to provide Rs 72,000 is nothing but a lie and designed to lure and befool the people. They have questioned the air strike, surgical strike and the Rafale deal.As far as Rahul Gandhis promises are concerned, his political maturity has now become a laughing stock globally from his twinkling eye in Parliament and his promise of producing gold from potatoes. His only support that remains is his sister Priyanka.He has become a liability to his own party, which lacks the guts to challenge family dominance  the same as it is with the RJD in Bihar.What would be the contribution of Bihars NDA to your national tally?Bihar will set a new narrative with a clean sweep of 40 seats. Wheres the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance)? The NDA in Bihar has set a new benchmark for development in a successful alliance between Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar. Its about development vs opportunism.As MP-in-contest from Patna Sahib, how do you see the legacy of Shatrughan Sinha, the preceding BJP candidate?Apparently, voters want more development. They are not dissatisfied with works done by the state and the Centre but they deserve more facilities like educational institutions, business points, areas wise development, transportation and modern civic amenities. I aspire to make Patna Sahib a model constituency since I am a son of the soil.How will the election pan out for the NDA?Historic and world-rocking together! On May 23, nationalism will win, while politics of appeasements will be doomed forever. There is no alternative to the NDA. We will win 400 seats. Its Modi hai toh mumkin hai. (With Modi, anything is possible)."

2019-04-07,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-lone-female-snatcher/story-HIkRQDxnrFnqktWK1w3RSM.html,Delhi's lone female snatcher,"In a mans world of bike snatchers in Delhi, she is the odd woman out.Dressed as a man in a pair of jeans, shirt tucked out of her waist, her face covered with a helmet, 32-year-old Ramanjeet Kaur, alias Rinkle, rides pillion on a motorcycle and snatches cell phones, jewellery, and handbags for a living.Rinkle, a mother of three, features in the list of bad characters at the Nangloi police station. A bad character, according to police records, is a person with multiple criminal cases whose activities must be monitored because he or she is a threat to law and order.Last month, Rinkle was arrested for the third time in her life. She had on March 8 rode pillion and dragged a middle-aged woman, who refused to let go of the bag she had tried to snatch, for more than 100 metres on a busy west Delhi road. Rinkle is back in prison, jail number 6, the same place from where she was released a year ago.Police officers, who have interrogated her all these years, describe her in various ways  a woman with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, a ruthless criminal, a kleptomaniac. They describe her differently; see her differently, but agree on one fact  Rinkle is getting violent by the year. This means trouble for her and the police.In January 2018, Rinkle  who police falsely believed had quit her criminal ways  attacked a woman in west Delhis Kirti Nagar when the woman resisted a snatching attempt. According to the womans complaint, she was assaulted, dragged and left bleeding on the ground.Rinkle is a habitual snatcher but she wasnt violent. Of late, she has started attacking her victims if they resist. This is scary. She takes the help of other criminals to commit the crimes, an officer said, adding this time Rinkles partner-in-crime was a man named Ramneek Singh, 24. Singh has cases of assault, robbery, and possessing illegal weapons.The beginningHad it not been for her younger brothers friendship with a local criminal, Rinkle, maybe, would have never had a police record. She would always be Ramanjeet Kaur, a wife, a mother, carpenter and a homemakers daughter. Rinkle had studied at a government school in west Delhis Chander Vihar where she lived. She dropped out of Class 10. Friends and distant relatives of Chander Vihar, who have known her, say that around 2012, her brother Romi had become friends with Jagga alias Jagjeet, 35, a man with over 40 criminal cases such as murder, snatching, robbery.One of the distant relatives, who refused to be identified, said,Romi did drugs and committed snatching crimes with Jagga. They were friends. Jagga was a regular at Rinkles house. We came to know much later he had fallen in love with her. Rinkle was already married with her childhood love Tejender. Jagga was so smitten by her that to date, he has never married.Maybe it was Jaggas flashy lifestyle that lured her to crime and gave her a new life. Rinkle knew how to ride. Her father, Kuldip, had even bought her a scooter. Unlike her elder sister, she loved riding and speeding. Jagga was what she needed. A smitten Jagga gave her wings. They started in late 2012. Jagga, a veteran with over 40 cases, had offered Rinkle a part of his stolen earnings.I hired her because she is a woman and having a woman in the gang is beneficial. There is no chance of doubt and they commit the crime easily, his confession in police records read.Police records show Jagga and Rinkle were neighbours in Chander Vihar and operated across the city. Their crimes  Delhis own Bonnie and Clyde  were reported from Vikaspuri in west Delhi to Laxmi Nagar in east Delhi; Greater Kailash in south Delhi to Connaught Place in the heart of the city.A crime dossier, prepared by crime branch, shows they were first arrested in east Delhis Krishna Nagar on March 14, 2014. On a stolen bike, the two were fleeing after a snatching spree . That evening, Rinkles name was etched in police records for the first time.A Chander Vihar resident, who claimed he was friends with Ramanjeet before she became Rinkle, said, Within months of her arrest, her husband Tejender was also arrested for murder. He had murdered a man after a drunken brawl and dumped the body in Sonepat. Their three kids were like orphans. Their grandmother came to take care of them. After two months, on May 30 that year, Rinkle was out on bail. We thought she would mend her ways but it did not happen. She found other partners to help her in the crime.Ramneek Singh, arrested in the latest case with Rinkle, told police that he too was in love with her. With Jagga, tagged as Rinkles partner-in-crime, in police files, she needed a new man. The Chander Vihar resident said that around mid-2017, Rinkle found the perfect guy  a local biker, who loved performing stunts on bikes and was often spotted at India Gate C Hexagon. Ramneek was just her man.Inspector Jai Prakash, who arrested the two, said, Rinkle became friends with Ramneek. Initially, she asked him if he could snatch potatoes from local shops while riding. Next, she asked him to snatch apples. It graduated to iPhones, jewellery and hand bags.In January last year, when the two were first arrested, police had found evidence of their involvement in nine cases of robbery. Between 2017 and 2018, they may possibly have been involved in over a 100 cases.WONT DO IT AGAINAt 32, Rinkle has 25 known criminal cases against her  and these are only the cases in which police have found evidence and pinned her involvement. The actual number of cases could be too many. All the cases are in the trial stage.The annual crime data shows there are over 8,000 snatching cases every year in the national Capital. With a strength of a little over 80,000 personnel for a population of 1.98 crore residents  half the force are on traffic or security duties  most cases remain unsolved in the city. Only 56% of the snatching cases were solved last year.Using this to their advantage, Rinkle and her partners made a killing by snatching for a living. An officer who had arrested Rinkle in 2018 said that the woman had even bought a house in Nangloi for Rs 25 lakh in 2017.A stolen iPhone that costs about 75,000 is sold for anywhere between 15,000-20,000 in the black market. A phone that costs around 20,000 is sold for about 5,000. There is no dearth of goldsmiths who take seconds to melt stolen gold chains and burn every bit of evidence of the crime. Rinkle told police she loved gold chains but has never worn a single piece of gold or diamond she has snatched.Last month, they had made the mistake of throwing a stolen handbag in the bushes, instead of burning it. Police found the bag and used it as an evidence against her and Ramneek.Last month, after her arrest, inside the operations cell of the west district, Rinkle cried. She said she would not do it again.Was it acting or was she indeed repenting? None of the police officers around her could say with conviction.An officer, who was at the office, said Rinkle defended her actions and came up with different reasons as to why she had become a criminal. She said she was obsessed with snatching hand bags. To another officer, she said she needed money to repay a debt. Next, she said the business is good  the lax laws help so she would not mind spending a few days in jail. Last year, she spent less than a month in prison.Delhi police have written to the government to amend anti-snatching laws to ensure harsher punishment and difficult bail provisions. More than two years later, the file is gathering dust.Police are unsure for how long Rinkle will be in prison this time. Her family refused to talk to HT. Locals said her mother is taking care of Rinkles kids.This isnt Rinkles first time in prison. But most of the locals and the police personnel are certain that it most definitely wont be her last. In 2016, the then lieutenant governor had signed an externment order barring Rinkle from living within Delhi for at least two years. Not many women get this sort of punishment. In banishment, Rinkle lived in Sonepat. She returned to Delhi after two years. Nothing has changed except she became more violent and desperate.First Published: Apr 07, 2019 03:58 IST"
2019-04-07,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-eat-lancet-commission-s-diet-plan-will-reduce-both-hunger-and-obesity/story-1RhhFiG2rYuTmo4zebQMhO.html,The EAT-Lancet commission's diet plan will reduce both hunger and obesity,"The worlds menu needs a drastic overhaul. At least 820 million people going hungry worldwide and close to two billion eating too much of the wrong food have made unhealthy diets a bigger cause of death and disease than unsafe sex, drugs, alcohol and tobacco use combined. As human diets are inextricably linked to health and environmental sustainability, the EAT-Lancet Commission has put together the first scientific evidence on a diet plan that meets the nutritional requirements of a 10 billion and growing population by 2050 while staying within a sustainable food production system that does not harm the planet.Compared with currently popular diets, the global adoption of the new recommendations requires the world to halve its consumption of red meat and sugar and increase nuts, fruits, vegetables, and legumes intake at least two-fold. As countries in North America eat almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, and countries in South Asia, including India, eat less than half the amount, these food targets will need to be applied locally. All countries are eating more starchy vegetables such as potatoes and cassava than recommended, with intake ranging from between 1.5 times above the recommendation in South Asia and by 7.5 times in sub-Saharan Africa.Along with a transformation in eating habits, the immediate challenge is to develop sustainable food systems by improving food production and reducing food waste. India is the second-largest grower of fruits and vegetables globally. It produces 97 million metric tonnes of fruits and 179.69 metric tonnes of vegetables, but around 40% of vegetables produced are wasted. Reviving traditional diets and promoting local produce and improving the cold chain, including storage, transport and processing are essential for the optimal use of produce. Agriculture must be refocused to produce varied nutrient-rich crops. Introducing policies to encourage people to choose healthy food, including improving availability through improved logistics and storage, moving from high volumes of crops to producing varied nutrient-rich crops, localising produce, and halving food waste are key issues that need to be addressed to make both sustainable nutrition possible and reduce hunger and obesity.First Published: Apr 07, 2019 14:09 IST"

No employment was generated and false claims were made that the countrys border was safe because of the BJP government. In fact, the jawans (soldiers), who are the sons of kisans (farmers), are guarding the border, he said.Akhilesh said it was during the tenure of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav as defence minister, that best fighter planes were purchased for the Indian Air Force.India will have to face both Pakistan and China if a war breaks out, he said, alleging that it was Chinese missile that had brought down Indian MIG recently.The Prime Minister claims that he belongs to the backward community but should tell the people why the chief ministers house was washed when I vacated it and Yogi Adityanath came in. We want to know what was going on in Yogis mind, he said.Akhilesh said the country did not need bullet train but bullet proof jackets for soldiers.In his 45-minute address, he said the BJP was trying to fool the voters by promising New India and added that the grand alliance would make sure that the nation gets a new prime minister.He alleged that animal slaughter had increased in the BJP regime.Addressing the people in potato belt, Akhilesh raised the farmers issues and the problem of stray cattle damaging their crops.Questioning the Congresss promise of giving Rs 6,000 per month to the poor, Akhilesh asked as to what would happen to funds allocated for other schemes.There is no difference between the toilets promised by the Congress and the BJP. Both the parties also failed to make arrangement for water, he said.Reiterating his stand on reservation, Akhilesh advocated caste-based Census and provision of opportunities accordingly. He added that the dhangar community would be given the status of Scheduled Caste if the alliance was voted to power.Various leaders of Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal attended the rally but no one from the family of Ramveer Upadhaya, a prominent BSP leader of area, was present.First Published: Apr 10, 2019 09:10 IST"

From being an aspiring architect and nailing her gardening passion with her entrepreneurial skills to penning down her planting knowledge through her blogs, Goradia shares her unique agendas where she believes sustainability is life and how adoption is better than ownership.Earning her passion towards greens from Oliver Jamie, Goradia began her tryst with gardening eight years ago and since then nature has been her key to healing. When I was a kid, I observed how my grandmom would take care of her plants. Each attempt to help or give advice had her telling me to do what I want when I grow my own garden! Today, I understand why she said that, recalled Goradia, adding that nature has always been a healer.Over the years, she was able to amass immense knowledge about gardening. Her first piece of advice would always be to leave plants alone as they know how to grow naturally, and often help each other multiply. Her garden comprises strawberries, yellow cherry tomatoes, Italian and Thai basil, sage and brinjals.The list doesnt end here since she has also adopted land for okras, sweet potatoes, onions, broad beans, Malabar spinach, snake gourd, amaranth, radishes, papayas and pumpkins. Mangoes will make an appearance too, she adds.Gardening helped Goradia discover other passions as well, which has been a life-changing experience for her. I started writing about it, experimented with the greens and have had the honour to present a lecture on it.It has been a happy and blissful journey that has healed and empowered me, she said.Before signing off, she adds that one must try growing their own food.

2019-04-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farm-mechanisation-tractors-equipments-when-the-field-is-level-5669445/,Farm mechanisation: When the field is level,"Dinesh Singh Saini has 16 bigha (3.33 acres; one acre=4.8 bigha), of which 2 bigha is dedicated to growing wheat only for self-consumption. On the remaining land, he cultivates vegetables, mainly cauliflower (10 bigha) and tomato (4 bigha).AdvertisingThis farmer, like many in Raghunathpur village in Hapur district and tehsil of western Uttar Pradesh, deploys a laser land leveler  computer manjha, in local parlance  on his field once every two years.Isse paani ki bachat hai aur paidavar bhi zyaada hai (it saves water and also boosts yields), says Saini about this machine that uses guided laser beam technology, as against conventional bullock/tractor-drawn iron scrappers or wooden planks, for smoothening and leveling of the soil surface prior to sowing.ALSO READ | Cane payment arrears could hurt the BJPs prospects in Maharashtra as much as in Uttar PradeshAdvertisingThe Spectra Precision manjha operating on his field basically comprises a laser emitter (fixed on a tripod stand just outside the field that is to be leveled), receiver (mounted on a mast attached to a tractor-drawn bucket with a scraper blade) and control box (fitted on the tractor). The emitter continuously sends out an infrared beam that can travel up to 600 meters radius in a perfectly straight line parallel to the required field plane. The receiver picks up the beam and converts it into an electrical signal for transmission to the control box. The control box, in turn, activates a valve that regulates the flow of oil from the tractors pump to the hydraulic cylinder to raise and lower the bucket/ scraper. The scraper guidance is automatic, with the raising and lowering of the blade (which cuts and fills the soil to achieve the desired leveling) simply following the laser beam.ALSO READ | Bonus for wheat could become major election campaign issue in Madhya PradeshWith manjha, the water reaches all parts of my field and I can irrigate 2 bigha in one hour, which otherwise (in unleveled land) takes 1.5 or even two hours. My gobi (cauliflower) yield, too, has doubled from 40-50 panni (polythene bags of 18 kg each) to 80-100 panni per bigha, while rising from 80-90 crates (of 25 kg each) to 100-150 crates per bigha for tamatar (tomato). This is due to more uniform distribution of water as well as placement of fertiliser and seed. The result is better germination and growth of plants, which are also of the same size in a leveled field, claims Saini, who sows his cauliflower and tomato nurseries in July, followed by transplanting in August. Cauliflower is harvested during November-December and tomato over November-February. He further sows lobiya (cowpea) in March-April for harvesting in May-June.Saini does not own the manjha, which does 3-4 bigha in an hour. He has hired the Spectra Precision laser leveler from Akash Sharma, who charges an hourly rate of Rs 650-700. The 20-year-old Sharma, a fresh commerce graduate from the nearby IMIT College in Hapur, is a farmer himself. His father Shivnath and he cultivate paddy-wheat on 20 out of their 35-bigha holding. On the balance 15 bigha, they take tomatoes and fodder maize (planted in March for harvesting in 60-70 days).We earn more from hiring of machinery than farming now, states Sharma, who bought the manjha for Rs 2.90 lakh a year ago. He has also invested Rs 22,000 in a cultivator (used for seedbed preparation) and Rs 1.06 lakh in a rotavator (for more heavy-duty tillage). All these equipment are powered by a 58-horsepower Sonalika tractor costing him Rs 7.22 lakh.My tractor runs for 1,000 hours in a year, of which only 100 hours is for our use and the rest on other farmers fields. The cultivator can cover roughly 14 bigha per hour and I charge a rate of Rs 100/bigha, with these at 8-9 bigha and Rs 160/bigha for the rotavator, explains Sharma.Sharmas laser leveler is operated for over 600 hours annually, much of it from end-February (just after harvesting of potato) to mid-July (before the monsoon rains). I do almost 500 hours during this period and another 100-125 hours from end-October to end-November (between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing). My income (at Rs 650-700/hour) comes to Rs 4-4.2 lakh, while the major expenses are on diesel (Rs 1.6 lakh for 4 litres/hour at Rs 66.5/litre) and labour (Rs 60,000, if hired for 150 days at Rs 400/day). Even after repair and maintenance, I make decent money, he adds.Manjeet Singh of Davinder Agriculture Works, a farm equipment dealer here, estimates that Hapur district alone has some 1,500 laser levelers. 70 per cent of farmers in Raghunathpur, which has 5,200 bigha of agricultural land, are using these in their fields. This village has two levelers (the other one belongs to Sharmas fathers brother Moolesh) and they cater to its entire requirement. Custom hiring has allowed even farmers with 10 bigha (2 acres) to level their lands once in two years. They are fully aware of the benefits from it, he points out.According to Rajan Aiyer, managing director of Trimble India Pvt. Ltd  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the California-based Trimble Inc, which sells Spectra Precision laser levelers  the market for precision agriculture equipment is expanding fast. We were the first to introduce land levelers in the country, for research trials in 2001-02 and commercial sales in 2004-05. There would be 1,00,000-1,25,000 levelers in Indian fields today, with a few hundreds of thousands acres of land being leveled every year, mostly in Punjab, Haryana and western UP, he notes.Apart from Spectra Precision, major laser leveler brands selling in India include Leica, Topcon, Moba and assorted Chinese makes."
2019-04-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farm-mechanisation-tractors-equipments-when-the-field-is-level-5669445/,Farm mechanisation: When the field is level,"Dinesh Singh Saini has 16 bigha (3.33 acres; one acre=4.8 bigha), of which 2 bigha is dedicated to growing wheat only for self-consumption. On the remaining land, he cultivates vegetables, mainly cauliflower (10 bigha) and tomato (4 bigha).AdvertisingThis farmer, like many in Raghunathpur village in Hapur district and tehsil of western Uttar Pradesh, deploys a laser land leveler  computer manjha, in local parlance  on his field once every two years.Isse paani ki bachat hai aur paidavar bhi zyaada hai (it saves water and also boosts yields), says Saini about this machine that uses guided laser beam technology, as against conventional bullock/tractor-drawn iron scrappers or wooden planks, for smoothening and leveling of the soil surface prior to sowing.ALSO READ | Cane payment arrears could hurt the BJPs prospects in Maharashtra as much as in Uttar PradeshAdvertisingThe Spectra Precision manjha operating on his field basically comprises a laser emitter (fixed on a tripod stand just outside the field that is to be leveled), receiver (mounted on a mast attached to a tractor-drawn bucket with a scraper blade) and control box (fitted on the tractor). The emitter continuously sends out an infrared beam that can travel up to 600 meters radius in a perfectly straight line parallel to the required field plane. The receiver picks up the beam and converts it into an electrical signal for transmission to the control box. The control box, in turn, activates a valve that regulates the flow of oil from the tractors pump to the hydraulic cylinder to raise and lower the bucket/ scraper. The scraper guidance is automatic, with the raising and lowering of the blade (which cuts and fills the soil to achieve the desired leveling) simply following the laser beam.ALSO READ | Bonus for wheat could become major election campaign issue in Madhya PradeshWith manjha, the water reaches all parts of my field and I can irrigate 2 bigha in one hour, which otherwise (in unleveled land) takes 1.5 or even two hours. My gobi (cauliflower) yield, too, has doubled from 40-50 panni (polythene bags of 18 kg each) to 80-100 panni per bigha, while rising from 80-90 crates (of 25 kg each) to 100-150 crates per bigha for tamatar (tomato). This is due to more uniform distribution of water as well as placement of fertiliser and seed. The result is better germination and growth of plants, which are also of the same size in a leveled field, claims Saini, who sows his cauliflower and tomato nurseries in July, followed by transplanting in August.

2019-04-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/at-a-ballygunge-restaurant-before-bengali-new-year/article26823563.ece,"At a Ballygunge restaurant, before Bengali New Year","When in Rome, do as the Romans do. And when in Kolkata, do as the Bengalis do  eat. With that philosophy guiding me, I landed up at a restaurant that friends had been talking about when I reached the city. The restaurant, called Ekdalia Rd, is at (no prizes there!) 1, Ekdalia Road. The road is in Ballygunge, in the heart of the city.Its a small restaurant, but doing brisk business. I was there, with friends and family, early for lunch, but by the time we were done, the place was buzzing. The eatery is open from the morning, as it does breakfast as well (with eggs, sandwiches, bacon, pancakes).Though I always get waylaid by bacon, I focused on the main menu, and decided that I would bravely look past it and order a grilled chicken. I opted for the chimichurri sauce  which is a South American mix that I am fond of. We also ordered the polo olives, crunchy raw papaya salad, grilled pork chops, and crispy pork.The reactions at the table were mixed. The polo olives ( 299) turned out to be fresh olives wrapped with chicken, and grilled. We found them a bit too dry. We couldnt taste the olive in those small chicken balls. The green papaya salad ( 99) was crunchy, mildly tart and light. Two others friends shared the crispy pork  sliced pork coated with Panko and fried ( 259)  but were disappointed. The meat wasnt crispy enough.When the grilled chop ( 349) was brought to the table, I couldnt not look at it. It was glistening with bits of fat, just the way it should be, and a brown sauce winked alluringly at me. The slow-cooked pork chops came with herbed rice and mashed potatoes. The chop was superbly juicy, with a buttery demi-glace that added to the taste. I confess: I had a small bite of it, ignoring my docs no-no.I was also very happy with my dish: a succulent spring chicken ( 329). The breast piece came with the delightful sauce prepared with some herbs (a lot of parsley), garlic, olive oil and red-wine vinegar. The chicken was juicy, and the sauce gave it the flavours it needed. It came with some crunchy (and very healthy, if I may add) black rice and sauted veggies.The restaurant is run by a former IT man called Surojit Rout, who followed his passion for food to set up this restaurant. He is now also running a quick-service outlet called Ekdalia Express at Patuli. I am told there is on offer a delicious marmalade. We had Routs beet jam, which was superb  sweet without being cloying, mildly tart.In the run-up to the Bengali New Year, and during the festive season  the restaurant will offer a Firinghee Thala in collaboration with (my friend) Pritha Sen, who is not just a food historian but a great cook. The non-veg thali has delicacies like topshe maach fried, Armenian khichuri, cabbage keema dolma and murgh makallach (Yehudi murghi). The vegetarian platter includes eggplant cutlet curry, pumpkin foogath, Colonel Skinners chutney, and spinach cheese kofta curry. Let the New Year be full of food  and happy!"

What tilts the scales in U.P.?,"Manu Sakya and Chandrabhan Singh live over 300 km apart. While Mr. Sakya repairs electronics in the Eidgah locality of Agra, Mr. Singh runs a small grocery store in Mohanlalganj, the rural Lok Sabha constituency in Lucknow. Mr. Singh is an upper caste Thakur, while Mr. Sakya is a Kori, a Dalit caste traditionally associated with weaving.But when it comes to making an electoral choice this summer, the two men are thinking along similar lines, converging on one factor, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is still the main vote catcher for the BJP in this crucial State.Mr. Modi is compensating for the anti-incumbency factor faced by the local BJP MPs. In Mr. Singhs case, it is Kaushal Kishore, who has been fielded again. After winning, not once did he visit us. But since my vote is in favour of Modiji, I will vote for Kaushal, Mr. Singh says.Listing the PM-KISAN scheme, new toilets and power and gas connections, Mr. Singh says the work done in the past five years has been unprecedented.In Agra, Mr. Sakya rates poorly the tenure of Ram Shankar Katheira, MP, who has been shifted to Etawah this year, and is equally angry with the local BJP MLA, Giriraj Dharmesh.He lists spiralling power bills, the GST and demonetisation as reasons that pushed back the informal economy and is worried by unemployment rates. But even he wants to give Mr. Modi another chance, saying only he can bring a better future for the country, and lauds the PM for the Balakot air strike and bringing back the Indian Air Force pilot.A similar sentiment is shared in a residential colony some distance away. Mahendra Kumar Prajapati and his neighbours say despite submitting several applications to the MP over the past five years, nothing has been done about the overflowing drains and broken paths in their colony, mostly housing OBC and Dalits.But the anti-incumbency factor doesnt stick on Mr. Modi. He is good and fit to be PM again. Those at the lower level are not doing their duties properly, Mr. Prajapati says.As one travels west from Lucknow, through Firozabad, Agra, Mathura and beyond, the consolidation of the votes of the SP-BSP-RLD is perceptible, posing a huge challenge for the BJP.Anecdotal evidence suggests that the fascination for Mr. Modi has reduced since then, as more critical voices appear especially among farmers and jobless youth.But the PM is still the single biggest attraction for BJP voters, who were found overlooking anti-incumbency against the sitting MPs and the State government.This is clearest in Mathura, where the BJPs Hema Malini faces heavy anti-incumbency.While a fair number of voters here, particularly Jats and Thakurs, are seen split between the BJP and the RLD, which has fielded a Thakur, those still supporting the BJP are mostly doing so due to Mr. Modis appeal.Mandhata Singh, a Thakur teacher, is angry with the Yogi Adityanath government for stopping the honorarium for teachers started under the SP rule. But he is willing to digest that for national interest.Modi has raised Indias stature at the global level. Under him, we are not indebted to any country, he says. He is voting for Ms. Malini, a Jat, despite the RLD fielding a prominent Thakur, Narendra Singh.Bachu Singh, a Jat farmer who mostly grows potatoes and wheat, admits that the promises made by the Modi government have not been fulfilled.He scoffs at the claims of farmers income being doubled and points out that the costs of farming and diesel prices have shot up while selling the crops has become more difficult than before. A 45-kg bag of urea is now sold at the price of a 50-kg bag, he rues.Despite all this, Mr. Bachu, who associates himself with the RSS, says he will vote for Mr. Modi.

The three-time former MP speaks to Pushkar Banakar about his chances in the upcoming elections in the city of the Taj Mahal.There have been reports of infighting in the BJP with incumbent MP Katheria being shifted to Etawah. Has this affected your chances?Elections are won by peoples votes. I have done so much for the people of Agra in the past that there is no chance of me losing. I will win with a big majority. I have been staying in Agra for the past 15 years and I will be rewarded for my good work.The SP and BSP have formed an alliance. Has this made it tougher for you to convince people to vote for you?Who are the candidates against me? People do not know them. My work will give me a victory. No alliance can stop the BJP from winning. Also, a credible leader like Narendra Modi only enhances our chances.FOLLOW OUR FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HEREThe BJP is seen as an anti-Muslim party.

My victory will only dispel the myth that the BJP is an anti-Muslim party.What steps have you taken to ensure that farmers dont turn against BJP?This stretch has a lot of potato farmers.

2019-04-13,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/beyond-insects-ferments-and-bhoot-jholokia/article26826864.ece,Beyond insects  ferments and bhoot jholokia,"Insects, fermented flavours, visions of TV show hosts scarfing down bhoot jolokia like marathoners. Just mention Assamese cuisine and some might even shudder a little or shy away because it has been made to sound so exotic or even intimidating. But it isnt. These are all myths that have been propagated to create TRPs for TV shows and social media. Some of these myths were busted for me by Kashmiri Barkakati Nath, exactly a year ago when she hosted her first Assamese pop-up in the city. Mumbaikars now have a chance to bust some myths about the States food too, with the self-taught proponent of Assamese cuisine, Nath coming from Guwahati with a host of traditional ingredients, her passion and a deep desire to showcase these gastronomical delights.The first thing Nath said to me when we met then was, I do not do tribal cuisine. She was visibly pained when talking about incorrect perceptions of Assamese cuisine. Momos, crickets worms. these are not representative of our food. I want to showcase regular Oxomiya (Assamese) food to the world. I remember identifying with her at the time. I was similarly upset when a popular TV show showcased kandalee or bichughaas (stinging nettle) as a sensational food in its episode on Garhwali cuisine. Yes, it is eaten and is quite tasty (it was a traditional foraged food used to supplement the diet), but only if found it by the wayside on the way home, is one inclined to risk being stung to harvest and cook it. Is it representative of vegetable preparations on the Gahrwali thali? Not by a long shot.While elements like insects, ferments, bhoot jholokia exist in Assamese food, they arent representative of the cuisine on the whole. These elements exist as part of tribal diets in Assam, but 80% of Assamese society is non-tribal. And just like every cuisine in the world, Assams food culture is a confluence of many factors and has many local regional variations.Assam is rich in local flora and fauna and has evolved its own signature flavour profile based on the climate and topography. Our diet is local and seasonal and has evolved to make the most of what we have available. We eat many traditional varieties of rice, as it is, or made into a variety of pithas accompanied but many subtly spiced curries, gravies and condiments, elaborates Nath. Predominantly rice based, Assamese cuisine is full of subtle flavours and delicate accents. Although perceived as meat centric, and associated strongly with pork, Assamese food is more nuanced. With rivers such as the Brahmaputra and its tributaries flowing through and almost every home boasting a pond, fish is much loved and eaten with relish. Being rich in local produce all year round, owing to abundant rain  vegetable dishes are cooked in a variety of ways to supplement meals. Pork has only became popular over the last 20 years or so. Meat is reserved for special occasions and festivals. Even though it is in India and the bhoot jholokia grows in Assam, our food is not spicy at all. We do not use many spices. Our dals and curries are mildly and delicately seasoned. We also use a lot of souring agents. Our hot and humid climate, has resulted in consumption of souring agents that have a cooling effect on the body. We also eat a lot of fermented foods, shares Nath.Local food, global twistNath has hosted Assamese food festivals and cooked for visiting dignitaries and celebrities. Shes also a permanent jury member for the Guwahati Food Awards while doubling up as a menu consultant for the Taj Group in Guwahati. Having been mentored by legendary cooks from tea estates, Nath has gained a deep understanding of the varied nuances of Assamese cuisine including the Ahom, South East Asian, and Colonial influences that blended with local techniques and ingredients to create Assamese cuisine.The Unsavoured Assam pop-up that Nath is hosting in the city currently showcases this. In honour of Rongali Bihu, a festival that marks the advent of the spring and is celebrated to welcome the Hindu New Year, Nath has included Bihu festive dishes as well as classic Assamese cuisine. Traditional ingredients and dishes are treated with delicacy and beautifully presented in more modern formats. Take the appetisers for example, Starters are Western concepts, Nath says, But I believe that a food must evolve and stay rooted in traditions at the same time. Its a process that has resulted in a thoughtful menu that caters to the vegetarian and non-vegetarian palate.Eat AssameseWhats on the menu, then? Theres Luchi, Guti Aloo and the flavourful Bilahi Ambol, ( an appetiser of s mall puffed puris topped with Assamese baby potatoes and sweet tomato chutney). Then theres the soul satisfying anguli pitha. Inspired by the traditional one-bowl dish of hand rolled rice flour dumplings, Naths version is rich in taste and texture, tossed in a piquant tomato sauce. Other unforgettable dishes included Maas Khorika Aru Kharoli (chunks of fish smoked and served with fermented mustard chutney), and the Haanh Kumura which is duck slow-simmered with ash gourd until its falling off the bone.Also included Bihu specials like Til Diya Chicken ( chicken in black sesame seed), the Pani Pitha Aru Bengena Pura , Jolphai Meetha Chutney (bite-sized rice flour pancakes with smoked eggplant and a sweet olive chutney), the Bhaat Kerala Bor Aamor Chutney (stuffed teasel gourd fritters with spicy sweet mango chutney). Desserts include Kola Bora Sawalor paiyox (black rice kheer) and Kumal Sawal, Doi and Gur (rice with yogurt and jaggery).An Assamese cooking class featuring dishes from the pop-up will take place at APB Cook Studio on April 17; call 42152799. The pop-up is ongoing at Mustard, Atria Mall; 67363338"

I have asked for an immediate inquiry & increased security for the people. Prayers go to the families of the victims & for early recovery of the injured.At the site of the blast, DIG Quetta Abdul Razzaq Cheema told the media that every day, people from the Hazara community come to this market from Hazara Town to buy groceries. Police and Frontier Corps personnel escort them and take them back as well. On Friday, there were 11 vehicles and 55 people in that convoy. To a question whether the Hazara community members were the targets, Mr. Cheema said that while the Hazaras have been targeted in the past, this market place has people from other ethnic communities as well.According to the police, the explosive was hidden inside a potato sack at a vegetable shop, while Balochistan Home Minister Ziaullah Langove said in a press conference that it was a suicide attack. Mr. Langove added that the attack did not target any specific community.The Hazara community in Quetta has been a target of terrorist attacks for more than a decade.Advocate Jalila Haider, a woman lawyer from the community, believes that while people from other communities died in the attack as well, the real target was the Hazaras. I am so disappointed and hurt right now. The Army chief assured us [Hazaras] that our community will be safe after the last attack. This attack challenges his promise as well, Ms. Haider told The Hindu .Saroop Ijaz, a lawyer who works for the Human Rights Watch in Pakistan, told The Hindu that the attack highlights the need to take prompt, effective and rights-respecting measures by bringing the perpetrators to justice. Many of the victims are from the already persecuted Hazaras. Prime Minister Imran Khan has rightly expressed the commitment that militant outfits targeting civilians and security officials will be held accountable and this attack should be treated as a test case, added Mr. Ijaz."

Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, said prices of all the green vegetables have shot up in the last few days. For instance, beans sells at Rs. 100 a kg in the wholesale market and bitter gourd at Rs. 30 a kg on Saturday. Carrot is sold at Rs. 50 a kg and ginger at Rs. 80 a kg, he added.Most of the vegetables come to Coimbatore from Karnataka all through the year. There is a drop in supply of some of the varieties because of summer and there is no rain in the cultivating areas. These vegetables cannot be stocked for long.The public do not feel the impact of the hike as prices of onions and potatoes are normal. Big onion, which comes from Maharashtra, is sold at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a kg, small onion at Rs. 22 a kg, tomato at Rs. 25 a kg, and potato at Rs. 22 a kg.However, prices of other vegetables are very high. The rain is expected only in June and the prices may go up further in the coming weeks, he said."

Their victory will be a befitting reply to the gag order, he said to loud cheer.Mr. Mishra described the gag order as anti-Dalit and unconstitutional. He said the EC did not look at the speech in its entirety where Behenji was appealing to the sarvajan (people) not to allow their vote to be divided on the basis of caste and religion.Instead, he said, they chose to focus on a minor portion of the speech. The EC didnt take note of how the Prime Minister and Amit Shah are dividing people in the name of religion, he alleged.He said that according to the Jammu & Kashmir Governor, the Pulwama attack was because of intelligence failure.Instead of taking responsibility for the failure, the Prime Minister is shedding crocodile tears for the martyrs.Coming down heavily on the EC, Mr. Yadav said the voice of the poor cant be throttled and when it will speak through machines (EVMs), our rivals will be silenced.He said Ms. Mayawati lived in the hearts of the masses and nobody could take her out from there.Mr. Singh said the so-called 56-inch chest of Mr. Modi did not have a heart with even a single inch of space for the minorities and the dispossessed. He is the chowkidar of the 1% rich of the country.He appealed to the crowd not to watch television till the last phase of voting.The news channels are not telling you how the crowd is receding in his rallies and increasing in mahagathbandhan rallies.In the rural belt, the potato farmers are in distress. Mr. Yadav raised their concern during his speech. The farmers didnt get the right price of their crop and it rotted in cold storage. He called it an impact of notebandi (demonetisation) which could only be avenged by votebandi (by not voting for BJP). Referring to the footwear industry, Mr Yadav said that the BJP was doing politics over animals and brought religion even in the occupation of people.Many see Mr. Anand as the successor of Ms Mayawati. Naresh Gautam, BSP Coordinator, western Uttar Pradesh said these are early days but there is a wave of happiness in the party."

The two-hour delay did not deter the enthusiasm as the local people, mostly Thakurs, rushed to greet their guest, honouring him with garlands of flowers and 10 notes and wrapping a traditional turban around his head.I am fighting on a different equation. I was born and brought up here [Agra]. And I have worked here as an MP, Raj Babbar told The Hindu, as he approached one of the verandahs. They are asking me, how many votes do I have of my caste and community, he said as he then addressed the villagers. I said to them, listen ... they (waving at the people) are my caste, kin and creed, said Mr. Babbar in Hindi in the local accent.It was met with loud cheers and clapping.However, Fatehpur Sikri is witnessing a different battle this time, where the underdog Congress is relying primarily on the charisma and son-of-the-soil image of its Bollywood star-turned-politician Babbar. While the BJP has fielded a Jat, the BSP has a Brahmin.The third key community in Fatehpur Sikri are the Thakurs. They dominate Ikhtara.Jiten Kumar, the village pradhans son, is among those enamoured of Mr. Babbar  not the Bollywood star but the former Agra MP (1999 and 2004). From the concrete road, drinking water tank and electricity connections, everything done here was during his period, Mr. Kumar said.Mr. Babbars outreach among the Thakurs was bolstered after two popular former BSP MLAs from the community, Surajpal Singh and Dharampal Singh, recently defected to him. And unlike previous elections, there are no Thakur candidates in the fray.But not all are impressed.Netrapal Singh, a farmer, is firmly behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi and dismisses Congress president Rahul Gandhis credentials. He doesnt care much for the BJP candidate, Raj Kumar Chahar, who has lost three consecutive Assembly elections and was once an aide of Mr. Babbar himself.Only Modi can take the country forward. Others talk of only Muslims and want to mortgage national interests, Mr. Singh said.The BSP is placed poorly this time after its former MP Seema Upadhyay, a popular Brahmin face, was denied ticket.Except for the Jatav voters, there is little enthusiasm for her replacement, Bulandshahr MLA Bhagwan Sharma, alias Guddu Pandit, an outsider who does not enjoy a good image.With the Brahmins alienated from the BSP, Mr. Babbar has been making inroads. Rajveer Lavaniya, a Brahmin who heads a potato farmers outfit, recently quit the SP to support Mr. Babbar.Mr. Lavaniya said a panchayat of 10-12 farmer outfits extended support to Mr. Babbar after he assured them he would set up a potato processing unit, get them the right price and help farmer's children get free education.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rashtrapati) is also backing Babbar. The Muslims too appear to be tactically supporting Mr. Babbar as he seems stronger than the BSP to defeat the BJP, said Irfan Salim of the Bharatiya Muslim Vikas Parishad."

The constituency also houses Pudil Nagar which is known for the trade of artificial beads (moonga and moti).Hathras comprises potato belt but due to the lack of adequate processing units, potato farmers are left complaining year after year.POLITICAL HISTORYHathras parliamentary constituency went to the Congress in the 1962 general elections but it was the Republican Party of India (RPI) which won thereafter.Congress bounced back in 1967 and 1971 but the JP Movement swept the nation and the Bharatiya Lok Dal candidate Ram Prasad Deshmukh won the seat in 1977 when the Janata Party formed the government at the Centre.The Bharatiya Janata Party began its winning spree with the Ram Temple wave in the 90s.Lal Bahadur Rawal of the BJP won the seat in 1991 after which Kishan Lal Diler (BJP) won it for four consecutive terms between 1996 and 2009.Supported by the BJP, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) Sarika Baghel won the seat.LOK SABHA ELECTION 2014The BJP once again bagged the Hathras seat in 2014 when its candidate from Jatav community Rajesh Diwakar garnered 5,44,277 votes (51.87%) to defeat Manoj Kumar Soni of the BSP who received 2,17,891 votes (20.77%).Samajwadi Party candidate Ramji Lal Suman got 1,80,891 (17%) votes and stood third. RLD candidate Niranjan Singh Dhangar and AAPs Sunhari Lal secured the fourth and fifth spot with 86,109 (8%) and 5,043 votes (0.48%) respectively.LOK SABHA ELECTION 2019This time around, BJP has replaced its sitting MP Rajesh Diwakar, a Jatav, with Rajvir Singh Diler, son of four-time MP Kishan Lal Diler.Diler belongs to the Valmiki community and may face resentment from Jatavs.The SP-BSP-RLD alliance has fielded Ramji Lal Suman who is a four-time MP from Firozabad. Suman stands a chance with added vote power of alliance partners with a healthy number of Scheduled Caste and Jat votes coupled with the Muslim support.Congress candidate Triloki Ram Diwakar had been an MLA from Iglas.First Published: Apr 16, 2019 14:05 IST"

The vacant posts would be filled in one year if the Congress came to power, he said.Reaching out to the agrarian community in U.P.s potato belt, Mr. Gandhi said after the 2019 Lok Sabha election, no farmer would go to jail for failing to repay debt. That farmers could be imprisoned for failing to repay nominal sums but industrialists owing the government crores were scot-free indicated the BJP government's attempts to create two Indias, said Mr. Gandhi.Bah is in Fatehpur Sikri Lok Sabha constituency, where Raj Babbar is the Congress candidate, and is scheduled to vote on April 18."

The question hangs in the air as Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls on April 18, the second phase of the general election.Travelling across the southern Jat-belt in western Uttar Pradesh, anecdotal evidence suggests Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not as popular in the community as he was in 2014. But will that translate into voting against the BJP? And will the Jats swing back to their original party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and support the alliance of the SP-BSP?The second phase of voting will be a test for the Jat mood, especially in Mathura, Fatehpur Sikri, Bulandshahr, Hathras and Aligarh.The split in opinion could be gauged in Panigaon Banger village in Mathuras Mant region. The contest in Mathura is between the BJPs Hema Malini, who carries the identity of a Jat bahu, and Narendra Singh, a Thakur from an influential political family.That the RLD has gambled with a non-Jat in this seat, where its vice-president Jayant Chaudhary himself lost in 2014, has made it a test case for the RLDs resurgence among its base community. If the RLD has to win, it will need to regain its original support base.In Panigaon, Lucky Solanki and Surendra Singh, are part of that change. They believe the BJP has hurt the agrarian economy. The two young Jat farmers had voted the BJP in 2014 but this time they want to defeat Modi.In the same village lives Balbir Chaudhary, who is fuming after suffering heavy losses to his potato crops, a big quantity of which has rotted away. The government says they dont want to buy our potatoes, says Mr. Chaudhary.In 2014, Mr. Chaudhary had voted for Mr. Modi hoping he would run the country better. But today he is disenchanted.But wont Ms. Malinis appeal make a difference? Mr. Chaudhary scoffs at the question. He takes a dig at Ms. Malini for recently sharing photos of her lending a hand to women carrying a bundle of harvested crops in Goverdhan. The women in the village went up to her to offer her a chunni (long scarf). But she did not even step out of the car. Do we stink? asks Mr. Chaudhary.Asked about the Balakot air strike, Mr. Chaudhary said, They are trying to mislead the people.But Mahavir Singh differs. My relatives in the forces are asking me to vote for the BJP. Anyway, the RLD no longer has a wajood (existence) here, he says.Another seat where the Jat vote is critical is Fatehpur Sikri. The lone Jat candidate is from the BJP, Rajkumar Chahar, who is up against the stardom of Congress Raj Babbar and the BSPs Guddu Pandit, a Brahmin. The Jats here too were found split, but between the BJP and the Congress, not so much for the BSP, which is in alliance with the RLD.The RLD is contesting three seats in this election. While in Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat, where its leaders Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary are contesting, the Jat support seemed tilted in favour of the party, questions still remain if the communitys vote would be transferred to the RLD in Mathura or to the SP-BSP in other seats where Jats are not fielded."

Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Chaudhary Ajit Singh had also attended the public meeting.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, SP president Akhilesh Yadav, Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and others have also left no stone unturned to win Aligarh.DOMINATING ISSUESCaste and religion dominate elections in Aligarh. Although the city has AMU but other colleges continue to be affiliated with Dr BR Ambedkar University of Agra. The demand for a university for Aligarh remains unfulfilled.Traffic jams is a perennial issue in Aligarh. The city also lacks connectivity with the southern part of the country.Moreover, sugarcane and potato farmers have their own set of problems and lack of industrialisation fails to support agriculture produce of the area.Lawyers have also been pressing for a separate high court bench for west UP.A section of residents also believes that the city should be a part of the national capital region (NCR) as Delhi is close to it.CM Yogi Adityanath and defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman were in Aligarh for the announcement of defence corridor but early implementation remains to be done.The lock industry seeks better labs here and despite being important seat of hardware industry, Aligarh still awaits attention.POLITICAL SCENARIOWhile the BJP has replaced its sitting MP in Agra, Hathras and Fatehpur Sikri, it has retained sitting MP Satish Gautam in Aligarh. Gautam is known for raising the Jinnah portrait controversy and SC/ST reservation issue at AMU.He initially faced opposition within the party and was not believed to be the chosen one for former chief minister Kalyan Singh who still remains a force to reckon with in Aligarh.BSP candidate Ajit Baliyan represents SP-BSP-RLD alliance and aims to bring back the success of BSP which won this seat in 2009. Congress candidate Bijendra Singh had won from Aligarh in 2004 and has made the contest not only triangular but interesting too.With no major party fielding a Muslim candidate this time, the inclination of Muslims, who form a fair part of the population, remains anybodys gamble.POLITICAL HISTORYThe parliamentary seat of Aligarh remained loyal to the Congress in first four elections between 1952 and 1957 but in 1962, the seat was won by the Republican Party of India (RPI). Then came the dominance of the Bharatiya Kranti Dal (BKD) which won in 1967 and 1971 with Chaudhary Charan Singh having a say in the area.The JP Movement brought success for the Janata Party in 1977 and for Janata Party (S) in 1980 but the Congress, riding on sympathy wave after Indira Gandhi assassination, won in 1984. This was followed by the emergence of Janata Dal in 1989.Then came the era of BJP and its candidate Sheela Gautam won in election in 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999. The Congress won the election in 2004.Photo Caption ::: File photos of buildings in AMU Campus at Aligarh.First Published: Apr 17, 2019 10:23 IST"

Their victory will be a befitting reply to the gag order, he said to loud cheer.Mr. Mishra described the gag order as anti-Dalit and unconstitutional. He said the EC did not look at the speech in its entirety where  Behenji was appealing to the sarvajan (people) not to allow their vote to be divided on the basis of caste and religion.Instead, he said, they chose to focus on a minor portion of the speech. The EC didnt take note of how the Prime Minister and Amit Shah are dividing people in the name of religion, he alleged.He said that according to the Jammu & Kashmir Governor, the Pulwama attack was because of intelligence failure.Instead of taking responsibility for the failure, the Prime Minister is shedding crocodile tears for the martyrs.Coming down heavily on the EC, Mr. Yadav said the voice of the poor cant be throttled and when it will speak through machines (EVMs), our rivals will be silenced.He said Ms. Mayawati lived in the hearts of the masses and nobody could take her out from there.Mr. Singh said the so-called 56-inch chest of Mr. Modi did not have a heart with even a single inch of space for the minorities and the dispossessed. He is the chowkidar of the 1% rich of the country.He appealed to the crowd not to watch television till the last phase of voting.The news channels are not telling you how the crowd is receding in his rallies and increasing in mahagathbandhan rallies.In the rural belt, the potato farmers are in distress. Mr. Yadav raised their concern during his speech. The farmers didnt get the right price of their crop and it rotted in cold storage. He called it an impact of notebandi (demonetisation), which could only be avenged by votebandi (by not voting for the BJP). Referring to the footwear industry, Mr. Yadav said that the BJP was doing politics over animals and brought religion even in the occupation of people.Many see Mr. Anand as the successor of Ms. Mayawati. Naresh Gautam, BSP Coordinator, western Uttar Pradesh, said these are early days but there is a wave of happiness in the party."

They do hinder the scenic beauty but are vital to this region as these cold storages help stock the most produced crop of the region  the potato.Moreover, these storages provide jobs for at least 10,000 people from the nearby villages. Each storage is equipped to handle 2.5 lakh bags of potatoes.The workforce forms a mere 0.5 per cent of the constituencys electorate but their issues are of prime importance to the leaders. They are the backbone of the region after the farmers. If the storage workers go on strike, all the potato produce will go waste, a BJP worker says. Congress is a step ahead. These cold storage workers are as important as the farmer. The local economy runs on potatoes hence their preservation is of utmost importance, a party worker said.However, the cold storage workers themselves are divided on who will be beneficial to them. While some say Prime Minister Narendra Modis schemes have benefitted them, a few believe BJP has become an arrogant party. There is a group of workers which says that their leader should be one among them and only then would their problems be solved.Take the case of particular storage, right on the border of Agra and Sadbad. On the stairs leading to the storage area is a group of workers hotly debating the polls. Bhaiyya, ye Modi nahi hota toh jaane humara kya hota (Had Modi not been there, God knows what would have happened to us), says 26-year-old Nitish Kumar smoking a beedi. Dekho Modi ne kuch nahi kiya hai. Bas bhashan dene aate hai usko. (Modi has not done anything for anyone, he knows only how to lecture people), comes the retort from 45-year-old Prempal Singh."

With 85 candidates in the fray, the contest in the eight seats of the Braj region seems to be evenly poised with caste calculations backing the prospects of the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in at least four seats. The BJP is banking on development, Modi magic and Jat-Lodh-non-Jatav consolidation in its favour. Bollywood star power is also a factor in at least two seats.However, pertinent regional issues may have their own influence over and above all other factors on the outcome of phase II on April 18.Notably, all the eight seatsAgra, Aligarh, Amroha, Bulandshahr, Fatehpur Sikri, Hathras, Mathura and Nagina  were won by the BJP under the Modi wave in 2014 with a respectable margin. The scenario may be a little different this time around. With Modi is a relevant factor across the Braj region, the caste calculus will also be in play for an alliance.In 2009, the saffron party could win just one seat -- Agra -- from this phase. RLD had bagged Mathura, Hathras and Amroha, while SP and BSP shared two each.With four reserved seats  Agra, Nagina, Bualandshahr, and Hathras with predominant Dalit population and five of eight seats with over 20% Muslim population, Dalit-Muslim consolidation will be an advantage for the alliance. Nagina has around 60 per cent Dalit-Muslim combined population of the total electorate. In Amroha the combination has over 55% voters and similarly, in Agra and Aligarh, the combined Dalit-Muslim vote share is around 50%.FOLLOW OUR ELECTIONS COVERAGE HEREThe phase is most crucial for the BSP as it is contesting on six out of eight seats. SP has just one seat, Hathras. The Congress has fielded candidates for all 8 seats.On the other hand, the BJP is eyeing Jat-Lodh and non-Jatav dalit consolidation in its favour. Non-Jatav dalits, in fact, make 45 per cent of the dalit population across 8 seats. Even Jats and Lodhs can impact the outcome. While Jats on three seats  Mathura, Aligarh and Fatehpur Sikri  may be a swing factor, Lodhs in Bulandshahr, Agra and Aligarh may turn the tables in favour of a party. Former CM and currently Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh, the Lodh poster boy of the BJP, still has an impact in the region.Similarly, Mathura and Fatehpur Sikri are set for Bollywood charisma. While dream girl Hema Malini is seeking re-election from Mathura, UPCC chief Raj Babbar is testing the poll waters in Fatehpur Sikri. Hema has the double advantage in Mathura with husband Dharmendra standing by her side. Dharmendra will draw the attention of 21 per cent Jats in Mathura.Moreover, at least five of the eight seats are also part of the sugarcane belt. Farmers' resentment over dues may have some bearing on the voting. Besides, a potato glut has hit farmers who are not getting adequate returns.Phase-II: At a glance1. Agra: A reserved seat, it is also known as the Dalit capital of UP. The combined Dalit-Muslim vote share is over 50%. The BJP has been winning this seat since 1991 except in 1999 and 2004 when the SP won it. In 2014, the BJPs Ramshankar Katheria had won defeating nearest rival Narain Singh Suman of BSP. This time the BJP has replaced Katheria with SP Singh Baghel. It is a triangular contest among BJPs Baghel, Preeta Harit of Congress and Manoj Kumar Soni of the alliance.2. Fatehpur Sikri: This seat involves a triangular contest among the BJP, Congress and alliance. The seat had come into existence in 2009 when BSPs Seema Upadhyay had defeated Congresss Raj Babbar. In 2014, BJP had bagged the seat as party candidate Chaudhury Babulal had drubbed Seema Upadhyay of BSP. Congress-RLD alliance had fielded Amar Singh in 2014 but he was pushed to fourth position. This time, the BJP has given a ticket to Rajkumar Chahar, Congress has fielded Raj Babbar yet again and BSP has reposed faith in Shri Bhagwan Sharma Guddu Pandit.3. Hathras: It is poised to be a direct BJP-alliance fight. The seat has been a BJP bastion as the party has been winning it six times in a row except 2009 when RLD had bagged the seat while being in alliance with the BJP. This time around, the seat has fallen in SPs kitty and the party has fielded Ramji Lal Suman who is depending on the caste calculus of the alliance. The BJP has given a ticket to its Iglas MLA Rajveer Diler who is the son of Kishanlal Diler, four-time party MP from the same seat.4. Mathura: This seat has an added attraction and a glamour quotient with actor-turned-politician and sitting BJP Hema Malini in the fray for the second time. While the seat belongs to RLD, the SP-BSP alliance partner, the Jat party has fielded Kunwar Narendra Singh, a Thakur by caste. In this seat, Jats, Brahmins and Thakurs are the deciding factors. In 2014, Hema Malini had defeated RLD vice chief Jayant Chaudhury. The Congress has fielded Mahesh Pathak, a Brahmin face. Mathura has given major reverses to many leaders. Once, former PM late Atal Bihari Vajpayee had forfeited his deposit in Mathura. Similarly, Jayant Chaudhurys grandmother Gayatri Devi had also faced defeat in the land of Krishna.5. Aligarh: Here the Jat vote bank is the X-factor. The battle in the land of locks and academics is set to be interesting. While the Congress and the alliance have fielded Jat candidates, the BJP has repeated sitting MP Satish Gautam. The BSP has fielded Dr Ajit Balyan while the Congress has given a ticket to Brijendra Singh. Aligarh has over 4.5 lakh Muslims of 18.62 lakh voters while 2.75 lakh are Jats. However, Aligarh has been in the limelight owing to repeated controversies plaguing Aligarh Muslim University. The constituency has around 90,000 young voters.6. Nagina: It is a reserved constituency which came into existence in 2009. The Dalit-Muslim combination rules the roost with around 60 % presence. However, the contest seems to be triangular with the tacit support of Dalit organisationBhim Army  for the Congress. The BJP may capitalise if Dalit and Muslim votes are divided between Congress and alliance candidates. While the BJP has reposed faith in its sitting MP Dr Yashwant, Congress has fielded Omwati Devi and alliance has given a ticket to Girish Chandra.7. Amroha: The outcome of Amroha will also depend on Dalit-Muslim combination which makes around seven lakh of the total 16 lakh voters. Keeping the caste calculus, the alliance feels it has an edge while the BJP is eyeing Jats and other dalit sub-castes. Famous for its mango products, Amroha was won by the BJP in 2014. This time the party has repeated its sitting MP Chadhury Kanwar Singh Tanwar, BSP has fielded Danish Ali and Congress has given a ticket to Sachin Chaudhury. The fourth corner is being held by Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia of rebel SP leader Shivpal Yadav who has fielded a Muslim Matloob Ahmad. Consequently, the Muslim vote may be divided three-way to the advantage of the BJP.8. Bulandshahr: Also a reserved seat. A BJP bastion but the saffron party faces a challenge to save its citadel. The constituency is dominated by Lodhs, Dalits and Muslims. However, Brahmins, Jats and Thakurs also have a considerable presence. While the BJP has repeated its sitting MP Bhola Singh, the BSP has fielded Yogesh Verma and the Congress has given a ticket to ex-MLA Bansi Pahadia. It seems to be more of a direct contest between the BJP and alliance. While the BJP is banking on upper caste and OBC votes besides PM Modi, the alliance is depending heavily on Dalit-Muslim and traditional Jat and Yadav vote bank of SP and RLD."

Here it is (also) potato farmers who are not getting their dues. Due to the historic importance of the walled city, no industries have come up. But certainly non-polluting, processing industries can be set up here,"" he told PTI.The BJP has pitched the development agenda and ""Modi factor"" to the electorate.""Vikas and Modi ji's face are two key factors for us,"" said Prahlad Garg, a local BJP leader.ALSO READ | Ali is ours, so is Bajrang Bali, says Mayawati in riposte to YogiHe cited Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Ujjwala Yojna, and construction of toilets under a government scheme to make his case and said people have benefitted from these programmes.Babbar, on the other hand, is banking on his local connection; he was born in Agra.Projecting his image as ""Aapka Apna Raj Babbar"", he said, ""This is the land where I was born, which made me the Raj Babbar who earned name in Mumbai. This is the land that elected me to Lok Sabha also.""""How much blessed I am will become clear tomorrow,"" he told PTI.Babbar said he had initiated work to bring the potato-processing industry and ensure potable water to the region but that could not fructify after he lost the election in 2009.""We need to mobilize resources to resolve this problem,"" he said.Asked about Congress's performance in western Uttar Pradesh, he said, ""Don't see it as the revival of Congress through me. Congress is in the hearts of people. They have faith in our central leadership in Priyanka ji.""The previous UPA government had showed it can work for all sections of society,"" he said.ALSO READ | Lok Sabha polls historic, will restore respect for poor: Akhilesh YadavBoth BJP and Congress see this poll battle as a fight between them, dismissing any threat from Sharma, who hails from Bulandshahr and is fighting the ""outsider"" tag.Sharma has also been reportedly booked for violating the model code of conduct at least four times for his indecent remarks in the run-up to the campaigning that ended Wednesday.The BJP had wrested the seat from BSP in 2014.Have things changed since then? ""When the GST and the note ban were implemented, they caused chaos.But now the situation is almost back on track,"" Agarwal, the shopkeeper, said.Babbar asserted the schemes implemented by the Congress party have been for welfare of the people at large.""For example, we brought NREGA, farmer loan waivers in the three states where we recently formed government or our new proposal of minimum income guarantee (NYAY),"" he said, and apparently referring to BJP added, ""Those who lose people's trust are set to lose the throne.""Around 17 lakh voters are eligible to cast their vote in Fatehpur Sikri.The constituency comprises Agra Rural (4 lakh voters), Fatehpur Sikri (3.25 lakh voters), Kheragarh (3.25 lakh), Fatehabad (3.5 lakh) and Baha (4.5) assembly segments.The region is dominated by Thakur and Brahmin voters, and Jats, Scheduled Castes, Kushwahas and Muslims are also in significant numbers.In 2014, BJP's Babulal had polled over 4.26 lakh votes, 44 per cent of all votes cast that year.BSP's Seema Upadhyay had come second with 2.53 lakh votes, while Samajwadi Party's Rani Pakshalika Singh had got over 2.13 lakh votes.Babbar had moved to Ghaziabad in 2014 general election and lost to BJP's V K Singh."

What is the use of opening bank accounts under Jan-Dhan scheme when there is no money in it? complained Noor Bano.At Ahmedgarh, Bhola Ram said izzat ghar (toilets), under the governments campaign for making the region open defecation-free, were being made in homes of those who are government servants or close to the ruling party.Same billAt the Daulatpur booth, Shamshad, a barber, was livid with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Of course, the electricity meters have been installed but the bill always reads 800, irrespective of the usage. At the ration shop, often our thumb impressions dont match or we are told that towers (Internet connection) are not there. This is the reality of digital India.Where is the alternative, asked Kushal Pal Singh in Bhakri village of Hathras (reserved) constituency. I agree potato farmers are suffering and the promise of doubling the farmers income seems like a dream but if the gathbandhan (Opposition alliance) comes to power, we will have Prime Ministers on a weekly basis.GST woesIn Aligarh, on Subhash Road that connects the Muslim-dominated Upper Fort area to the rest of the city, Vivek Varshney, who runs a pharmacy shop, said after casting his vote, the GST has harmed our business but the important thing is during the Modi rule Muslims dont show their muscle on the street like they used to during the SP or BSP rule.In the Jama Masjid area, locals complain that the unorganised lock industry is suffering because of demonetisation and GST. Plus, the administration sides with the majority community on every issue, alleged Mohd. Tahir, who runs a hardware business. Dange nahin huye (There were no riots) but what to expect when chor ke haath main tarazu hai (when the balance of justice lies in the hands of the culprit), remarked Babbu Khan, waiting for his turn at the Lutfiya Junior High School.Interestingly, Aligarh Muslim University Students Union President Salman Imtiaz could be seen in queue to vote at the booth.Last year, after the protest over the Jinnah portrait, AMU Students Union, for the first time, elected Salman Imitiaz, a non-residential candidate, as its president, arguably to create a connection between the campus and the city. Mr. Imitaz said it was a coincidence but it did give the community the confidence to resist the fascist forces.All quiet in AMUMeanwhile it was all quiet on the AMU campus. Asmer Baig, Professor of Political Science at the university, said AMU was not a vote bank for any party. It was just used by the BJP for political gain like they did with JNU. The BJP had managed to create a sense of victimhood in the majority community."
2019-04-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/apr/18/tiktok-brings-chinese-style-censorship-to-americas-tweens-1965961.html,TikTok brings Chinese-style censorship to America’s tweens,"By BloombergMost nights, from around 7 till midnight, Sydney Jade is on TikTok, the smartphone app of the moment. The platinum blond teenager films herself singing show tunes, doing jumping jacks, and joking around with store clerks at a Walmart not far from her home in Oklahoma. Her short music videos and livestreams are popular-Jade has 284,000 followers, some of whom periodically send her virtual gifts, like 99 cent Rainbow Puke stickers.Jades parents resisted TikTok at first. They hadnt heard of the app and, Jade says, didnt like the idea of strangers watching me sing alone in front of the pink curtains in my bedroom. But she convinced them that TikTok was friendlier for kids than other apps like Facebook. They let her join last year, just as, it seems, every other teenager signed on as well. In January, TikTok was the most downloaded app in the Android and iPhone stores, according to research firm Sensor Tower Inc.The story sounds a lot like the rise of other social media powers such as Instagram and Snapchat, both of which pitched themselves as alternatives to Facebooks big blue app. But TikTok wasnt created by Stanford students Mark Zuckerberg could buy off or spend into the ground. Its a subsidiary of a Beijing startup, Bytedance Ltd., thats built a collection of valuable apps in China powered by vast troves of data and sophisticated artificial intelligence. Last year, Bytedances investors valued the company at $75 billion, the most of any startup in the world.Inevitably, especially in the age of Donald Trump, TikToks fast growth and Chinese ownership have made it the subject of scrutiny. Last month, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), ordered Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., a little-known Chinese gaming company that bought the very well-known gay-dating app Grindr, to sell the business over apparent concerns that Chinese intelligence agencies could potentially use data from the app to blackmail users. In an April 1 filing, the company said its in talks with CFIUS. U.S. authorities havent said theyre investigating Bytedance in connection with its ownership, but the companys large user base could conceivably make it a target. Social media platforms are increasingly considered sensitive by CFIUS, says Farhad Jalinous, chair of the national security and CFIUS practice at law firm White & Case LLP. Bytedance says it now stores all TikTok data outside of China and that the Chinese government has no access. (The companys privacy policy had previously warned users it could share their information with its Chinese businesses, as well as law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so.)Separately, TikTok has faced concerns over privacy and child safety. In February, Bytedance was fined $5.7 million by the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that Musical.ly, which Bytedance bought and renamed TikTok, illegally collected information from minors. It was the largest FTC penalty in a childrens privacy case.The settlement didnt scare off Bytedances investors or the company itself, which is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise on Facebook in the hope of luring away more users. Over the past three months, for instance, 13 percent of all the ads seen by users of Facebooks Android app were for TikTok, says app-analytics firm Apptopia.The result is that Bytedance has had more success outside of China than any previous Chinese internet company, including Baidu and Tencent. The TikTok app and its Chinese version have been installed more than a billion times. (It has no relation to TicToc, Bloomberg LPs breaking news network.) Late last year, executives told investors that they expect $18 billion in revenue this year and $29 billion in 2020, according to people familiar with its finances who arent authorized to discuss the company publicly. Bytedance will become a global player, says Hans Tung, managing partner of GGV Capital, one of the companys backers. Its just a matter of when.Bytedances Beijing headquarters, a former aerospace museum with 50-foot glass skylights, is a celebration of the companys frantic pace. On a January afternoon, a video in the cafeteria asked workers to share New Years resolutions and regrets. Most seemed to involve workaholism. To my ex, Im sorry I was too busy at work, one employee said. Im sorry to my kids that Im never home, another message lamented.The corporate culture is intense even by the standards of Chinese startups. Employee performance goals are published internally via a mobile app the company created called Lark and are reviewed every other month. In an interview, Bytedances senior vice president for corporate development, Liu Zhen, mentions that founder and Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming likes to travel to the West when the Beijing office shuts down during Chinese holidays. So he can keep working, she explains. Zhang declined interview requests.Now 36, he started Bytedance in 2012, in an apartment near Beijings Tsinghua University. One of its first apps, Neihan Duanzi (implied jokes), used AI to tailor a selection of memes to individual users tastes. The effect was irreverentthink of Reddit, but a little bit grosser and more personaland the app attracted tens of millions of users. Bytedance used the same approach to develop a news app, Jinri Toutiao (todays headlines), which became Chinas largest news site, with more than 700 million users. The success prompted acquisition offers from Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, all of which Zhang declined.Then in 2016 it launched a short-video app in China called Douyin that allowed users to add music and animations. The following year, it created an international version, TikTok. Users who open TikTok are confronted with an endless feed of short, full-screen videos, generally set to music. Tapping on a magnifying glass icon reveals TikToks Discover page, which displays a carousel of videos under trending hashtags. These are internet memes such as #potatoportrait, where users apply makeup to potatoes, or #simbachallenge, which asks them to reenact an iconic Lion King scene.Although these features make TikTok feel similar to Facebook, Instagram, and Snap, the app doesnt rely on social connections to figure out what to show you when you open it. Instead, TikTok decides what videos to show by tapping into data, starting with your location. Then, as you start watching, it analyzes the faces, voices, music, or objects in videos you watch the longest. Liking, sharing, or commenting improves TikToks algorithm further. Within a day, the app can get to know you so well it feels like its reading your mind. Thats why Jade, the Oklahoma teen, mostly sees videos of people dancing, while her mom regularly gets clips of dog tricks.Another way TikTok differs from big American social media apps, which largely grew through word of mouth, is that its expansion didnt happen entirely through the magic of viral marketing. Although the app initially took off in India and Southeast Asia, it struggled to attract users in the U.S. and Europe. In November 2017, Bytedance paid about $800 million for Musical.ly, a music video app that had more than 100 million users. A few months later, those users would find the old Musical.ly app replaced with one bearing TikToks neon logo instead. The app suddenly had a substantial footprint in the U.S. Musical.ly believed in organic growth, and that worked great with early adopters, says GGV Capitals Tung, who also invested in Musical.ly. TikTok is more based on algorithm recommendations and paid growth, meaning ads on Facebook and elsewhere.It wasnt real, but it could have been, and I got scaredUnlike on other platforms, where trends bubble up from users posts, many of TikToks trending hashtags are created by the companys marketers. Ahead of its U.S. launch, Bytedance hired about 40 social media celebrities to make videosincluding YouTube comedian David Dobrikpaying each tens of thousands of dollars. Some contracts required the influencers to ask their YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram fans to move over to TikTok.Bytedance still makes most of its money in China, where its short-video app charges advertisers 15 percent of what influencers get paid to promote brands. TikTok also takes a cut from the sale of digital coins that fans buy for creators during livestreamed videos.In theory, relying more on professionally created content should make TikTok safer than Twitter or Facebook are. But users say livestreams are peppered with lewd acts and vulgar comments. That can be terrifying for children. Jade, the Oklahoma teen, says she recently cut short a live appearance after commenters said they knew where she lived and threatened to kill her dog. It wasnt real, but it could have been, and I got scared, she says. In February a 35-year-old man was accused by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department of posing as a 13-year-old boy to send sexual messages to at least 21 girls on TikTok. Police said he showed up at the home of one of his alleged victims, a 9-year-old.In response to the FTC settlement, TikTok began requiring users in some countries, including the U.S., to input their birthdays, denying entry to the full-feature app to those who say theyre under 13. It also started using facial-recognition software to identify youthful faces, expelling underage creators, and preventing younger viewers from seeing mature content.Its too soon to say whether these changes will work, but TikTok has won cautious praise from some child safety advocates who say its challenges are similar to those facing other platforms, but that the stakes are higher because of its younger audience. Three years ago, we were having a really hard time trying to pin them down and get them to do the right thing, says Julie Inman Grant, commissioner of Australias eSafety Office, a government agency. Theyre starting to be more responsible.Bytedance is aiming for more than mere social responsibility. The companys long-term goal is to eliminate objectionable content entirely, to be controversy free, as Tung, the investor, puts it. Its a uniquely Chinese censorship strategydistinct from the hands-off approach of Bytedances American counterparts, who tend to express support for almost unrestricted free speech. (Zuckerberg once famously said that Holocaust denial should be permitted on Facebook.) Last year, Zhang issued a public apology after media regulators shut down the jokes app for hosting vulgar content. The company hired thousands of people to police content, giving preference to Communist Party members, and invested more money in developing algorithms to screen posts.Today, Bytedances AI screens videos as theyre posted, automatically removing content without waiting for user complaints. The ambition, says Raj Mishra, TikToks head of operations in India, is to be a one-stop entertainment platform where people come to have fun rather than creating any political strife. He makes no attempt to defer to the freedoms of speech and expression that are written into the constitution of the worlds largest democracy. When asked if TikTok would allow criticism of, for example, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to be prominently featured in the app, Mishra answers, No. In mid-April, Google and Apple app stores blocked new downloads of TikTok in India after a court asked the government to ban the app over concerns about pornography. Bytedance is fighting the action.Whether Bytedance ultimately succeeds will depend in large part on its ability to attract older users with more spending power. TikTok has been encouraging cooking, travel, and sports videos designed for those crowds. At the same time, its adding thousands of employees to its 40,000-person staff and pumping hundreds of millions of dollars more into ad campaigns. Its also working on a search engine, a way for livestreamers to sell products, and a Slack-like chat service for businesses.According to people familiar with the company, executives have met with bankers to discuss going public. (The company denies it has plans for a public offering.) Bytedance was set to lose about $1 billion in 2018, according to another person familiar with its financials.Even so, the companys global ambitions have been enough to get the attention of Facebook, which released a TikTok-like app, Lasso, in late 2018. While only 70,000 people have downloaded it so far, according to Sensor Tower, Facebook has had success knocking off competitors apps in the past. The company released several Snapchat clones before successfully copying its most popular feature, Stories, within Instagram. That caused Snaps growth to slow, and Instagrams to take off.Zuckerberg seemed to acknowledge the threat posed by Bytedance and other Chinese upstarts last year during a U.S. Senate hearing in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, threw him a softball, offering that Zuckerbergs rise from college dropout to technology mogul might have a patriotic element.Only in America, Sullivan said. Would you agree with that? Senator, mostly in America, Zuckerberg offered, noting that there are some very strong Chinese internet companies. Youre supposed to answer yes to this question, said Sullivan.Back in Oklahoma, Jade isnt sweating geopolitics or regulation, and shes mostly off Facebook and Snapchat. On TikTok, she applies a fresh coat of candy apple lipstick and lip-syncs to Keliss Milkshake while dancing behind a J.C. Penney cash register.There are nasty people here and there, she says of her experience using the app. But for the most part, its just a fun, friendly place."
2019-04-18,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jat-votes-which-way-will-they-swing/article26870199.ece,Which way will Jat votes swing?,"Which way will the Jats swing? The question hangs in the air as Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls for the second phase on April 18.Travelling across the southern Jat-belt in western Uttar Pradesh, anecdotal evidence suggests Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not as popular in the community as he was in 2014. But will that translate into voting against the BJP? And will the Jats swing back to their original party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and support the alliance of the SP-BSP?The second phase of voting will be a test for the Jat mood, especially in Mathura, Fatehpur Sikri, Bulandshahr, Hathras and Aligarh.The split in opinion could be gauged in Panigaon Banger village in Mathuras Mant region. The contest in Mathura is between the BJPs Hema Malini, who carries the identity of a Jat bahu, and Narendra Singh, a Thakur from an influential political family.That the RLD has gambled with a non-Jat in this seat, where its vice-president Jayant Chaudhary himself lost in 2014, has made it a test case for the RLDs resurgence among its base community. If the RLD has to win, it will need to regain its original support base.In Panigaon, Lucky Solanki and Surendra Singh, are part of that change. They believe the BJP has hurt the agrarian economy. The two young Jat farmers had voted the BJP in 2014 but this time they want to defeat Modi.In the same village lives Balbir Chaudhary, who is fuming after suffering heavy losses to his potato crops, a big quantity of which has rotted away. The government says they dont want to buy our potatoes, says Mr. Chaudhary.In 2014, Mr. Chaudhary had voted for Mr. Modi hoping he would run the country better. But today he is disenchanted.But wont Ms. Malinis appeal make a difference? Mr. Chaudhary scoffs at the question. He takes a dig at Ms. Malini for recently sharing photos of her lending a hand to women carrying a bundle of harvested crops in Goverdhan. The women in the village went up to her to offer her a chunni (long scarf). But she did not even step out of the car. Do we stink? asks Mr. Chaudhary.Asked about the Balakot air strike, Mr. Chaudhary said, They are trying to mislead the people.But Mahavir Singh differs. My relatives in the forces are asking me to vote for the BJP. Anyway, the RLD no longer has a wajood (existence) here, he says.Another seat where the Jat vote is critical is Fatehpur Sikri. The lone Jat candidate is from the BJP, Rajkumar Chahar, who is up against the stardom of Congress Raj Babbar and the BSPs Guddu Pandit, a Brahmin. The Jats here too were found split, but between the BJP and the Congress, not so much for the BSP, which is in alliance with the RLD.The RLD is contesting three seats in this election. While in Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat, where its leaders Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary are contesting, the Jat support seemed tilted in favour of the party, questions still remain if the communitys vote would be transferred to the RLD in Mathura or to the SP-BSP in other seats where Jats are not fielded."
2019-04-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/production-glut-behind-farm-distress/story-T1szIbkNoEZDGdFIgy5IAP.html,Production glut behind farm distress?,"In an article published in The Indian Express on 18 April, Harish Damodaran has argued that production glut, not dearth of cold storage and processing infrastructure, is the real cause of farm distress (in India) today. The argument, if true, has serious ramifications for Indian agriculture. This is because it suggests that the only way to deal with farm distress is to reduce agricultural production in the country.This is an interesting argument, but does it have a macroeconomic justification? The article cites problems of potato and sugar cane farmers in some districts of Uttar Pradesh, but such anecdotal evidence may not warrant the radical inference. Indeed, such an argument focuses almost entirely on supply side factors without looking at demand side issues. And two, it does not recognise the fundamental asymmetry which characterizes global agricultural markets.Whether or not a particular commodity is in excess supply in a market also depends on the level of demand for it, which is a function of many things including purchasing power and preferences. For example, if all billionaires were to vanish from the world tomorrow, we would suddenly have a glut of private jets. Similarly, if the number of billionaires suddenly doubled in six months, there would be a severe scarcity for these jets. Both of these situations can arise without any change in the supply of private jets in the world.What many commentators do not realise is that demand for food also varies drastically among countries. This becomes clear by a comparison using the data published by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). The relevant category to look at in the FAO database is per capita supply of food items.FAO calculates supply by deducting net exports, addition to stock and other wastages from the total production for a commodity. In other words, this is a good proxy for effective demand for food in a country. FAO also gives out information on per capita supply of food (in kilo calories per day) and protein and fat (in grams per day).The latest available data (for 2013) shows that among 177 countries in the FAOs list, India is ranked 137th in food supply per capita, 145th in protein supply per capita and 146th in fat supply per capita. To put these numbers in context, China is ranked 54th in per capita food supply, 38th in per capita protein supply and 60th on per capita fat supply. The countries which are ranked at the top in each of these lists are developed economies.What is interesting is that Indias per capita supply of calories, protein and fat used to be more than Chinas until the 1970s. China adopted large scale economic reforms after this period and since then its per capita supply figures (a proxy for demand) has surpassed that of India. This is also the period when Chinas per capita incomes have increased at a faster pace than Indias. One can argue on the basis of these numbers that lack of mass income growth has acted as a roadblock to any increase in effective demand for food in India.There is nothing to suggest that the current supply-demand situation in Indian agricultural is very different from what it has been until 2013, the latest period for which the FAO data is available. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) or Gross Value Added (GVA) in agriculture at constant prices under the present government (2014-15 to 2018-19) is lower than what it was under the second United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and marginally higher than the value for UPA-I. This does not suggest any radical overproduction problem in Indian agriculture in the recent period. However, the current price growth, which is the function of prices, has fallen drastically under the present government, taking the ratio of current price to constant price growth in agriculture at the lowest level under the past three governments for which data is available under the 2011-12 GDP series.If prices did not collapse when agricultural production was growing at a much faster pace, why should they crash when production growth has actually decelerated?India is nowhere close to reaching peak food consumption levels in the world. This (price crash for food items) could have happened if mass purchasing powers have come under squeeze in the recent period. Unfortunately, there is no consumption expenditure data to accept or reject this claim. The recently leaked findings of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) employment survey did suggest that the Indian economy has fared badly on the employment front. If these findings are true, there is bound to have been a negative impact on mass purchasing powers. To be sure, farm incomes have also suffered in India due to the adverse turn in international food prices, which have brought down export opportunities and earnings and also created problems for crops such as sugar cane.Also, agrarian distress is not something which has suddenly appeared in India in the past couple of years. Viability of the average Indian farmer has been in crisis for a long time now. What many people do not realise is that this is not a problem which is unique to India. Even in a country like the US, where farming is extremely mechanised and practiced on very large farms, prices cannot cover the cost of production for important crops such as wheat and cotton. Statistics from the United States Department of Agriculture show that the difference between value of output and total costs has been continuously negative in the US.It is the extremely high level of farm subsidies which sustains commercially unviable farming in countries such as the US. The US gave almost $120 billion in Green Box category farm support to its farmers in 2015. This is nearly one-third of the nominal agricultural output in India in 2015-16. Although Green Box subsidies are permitted under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, they do play an important role in sustaining what would otherwise be commercially unviable cultivation and creating a glut in the global market. The US is among the top exporters of both wheat and cotton in the world. If the global agricultural markets did not suffer from such distortions, third world countries like India would actually have a better chance at exporting their products.These factors are probably more important for the current predicament of Indian agriculture than overproduction is.First Published: Apr 19, 2019 08:14 IST"

We grabbed it and frowned over the menu. Given the variety on offer, it was difficult to decide but finally settled for Carronge (Carrot and Orange juice, though my husband made a face), Ganga Jamuna (Orange and Sweet Lime juice) and a plain musambi juice for the unadventurous man; a vegetable cheese pizza, pani puri, cheese pav bhaji and vegetable cheese grill sandwich.Mix the spice in the pani puri to your own tasteThe pani puri arrived first, each puri resting on a tiny glass of spicy mint water and the date-tamarind chutney in a separate bowl. This allowed us to fix the spice levels to suit our individual tastes and the explosion of flavours that resulted was incredible.Whats in a name In case anyone is wondering if this is the branch of the famous Mumbai outlet, Shiva Prakash, one of the owners (the others being Hajiali Noufal and Vimal Kumar), clarifies that this is a branch of the Kochi eatery with the same name.The men behind the eatery (from left) Shiva Prakash, Hajiali Noufal and Vimal KumarThe pizza, pav bhaji and sandwich were piping hot and came in quick succession. The pizza base was crisp and the cheese a melting blanket that covered the veggies. The sandwich had a nice minty flavour, which on investigation turned out to be the mint chutney smeared on the bread. The pav was soft and generously spread with butter, and the cheese took the edge of the bhajis bite. While the dishes were equally tasty, the highlight for me was the Carronge, with the sweetness of the carrot and orange chasing each other at each sip. The service was so quick that we are done in half an hour. The only downside was none of us felt up to coping with a dessert. As we left, my mother-in-law gave it her ultimate accolade, I am sure they used garlic but I never knew it.So I took a second trip, this time with my colleagues. We chose Sev Batatapuri, Chutney Cheese Grill sandwich, Vegetable Cheese Mix Roll and Mushroom Tava Pulao. The sev was fresh and crunchy and the potato mash tangy. The roll was neatly cut into manageable bite-sized pieces, which made it easier to share. Served with a sprinkling of grated cheese, both the roll and the sandwich were very tasty. The pulao, however, was a bit of a let down. Though hot, it didn't have any discernible flavour but was redeemed by the raita. Thick fresh curd, lightly seasoned and filled with chunks of cucumber and tomato, we requested for a second bowl to help us finish the rice.The highlight of this trip was the fruit with fresh cream. We ordered anjeer, mango and mixed fruit. The first two had the fruit pured along with the cream and topped with chopped bits, while the last had apple, banana, grape, kiwi, strawberry mixed with cream and served with a dash of cashew and raisins. As desserts go, all three were excellent. The sweetness came from the fruit and the cream was indeed fresh. There was no extra sugar to make the teeth tingle. Again the service was quick and efficient. We left barely 40 minutes after we entered.Food for thought Where: Haji Ali Fresh Fruit Juices, Uday Enclave, Venktachalam Street, off TV Samy Road West, RS PuramHits: Carronge, Cheese Pav Bhaji, Vegetable Cheese Sandwich, Mixed Fruit CreamMisses: Mushroom Tava PulaoCost for 2: Between 500 and 800 depending on your choicesContact: 0422-4371437A third visit was just for the the rose falooda was mildly sweet, fresh milk, vermicelli with rose syrup sticking to it... perfect for a hot summer evening.The Haji Ali special falooda: a meal in itselfSo if youre looking for a quick bite, tasty and filling but easy on the pocket, head to Haji Ali."
2019-04-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/such-a-simple-recipe-such-a-magical-result-kunal-vijayakar-on-mayonnaise/story-H99cePZ1DQ63s1kEaQudTN.html,Such a simple recipe; such a magical result: Kunal Vijayakar on mayonnaise,"Ive often extolled the virtues of eggs and the many-sidedness of this smooth and oval object. Talked about how the modest white and yolk, when artistically negotiated, can burgeon into a variety of dramatic forms, textures and tastes. One such gastronomic opera is performed when two seemingly straightforward and unassuming ingredients  vegetable oil and vinegar  have a bit of a skirmish with eggs in a bowl, to result in the most wondrous consequence: a luscious, bright, tangy and sweet emulsion called mayonnaise.Mayonnaise in a jar, off a shelf, was difficult to procure in the 70s, unless you had an uncle smuggling in foodstuff from abroad. So it was no big deal that my grandmother made mayo at home. It was just done. She would separate the yolks from the whites and drop them into a large Tupperware bowl. To that shed add a bit of vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard. Even mustard, in those days, was sold in powder form. The most popular being Colmans Dry Mustard Powder, and a local variant being Atlas Brand. Mustard powder is usually made of finely ground yellow, brown and black mustard seeds and needs to be mixed with cold water and set aside for the mustard to catalyse and erupt with that unmistakable kick. Of course that was then; today you can just inflict a few helpings of mustard straight out of a tube or a bottle.So with three or four egg yolks, vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard in a bowl, my grandmother would instruct me to hold the basin at an angle while she simultaneously did two things. With a hand mixer in her right hand, shed start blending the yolks and condiments, while with her left hand shed start dripping measured vegetable oil from a large cup slowly into the swirling recipe. Lo and behold, as she got to the end of the oil, the vigorous liquid ingredients would start getting stable as if by magic and turn into a calm creamy emulsion of golden yellow.The mayonnaise my grandmum made, and my mum after her, was unlike the white mildly sour mayo that you can buy ready-made in a jar or a bottle. This mayonnaise was bright yellow, translucent, sticky, gooey, and sweet, with a sharp slam of mustard. And with this sauce we made the most memorable chicken mayo sandwiches and rolls. A simple soft bread roll stuffed with boiled or roasted chicken, a crisp cold frond of lettuce tucked in sideways and dressed with this homemade mayonnaise that oozed out from the side of the bread and your mouth when you took a bite.Paradise Restaurant in Colaba used to make these chicken rolls best, but now that Paradise is lamentably lost, the iconic J Hearsch and Co at Hill Road, Bandra, makes unarguably the finest chicken rolls on both sides of the sea link. Theres no lettuce in their chicken rolls, but they are stunning. Soft bread generously filled with both chicken and mayo, moist and fresh. Fresh is important, because unlike the mayo you buy in a bottle, this mayo needs to be made fresh and consumed fresh. If you ask Melvin DSa, who runs the bakery, anything about his mayonnaise, he suddenly goes coy and silent. Then, with a sly smile, he admits that the recipe is a huge secret and their mayo is clandestinely prepared in his kitchen at home and then brought to the bakery, so that not even the staff know how it is made.Well, I dont really want to know how he makes the mayo, as long as he keeps making it the way they do. Just across from Hearsch is a 60-year-old hole in the wall. Its called A-1 Bakery. They too make chicken rolls and their mayo too is from a similar recipe. After youve stood in a sweaty queue, the man behind the counter freshly fills warm bread with chicken and mayo and serves it wrapped in butter paper, on order. A-1 Bakerys mayo packs a substantial punch. It has a sharp mustard taste that cuts the sweetness of the sauce and is a joy to bite into.But if you cant be bothered to make the mayo yourself, and getting Hearsch to divulge the recipe proves hopeless, Ratan Tata Institute (RTI, as it is popularly known) often sell a tub-full. You can make your own sandwiches or dress old-fashioned salads, like a Summer Salad (lettuce, cress, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, radishes, cucumber and mayo) or an old club-style Potato Salad (boiled potato, dill, celery, onion, mustard, pepper and mayonnaise) or a Russian Salad, also known as an Oliver Salad, originally invented by Lucien Olivier in Moscow in the 1860s (potato, carrot, boiled egg, French beans and peas in a mayonnaise dressing). Or just simply boil some eggs and smear them with mayonnaise! By the way, do you know what my favourite law is? Its Cole Slaw!First Published: Apr 19, 2019 16:22 IST"

But the price of the citrus fruit has skyrocketed in a month on account of the increasing demand for lemons in the city. One kg lemon, which was sold at `30 in March, is now priced at `90 in the Ernakulam retail market.The wholesale price has also increased to `75 per kg, traders said. The price of a single lemon, depending on size, hovers between `4 and `8.The lemons sold at our market mainly arrive from Andhra Pradesh. The supply from Tamil Nadu has fallen these days as the mercury levels are soaring there. They are now supplying to us only after catering to their local market needs, said Ernakulam Market Stall Owners president K K Ashraf.Earlier, nearly 1,000 sacks of lemon used to be brought to the Ernakulam market. Now, owing to the shortage, hardly 500 sacks are brought daily, contributing to the increase in price.Vegetable price upThe price of other vegetables has also increased by 30 per cent in April, say vendors. On market days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday), 12 loads of vegetables, including potato and onion, are brought to the Ernakulam market.The price of big onion is almost steady. In March, the price of one kg of big onion was `12. Now, it has increased only to `16. The price of drumstick is steady at `25 per kg. Other vegetables, however, saw a 30 per cent hike in prices compared to March, said Ashraf. Among the vegetables, the price of beans is leaping towards the `100 per kg mark, which is almost double its price in March.The rise in temperature in farming areas has not had a huge impact on the production of root or tuber crops like potato, beetroot and carrots. However, green vegetables like cowpea, okra, beans and brinjal have been affected. The retail price of beans has already touched `100 per kg mark.Domestic productionAfter the intensive drive carried out by the state government to encourage organic farming, there has been an increase in domestic production of vegetables.In fact, the domestic production has helped in meeting nearly 25 per cent of the states vegetable requirement. However, the post-flood conditions and strong summer waves have adversely affected the production of vegetables in the state, forcing it to depend on vegetables from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka."

The dried-up farms have been cleared and the farmers are waiting for summer rain to start the first sowing season. The temperature is high, which, the residents say, is a fallout of the recent massive wildfires in the nearby grantis and eucalyptus plantations. Unlike in the past, there has been no rain so far in this cool-season vegetable cultivating village, where the temperature had fallen to -3 Celsius during the winter.We usually sow seeds in April, after the summer rain, so that harvesting can be done by August/September. However, there has been no rainfall so far and the seeds will dry up if we sow them now, says Palaniyappan, an aged farmer.He says there has been a rise in temperature level and it may affect vegetable cultivation in future. Already, area under cultivation has shrunk as grantis and eucalyptus have replaced vegetable farms. Farmers turn to grantis cultivation as it requires less care and the timber could be sold in five years period, he says. Shortage of water, he adds, has not only affected cultivation but also hit their daily lives. There is a severe depletion in groundwater level, which is attributed to the spread of grantis cultivation.Drought situationGrama panchayat president P. Ramaraj says water is being supplied in tanker lorries. All the streams in the village have dried up and with the mercury rising there is a drought situation. Wildfires have aggravated the situation.A member of the Vattavada Cool-Season Vegetable Producers Marketing Society says they have cleared the land expecting summer rain. However, the sowing season has been delayed and it would delay the harvesting season as well. Cultivation is taken up in large areas during the first farming season and only in limited areas where water is available in the second and the third seasons.CropsThe main crop in the first season is garlic, besides potato, cabbage, carrot and beans. The farmers solely depend on rain for sowing. For long, they have been demanding construction of check-dams on forest streams, which get flooded in the rainy season.All the three seasons had been productive in the past as water was available and it is the grantis cultivation that has affected the natural seasonal cultivation at Vattavada. In this rain-shadow area, the northeast monsoon is more active than the southwest monsoon."

What is the use of opening bank accounts under Jan-Dhan scheme when there is no money in it? complained Noor Bano.At Ahmedgarh, Bhola Ram said izzat ghar (toilets), under the governments campaign for making the region open defecation-free, were being made in homes of those who are government servants or close to the ruling party.Same billAt the Daulatpur booth, Shamshad, a barber, was livid with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Of course, the electricity meters have been installed but the bill always reads Rs. 800, irrespective of the usage. At the ration shop, often our thumb impressions dont match or we are told that towers (Internet connection) are not there. This is the reality of digital India.Where is the alternative, asked Kushal Pal Singh in Bhakri village of Hathras (reserved) constituency. I agree potato farmers are suffering and the promise of doubling the farmers income seems like a dream but if the gathbandhan (Opposition alliance) comes to power, we will have Prime Ministers on a weekly basis.GST woesIn Aligarh, on Subhash Road that connects the Muslim-dominated Upper Fort area to the rest of the city, Vivek Varshney, who runs a pharmacy shop, said after casting his vote, the GST has harmed our business but the important thing is during the Modi rule Muslims dont show their muscle on the street like they used to during the SP or BSP rule.In the Jama Masjid area, locals complain that the unorganised lock industry is suffering because of demonetisation and GST. Plus, the administration sides with the majority community on every issue, alleged Mohd. Tahir, who runs a hardware business.  Dange nahin huye (There were no riots) but what to expect when chor ke haath main tarazu hai (when the balance of justice lies in the hands of the culprit), remarked Babbu Khan, waiting for his turn at the Lutfiya Junior High School.Interestingly, Aligarh Muslim University Students Union President Salman Imtiaz could be seen in queue to vote at the booth.Last year, after the protest over the Jinnah portrait, AMU Students Union, for the first time, elected Salman Imitiaz, a non-residential candidate, as its president, arguably to create a connection between the campus and the city. Mr. Imitaz said it was a coincidence but it did give the community the confidence to resist the fascist forces.All quiet in AMUMeanwhile it was all quiet on the AMU campus. Asmer Baig, Professor of Political Science at the university, said AMU was not a vote bank for any party. It was just used by the BJP for political gain like they did with JNU. The BJP had managed to create a sense of victimhood in the majority community."

APSir  It was one of the greatest moments in sports history when the golfing legend, Tiger Woods, who is well past his prime, won his fifth Masters title and his 15th Major tournament after more than a decade (Tiger, Tiger burning bright: 11-year-old Major drought ends, April 15). At the age of 43, Woods became the second-oldest winner of the Masters, after Jack Nicklaus, who won it in 1986 at the age of 46.Woodss feat reminded us of the struggles and controversies he faced in his personal and professional life. He underwent four back surgeries and endured global scrutiny with regard to his troubled married life. But it seems he was preparing for redemption over all these years. Now he is at the top of his game again.Golf is not for the faint-hearted. It is for the patient few who have the highest concentration levels and are not easily flustered. Winning again in Augusta must have felt like a homecoming of sorts for Woods. His remarkable comeback has been appreciated by numerous sports lovers, including the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, and his predecessor, Barack Obama. With this 15th career major, Tiger may be already eyeing Nicklauss record of 18 such wins. He deserves the best wishes from his fans across the world.Khokan Das,CalcuttaSir  The epoch-making comeback of Tiger Woods after an 11-year-long lean period has proved that he is one of the best golfers of the 21st century. This was his fifth Masters title. At the age of 43, being the second-oldest holder of such a title is no mean feat. Future sportspersons  or indeed professionals in any discipline  who face struggle and wish to reclaim their lost glory can now look to Woodss perseverance, grit and tenacity for inspiration.If Woods can regain the number one position in golf this time, then it will be a feat that no one before him will have achieved. There is a strong likelihood, in that case, that he will be regarded as an all-time great of the game.Chanchal Nandy,West BurdwanToo dependentSir  Young people today have developed a disturbing level of dissociation from society, and begun to lack social awareness. They are far too dependent on the internet. This has led to them being transformed into couch potatoes who get whatever information they need at their fingertips within seconds. They spend hours daily on social media platforms and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Tinder and YouTube.There is no denying the fact that the internet is very useful, but nothing in excess can be good. Constantly being glued to the internet is spoiling the reading and writing skills of young people. This, in turn, is contributing to their lack of confidence and their inability to take to public speaking. It is ironic that the internet is connecting them to all parts of the world through various apps, but distancing them steadily from their own families and dear friends. Things have come to such a pass that young people feel restless if they have to spend even a small amount of time without their mobile phones, tablets or computers.We must remember that the internet was developed to make human lives easier, not to alienate people from one another or discourage them from thinking.Rituparna Saha,DehradunRight stepSir  It was heartening to learn that the New Zealand Parliament passed a law banning all semi-automatic guns by an outstanding majority. This step, taken by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, after the Christchurch attacks, could go a long way in preventing the illicit stockpiling of firearms.There is a reported estimate of about 875 million firearms in the world, many of which are acquired illegally. The arms trafficking business accounts for up to $60 billion. As such, New Zealands course of action can pave the way for a proper screening of the firearms business and control arms trafficking.Rajorshi Ghosh,Hooghly"
2019-04-21,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/apr/21/the-kids-use-tiktok-now-because-data-mined-videos-are-so-much-fun-1967072.html,The kids use TikTok now because data-mined videos are so much fun,"By BloombergMost nights, from around 7 till midnight, Sydney Jade is on TikTok, the smartphone app of the moment. The platinum blond teenager films herself singing show tunes, doing jumping jacks, and joking around with store clerks at a Walmart not far from her home in Oklahoma. Her short music videos and livestreams are popularJade has 284,000 followers, some of whom periodically send her virtual gifts, like 99 Rainbow Puke stickers.Jades parents resisted TikTok at first. They hadnt heard of the app and, Jade says, didnt like the idea of strangers watching me sing alone in front of the pink curtains in my bedroom. But she convinced them that TikTok was friendlier for kids than other apps like Facebook. They let her join last year, just as, it seems, every other teenager signed on as well. In January, TikTok was the most downloaded app in the Android and iPhone stores, according to research firm Sensor Tower Inc.The story sounds a lot like the rise of other social media powers such as Instagram and Snapchat, both of which pitched themselves as alternatives to Facebooks big blue app. But TikTok wasnt created by Stanford students Mark Zuckerberg could buy off or spend into the ground. Its a subsidiary of a Beijing startup, Bytedance Ltd., thats built a collection of valuable apps in China powered by vast troves of data and sophisticated artificial intelligence. Last year, Bytedances investors valued the company at $75 billion, the most of any startup in the world.Inevitably, especially in the age of Donald Trump, TikToks fast growth and Chinese ownership have made it the subject of scrutiny. Last month, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), ordered Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., a little-known Chinese gaming company that bought the very well-known gay-dating app Grindr, to sell the business over apparent concerns that Chinese intelligence agencies could potentially use data from the app to blackmail users. In an April 1 filing, the company said its in talks with CFIUS. U.S. authorities havent said theyre investigating Bytedance in connection with its ownership, but the companys large user base could conceivably make it a target. Social media platforms are increasingly considered sensitive by CFIUS, says Farhad Jalinous, chair of the national security and CFIUS practice at law firm White & Case LLP. Bytedance says it now stores all TikTok data outside of China and that the Chinese government has no access. (The companys privacy policy had previously warned users it could share their information with its Chinese businesses, as well as law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so.)Separately, TikTok has faced concerns over privacy and child safety. In February, Bytedance was fined $5.7 million by the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that Musical.ly, which Bytedance bought and renamed TikTok, illegally collected information from minors. It was the largest FTC penalty in a childrens privacy case.The settlement didnt scare off Bytedances investors or the company itself, which is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise on Facebook in the hope of luring away more users. Over the past three months, for instance, 13 percent of all the ads seen by users of Facebooks Android app were for TikTok, says app-analytics firm Apptopia.The result is that Bytedance has had more success outside of China than any previous Chinese internet company, including Baidu and Tencent. The TikTok app and its Chinese version have been installed more than a billion times. (It has no relation to TicToc, Bloomberg LPs breaking news network.) Late last year, executives told investors that they expect $18 billion in revenue this year and $29 billion in 2020, according to people familiar with its finances who arent authorized to discuss the company publicly. Bytedance will become a global player, says Hans Tung, managing partner of GGV Capital, one of the companys backers. Its just a matter of when.Bytedances Beijing headquarters, a former aerospace museum with 50-foot glass skylights, is a celebration of the companys frantic pace. On a January afternoon, a video in the cafeteria asked workers to share New Years resolutions and regrets. Most seemed to involve workaholism. To my ex, Im sorry I was too busy at work, one employee said. Im sorry to my kids that Im never home, another message lamented.The corporate culture is intense even by the standards of Chinese startups. Employee performance goals are published internally via a mobile app the company created called Lark and are reviewed every other month. In an interview, Bytedances senior vice president for corporate development, Liu Zhen, mentions that founder and Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming likes to travel to the West when the Beijing office shuts down during Chinese holidays. So he can keep working, she explains. Zhang declined interview requests.Now 36, he started Bytedance in 2012, in an apartment near Beijings Tsinghua University. One of its first apps, Neihan Duanzi (implied jokes), used AI to tailor a selection of memes to individual users tastes. The effect was irreverentthink of Reddit, but a little bit grosser and more personaland the app attracted tens of millions of users. Bytedance used the same approach to develop a news app, Jinri Toutiao (todays headlines), which became Chinas largest news site, with more than 700 million users. The success prompted acquisition offers from Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, all of which Zhang declined.Then in 2016 it launched a short-video app in China called Douyin that allowed users to add music and animations. The following year, it created an international version, TikTok. Users who open TikTok are confronted with an endless feed of short, full-screen videos, generally set to music. Tapping on a magnifying glass icon reveals TikToks Discover page, which displays a carousel of videos under trending hashtags. These are internet memes such as #potatoportrait, where users apply makeup to potatoes, or #simbachallenge, which asks them to reenact an iconic Lion King scene.Although these features make TikTok feel similar to Facebook, Instagram, and Snap, the app doesnt rely on social connections to figure out what to show you when you open it. Instead, TikTok decides what videos to show by tapping into data, starting with your location. Then, as you start watching, it analyzes the faces, voices, music, or objects in videos you watch the longest. Liking, sharing, or commenting improves TikToks algorithm further. Within a day, the app can get to know you so well it feels like its reading your mind. Thats why Jade, the Oklahoma teen, mostly sees videos of people dancing, while her mom regularly gets clips of dog tricks.Another way TikTok differs from big American social media apps, which largely grew through word of mouth, is that its expansion didnt happen entirely through the magic of viral marketing. Although the app initially took off in India and Southeast Asia, it struggled to attract users in the U.S. and Europe. In November 2017, Bytedance paid about $800 million for Musical.ly, a music video app that had more than 100 million users. A few months later, those users would find the old Musical.ly app replaced with one bearing TikToks neon logo instead. The app suddenly had a substantial footprint in the U.S. Musical.ly believed in organic growth, and that worked great with early adopters, says GGV Capitals Tung, who also invested in Musical.ly. TikTok is more based on algorithm recommendations and paid growth, meaning ads on Facebook and elsewhere.It wasnt real, but it could have been, and I got scaredUnlike on other platforms, where trends bubble up from users posts, many of TikToks trending hashtags are created by the companys marketers. Ahead of its U.S. launch, Bytedance hired about 40 social media celebrities to make videosincluding YouTube comedian David Dobrikpaying each tens of thousands of dollars. Some contracts required the influencers to ask their YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram fans to move over to TikTok.Bytedance still makes most of its money in China, where its short-video app charges advertisers 15 percent of what influencers get paid to promote brands. TikTok also takes a cut from the sale of digital coins that fans buy for creators during livestreamed videos.In theory, relying more on professionally created content should make TikTok safer than Twitter or Facebook are. But users say livestreams are peppered with lewd acts and vulgar comments. That can be terrifying for children. Jade, the Oklahoma teen, says she recently cut short a live appearance after commenters said they knew where she lived and threatened to kill her dog. It wasnt real, but it could have been, and I got scared, she says. In February a 35-year-old man was accused by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department of posing as a 13-year-old boy to send sexual messages to at least 21 girls on TikTok. Police said he showed up at the home of one of his alleged victims, a 9-year-old.In response to the FTC settlement, TikTok began requiring users in some countries, including the U.S., to input their birthdays, denying entry to the full-feature app to those who say theyre under 13. It also started using facial-recognition software to identify youthful faces, expelling underage creators, and preventing younger viewers from seeing mature content.Its too soon to say whether these changes will work, but TikTok has won cautious praise from some child safety advocates who say its challenges are similar to those facing other platforms, but that the stakes are higher because of its younger audience. Three years ago, we were having a really hard time trying to pin them down and get them to do the right thing, says Julie Inman Grant, commissioner of Australias eSafety Office, a government agency. Theyre starting to be more responsible.Bytedance is aiming for more than mere social responsibility. The companys long-term goal is to eliminate objectionable content entirely, to be controversy-free, as Tung, the investor, puts it. Its a uniquely Chinese censorship strategydistinct from the hands-off approach of Bytedances American counterparts, who tend to express support for almost unrestricted free speech. (Zuckerberg once famously said that Holocaust denial should be permitted on Facebook.) Last year, Zhang issued a public apology after media regulators shut down the jokes app for hosting vulgar content. The company hired thousands of people to police content, giving preference to Communist Party members, and invested more money in developing algorithms to screen posts.Today, Bytedances AI screens videos as theyre posted, automatically removing content without waiting for user complaints. The ambition, says Raj Mishra, TikToks head of operations in India, is to be a one-stop entertainment platform where people come to have fun rather than creating any political strife. He makes no attempt to defer to the freedoms of speech and expression that are written into the constitution of the worlds largest democracy. When asked if TikTok would allow criticism of, for example, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to be prominently featured in the app, Mishra answers, No. In mid-April, Google and Apple app stores blocked new downloads of TikTok in India after a court asked the government to ban the app over concerns about pornography. Bytedance is fighting the action.Whether Bytedance ultimately succeeds will depend in large part on its ability to attract older users with more spending power. TikTok has been encouraging cooking, travel, and sports videos designed for those crowds. At the same time, its adding thousands of employees to its 40,000-person staff and pumping hundreds of millions of dollars more into ad campaigns. Its also working on a search engine, a way for livestreamers to sell products, and a Slack-like chat service for businesses.According to people familiar with the company, executives have met with bankers to discuss going public. (The company denies it has plans for a public offering.) Bytedance was set to lose about $1 billion in 2018, according to another person familiar with its financials.Even so, the companys global ambitions have been enough to get the attention of Facebook, which released a TikTok-like app, Lasso, in late 2018. While only 70,000 people have downloaded it so far, according to Sensor Tower, Facebook has had success knocking off competitors apps in the past. The company released several Snapchat clones before successfully copying its most popular feature, Stories, within Instagram. That caused Snaps growth to slow, and Instagrams to take off.Zuckerberg seemed to acknowledge the threat posed by Bytedance and other Chinese upstarts last year during a U.S. Senate hearing in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, threw him a softball, offering that Zuckerbergs rise from college dropout to technology mogul might have a patriotic element.Only in America, Sullivan said. Would you agree with that?Senator, mostly in America, Zuckerberg offered, noting that there are some very strong Chinese internet companies.Youre supposed to answer yes to this question, said Sullivan.Back in Oklahoma, Jade isnt sweating geopolitics or regulation, and shes mostly off Facebook and Snapchat. On TikTok, she applies a fresh coat of candy apple lipstick and lip-syncs to Keliss Milkshake while dancing behind a J.C. Penney cash register.There are nasty people here and there, she says of her experience using the app. But for the most part, its just a fun, friendly place."

So far, we have seen two phases of the elections in different states. The Big Bang of the election is Prime Minister Narendra Modi. For the opposition, he is the main agenda, how does one oust him in order to get the throne in South Block back. For the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the issue is also Modi. He remains the brand equity of the party.The Sangh Parivar votebank argues that Modi is the victim. Lutyens' Delhi doesn't like him, as he isn't elitist. Modi wants to break away from the status quo of Delhi's ancient political corruption. The BJP clientele remains active in supporting him. It is Modi around whom the main polarisation is taking place. The so-called Left Liberal public intellectual, and the secular civil society remain highly intolerant regarding the intolerance of the Modi-era. On the other hand, the BJP thinks that in all the seats in the country, where the BJP is contesting, it is Modi who is contesting.ALSO READ: Willing to take on Narendra Modi in Varanasi constituency, says PriyankaIn Indian politics, this extreme either-or situation has ironically happened only in the last few decades. That is, with Mrs Indira Gandhi. The Congress campaigned for her, with their slogan of 'garibi hatao' and it was the Left which was the demon. This ademonology', this politics of aothering', isn't new in India. It is like the pendulum of an old clock. It swings to one extreme, before moving to the other. It was anti-Congressism in 1967, reaching its extreme in 1989. Then, the BJP took the Congress space and the anti-BJPism started in full swing when Vajpayee was the PM.The Modi-era is a new phenomenon. The idea: a strong leader, with strong Hindu nationalism to back him, supported by a strong economy. In spite of all discontent, one has to accept that the economic conditions appear favourable to rapid growth in the country. The market has sensed it today, signs of upward movement in the market are there and the scene of market inflow seems positive.It remains a fact that while travelling in different villages in the country, several of Modi government's schemes - Swacch Bharat, LPG supply to rural areas, housing programmes, Modi's health care programme, the opening of Jan Dhan accounts - have all had a positive impact on the lives of the poor. These aren't very exciting hot potatoes for us in the media - but the actual beneficiaries might have a different reaction.ALSO READ: If Modi becomes PM again, he will definitely be Hitler of India, says SiddaramaiahSitting in Delhi, this, is something we might forget and fail to understand.But it is also true that there is a strong sense of discontent in the urban populace over job creation. Price rise and unemployment have, like always, been the opposition's weapons. Jawaharlal Nehru would write letters to all his chief ministers, from the early days of 1947 till the last day in office in 1964, that 'employment, poverty alleviation, price rise' were the main challenges of the country. Over 70 years later, we are still fighting the issue and no one has figured out where the magic lantern remains hidden.The anti-Pakistan Balakot strike did change the election narrative. Modi and BJP were aggressive on national security and on Hindu nationalism. The opposition became defensive. Rahul Gandhi's Rafael issue became a non-starter. But after two phases of elections in Delhi, a lot of people asked me, ""Is there a change in milieu? Is the nationalism plank down? Imran Khan said Modi should come to power, so they can start the dialogue. Did that spoil the BJP's anti-Pakistan stand.""Be that as it may, I think that in these elections it remains Advantage-Modi. There is no tsunami in favour of Modi, like what we've seen in 2014. But after completing two phases of elections, the unanswered question is still there: What is the alternative?ALSO READ: Idea of smart city not clear even to Narendra Modi, says Digvijaya SinghRahul Gandhi got the opportunity and he started well. The 2014 perception of him was very different from earlier, when the BJP had campaigned successfully against him, rendering him a 'pappu'. I took Rahul Gandhi's interview in 2014 for Anandabazar Patrika. I found him to be intelligent and a thorough gentleman. Even he told me that he was fighting against a hologram created by Modi and the BJP. He was the general of the party, so he didn't admit, but my impression through the conversation remained that he understood the situation and the fate of the 2014 polls before the results were announced.This time he has been more serious, more deliberate. His interactions abroad also got him momentum. His image was calibrated away from what was, to a more serious general of a party. But then again, he has fallen into the old trap.His main mistake was to not form an opposition-front before the election. Mamata Banerjee's proposal was to form a loose federation. At the time, Rahul Gandhi ignored not just Mamata, but also Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Congress thought that the 'Aklo Cholo (Go alone)' policy' would be more useful than a compromise formula with regional forces. Rahul Gandhi thought that an alliance with regional parties would be a liability. Congress may get more seats in the country if they don't go for a new Federal Front like UPA III. Actually, this overconfidence of Rahul Gandhi will spoil the opposition unity index further. He got into an alliance with N. Chandrababu Naidu in Telangana, but this became counterproductive - its impact stretching to Andhra Pradesh.ALSO READ: Rahul Gandhi to be PM if Congress gets maximum number of seats, says Rajya Sabha MP Anand SharmaThe victories in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh assembly elections disturbed Rahul Gandhi's long term strategy for 2019. In the Hindi-heartland, the Congress is in a sorry state: it is a poor No. 4. Ask Mayawati - the Congress is untouchable. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra landed with a message of sibling solidarity, but ask the local Congress worker, it is too little too late.It is clear that in this election, it is not just Mamata-Mayawati-Akhilesh Yadav or even Tejashwi Yadav who are fighting against Narendra Modi. These regional leaders are giving it their all.But where is the Congress? Where is Rahul Gandhi?(The views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to senior journalist Jayanta Ghosal, and not necessarily to organisation, committee or other group or individual.)"
2019-04-23,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/favourable-temperature-brings-cheer-to-farmers/article26917002.ece,Favourable temperature brings cheer to farmers,"The rise in temperature has wreaked havoc on agriculture sector, but farmers in Talavadi hills is feeling less heat as they are getting good price for the vegetables, mainly cabbage.Favourable temperature in the hills has helped the farmers to cultivate cabbage, potato, carrot, beans, beetroot, ladys finger, small onion and tomatoes in their land that vary from one acre to 2.5 acre.Apart from this, marigold, tapioca, sugarcane and a few other crops are also cultivated in the hills. Traders procure the produce farm from the farmers and sell it at markets in Erode, Mettupalayam, Coimbatore and in Kerala.Poor monsoon, prevailing intense heat and shortage of water led to drop in the cultivation areas, said S. Manickam, president of theTalavadi Farmers Association. He said that traders purchase vegetables from farmers at cabbage (Rs. 12 to Rs. 14 a kg), tomato (Rs. 28 to Rs. 30 a kg) and beans (Rs. 50 to Rs. 55 a kg). Crops are cultivated in less than 500 acre now, he added.Cabbage is usually purchased for Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 a kg from the farmers. Later, they started cultivating alternative vegetables leading to drop in cabbage cultivation.Gurusamy of Gumatapuram, who owns two acre, said that currently 25,000 cabbage plants were cultivated in his field and there is a good demand for the produce. It is a 90-day crop and the climate is not conducive now.After harvesting the crop now, we will start cultivating cabbage only during rainy season that begins from August, he added.Another farmer said that in the absence of check dams, rain water from the hills enter Chikkahole Dam in Chamrajnagar district of Karnataka.Five to seven small check dams were constructed without storage facilities and water from Neithalapuram easily enters the dam, said V. Ramadurai of Susaipuram. He said that if rain water is stored, farming activities could be done throughout the year which will ensure the livelihood of farmers.The hill has been receiving good rainfall in the past three days and farmers expressed hope for a good harvest season."

The officers came inside a cinema theatre and took the money out and kept it in the car. I am not afraid of any inquiry. The Deputy Commissioner had checked my vehicle and the escort a few hours earlier on that day.He also wanted to know why the officers did not conduct raids on properties belonging to BJP functionaries despite repeated complaints. We had given complaints to the Deputy Commissioner on BJP leaders. But, no action was taken. Instead, houses of many innocent JD(S) leaders were raided, he alleged. The Minister maintained that those who conducted search operations in the house of a priest at Haradanahalli were indeed IT people.The Chief Electoral Officer in Karnataka was also acting in favour of the BJP, he alleged. Once the scrutiny of the nomination papers was over, there should be no room for petitions raising doubts over the papers. But here, repeatedly notices were served on our candidate. This was only to disturb us in the campaign, he said.Seed procurementThe Minister reiterated that the BJPs efforts to destabilise the coalition government would not succeed.Regarding the procurement of seed potatoes for Hassan, he said he had held several meetings on this issue before the elections were declared.

The BSP as well as the Congress decided not to contest from the seat.BJPs nominee Jagdev Singh Yadav did not show up to file his nomination on the last day and independent candidates withdrew from the race following which Dimple Yadav was elected unopposed.However, the family faced a brief moment of scare in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when the BJP, fighting the SP on every booth, took the contest to a near photo finish. Dimple managed to win despite the Modi wave but the margin dropped to less than 20,000 votes against BJPs Subrat Pathak. BJP STEPS UP CAMPAIGN The close contest gave BJP the confidence that it can pull off a major upset in 2019. If SP loses this seat, it would mean Akhilesh Yadav has lost, says Vijay Mishra of Kanpatiyapur village.Last week, BJP president Amit Shah was in Kanpur to review the 10 seats in the Kanpur-Bundelkhand region. Kannauj was the only seat which the BJP could not win and Shah told his team that winning the SP bastion was a priority this time, said a BJP leader not willing to be named.The Kannauj Lok Sabha constituency has always been prestigious for the Yadav clan. While the SP is banking on its goodwill and the work done by the party in the last two decades, BJP candidate Subrat Pathak is asking voters to vote for the ghar ka ladka (local) instead of baharwale (outsiders). Cars engaged for campaigning have been withdrawn and workers have been asked to use motorcycles to go from village to village to reach out to more people, a party leader said. SOCIAL ENGINEERING The party is also using social engineering to strengthen its vote bank this time. It is time to align the non-Jatav Scheduled Castes. They comprise about 14% besides the non-Yadav OBCs like Kushwaha which comprise about 10%, the party leader cited above said.The idea is to counter SPs Muslim-Yadav-Jatav combination with BJPs own social engineering along with an appeal in the name of Narendra Modi, which worked well last time when SP contested without the Jatavs. This time too, Modi is central to the partys campaign and workers are seeking votes in his name. They avoid talking about BJPs achievements but stress on nationalism, Balakot and surgical airstrikes. SP BANKING ON PAST PERFORMANCE, GOODWILL To counter the BJP, SPs campaign revolves around the development work done by it in Kannauj in the last 20 years and targets the BJP government for not fulfilling its promises.The government announced to buy potato from farmers for a minimum support price of Rs 480 per 50 kg but not a single kilo was bought from them, says Khalilur Rahman, a poll analyst.The failure of the state government to check stray cattle menace is another big issue in Kannauj villages, he adds.Kamal Gupta, who teaches at a degree college, feels shelving of the projects brought to Kannauj by Akhilesh Yadav could also put the BJP on a sticky wicket.The ambitious international perfume park, aimed at giving perfumers a global platform has been junked. The construction of a potato mandi along the expressway stopped after the BJP government came to power in the state in 2017.The government hasnt even started the construction work of a hostel for regional engineering college started by Akhilesh Yadav, says Surendra Sahu.The BJP put up a spectacular fight in 2014 but it did not dampen the goodwill of the Yadav clan. The BJP can thank the caste alignment and loss of Bharthana assembly segment in the reconstruction of Kannauj Lok Sabha seat, he adds.Bharthana, now a part of the Etawah seat, has Yadavs in majority.First Published: Apr 27, 2019 12:19 IST"

2019-04-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/how-a-gujarat-town-handled-a-hot-potato-by-getting-rid-of-it-5698658/,How a Gujarat town handled a hot potato: By getting rid of it,"Deesa, the potato bowl of Gujarat, has lost its most striking landmark  a giant sculpture of a potato, held up by two hands  to a belief that it was cursed.AdvertisingDeesas potato chowk, or bataka circle as it is popularly called in Gujarati, got its name from this giant sculpture at the entrance of the town in Banaskantha district, with the potato greeting visitors to Gujarat ni bataka nagri (Gujarats potato city).But one day, sometime last month, the replica was gone  falling victim to a growing belief among potato farmers, traders and cold storage owners in Banaskantha district that the sculpture had brought them ill-luck and that they had incurred losses, year after year, since it came up four years ago, in 2015. Whats now left of the replica is a platform on which the potato once stood.Though the Deesa Cold Storage Association, which installed the sculpture in 2015, removed it ostensibly because it would have come in the way of a flyover on the national highway between Palanpur and Deesa, WhatsApp groups in the region have been aflutter with farmers excitedly sharing prices of rising potato prices since the sculpture was removed.AdvertisingIn March 2014, potato prices at the Deesa mandi averaged Rs 8.55 per kg, before climbing to Rs 16.99 by July. But in 2015 and in the following years, farmers had to bear huge losses as their produce fetched Rs 1-3 per kg against a production cost of Rs 5-6 per kg, a fall that was then attributed to a number of factors, including water scarcity and the 2016 demonetisation that is said to have affected the 2017 season of the crop. In 2017-18, too, prices hovered around the Rs 3-per-kg mark. Farmers and traders did their best to ride out the storm  including stocking their produce in cold storages, in the hope of selling it when prices picked up  but when nothing worked, they identified the scourge: the potato at the chowk.Says Deesa Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) director Babubhai Desai, This is their dharmik manyata (religious belief). Everyone  farmers and traders, both big and small, those not only from Deesa but the entire district  had started believing that after the statue was installed in 2015, (wholesale) prices of potato have been crashing. It came down to as low as Rs 1 per kg that year.Deesa Cold Storage Association president Ganpath Kachhava says the association had put up the around 15-foot-tall sculpture in 2014-15 at a cost of Rs 10 lakh. We went with a design and model of the bataka (potato) statue to then chief minister Anandiben Patel, says Kachhava, adding that it was removed because it was too tall for the flyover.Deesa APMC secretary Amrutbhai Joshi, however, denies that the replica was brought down to accommodate the flyover. It was not obstructing the flyover; it is simply about peoples beliefs. It is a fact that the prices were low as long as the replica was around and shot up after it was removed. For instance, the wholesale rate today is Rs 100-135 (per 20 kg); it was Rs 50-60 in 2018.Deesa BJP MLA Shashikant Pandya, who was among those the anguished farmers approached, says people were waiting for an opportunity to bring the potato replica down.Everybody believed the reason for the distress in the market was because of the potato sculpture. Farmers were very distressed over the last five years  potato prices dropped so much that people would not take it for free. Log bolne lage, nikalo, nikalo ise (People began to demand its removal). So the minute they learnt that a flyover was being built over the highway, somebody removed it overnight, he says.Pandya also insists that wholesale rates of potato have gone up since the sculpture was removed.While farmers in Deesa and the larger Banaskantha district have been struggling with low wholesale prices since 2015, many resorted to stocking their produce in cold storages as they waited for the tide to turn. But that did little to help  at Rs 3 per kg per season, warehouse rentals are usually higher than the rates their produce would have fetched in the market, thus forcing farmers to either not lift the stock from the warehouses or sell their potatoes to cold storage owners at throwaway prices.Of 450 cold storages in Gujarat, over 200, all privately owned, are in Banaskantha district alone. Of these, around 10 were forced to shut down late last year after running into losses.Dineshbhai Mali, 40, a small farmer from Malgadh village in Deesa, is glad the potato is out of sight. Mali, who in 2018 reduced the sowing area on his 5-acre field to half, says, We did not know who put it up and whom to approach for its removal. So we stayed quiet. But now that the bad omen has been removed, we have already started getting better prices for our produce."

Or, do you need to stock up on some flavourful ready-to-eat items since your week will be too busy at work? If you just said yes to any of these questions, then this newly-launched store in Koramangala might have answers. Nothing But Chicken (NBC) serves a variety of cooked, marinated and raw chicken. Claiming that their Halal and ISO 22000-certified chicken products are 100% natural, preservative and artificial colour-free, NBC delivered a few of their products for CE to try them out.First of all, NBC sells food by weight, not portion, and hence, buyers can try multiple options. What struck us was the freshness of the products. We first tried the marinated chicken breast with the Greek yoghurt and pepper. It was marinated with olive oil and all the essential spices, ready to be cooked, grilled or baked. So, we cooked it well in a greased pan on low flame, and it turned out to be one of those delicious chicken breast fillets that we have tasted at continental restaurants. Serve this with mashed potatoes and salads on the side, and it becomes a perfect lunch or dinner.The cheese and onion sausages, when cooked on medium heat, was soft and unlike other packaged sausages available in the market, these were of sizeable portions.If you are health-conscious, try their range of grilled chicken salads. These are ready-to-eat, high-protein salads that have been garnished with olive oil and contain some of the freshest vegetables to dig into. We tasted the Bistro Salad and loved the healthy combination. The chicken was sliced in thin cuts, making it easy to put the dish in a box and carry it along.Next, we heated the Angara Seekh Kebab in a pan for some time and boy, are they filling! With the right amount of spices and proper filling, they were some really great kebabs that we tried after a long time.NBC also sent over a box of raw chicken breasts and minced chicken that were only marinated wth masala, so they had to be cooked properly. It was surprising how smooth the process was, and for working professionals, this saves times immensely, and is healthy and fresh if kept properly refrigerated.For online orders and home delivery, log onto www.nbcindia.in.

Farmer groups across the political spectrum have joined a growing chorus of outrage on social media to demand that PepsiCo withdraw its rights infringement case.In an Ahmedabad civil court on Friday, PepsiCos lawyer offered a settlement on these terms: the farmers must give an undertaking that they will not use its registered variety and surrender their existing stocks, or must enter PepsiCos collaborative farming programme where farmers buy seeds from the company and sell produce back to it.The lawyer for the farmers said they would need time to consider the offer and to reply to the court. The next hearing is on June 12.We have not yet decided what to do about the offer, Haribhai Patel, a farmer, told The Hindu on the phone. He owns four acres of land planted with potatoes, and is one of the four farmers being sued for Rs. 1.05 crore in damages. We would like to fight. The company is harassing us. Just to come to Ahmedabad for this court case, I have to leave my fields and that hurts my livelihood.Last resortA company spokesperson said PepsiCo India had proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety. The company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming programme.PepsiCo has invoked Section 64 of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001 to claim infringement of its rights. However, farmers groups cite Section 39 of the same Act, which says that a farmer is allowed to save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share or sell his farm produce, including seed of a variety protected under this Act, so long as he does not sell branded seed.Farmers groups as well as the corporate farming industry see the case as a precedent that could have a far-reaching effect on how other food crops are developed, sown and sold.This is a test case that will affect all Indian farmers. It is a matter of seed sovereignty, food sovereignty and sovereignty of this country, said Kapilbhai Shah of the Gujarat farmers welfare group Jatan. For the farmer, it is do or die."
2019-04-27,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2019/apr/27/the-seeds-of-a-farming-disaster-1969499.html,The seeds of a farming disaster,"In a country infamous for farmer suicides and loan waivers, four Gujarati farmers were dragged to court by multinational food giant PepsiCo seeking Rs 1 crore from each, in damages. Their crime: Cultivating a registered variety of potato used to make Lays Chips. After the news angered many on social media, the company on Friday offered to make an out-of-court settlement.Farmer unions and activists slammed the legal action, calling it a move to intimidate small farmers. PepsiCo says it had registered under relevant laws to breed a special variety of potato used in the making of Lays Chips. Seed freedom activists claim that such practices put farmers at the mercy of corporate firms.Take the case of Bt cotton. The genetically modified seed introduced by an MNC agritech company, which cost much more than non-Bt varieties, was supposed to be pest-resistant. The farmers were not allowed to save or reuse the seeds. Seventeen years down the line, a pest called pink bollworm is wreaking havoc across Bt cotton fields in the country, especially in Telangana. American pink bollworm expert Bruce Tabashnik, in a recent interview to an Indian newspaper, said the problem is out of control in India, unlike in Arizona and China where non-Bt seeds were mixed to mitigate the problem. Today, more than 96 per cent of cotton grown in India is of Bt variety and non-Bt varieties are almost non-existent.Experts say the problem is the lack of a consistent policy response. In 2004, the then Union government attempted to criminalise the saving of traditional and heirloom variety of seeds by farmers. The move was later dropped after huge protests. A year later, Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001, came into force, providing some succour to troubled farmers. Still, the legislation has a long way to go in balancing trade and agrarian interests. Returning to the potato conundrum at hand, the terms of settlement offered by the company are simple: Sign a pact to buy seeds and sell potatoes only to Pepsico or give an undertaking to never use the registered seeds."

Cross the Lakhan gate into town and the invigorating smell of rose petals wafts into the nostrils.The imperial glory of Kannauj under emperor Harsha Vardhan is long gone; today the all intrusive city life hits one on the face, almost immediately. However, the usual hustle and bustle of a poll season is nowhere to be seen even in the bylanes, which hoard attar bottles.Yet, that Kannauj is at the epicentre of UP politics is clear from the fact that Mulayam Singh Yadavs daughter in law Dimple is in the fray in the Socialist bastion, where party ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia won an election in 1967.Like in 2014, its a straight fight between SPs Dimple Yadav and BJPs Subrat Pathak who lost last time narrowly by 19,000 votes.FOLLOW OUR FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HEREBy logic, with support from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Congress deciding not to field a candidate, Dimple should have an easy run. But the ground realities are different.Caste dynamics are a major factor in the constituency, which has elected both SP patriarch Mulayam and his son Akhilesh Yadav to Parliament earlier. Additionally, Kannauj has been an SP bastion since 1999, with the Yadav, Muslim and Dalit support base further bolstering the party cushion this time.Dimples rival Pathak rides on his personal popularity, besides the Modi factor  which is evident in both the rural and urban segments.Farmers of Tirwa  Anuj, 35 and Bansi, 39  feel that though stray animals are giving them sleepless nights, its an issue for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to handle, not the PM.We want to give Modi a second chance, they say in unison. Yet, there are issues which come to the fore during discussions. The recession-hit perfume industry, a potato glut and unemployment, being the major ones.Kannauj has over 200 small, medium and large manufacturing units of perfume. Traders, who export Attar worth Rs 100 crore annually, claim that the trade could not soar owing to government apathy.We dont want loans, but facilities, says Pawan Trivedi, secretary of the Attar and Perfumers Association.Non-availability of raw materials and a lack of support from an administration led the likes of Ram Sanehi to close down units in 2015.But despite all hardships, Nishish Tiwari, a perfume trader in the city, finds the ensuing battle in the constituency tightly poised between the BJP and the mahagthbandhan.On one hand, Modiji is popular, on the other, the SP has to save its bastion, he says.What do voters want? The question is mostly met with a cautious silence. No one speaks of support to one or the other party but Deshdeepak, 27, of Makrand Nagar, a suburb of Kannauj, feels cheated.Everyone promises jobs but no one delivers.Joining the conversation, trader Rajnarain Gupta says: The election is for the country and not forKannauj. Only this government has the courage to hit at terrorism.However, pitching for the mahagathbandhan, Ratan Lal a contract farmer says: the Mahagathbandhan is putting up a good fight. Akhilesh has done a lot. He has ensured that this region gets uninterrupted power supply. For us that is a big relief.Jalalabad, some 20 km away from Kannauj city, has a population of around 1200, most of whom are potato growers. Kush Har, who owns six bighas of land, has his own woes to relate.The government has announced that it will purchase our potato stocks. But they grade it before we can sell it, which hardly helps retrieve the input cost. We dont want to sell to the government.The issue of paucity of cold storage units to store the produce also comes up. In case of a glut, farmers are forced to leave the produce in the open.However, non-availability of the sitting MP is a common refrain, which goes against Dimple.The BJP has done good work and will reap benefits. They have fielded a local candidate who is available. He may have lost the previous election but is putting up a good fight this time, says Mukesh Tiwari, 38, a dhaba owner.Anurag Arora, vice president, UP Cold Storage Association, aptly summarised the dilemma of the Kannauj voter.Nearly 80% people of Kannauj are either dependent on the Attar business or are farmers. The electoral battle here is evenly poised because on one side, the SP has done good work here, on the other BJPs Subrat Pathak is popular.While caste arithmetic favours Dimple, young voters and the chemistry seem to favour the BJP candidate."

Behenji, which means sister, is how Mayawati is known in UP.I was not aware of my caste till Behenji, Akhilesh Yadav and Congress began mentioning it. I am grateful to them, yet I am not in caste politics. I ask them to not drag me into caste politics, Modi said. I am a backward but I want to take the country forward; my caste gets a mention when these people realise they are losing the election.At an election rally in Mainpuri on April 19, Maywati called SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhileshs father, a real backward class leader, unlike Modi, whom she described as a fake one. And on April 21, in a statement, Mayawati questioned Modis OBC credentials and said he got his community included in Gujarats list of OBCs after he became chief minister of the state.On Thursday, at rally in Uttar Pradeshs Banda, Modi accused the SP and the BSP of engaging in caste politics and said they were busy distributing my caste certificate. On Friday, Mayawati struck back, saying Modi doesnt belong to a backward class by birth. When his government was formed in Gujarat, he got his caste included in the backward class list, she said, repeating her claim. He just wants to votes of people from the backward classes; he is a fake, she added.BSP and SP are counting on the support of Dalits and OBCs in Uttar Pradesh to dent the BJPs strength in the Lok Sabha in the ongoing elections.OBCs account for 41.1% of the voters in Uttar Pradesh and Dalits, the main support base of the BSP, 20.7%. On paper, in terms of arithmetic, the alliance is at least as strong as the BJP.Also read| BJP greatest danger for India like 440 volts : Mamata BanerjeeIn the 2014 general election, the BJP on its own won 71 of the 80 members that Uttar Pradesh sends to the Lok Sabha, more than any other state in India. The SP won five and BSP none, but they were not in an alliance then.Playing up the traditional fault lines between the Yadavs (OBC) and Jatavs (scheduled caste, or Dalit) in the potato belt of Uttar Pradesh, Modi said, Behenji is gleefully seeking votes for those who never respected Baba Saheb (BR Ambedkar, a Dalit icon), attacked the Dalits and forcibly occupied their land and houses. It clearly shows that power and the chair matter most to Behenji.He claimed that Mayawatis BSP government, while in power, named the medical college in Tirva after Ambedkar but the SP government changed it.The BSP chief on Thursday sought votes for Dimple Yadav, SP leader Akhilesh Yadavs wife, from the same ground in Kannauj, considered an SP stronghold. Dimple Yadav is seeking a third term from the seat. The BJP has fielded Subrat Pathak, and hopes to do better than it has done in the past in the constituency, despite the SP candidate enjoying the BSPs support this time.In Sitapur, Modi termed the SP-BSP-Rashtriya Lok Dal grand alliance a mahamilawat ka counter they had opened when locks were placed on their old shops. Mahamilawat literally translates as great adulteration. Sitapur goes to the polls on May 6.Starting his speech by congratulating class X and class XII students of the UP Board examinations, results of which came out around 90 minutes before his speech, Modi said: I wish them great success in the future. Those students who are left behind by a few marks should start working right away. I say this as one of their family members.Hours later, Mayawati alleged again that Modi had his caste status converted into OBC and tore into Modi for mischievously suggesting that she and Akhilesh had described him as neech (lowly).He claims I had described him as neech. Far from it, I had actually described him as originally hailing from a forward caste and so it appears that in his own eyes, he is taking the upper caste to be neech, Mayawati said.Also read: BJPs promises only hawa hawai, says Mayawati in fresh attack on PM ModiFact is Modi and his party have always treated the dalits, tribals and OBCs as neech, she said, accusing him of raking up the issue of his caste to reap political gains, which she said showed the BJPs desperation at losing to the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in the first three phases of the general election in UP. She said the trend would hold good in the remainder of the election.Mayawati questioned the timing of the CBI opening a probe in the sugar mills sale that had, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, caused a loss of 1,179 crore to the state exchequer.I am not against the probe per se, but surely the manner in which CBI has opened the case in the middle of elections is unprecedented. Such misuse of CBI or other government agencies during polls is unprecedented, she told journalists in Lucknow on Saturday night.The BJP dismissed Mayawatis allegation. These appear to be senseless chatter of a politician who knows which way the wind is blowing in the elections. If she has done no wrong, she neednt fear, BJP leader Chandramohan said.First Published: Apr 27, 2019 20:11 IST"

I request with folded hands not to drag me into caste politics, 130 crore people are my family,"" he said in his first rally of the day in Kannauj.""This country didn't know my caste till my detractors abused me. I am thankful to Mayawatiji, Akhileshji (SP chief), Congress people and the 'mahamilavatis' that they are discussing my caste. I believe that taking birth in a backward caste is an opportunity to serve the country,"" the PM said.He hit out at the opposition for attacking 'chowkidars' (watchmen) and Ram bhakts, and alleged that the alliance wanted a helpless government because their mantra was ""jaat, paat japna; janata ka maal apna"" (Talk about caste while looting people's money).""They (opposition) want a government at the Centre which is 'majboor' (helpless) not 'majboot' (strong) as it used to do before 2014,"" he said.Modi alleged that when opposition parties are on the verge of defeat they hit new lows in using abusive language.""Whatever efforts you (opposition) make, it will be,"" he said, following which the crowd shouted, ""Modi again"".He ridiculed opposition leaders for their ""dream"" of becoming PM and poked fun at Mayawati for seeking the support of SP ""only for the sake of power"".Modi said people are aware of the opportunism of SP and BSP and alleged Mayawati is asking for votes for SP which had disrespected Babasaheb.""Behenji is happily seeking votes for the same SP which had disrespected Babasaheb and was embracing them just to defeat Modi apmaan bhi kursi ke nichey chipaa detey hain aur kursi sey chipak jatey hain,"" he remarked.""These (parties) are the ones who seek evidence of (Balakot) airstrike and shed tears for Batla House encounter (against terrorists),"" Modi told the gathering.Stressing that the ""chowkidar's"" policies and intentions are clear, the PM took a dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying, ""Some wise people had made the promise of making gold out of potato which neither I nor my party BJP can promise.""""We don't make promises which we can't fulfil there are wise people who make gold out of a potato. Neither I, nor my party can do it can't tell lies and those who want to make gold can go there,"" he said without naming Gandhi.He said the 'chowkidar' from the land of Dwarikadheesh has come to the land of Baal Gopal (Lord Krishna).Stressing that history will be created on May 23 when results are announced, Modi also spoke about his vision of development based on the colours in the national flag.Saffron in the flag stands for 'urja' (power), whether it is through coal, water, sun or wind, white stands for revolution in milk, cotton, sugar, egg.Green stands for agriculture revolution achieved through new techniques, and blue for the revolution of water resources, he said.""The pole which holds the flag high needs to be a strong one and it means infrastructure. Be it railways, digital, gas pipeline all which are the identity of new India,"" Modi said.Buoyed by the massive turnout despite sweltering heat, he said, ""It shows people have decided to break the record of 2014.""""The mahamilavatis abused the chowkidar and Ram bhakts but what happened? Their game is over they are campaigning for themselves but you all have come on roads to campaign for this chowkidar,"" he said.Terming terrorism as the biggest danger to the country, he said terror factories are still operating from Pakistan and lashed out at SP and BSP for having no formula to deal with it.In an apparent dig at Congress' Salmaan Khurshid, he said people of Farrukhabad were aware of what games were played in the name of 'divyangjans'.""Do I have to recall it the divyangjan upkaran scam is another black chapter in the corruption book of Congress,"" he said, without taking names.The trust led by Khurshid's wife had faced allegations of corruption after a sting operation. In Hardoi, Modi recalled how the SP commented on Babasaheb's statues and branded him as a land mafia.They razed Dalit bastis and framed fake cases against them, he alleged. He claimed, ""Despite all this, Mayawati is seeking votes for SP as their only aim is to occupy seat of power."" The BJP developed five memorials of Ambedkar as 'panch teerth'.""The Congress saw no one other than their family. It ignored Babasaheb,"" he said. Modi wrapped his day-long visit to UP with a public meeting in Sitapur.He appealed to people to vote for BJP with complete faith that it will ""spoil sleep of terrorists, make corrupt shiver, bring more laurels to the country"" and guarantee the nation becomes strong."

Activists seek Centre's intervention in PepsiCo's case against potato farmers Nine farmers from Sabarkantha and Aravalli districts have been dragged to court by PepsiCo for allegedly growing a variety of potatoes for which it has claimed Plant Variety Protection (PVP) rights. PepsiCo has a potato issue with farmers The US multinational had sued nine farmers for alleged ""rights infringement"" by illegally dealing with its registered potato variety used in its Lays chips.(This article was originally published by the Economic Times on 29/04/2019)NEW DELHI: Executives at Pepsi-Cos headquarters and its Asia-Pacific office are said to have conveyed their concern over the Indian units decision to take legal action against Gujarat farmers for growing a variety of potato following social media hostility and calls for a boycott of the companys products.Headquarters has asked PepsiCo India to resolve the issue at the earliest and work as a team, said one of two senior executives aware of developments. They are concerned about the legal issue and the backlash. The Apac office is in Dubai.PepsiCo has sued nine farmers in Gujarat for alleged rights infringement on the grounds that they illegally grew its registered FC5 potato variety used to make Lays chips A PepsiCo India spokesperson said the local unit is free to make its own decisions.The local team at PepsiCo India is fully empowered to act as owners and equipped to take decisions based on local market conditions, the spokesperson said. Beyond this, there is nothing more to add.He didnt respond to queries about any worries that may have been expressed by executives at the Dubai office and head office in New York.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress leaders tweeted against the companys decision to sue farmers in Gujarat over the weekend. On Friday, PepsiCo had offered to withdraw the suits against the farmers if they stop growing the FC5 variety. The farmers have sought time till June 12 to respond.I am giving an ultimatum to Pepsi India to withdraw cases against Indian farmers in the next 72 hours, otherwise we will start a campaign to boycott all PepsiCo products in India, tweeted Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, a spokesperson of the BJPs Delhi unit.The farmers have maintained that PepsiCo acted in violation of the Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Right Act (PPVFR Act), which seeks to protect specified plant varieties, rights of farmers and plant breeders, and encourages development and cultivation of new varieties of plants.Congress leader Ahmed Patel condemned PepsiCos move.PepsiCos decision to take Gujarats potato grower farmers to court is ill-advised and brazenly wrong. It is in violation of the farmers rights under the PPVFR Act. He added that the state government shouldnt keep its eyes shut Corporate interest cannot dictate what our farmers must or mustnt cultivate.For the maker of Pepsi cola, Lays chips and Quaker oats, India is a critical market at a time when mature markets such as the US have slowed. Being perceived as antifarmer could send the wrong message, experts said.A large global company suing farmers is bad optics under any circumstance, said Lloyd Mathias, formerly with PepsiCos leadership team and now an independent business consultant. PepsiCo could have found a better approach to protect its interests. This could have a negative fallout for PepsiCo in India.PepsiCo told the Ahmedabad court on Friday that it has proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety.The company said on Friday that PepsiCo has also proposed that they (the farmers) may become part of its collaborative potato farming program. In case they do not wish to join this program, they can simply sign an agreement and grow other available varieties of potatoes.The company said in its statement that it was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming program.Advocate Anand Yagnik, who had appeared on behalf of the farmers, accused PepsiCo of corporate arrogance, adding, An MNC enters into our farmlands, procures crops without our knowledge and frames us. It is infringing upon the right to privacy and dictating terms about what we should eat. This is unacceptable.Yagnik said PepsiCo officials entered farms with advocates and collected crop samples without the knowledge of farmers. The entire process of evidence collection was flawed, he said.PepsiCo has registered separate cases against nine farmers of the state so far for allegedly using the potato variety, for which it has exclusive rights in India. The company also sought damages of Rs 1.5 crore each from four farmers of the Sabarkantha district. Five other farmers were sued by Pepsi-Co in north Gujarat under similar charges in 2017-18."

The district is served by four MPs but stands as a glaring example of complete political apathy. Welcome to the home district of President Ram Nath Kovind.After the delimitation exercise of 2009, Kanpur Dehat got four assembly segments Rasoolabad (reserved), Akbarpur Raniya, Sikandra and Bhognipur belonging to Kannauj, Akbarpur, Etawah (R) and Jalaun (R) Lok Sabha constituencies respectively. Of the four parliamentary seats, BJP has sitting MPs in three while Kannauj is represented by Dimple Yadav, wife of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. However, whenever its people have demanded basic amenities, none of the four MPs has delivered.The district could have been a model in terms of development if all the four MPs had spent even a small chunk of their MPLAD funds to mitigate the problems of the people of their respective constituencies, said Brijendra Gupta, a political observer.All the four MPs  Dimple Yadav, Devendra Singh Bhola, Ashok Dohre and Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma  did attend meetings of district development panels but took no effort to give shape to development.The irony doesnt end here. As one approaches Kanpur Dehat, plants of a number of multinational giants  Nerolac, Pepsi, Amul and HPCL can be seen on either side of NH-19 but unemployment is a major issue. All the manpower is ferried to work from Kanpur city or other places. Those of Kanpur Dehat is taken only as daily wagers, said Ram Surat Agarwal, 46, a contractor. Kanpur Dehat has two National Highways but not a single bus station. It has two broad gauge railway tracks passing through it but hardly any express train has a stoppage here, he said. The district had 500 such industrial units in 1981 which has dwindled to 250.Besides unemployment and non-development, voters of Akbarpur also talk of the plight of potato growers, lack of higher education institutions and hospitals. Akbarpur, which largely covers Kanpur Dehat district, has Devendra Singh Bhola as the sitting MP. BJP has reposed faith in him in the wake of predominant upper castes, believed to be a dedicated vote bank of the BJP.However, the SP-BSP alliance is pinning hopes on the Dalit-Muslim-Yadav combination though Congress Rajaram Pal, MP since 2009. Rural voters of Akbarpur are tight-lipped about their preferences. However, they openly acknowledge the benefits of Central welfare schemes like housing, Ujjwala, toilets and PDS supplies."
2019-04-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/pepsico-india-potato-farmers-gujarat-ppvfra-5701539/,Lay off,"PepsiCos suing nine Gujarat farmers for alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights (IPR) over a proprietary potato variety makes for bad optics, bordering on a public relations disaster. The American food-and-beverage giant enjoys IPR protection in India for FL 2027, a potato variety with high dry matter and low sugar content that is better suited for making chips (normal table potatoes have more moisture, which adds to dehydration and energy costs during processing, and higher sugar that causes blackening on frying). Such protection is, indeed, required for incentivising agricultural research and development of new plant varieties by breeders, both in the private and public sectors. Under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001(PPVFRA), over 3,500 varieties across a range of crops  including those bred or improved by individual farmers  have so far been granted registration certificates for up to 15 years. These certificates confer on the breeders the exclusive rights over commercial production, sale, marketing, distribution, export and import of their protected varieties.AdvertisingHowever, the PPVFRA simultaneously entitles farmers to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange, share or sell the produce and seeds of any variety protected under the Act. Such freedom is conditional only upon no sale of such seeds in branded form  in other words, being put in a package or any other container and labeled. It is clear from this that the Gujarat farmers had not committed any IPR infringement by merely growing FL 2027 potato, even if without PepsiCos authorisation. PepsiCo may have developed this processing-grade variety solely for its Lays chips and for contract cultivation by farmers through a buy-back mechanism at pre-fixed rates. The company claims to be working with some 24,000 farmers across nine states: Its fair to assume they benefit from the arrangement, both on account of being insulated from open market price fluctuations  huge in potatoes  and also receiving quality farm inputs and extension support. PepsiCo may, in turn, have legitimate concerns over farmers independently cultivating its proprietary varieties and possibly even supplying their produce to rival chips/French fries makers. But that still does not constitute an IPR infringement.It would be in PepsiCos best interest to simply withdraw its suit against the Gujarat farmers, without attaching conditions. A $65-billion multinational seeking Rs one crore each of damages from Average Joe farmers of Sabarkantha  that too, during election time  is going to only invite opprobrium and consumer backlash. The losses from that will far outweigh any pyrrhic legal victory."

Next, I dig into the traditional 999 noodles, flavourful, without any sauces. My companion choose the black sticky rice with eyed pea and pickled vegetables, its robust nutty flavour was a welcome change. It went well the sweet, tangy and thick eggplant-long bean-and-potato curry.

2019-04-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/pepsico-india-potato-farmers-gujarat-ppvfra-5701539/,Lay off,"PepsiCos suing nine Gujarat farmers for alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights (IPR) over a proprietary potato variety makes for bad optics, bordering on a public relations disaster. The American food-and-beverage giant enjoys IPR protection in India for FL 2027, a potato variety with high dry matter and low sugar content that is better suited for making chips (normal table potatoes have more moisture, which adds to dehydration and energy costs during processing, and higher sugar that causes blackening on frying). Such protection is, indeed, required for incentivising agricultural research and development of new plant varieties by breeders, both in the private and public sectors. Under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001(PPVFRA), over 3,500 varieties across a range of crops  including those bred or improved by individual farmers  have so far been granted registration certificates for up to 15 years. These certificates confer on the breeders the exclusive rights over commercial production, sale, marketing, distribution, export and import of their protected varieties.AdvertisingHowever, the PPVFRA simultaneously entitles farmers to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange, share or sell the produce and seeds of any variety protected under the Act. Such freedom is conditional only upon no sale of such seeds in branded form  in other words, being put in a package or any other container and labeled. It is clear from this that the Gujarat farmers had not committed any IPR infringement by merely growing FL 2027 potato, even if without PepsiCos authorisation. PepsiCo may have developed this processing-grade variety solely for its Lays chips and for contract cultivation by farmers through a buy-back mechanism at pre-fixed rates. The company claims to be working with some 24,000 farmers across nine states: Its fair to assume they benefit from the arrangement, both on account of being insulated from open market price fluctuations  huge in potatoes  and also receiving quality farm inputs and extension support. PepsiCo may, in turn, have legitimate concerns over farmers independently cultivating its proprietary varieties and possibly even supplying their produce to rival chips/French fries makers. But that still does not constitute an IPR infringement.It would be in PepsiCos best interest to simply withdraw its suit against the Gujarat farmers, without attaching conditions. A $65-billion multinational seeking Rs one crore each of damages from Average Joe farmers of Sabarkantha  that too, during election time  is going to only invite opprobrium and consumer backlash. The losses from that will far outweigh any pyrrhic legal victory."

The district is served by four MPs but stands as a glaring example of complete political apathy. Welcome to the home district of President Ram Nath Kovind.After the delimitation exercise of 2009, Kanpur Dehat got four assembly segments Rasoolabad (reserved), Akbarpur Raniya, Sikandra and Bhognipur belonging to Kannauj, Akbarpur, Etawah (R) and Jalaun (R) Lok Sabha constituencies respectively. Of the four parliamentary seats, BJP has sitting MPs in three while Kannauj is represented by Dimple Yadav, wife of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. However, whenever its people have demanded basic amenities, none of the four MPs has delivered.The district could have been a model in terms of development if all the four MPs had spent even a small chunk of their MPLAD funds to mitigate the problems of the people of their respective constituencies, said Brijendra Gupta, a political observer.All the four MPs  Dimple Yadav, Devendra Singh Bhola, Ashok Dohre and Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma  did attend meetings of district development panels but took no effort to give shape to development.The irony doesnt end here. As one approaches Kanpur Dehat, plants of a number of multinational giants  Nerolac, Pepsi, Amul and HPCL can be seen on either side of NH-19 but unemployment is a major issue. All the manpower is ferried to work from Kanpur city or other places. Those of Kanpur Dehat is taken only as daily wagers, said Ram Surat Agarwal, 46, a contractor. Kanpur Dehat has two National Highways but not a single bus station. It has two broad gauge railway tracks passing through it but hardly any express train has a stoppage here, he said. The district had 500 such industrial units in 1981 which has dwindled to 250.Besides unemployment and non-development, voters of Akbarpur also talk of the plight of potato growers, lack of higher education institutions and hospitals. Akbarpur, which largely covers Kanpur Dehat district, has Devendra Singh Bhola as the sitting MP. BJP has reposed faith in him in the wake of predominant upper castes, believed to be a dedicated vote bank of the BJP.However, the SP-BSP alliance is pinning hopes on the Dalit-Muslim-Yadav combination though Congress Rajaram Pal, MP since 2009. Rural voters of Akbarpur are tight-lipped about their preferences. However, they openly acknowledge the benefits of Central welfare schemes like housing, Ujjwala, toilets and PDS supplies."

State convener of SJM M.R. Ranjit Karthikeyan said PepsiCo, manufacturer of the Lays brand of potato chips, had filed the suit against four farmers from Sabarkantha district in Gujarat, accusing them of intellectual property rights infringement for buying seeds and selling a variety of potato registered by the company under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001.Farmers interestsIn a press note, Mr. Karthikeyan said it was the duty of the State to protect the interests of the farmers and shield them from the so-called breeders of plant varieties. This is an indicator of what is in store for farmers who are not willing to be bound by the contract farming trap laid by foreign corporates. It is not acceptable at all in a country like India which has a rich and vast history of an agrarian economy.Mr. Karthikeyan also urged the government to withdraw the IPRs to foreign companies and to protect farmers rights. The SJM has called on the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority to intervene in the issue and protect the farmers rights.Calling for a public boycott of all Pepsico products, the manch said it was planning a nation wide awareness campaign."

The issue snowballed into a controversy when the US multinational giant sued four Gujarati peasants, demanding they pay a whopping `1.05 crore each as damages for contravening its rights by growing the potato variety used in its Lays brand of chips. This has yet again brought to the fore the issue of hybrid versus traditional variety of potato, be it Gujarat or Kerala.In Kerala, around nine varieties of farm produce have made their way into the Geographical Indication(GI) registry as these are best known by their place of origin, reputation, unique characteristics and quality. Further, the Kerala Agricultural University(KAU) is engaged in efforts to get GI registration for six more traditional varieties.Baby John, Vazakulam Pineapple Growers and Processors Private Ltd executive director and Pineapple Farmers Association former president, said Vazhakkulam pineapple is the main traditional variety cultivated by states pineapple growers on 40,000 ha of land, with an annual production of four lakh tonne and turnover of `800 crore. The farmer who cultivates the traditional pineapple variety will achieve the breakeven only if the produce fetches a farm price of `17-18.But the fact is farmers were forced to sell the produce at an average price of `10-12 last year, despite Vazhakkulam pineapple having a niche market. The main drawback of the agriculture produce is its poor shelf-life. We have to shift to hybrid varieties like MD2 at least to some degree to keep the business going as it has greater shelf-life and can be exported to other states in the country, apart from tapping into the export market. This doesnt mean the traditional variety has to be given up altogether. While patronising the traditional variety, we ought to overlook its limitations. But then, farmers should be assured of better returns, he said.Further, it is the middlemen who make money. Though the state has tag like GI for many products which enhances their market value, the farmers get only a pittance. For instance, GI- tagged traditional variety pokkali rice fetches `33 per kg while the retailers charge around `80-90 for per kg for pokkali rice.The farmers are looking for hybrid varieties like Vyttila-6 to get a proportional return in tune with the investment as the traditional pokkali variety has a low yield of around 1 tonne per acre.Francis Kalathungal, Pokkali Samrakashana Samithi general convener, said even after having an assured market for the rice, pokkali farming in the state failed to make giant strides in the saline rice production system under which a single crop of pokkali rice is cultivated in the low saline phase of the production cycle that starts with the monsoons onset and ends by the time the monsoon withdraws from the state. It will then be followed up by prawn farming during the high saline phase.According to the department statistics, there are around 4,055 ha of pokkali field available for farming in Ernakulam district alone. However, the area under cultivation in Ernakulam is less than 500 ha , which accounts for the largest area under pokkali cultivation in the state. Compared to the returns from fish farming in pokkali fields, the rice cultivation is not that lucrative. So the farmers are renouncing the traditional rice to pursue fish farming. Though it is important to retain the traditional varieties, it is more important to switch to hybrid varieties, if only the farming can be made sustainable in the longer run.Vazahakkulam pineappleAcreage - 40,000 acreProduction 4 lakh tonneTurnover - `800 croreThey are looking for MD2 variety for better prospects, despite GI tag- The total area of Pokkali fields, mainly spread across Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kannur, is 6,500-7,000 ha. But only a tenth of the total area is effectively used for cultivation- Farmers looking to switch to hybrid varieties like Vyttila 6, as the market failed to provide returns on par with the retail price."

Seeds, plants and lives cannot be patented. PepsiCos move is highly illegal and unethical and it will be in their own interest, not the farmers, to resolve the issue amicably. We will take care of our farmers, SJMs head Ashwani Mahajan told TOI.PepsiCo India sued farmers in Gujarat for alleged rights infringement for growing FC5 potato variety used to manufacture the popular Lays potato chips. While the company said it has already agreed to settle the issue amicably, the farmers sought time till June 12 to respond. Mondays development comes after executives at Pepsi-Cos global headquarters expressed concern at its local units handling of the situation. The local team at Pepsi-Co India are fully empowered to act as owners and equipped to take decisions based on local market conditions, a PepsiCo India spokesperson said.Mahajan, however, said, PepsiCos move has set a wrong precedent that may be followed by other MNCs to forcibly coerce Indian farmers to fall in with their demands.The government should take a strong stand against such companies and it should serve as a deterrent for global players, he said.PepsiCo continues to maintain that they may become part of its collaborative potato farming programme. This programme gives them access to higher yields, enhanced quality, training in bestin-class practices and better prices. In case, they do not wish to join this program, they can simply sign an agreement and grow other available varieties of potatoes, the PepsiCo India spokesperson said. He said the company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming programme."

The company sued the farmers for growing and selling this potato type, which is registered by PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd, alleging that the cultivation violated the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act.The case in the high court involved two farmers from Malgadh village of Deesa block in Banaskantha district, Fulchand and Suresh Kachchhawa. The company approached the high court after a civil court in Deesa ordered an inspection by court commissioner only of the premises belonging to Kachchhawa at Malgadh village, where the potatoes are stored. The civil court did not order inspection and inventory of potato stocks in cold storage. Upon PepsiCos request, the HC ordered the court commissioner to visit to cold storages in Banaskantha and Sabarkantha districts. Meanwhile, the courts interim stay on the farmers growing and selling this potato type remains in force.Govt should say how PPVFR helps farmersThe US food and beverage giant PepsiCo dragging Gujarat farmers to court for cultivating its registered variety of potatoes has evoked strong reactions from activists and farmer groups. Last week, as many as 194 activists and farmers bodies sought the Centres intervention in the matter. They protested against PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd suing farmers for sowing its registered FL 2027 type of potatoes, which the company says it has exclusive rights to and is used to make its Lays chips. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh asked the state government on Monday to issue a statement explaining how the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPVFR) Act works in favour of the farmers."

ShutterstockDark designsIf you are a Tim Burton fan, you are in for a treat. For the first time, there is an exhibition in Las Vegas at the Neon Museum to view the artists work up close. Burton brought us films like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks! and The Nightmare Before Christmas. The exhibition will run for four months and include original art pieces, dark set designs and massive installations from his film sets.Before this, Burtons art and the memorabilia from his films found their way through metropolitan museums from 2009 to 2013, ending up in often sold-out runs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and Pariss Cinmathque, among others. But in the Las Vegas exhibition, pieces will be spread across the iconic museums campus: the outdoor exhibition space, its adjacent North Gallery and the visitors centre.The Neon Museum is quite different from previous exhibition spaces for Burtons work. The massive neon signs outside it certainly complement the art. This exhibition will be a collaborative showing that features site-specific staging. To say were flattered that Mr Burton has chosen our museum for this exhibition would be an understatement, the Neon Museums president, Rob McCoy, said in a press statement. But when you think about it, Tim is one of the few artists who can match the great imagination of Las Vegas.Quality controlWhen you think of good food, you may not think of airlines food. However, recently people have been taking pleasure in critiquing, ranking, and even hating airplane food on social media. Brian Kelly, the founder of The Points Guy, indulged in this pastime recently by posting a photo of a rather unappetizing plate of pasta served to him on an American Airlines first-class ticket. He invited his followers to caption the photo, which led to some caustic remarks that probably would cause a public relations nightmare.Kelly is not the only one calling out airlines for their soggy food.Popular Instagram accounts such as @inflightFeed and @airplanefoodselfie feature frequent flierss meals as a form of culinary entertainment. The latter account crowdsources photos and then invites followers to rank each offering on a scale of one to 10. It includes the flight number and route to make clear where the dining experience  whether it was great or terrible  happened.But the critics are not limited to dedicated accounts only. A Malaysian chef took to Instagram to lash out at AirAsia, the Malaysian low-cost airline, for allegedly serving poor quality sambal tumis (stir-fried chilli paste) with nasi lemak in its Premium Lounge. He also uploaded another video of a sambal prawn dish which he whipped up himself, describing it as nice and thick, and said it does not look like the AirAsia premium nasi lemak sambal.Steep dropNew Year is famously about the drop of the crystal ball in NYC. But this year there has been a lot more of things dropping in different states around the country.

Mt Olive, North Carolina drops a pickle every single year, but not at midnight. They drop it at 7 pm Eastern Standard Time because that is midnight on Greenwich Mean Time. In Georgia, a giant peach  the states official fruit  drops in the middle of fireworks. The rain in Atlanta did not stop thousands from turning up to watch.Bethlehem, Pennsylvania drops a 400-pound illuminated Peep (the popular branded yellow marshmallow candy) each year. They do this because Peepss parent company, Just Born, is headquartered in the town. Mobile, Alabama drops the marshmallow-stuffed moonpie every year. But it is electronic and weighs nearly 600 pounds. Boise, Idaho drops a giant, glowing potato, now in its sixth year. Viewers can watch the famous 17-feet, 800-pound GlowTato drop right in front of Idahos capitol building each year.FootnoteNew Year means it is time for resolutions.

We are relying on the said discussions to find a long term and an amicable resolution of all issues around seed protection, said a PepsiCo spokesperson on Thursday.This decision applies to the nine farmers PepsiCo has sued over the last two years for allegedly growing its registered potato variety which is used for Lays chips.Anand Yagnik, the lawyer representing four farmers from Sabarkantha district who were sued for 1.05 crore each, said an unconditional withdrawal of litigation would be a great victory for the downtrodden and small farmers against a major corporate power, but noted that the company is yet to communicate its decision to the court or to the farmers and their lawyer.It is not stated when it will implement its decision, he said. It is important that no wrong precedent is set, given that this is a test case which could affect other farmers across the country.The PepsiCo decision follows criticism from political parties and farmers rights groups, as well as boycott calls on global social media.The multinational conglomerate seemed to have won an early victory when an Ahmedabad commercial court issued an ex-parte injunction against the farmers on April 9. However, by the next hearing on April 26, faced with a growing campaign by farmers groups, the company offered a settlement to the farmers on the condition that they give an undertaking not to grow the registered variety or to join its collaborative farming programme.Outrage continued to grow over the weekend, with farmers groups across the political spectrum calling for boycotts and senior politicians from both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress slamming the company, in the midst of a Lok Sabha election putting the spotlight on farmers issues. On Saturday, the Gujarat government announced that it would back the farmers and join the legal case on their behalf. However, on Wednesday evening, deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel told reporters that the state government was working toward an out-of-court settlement in a manner that it is helpful to farmers.Sources familiar with the latest development told The Hindu that PepsiCo had decided to withdraw the cases backed by an assurance from the government for a long term amicable settlement, adding that both the Gujarat state government and the Centre were involved in such an assurance to the company.Some farmers groups objected to the idea of any long term solution being negotiated by the government. The only long-term solution needed is already given in Section 39 of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001 which allows any farmer to grow or sell produce even of registered varieties so long as he does not sell branded seed. The government only needs to enforce this law, said Kapil Shah, a Gujarat based activist with the Jatan Trust and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture.He called for future certificates of registration issued to companies under the Act to specifically mention this clause supporting farmers rights over breeders rights. He also called for PepsiCo to apologise to the farmers it sued and offer them compensation, and give an undertaking not to sue farmers on this issue in future.The multinational conglomerate seemed to have won an early victory when an Ahmedabad commercial court issued an ex-parte injunction against the farmers on April 9.

2019-05-02,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/may/02/game-of-feasts-1971581.html,Game of feasts,"Meenakshi Girish, ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Deepthi Parthasarathy Popular series Game of Thrones (GoT) is not just about war, incest and gore. While a common viewer of the show might not have picked up on the food that is served as per the geography of the city in Westeros, restaurateurs and bakers have spotted the special dishes and infused the flavours of the show in their dishes. City-based Coco Jaunt 1728 caf and Sugar Base Studios have curated special GoT-themed menus, dedicated to the final season of the series.Twist in the menuWe are huge fans of Game of Thrones. I have watched the series nearly four times, so I know a lot of lines by heart. We actually wanted to start this menu last year, but I felt it would be more relevant now as the final season is here and fans can connect to it more, says Rohini Chandrasekaran, founder of Coco Jaunt.Snehithi Jambulingam of Sugar Base Studios calls the show the best ever she has watched so far. This is a tribute from my end. Cheesecakes are our specialty and I have come up with a hamper of six cheesecake flavours, says the 26-year-old who supplies desserts to restaurants and also helps them conceptualise themed menus.As we enter Coco Jaunt in Anna Nagar we notice that the cafs dcor is dotted with vibrant colours and GoT references. We were inspired to make this menu based on customers inputs. We took nearly three months to understand how we could connect the items on the menu to characters, GoT references, dishes from the series and our own twist with wordplay. The response has been great, says Rohini.The initial menu comprised dishes that only ardent GoT fans could devour. So Rohini made a few changes so that even a non-GoT fan would want to try out the dishes. We had to modify a lot of dishes and remove a lot of ideas to suit all customers. For example, I made a dessert based on a scene where Daenerys eats a raw horses heart. I felt non-GoT fans would get disgusted by this, so I removed it, she adds.Of Dracarys and StarksCoco Jaunt offers separate menus for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. It is a four-course meal. The menu includes Tyrion Wildfire Shot  a blend of Kiwi, green Jell-O and Sprite  Sansas lemon cake and the Bowl of Brown soup (both being actual meals from the series), R+L=J  based on the famous fan theory  where R is ricotta cheese, L is for leeks and J for jalapeno poppers; Oberyns Head  smashed baby potatoes and cajun seeds representing Oberyn Martells smashed head  and White Walker  crushed ice blended with sugar and a touch of blue colour. One of our highlights is Dracarys, which is a grilled shaslik with extremely spicy naga chilly sauce. Daenerys Targaryen often says Dracarys when she wants her dragon to spew fire. So, whenever our customers say the word Dracarys, our chef uses the blowtorch on the shaslik at their table. We recommend the customers to buy Cerseis wine along with this, which is non-alcoholic sangria, made a bit sweet and served with apple pieces, says Rohini.Snehithi offers two types of limited-edition hampers. The first hamper is an assorted box of six cheesecake flavors, that match the features, colour, mood, and background of the famous houses from the series  Lannisters (Milo and Nuttela), White Walkers (Blueberry), Greyjoys (Intense Chocolate), Children of the forest (Mango & Passion fruit), Targaryens (Coconut & Salted Caramel), and Starks (Biscoff and Cookie Butter). The second is a Dragon Egg Hamper, which represents the three dragons. It has three chocolate eggs colour-coded and named after the dragons  Drogon (Dark Chocolate with Crispy Chocolate Cornflakes), Rhaegal (Milk Chocolate with Salted Caramel Sauce), Viserion (White Chocolate with Raspberry Sauce)  and two macarons with famous verses written on them  Lavender Macarons that reads Winter Is Coming, and Strawberry Compote Macarons that reads Valar Morghulis. Snehithi recommends the Milo and Nutella Lannisters cheesecake.Food challengeRohini plans to retain a part of these curated dishes in their regular menu. They conduct yearly food challenges; the latest one being a challenge to consume Dracarys in a couple of minutes. Doctors are still being consulted, as the consumption of such a spicy meal could be dangerous to the customers health. I came up with all the names and gave my ideas to the cafs co-founder, Senthil Egambaram. He made my ideas come to reality. We had a real challenge while experimenting with different combinations of ingredients, she says."

Over the years, the Company has developed a best in class collaborative potato farming program which has benefited thousands of farmers across the country. The program which included several market awareness initiatives has resulted in farmers getting access to higher yields, enhanced quality, training in best-in-class practices and better prices, all leading to improved livelihoods. To safeguard the larger interest of farmers, PepsiCo India was compelled to take judicial recourse to protect its registered variety. PepsiCo from the very start had also offered an amicable settlement to farmers. After discussions with the (state) government, the company has agreed to withdraw cases against farmers. We are relying on the said discussions to find a long term and an amicable resolution of all issues around seed protection.AdvertisingThe six lawsuits slapped against nine farmers had sought damages ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1.05 crore. PIH has accused the farmers of illegally growing, producing and selling the potato plant variety FL-2027 (commercial name FC-5), without permission of PIH, for which the company is the registered breeder, under the provisions of the PPV&FR Act, 2001. Four from Vadali taluka in Sabarkantha district had been slapped and five others from Modasa taluka in Aravalli district.In March 2018, PIH slapped two special civil suits against five farmers  One, with defendants Prabhudas Patel, Bharat Patel, Jeetu Patel and Vinod Patel, and second with defendant Jigarkumar Patel  all from the Aravalli district.

2019-05-02,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/gujarat-farmers-case-pepsico-is-on-shaky-ground/story-f1t5waNGQ3Oab7kPvo6SzK.html,Gujarat farmers' case: PepsiCo is on shaky ground,"On April 5, PepsiCo India filed a case against four potato farmers of Sabarkantha district of Gujarat, accusing them of growing a variety of potato (FC5) that is exclusive to it. The multinational corporation (MNC) claims to have exclusive rights over this variety of potato under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001. Three days after the case was filed, a commercial court in Ahmedabad passed ex-parte interim injunction orders (against infringement) against the defendant farmers. The company is also seeking to recover damages from the infringement to the tune of 1.05 crore from each farmer.However, due to political and civil society pressure, PepsiCo India has now proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety. The company is suggesting that they may become part of its collaborative potato farming programme.But was there an infringement at all?The MNC is claiming that FC5 was developed by its scientists in the US and that PepsiCo India was granted a Certificate of Registration by the Protection of Plant Varieties & Farmers Rights Authority in 2016 for this variety as FL-2027. But this variety has actually been in use in India since 2009 and unsurprisingly the seeds can be found with many farmers because of certain practices that they follow: saving and resowing of seeds, exchange of seeds and sourcing of seeds from the market. In India, farmers cannot be expected to know which varieties are being registered under the PPV&FR Act and if this has many implications for them.Importantly, the farmers dont need to use the above two explanations as part of their defence in the court. In compliance with World Trade Organizations TRIPS Agreement, India had adopted a sui generis or unique approach, which takes into cognisance farmers traditional practices around seed management and also recognises them as seed breeders too. The PPV&FR Act emerged from this approach.The PPV&FR Acts Section 39 entitles farmers to save, use, sow, resow, exchange or sell his/her farm produce, including seeds of a variety protected under this Act, provided that such seeds are not branded. In fact, Section 39s articulation makes other provisions of the Act subject to this Section.A perusal of the 1999 version of the PPV&FR Act, the revised Bill of a Joint Parliamentary Committee, and the parliamentary debates in August 2001 clearly illustrate the legislative intent behind this statute, and it was clearly an intent to protect farmers interests.PepsiCo India is on shaky ground inside and outside the court in this case. The sued farmers, who are not in any buyback arrangement with PepsiCo India, have decided against any settlement since they realise that the fight here is larger than their individual cases. It is about the assertion of their seed freedom/sovereignty and the correct judicial interpretation of the PPV&FR Act. It is now in PepsiCo Indias interest to withdraw the cases unconditionally. I hope the judiciary will reinforce unequivocally Section 39 of the PPV&FR Act since this has huge ramifications for farmers and their livelihoods.Kavitha Kuruganti is with Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture, an advocacy platform for farmers rights and sustainable farm livelihoodsThe views expressed are personalFirst Published: May 02, 2019 21:16 IST"

Pepsico, one of the worlds largest multinational corporations, had to face widespread backlash from farmers for bringing the lawsuits. Its legal action had sparked outrage among farm activists.The company had claimed that the farmers had grown potatoes of a variety known as FL2027, which it had developed and registered as a protected strain under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority.The Gujarat government was involved in talks between farmer groups and the company to settle the matter. After discussions with the government, the company has agreed to withdraw cases against farmers, Pepsico said in a statement Thursday.The company had pressed charges of infringement of its exclusive rights over the seed variety, which it uses in Lays crisps, under sections 28 and 64 of The Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Right Act, 2001.Farm activists however claimed that section 39 of the Act allows Indian farmers to freely grow, use or sell a proprietary or a protected variety of seed as long as they dont sell it as a branded item.Pepsico had wrongfully charged the farmers because the same Act gives farmers the freedom to use or grow protected seeds. The Indian legal system governing agricultural innovations offers farmers full freedom, unlike in the US, said Kapil Shah of Jatan Trust, a farm organisation that was involved in defending the farmers.PepsiCo introduced this variety of potato, which is sourced from its US arm, for commercial use in 2009. The low moisture content of the variety makes it ideal for processing.We are relying on the said discussions to find a long term and an amicable resolution of all issues around seed protection. The company remains deeply committed to the thousands of farmers we work with across the country and towards ensuring adoption of best farming practices, the companys statement said.Over 200 farmer organisations, civil society representatives and activists had opposed PepsiCos move before the government. Several farmer organisations affiliated across the political spectrum, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, had vowed to fiercely resist PepsiCos legal action.The company had entered into exclusive buyback arrangements with farmers in India, including in north Gujarat. In its infringement suit, PepsiCo claimed that some farmers were growing and selling their variety without any licence or agreement with them, thereby hurting the firms commercial interests.First Published: May 03, 2019 01:28 IST"

Thats why I have purchased essential commodities and dry food for at least a week. The traders have already hiked the price, which may increase further, said Indumati Sahani, a resident of Unit-IX. Traders attributed it to the rise in demand from the consumers, who procured commodities two to three times of their usual requirement in anticipation of the stocks vanishing.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said there is no reason to panic as required quantity of essential commodities has been stocked and green vegetables will arrive as usual if there is no damage to roads. There was scarcity of some commodities on Wednesday as labourers did not load and unload as it was Labour Day. Though we have been advising people to buy only the quantity required, they are in no mood to pay any heed. Markets witnessed heavy rush and people went for more tuber and dry foods besides vegetables, Panda said. Panda informed that potato and onion is priced at Rs 1,350 a quintal in the wholesale market.It is the retailers who are taking advantage of the situation to make some easy bucks, he added and demanded the administration to step in immediately. Meanwhile, the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department has directed district collectors to keep a close watch on price and availability of essential commodities in the market and ensure that food items are available at reasonable prices to the consumers. Since disruption of supply of different commodities like pulses, edible oil, sugar, potato, onion, flattened rice and jaggery is apprehended, an official communication warned that unscrupulous traders may resort to unfair practices like hoarding and profiteering leading to public discontentment. The market intelligence wing has been asked to keep close watch on hoarding by unscrupulous traders. Collectors have been instructed to deploy civil supply and market intelligence field staff for surprise checks and take action under provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1995 against illegal hoarders if warranted."

2019-05-03,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2019/may/03/gates-di-caprio-back-fake-meat-company-shares-fatten-up-on-ipo-debut-day-1972150.html,"Gates, Di Caprio back fake meat company, shares fatten up on IPO-debut day","By Associated PressInvestors have a big appetite for fake meat.The shares of Beyond Meat, the purveyor of plant-based burgers and sausages, more than doubled Thursday in its Nasdaq debut. Its the first pure-play maker of vegan meat to go public, according to Renaissance Capital, which researches and tracks IPOs.Beyond Meat raised about $240 million selling 9.6 million shares at $25 each. Those shares rose 163% to close at $65.75.The 10-year-old company has attracted celebrity investors like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and actor Leonardo DiCaprio and buzz for placing its products in burger joints like Carls Jr. It sells to 30,000 grocery stores, restaurants and schools in the U.S., Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and Israel.Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown said the IPO timing is right because the company wants to expand overseas. He also wants consumers to be able to buy shares since they have fueled the companys growth.It really is a wonderful feeling to be able to welcome people in who have helped this brand, Brown told The Associated Press.Still, Beyond Meat has never made an annual profit, losing $30 million last year. Its also facing serious competition from other new meat companies like Impossible Foods and traditional players like Tyson Foods Inc. Tyson recently sold a stake in Beyond Meat because it plans to develop its own alternative meat.The IPO comes amid growing consumer interest in plant-based foods for their presumed health and environmental benefits. U.S. sales of plant-based meats jumped 42% between March 2016 and March 2019 to a total of $888 million, according to Nielsen. Traditional meat sales rose 1% to $85 billion in that same time frame.The trend is a global one. U.K. sales of meat alternatives jumped 18% over the last year, while sales of traditional meat and poultry slid 2%.Demand is expected to continue to grow. Euromonitor, a consulting firm, predicts worldwide sales of meat substitutes will grow 22% by 2023 to a total of $22.9 billion.Even Burger King has recognized the appeal. Earlier this week, the fast food chain announced that it would start testing the Impossible Whopper, made with a plant-based burger from Impossible Foods, in additional markets after its monthlong test in St. Louis proved successful. Meanwhile, Ikea says its working on developing a plant-based Swedish meatball, which it says it plans to test with customers early next year.Brown says Beyond Meats ingredient list  it only uses natural ingredients that havent been genetically modified and doesnt use soy  sets it apart from competitors. Its products are made from pea protein, canola oil, potato starch and other plant-based ingredients. Its burgers bleed with beet juice; its sausages are colored with fruit juice.Unlike competitors, Beyond Meat products have also been sold in the meat section of groceries since 2016. That has broadened their appeal beyond vegetarians. Beyond Meat says a 26-week study last spring showed that 93% of Kroger customers who bought its burgers also bought animal meat during the same period.In a 2016 taste test, Consumer Reports said the texture of the Beyond Burger was similar to ground beef, but it didnt match up in flavor. The magazines conclusion: It might not be the best burger youve ever tried, but its pretty tasty on a bun with lots of toppings.As for health benefits, the results are mixed. A four-ounce 92% lean burger from Lauras Lean Beef has higher fat and cholesterol than a Beyond Meat burger, but Beyond Meats burger has higher sodium and carbohydrates and slightly less protein. The lean beef burger is 160 calories; a Beyond Meat burger is 270 calories.Brown says Beyond Meat is working on reducing sodium, which is a natural byproduct of its manufacturing process. But he also points out that red meat and processed meat have been classified as possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization.Beyond Meat also costs more. For $5.99, consumers can get two 4-ounce patties of Beyond Burger or four 4-ounce patties of Lauras Lean Beef.Brown said Beyond Meat has a five-year goal of getting at least one product  most likely beef  to cost less than the animal version. He expects the supply chain will grow as sales expand, which will lower the cost of raw ingredients like peas.But Beyond Meat touts environmental benefits as well. The company says a plant-based burger takes 99% less water and 93% less land to produce than a beef burger, and generates 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.Beyond Meat was founded in 2009 by Brown, a former clean energy executive. Browns family part-owned a Maryland dairy farm, so as a child, Brown spent weekends and summers on the farm. As he grew older, he began to question whether people really needed animals to produce meat.Brown teamed up with two professors from the University of Missouri, Fu-hung Hsieh and Harold Huff, who had been developing soy-based chicken since the 1980s. By 2013, Beyond Meat was selling plant-based chicken strips nationwide at Whole Foods. (The company discontinued chicken earlier this year but says its working on a better recipe.)For investors, the stock is not without risk. Amid its annual losses, Beyond Meat must also continue to spend heavily on research and development. The El Segundo, California-based company employs 63 scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians and chefs at its 30,000-square-foot lab. It also has manufacturing facilities in Columbia, Missouri.Renaissance Capital, which has researched the company, says investors will likely tolerate the losses because the business is growing so quickly. Beyond Meats net revenue was $87.9 million last year, 170% higher than 2017.In documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Beyond Meat says it will invest $40 million to $50 million in current and new manufacturing facilities and spend $50 million to $60 million on product development and sales. The rest will be used to pay down debt and fund operations."

2019-05-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lawsuits-against-farmers-govt-pepsico-officials-meet-discuss-middle-ground-5709806/,Gujarat to ask farmers to not grow ‘PepsiCo potato’ without firm’s nod,"In the wake of lawsuits filed by PepsiCo India against 11 farmers for growing a particular variety of potato, registered by the US food giant, the Gujarat government has decided to persuade farmers to desist from growing the registered variety of potato without requisite permission from the company. And if they did, they could sell it only to the patent holder  the company which has registered the crop variety  government sources told The Indian Express on Friday.AdvertisingThis came on a day when Chief Secretary J N Singh met PepsiCo India officials, led by its Vice-President Jagrut Kotecha here on Friday.After the meeting, Singh told The Indian Express that the state government suggested to Pepsico officials that instead of having a bipartite agreement with farmers for contract farming of their registered seeds, they should sign a tripartite agreement involving the state government in it.In that case, the state government remains in the know of the development if any controversy erupts and can also have a say in it.AdvertisingThe meeting which was also attended by Additional Chief Secretary (Agriculture) Sanjay Prasad and Director (Agriculture) B N Modi was held a day after PepsiCo India announced to withdraw all the cases against the farmers from whom it had sought damages ranging between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.05 crore for illegally growing and selling their potato variety  FL-2027  registered under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001. In all, 11 farmers are facing lawsuits filed by the company. Three of them, however, had previous contracts with PepsiCo.When asked about the meeting, PepsiCos Kotecha said that the state government wanted to know from them the details of the issue, and refused to divulge any further details.Chief Secretary, however, said that the company told them that they wanted to amicably resolve the issue.Singh said that they told PepsiCo that instead of filing lawsuits against the farmers, they should have informed the state government about the issue. We told them that had they informed us prior about the issue, the controversy could have been avoided, Director (Agriculture) Bharat Modi said.Meanwhile, Kavitha Kuruganthi of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), a nationwide network of more than 400 farmers organisations, hit out at the Gujarat government for trying to settle the issue without the involvement of any farmers.What is the government so afraid of that it is trying a settlement without any farmers involvement? The PPV&FR Act is clearly on the side of farmers. The government has no business in committing on behalf of the farmers. This kind of arrangement is completely against section 39 (1) (iv) of the Act. Moreover, in case of such an arrangement, we are looking at lakhs of farmers losing freedom of sowing, Kuruganthi said.While a senior government officer expressed apprehension of Gujarat farmers losing out on contract farming and healthy rates of potato yield from companies like PepsiCo if more such violations are reported from the state, Kuruganthi disagreed.The possibility of PepsiCo moving out of the state should not be a concern. What Gujarat government should look at is what is at stake here  lakhs of livelihood of farmers as what happens with this case will set a precedent, and the effects of it would not be restricted to the few farmers facing the lawsuit at present.(With inputs from Sohini Ghosh)"

A love for the game, of course, but also what he or she eats.At the IPL, which features players from across the world, team nutritionists are flooded with a variety of food requestslocal bacon wont cut it for most overseas players, and organic, free-range eggs are popular.Coconut water first thing in the morning is the main request for many of the guys, says John Gloster, ex-Indian cricket team physiotherapist now working with the Rajasthan Royals. Fresh berries is the other one, and macademia nuts are popular.English players have a thing for organic farm produce, says Sumeshen Moodley, the South African head of medical at DC, but there are other demands that he struggles to meet.In Delhi Capitals we have guys from South Africa, New Zealand. They dont get good quality red meat in India, so thats a little bit of a downer. They crave steaks, but in India you wont get beef. For them lamb is a sort of forced substitute.While meat is the preferred source of protein for most, there are some vegetarian exceptions, and the experts agree that there is no such thing as a standard good diet.READ: Gambhir reacts to Afridis remarks, says will take him to a psychiatristIndia did not become the No. 1 Test nation by eating poorly. Rather than blindly following what the overseas players are having, one should stick with whats working for them, Moodley says.Like Shikhar Dhawan. He has been around for a long time. As a young player he didnt care about what he ate as long as he was performing well. As he got more mature and thought of prolonging his career he started following a strict diet, training seriously, and became a vegetarian. We had a conversation recently and his muscle mass is returning to what it was when he was eating meat. Its because his body has adjusted to the new diet. He is getting the proper amount of protein from sources other than meat.BespokeThe work of a modern sports nutritionist is to carefully tailor dietary needs according to the sport as well as the athlete. No single size fits all.T20 cricket is quick, short, it requires high intensity, says Badrinath Prathi, head physiotherapist at the Delhi and District Cricket Association. Speed is important. So, good fat, good carbohydrate, low oil, high protein diet. Top teams now do nutritional profiling, plus blood tests, to determine the individual need and allergic profile of a player.With matches in the IPL crammed into a tight schedule, recovery becomes trickier than it already is in elite sports, and nutrition plays a critical role here.Match-day nutrition is divided into three partsbefore, during, after. The basic quality of a match day meal is that it should be easily digestablenon-spicy, non-oilyit helps the body absorb the nutrients easily and release energy during the match, says Prathi, who has worked with Indian womens cricket team as well as the Indian football team.READ: 2019 WC: Yuvraj Singh makes bold prediction about Hardik PandyaA typical breakfast features wholemeal bread, eggs, and complex cereals (like granola or muesli), to give the body a energy bank.A player on an average burns about 3000-4000 calorie while a normal person may burn 2000 calories, Prathi says. Also, hydration with high water content fruit and electrolyte rich drinks in the morning as during the day or evening matches they tend to lose a lot of water.Gloster added that he prefers that players have their pre-match meal at least three hours before the game, with a focus on good carbohydrates and high protein with little or no sugar.I dont tell the players anything specific to have other than the normal food on a match day, Gloster says. For me how the food is prepared is more important. We dont cook the foods in poly unsaturated vegetable oils. All foods are cooked in either saturated or mono unsaturated fats.DCs Moodley elaborates on good carbohydratesminimally processed, slow-releasing starches like brown rice, brown pasta, and potatoes.When you are playing or training with high intensity, there is a breakdown of tissue, Moodley says. So, internally, we need to repair cells and tissues. Protein and mineral rich foods like fish, leafy vegetables, eggs, meat, and whole grains is advised post match or training.No sugarKeeping away from sugar is the one directive followed by all teams, even when it comes to hydration.Sugar is inflammatory, Gloster explains. The players systems are going to be inflammed due to training, playing, travelling, cortisol that is released because of excitement or stress. We dont use sugar-based energy drink or sugar in any form. We use drinks which are electrolyte based.READ: Shubman Gill creates history, claims unique record with fifty against KXIPThough non-match days are less restrictive, players are expected to follow some basic guidelines.You dont get results from proper nutrition just by following a strict diet on match days, Prathi says. Players have the liberty to go out and eat on break days but they have become far more cautious now. Some prefer five meals on non-match days to fill the tanks but the basic target of a non-match day meal is not different from a match day. The protein intake is in a greater quantity to aid in the recovery process. Prathi said.Sometimes, it is important to trick the mind to stick to the nutrition plan.Players work in a high stress environment, and under stress, people often eat more, Prathi says. Sometimes we give players smaller plates and cutlery to curb that. The right diet requires behavioural efforts too.First Published: May 04, 2019 13:18 IST"

2019-05-05,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chips-at-stake-in-pepsico-farmers-fight/article27035550.ece,Chips at stake in the PepsiCo-farmers fight,"The story so far: A David versus Goliath story has played out in Gujarat over the last month, with food and beverages giant PepsiCo dragging potato farmers to court for allegedly growing its registered potato variety used to make Lays chips. Four small farmers from Sabarkantha district were sued 1.05 crore each, although they cite a law allowing them to grow and sell even registered plant varieties. Faced with growing social media outrage, boycott calls from farmers groups and condemnation from major political parties, the company finally agreed to withdraw cases after talks with the Gujarat government.When was the variety introduced?PepsiCo introduced, in 2009, the FC5 variety of potato that it uses to make its popular Lays potato chips to India. The potato variety is grown by approximately 12,000 farmers who are a part of the companys collaborative farming programme, wherein the company sells seeds to farmers and has an exclusive contract to buy back their produce. In 2016, the company registered the variety under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001 (PPV&FRA).Also Read Farmers worried PepsiCo-govt. talks will dilute their rightsFinding that farmers who were not part of its collaborative farming programme were also growing and selling potatoes of this variety in Gujarat, PepsiCo filed rights infringement cases under the Act against some farmers in Sabarkantha, Banaskantha and Aravalli districts in 2018 and 2019. Farmers allege that the company hired a private detective agency to pose as potential buyers, take secret video footage and collect samples from farmers fields without disclosing its real intent.What is the farmers stand?The 4.2 crore lawsuit against four small farmers in Sabarkantha district was heard by an Ahmedabad commercial court on April 9, and an ex-parte injunction ordered against the farmers. However, farmers rights groups across the country began a campaign against PepsiCo, requesting the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority to intervene in the case and bear the farmers legal costs using the National Gene Fund. At the April 26 hearing, the company offered an out-of-court settlement to the farmers on the condition that they give an undertaking not to grow the registered variety and surrender existing stocks or to join its collaborative farming programme.Demanding an unconditional withdrawal of cases, farmers unions affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well as the Left parties joined in boycott calls against PepsiCo products and stoked outrage on social media as well. In the midst of an election season in which agricultural issues are in the spotlight, senior political leaders from the Congress and BJP added their criticism. On April 27, the Gujarat government announced that it would back the farmers and join the legal case on their behalf, although it later indicated it was working toward an out-of-court settlement. Finally, on May 2, PepsiCo agreed to withdraw all nine cases after discussions with the government.What is the legal basis for the suit?Both PepsiCo and the farmers cite the same Act to support their opposing positions. The PPV&FRA was enacted in 2001 to comply with the World Trade Organisations Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.PepsiCo based its suits on Section 64 of the Act dealing with infringements of the registered breeders rights and subsequent penalties. The farmers legal case depended on Section 39 of the Act, which allows the cultivator to save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share or sell his farm produce including seed of a variety protected under this Act with the sole exception of branded seed. As this section begins with the words Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, farmers claim their rights have precedence.Over the last decade, more than 3,600 plant varieties have been registered under the Act, with more than half of the registration certificates going to farmers themselves. This was the first case of infringement of rights under the Act, according to the central agency set up to implement the Act.Who are the stakeholders and what are the stakes?The company is harassing us. I am not a crorepati, I cannot afford to pay these damages they want, says Haribhai Patel, who owns four acres and was sued for 1.05 crore. He claims he bought potato seeds locally, and is within his rights to grow and sell any variety. Even PepsiCo supporters admit that they lost the perception battle by dragging small farmers to court for large sums in election season.However, some of the farmers sued in 2018 seem to be larger players with bigger stakes in the game. Fulchand Kachchhawa reportedly owns over 150 acres of land, as well as cold storage facilities, and is a potato grower and trader selling much of his produce to Balaji Wafers, the major regional competitor of Lays chips. It is alleged that he sells the registered variety of seeds to smaller farmers and buys their produce as well. It is unclear whether his activities would be protected under Section 39 of the PPV&FRA.PepsiCo says its collaborative farming programme and registered variety rights are under threat. While Lays claims to be a leader in the countrys 5,500 crore potato chips market, regional players are eating into the market share.Farmers rights groups such as the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture saw the issue as a test case on farmers rights in India under the WTO regime, and warned that a bad precedent could hurt farmers of other crops and endanger the countrys food sovereignty.What happens next?While farmers have claimed victory, they also demanded an apology from PepsiCo and plan to sue for compensation for harassment by the company. They are also wary of any future government-facilitated negotiations on seed protection and the rights of breeders. Pepsicos decision to withdraw the cases was backed by an assurance from the government for a long term amicable settlement, according to sources familiar with the development, who added that both the Gujarat government and the Centre were involved in that assurance for further talks."

2019-05-07,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/may/07/vegetable-prices-drop-post-fani-1973739.html,Vegetable prices drop post Fani,"By Express News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: Unusual it may seem. Post cyclone Fani, prices of essential commodities and vegetables are either normal or have been slashed at the main markets of the Capital. Vegetables are now priced half than the usual rates for this time of the year.According to sources in Unit-I market, potato which was priced at `22 to `30 on May 2 due to panic buying, is now being sold `18 to `20 a kilo. Onion is also priced almost the same. While the price of brinjal is `20 to `30 a kg, ladyfinger, tomato, carrot and pointed gourd are priced at `20 a kilo each. Similarly, drumstick is being sold at `30 a kilo and cauliflower `30 per piece.In an usual situation, price of essential commodities and perishable items including vegetables skyrocket after calamities as vehicular movement is disrupted and traders face a daunting task to meet the daily requirement. Fani has been a different experience for traders, who had stocked up on vegetables and essentials going by the forecast about the extremely severe cyclone. They are now forced to clear the stock at cheaper price to avoid huge losses. There is no power and water for the last four days. How can we stock the vegetables without power. We are forced to sell those commodities at half the usual price to clear the stock, said a wholesale vegetable trader Jagabandhu Khuntia.As the forecast was for heavy rain after the cyclone, I had stocked one quintal each of tomato and brinjal besides 50 kg each of pointed gourd and ladies finger. Almost 50 per cent of the stock has perished, said Saroj Samal, a vendor at the Unit-IX market. Meanwhile, as there is no issue of vehicular communication with the neighbouring States, vegetables are arriving regularly and suspecting black-marketing and hoarding, marketing inspectors are conducting surprise raids.The price of fruits is, however, soaring as the demand is more and supply is less. Make-shift shops of many fruit vendors have been damaged in the cyclone. While banana is being sold `80 to `100 a dozen, apple is priced `200 a kilo."

While there is an acute shortage of drinking water, vegetables prices have skyrocketed in the last three days.Almost every vegetable is selling at`40 to `50 per kg and potatoes that sold at `10 before Fani, are now selling at `40 a kg. Dukhi Bewa, a villager of Raghunathpur, said poor villagers are the worst hit as they cannot afford vegetables now. What can I buy if the rates of vegetable are as high as `50 per kg. I have to feed a family of eight but no money to buy vegetables for them, he said.Kerosene, which is high in demand by rural populace now, is being sold at `80 per litre. In the absence of electricity, people are mostly dependent on lanterns that need kerosene. In Paradip and Jagatsinghpur towns, unscrupulous PDS dealers are selling it at `100 a litre. Other villagers of affected areas in Erasama and Balikuda alleged that vegetables vanished soon after the cyclone hit the district and currently, an artificial scarcity of essential commodities and vegetables has been created by unscrupulous traders. Neither the district administration nor the Civil Supply Department officials have taken any steps to check hoarding or price hike of vegetables.Meanwhile, the cyclone has destroyed crops in thousands of acres of land.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Ram Chandra Nayak said green gram crop has been destroyed in 22,000 hectares (ha) of land while vegetables in 2,100 ha and paddy crops on 323 ha are damaged. He said a joint verification will be conducted by revenue inspectors and village level workers for assessment of crop loss due to cyclone Fani and the report would be submitted to the State Government in two to three days. Compensation of `6,800 will be provided to farmers for crop loss in one ha of land in rain-fed area, `13,500 for per ha of irrigated land and `18,000 per ha of horticulture crops like mangoes and jackfruits.On the other hand, the district administration has started taking measures to supply drinking water to Fani-hit people. There are 255 piped water supply projects in the district and generators are being used to pump water from 31 such projects, solar pump sets are being used to activate 14 water projects and 45 tankers are being used to provide water in town areas, As many as 13,704 tube-wells have been repaired to supply drinking water to affected people."

We had been surviving on two buckets of water a day. Today we received four buckets and I feel I have won a lottery, he said.Four days after Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani ravaged eastern Odisha and disrupted life, many pockets in Bhubaneswar continue to ration water to two buckets per day.The Indian Express visited slum settlements in the city and found that the larger ones had access to water tankers, sometimes twice a day. The strength of these communities lies in numbers, which can either pressure local government to provide water, or source it themselves.AdvertisingAccording to the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, 184 MLD of water is currently being supplied by the Public Health Engineer Organisation. In the worst-affected areas, water supply is restored with the help of 164 tankers, 114 diesel generator sets and 600 PVC tanks, the corporation claimed.However, in smaller slum settlements, which are scattered across the city, water shortage is particularly acute as there are not enough people to raise a clamour. In scattered pockets near Patia, Sainik School and Damana, clusters of 10 to 20 families are moving heaven and earth to obtain water.Janardhans slum settlement only has around eight families.Generally we allocate water usage for Musa, the youngest, first. In this heat, he is the only person allowed a bath with one mug of water, said Janardhans son, Bijay.This allocation is also fair because Musa does not need drinking water, his cousins say. The teenage girls are piqued that they are not even allowed to wash their faces. Bathing is out of the question.The rest of the family is on a rigorous drill. Water is used to boil rice and potatoes in the same pot. The residual water is available for anyone who wants a drink.Only one bucket of clear drinking water remains. It is boiled and cooled so that no one falls sick. However, no family member tries to take more than one cup.We spent Friday inside a Kalyan Mandap (marriage hall) that was well built and fully stocked with flattened rice and gur provided by the state government, said Janardhan, glaring at a neighbours boy, who was eying one of his buckets. The day of the storm was comfortable. We are seeing hard days now.Janardhans neighbour Sarbeswar Das, 42, has volunteered to fetch water on his dalla auto (open auto).He says he visits different parts of the city, asking for access to all sources of water from handpumps to ponds. He says that sometimes guards in closed office buildings allow him access to taps in the premises so that he can fill a plastic tank mounted on the open space of his auto.I have two young boys from our settlement assist me. I cant fill up the entire tank because it will be too heavy to shift or consume too much fuel to transport, he says."

Vegetable prices in affected areas have skyrocketed. So have fuel prices. Drinking water supply, too, is a cause for concern as people struggle to make ends meet in the disaster zone.Puri, where Fani made landfall on May 3, is almost pulverised as if hit by some brutal force that left bruising scars on several prominent landmarks.The iron scaffolding covering the Jagannath temple, the biggest tourist attraction in the city, has crumbled. Kalpa Bata, a huge banyan tree in the sprawling temple, has broken.The roofs of the residence of the district collector and the superintendent of police were blown away. The gate of the heritage hotel BNR Chanakya lay in tatters. As the extremely severe cyclone hit Odisha, several buses overturned and two-wheelers kept in showrooms were flung away.In Kathauli village of Puris Brahmagiri block, farmer Daitari Lenka said he had never seen the sea so angry and hot. Two days before the storm hit, it seemed as if it [the sea] was spewing fire..., recounted Lenka, who took shelter in a broken concrete pipe.In Bhubaneswar, it uprooted electric poles and trees, shattered window panes of several residential and commercial complexes, and damaging the facade and roof of the Biju Patnaik International Airport. In neighbouring Cuttack, the cyclone hit the Orissa High Court, which is still shut.Cyclone Fani is one of the rarest of rare summer cyclones to hit Odisha in 43 years. The devastation is unfathomable and unprecedented, tweeted chief minister Naveen Patnaik, a day after the cyclone ripped through the Odisha coast.A day before the cyclone hit, his administration evacuated over 1.4 million people in the arc of the cyclone to safe houses. The states prompt action earned applause from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited Odisha on May 6.The Centre has already announced an assistance of ~1,000 crore after making an aerial survey of the affected areas, and has promised more.The states efforts minimised the damage, but it is grappling with relief and restoration work. Power and telecom connectivity has been hit hard, with the cyclone damaging the infrastructure. Over 14 million people in about 16,000 villages and 51 urban local bodies have been affected by Fani.State energy secretary Hemant Sharma said 156,000 electric poles were uprooted or damaged in the state; Puri alone accounted for 56,000 of them.Over 5,030km of 33 kilovolt lines, 38,613km of 11 kilovolt lines, 79,485km of low tension lines and 11,077 distribution transformers have been completely damaged.The telecom services have suffered near-total breakdown in Puri, Khurda and Cuttack, with several mobile towers of BSNL, Reliance Jio and Airtel damaged.Sharma said the state has around 2500-odd technicians to work on damaged power lines while the requirement is the double. We are trying to restore power to 25% of the areas in Bhubaneswar by Tuesday, he said.But officials in his department, speaking on condition of anonymity, say power connection may not be restored before a week. So far, just 200-odd consumers of CESU [Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha] in Bhubaneswar have been given power, while there are 300,000 consumers, said the official. In Puri, officials say it would be a much longer wait.Already in the grip of a cruel summer, the lack of power has hit the people of Puri and Khurda  of which Bhubaneswar is a part  hard as they depend on bore wells, which run on electricity.I cannot afford a generator set. So I tried getting one on rent. But the rates are climbing up  from ~1,000 an hour 3 days ago to ~1500 an hour today, said Nityananda Swain of Bhubaneswars Bapuji Nagar.In Puri, housewife Anima Das said she is planning to leave for her parents house in Dhenkanal district, which escaped the fury of cyclone. I have not taken bath since the day cyclone hit. I am buying water for my kids. This is proving to be very difficult, said Das. In Bhubaneswar and Puri, the government has deployed water tankers to supply drinking water. But that too is inadequate. In the capital, people in a housing colony blocked a road, demanding water.So far there has been no outbreak of any diseases in the affected areas, but the government is cautious. We have opened 804 medical rehabilitation centres and deployed 321 mobile medical teams. Over 5700 open water sources have been disinfected and 2.85 million ORS sachets have been distributed, said state health secretary Pramod Meherda.Apart from the telecom and electrical infrastructure, the green canopy that Puri and Bhubaneswar once boasted of has been a casualty of the cyclone. We are yet to make an assessment of the number of coconut trees, banyan trees and several other trees that dotted the landscape. The numbers would run into millions, said special relief commissioner Bishnupada Sethi.The cyclone has also set the prices of essential goods skyrocketing, with potato selling at Rs 20 a kg and eggs at Rs 8-10 apiece.With the markets devastated by the cyclone, vegetable prices have hit the roof. Though few petrol pumps are open, fuel is selling ~Rs 150-200 a litre in the interiors of Puri. With no power and water, a large number of students in Bhubaneswar are finding it difficult. There are very few roadside eateries left.. .I am heading for my village, said Soumya Sourav Mohanty, an engineering student. The other major problem that people in Puri and Bhubaneswar are facing is non-functional ATMs.Sunanda Swain, who works in a private organisation, queued up before the ATM in Sahid Nagar area on Tuesday morning, but when her turn came, she found it out of order.I have gone around the area checking almost all ATMs. I have to get some cash...as shops are only accepting cash and not cards, said Swain.Odisha chief minister Patnaik announced two days ago that all families covered under the National Food Security Act in Puri district and Bhubaneswar city will get 50kg of rice, Rs 2,000 and polythene sheets.But for fisherfolk in Puris Penthakota area who lost their homes to the cyclone, the long wait for relief did not end on a happy note.The rice is all soggy and unfit for human consumption. Are we dogs that they gave us such relief? asked D Divya, a fisherwoman, who stood under the scorching sun, waiting for relief material.As dusk fell and candles were lit in the shacks at Puri beach, Telugu fisherman P Dhananjay Swami sat on a dingy just across his house in Betanolia sahi. The cyclone flattened his asbestos-roofed house and flung his boat several metres away.Earlier we used to sleep on the beach without any care for the waves. But after Fani, I am scared of the sea. I had never seen it so violent, he said.First Published: May 08, 2019 08:24 IST"

Members of 50 to 70 Sikh families in Bhubaneswar and volunteers of an International voluntary organisation, Khalsa Aid, work in shifts at the Gurudwara to cook meals, serve food to people in the Capital and Puri.Around 100 kg each of dal and rice are cooked at Bhubaneswar Gurudwara for the affected people of the two cities. Eight volunteers of Khalsa Aid have been taking meals to the people in Puri from Monday. They will soon serve meals at Gop and Konark too. Secretary of Bhubaneswar Gurudwara, Satpal Singh, went to Puri on Tuesday to take a stock of the distribution.While women and elderly prepare meals, youngsters distribute it among people standing in a queue outside the Gurudwara during lunch and dinner time. The preparations begin from 7 am. Nothing was planned. The day, after Fani, we rushed to the Gurudwara to help people. We did not want the people to starve. In fact, we will continue to serve people until everything returns to normal. It could take a weeks time, a month or whole year. We are ready for it,said Gangandeep, a resident of Rasulgarh area.Volunteers of Khalsa Aid had come to Odisha from other cities like Kolkata and Delhi. Members of Gurudwara claimed teams from Punjab might also turn up for helping them. Each family comes foreword to donate the supplies for langar. People in Puri dont have utensils. I was moved to tears when a man came to us with a polythene sheet, a volunteer in Puri said.People run for cashJeypore: Cyclone Fani may have spared Koraput but its repercussions are being felt by the people across the district. Disruption in telecommunication services has hit banking transactions, leaving the people penniless. With BSNL, the major service provider, down, Internet connectivity has become a major challenge. Most of the ATMs across the district are running dry, while banking service in Jeypore, Koraput, Sunabeda and Kotpad areas are yet to get linked with Internet as a result customers are finding it tough to get their works done. People are struggling to get cash for the past three days. Sources said local networks are unable to link with the main server in Bhubaneswar.Insufficient cash reserve in SBI main branches has led to shortage of cash in ATMs and things can be streamlined only after banks in Bhubaneswar re-start regular work. In the absence of cash, people are facing difficulties in purchasing essential commodities. On the other hand, prices of vegetable have gone through the roof. Tomato is priced at `50 per kg while the potato is selling for `25 per kg.Market sources said transporters of neighbouring districts and Andhra Pradesh have stopped plying their vehicles under the impact of the cyclone resulting in low supply of essential commodities. Taking advantage of the situation are the wholesalers, who are resorting to hoarding and jacking up prices. Fani has also impacted Government work with local offices unable to connect with their headquarters in Bhubaneswar for daily activities."

PepsiCo accused them of stealing a variety of potato over which it claims to have exclusive rights, seeking damages of Rs 1 crore from each.The case could have financially wrecked the farmers and possibly meant jail time. In a stunning reversal, PepsiCo said on Thursday, May 2, that it would drop the charges. We would have never been able to pay that sum. We would have had to commit suicide, said Bipin Patel.Hannah Lownbrough, the executive director of UK-based Sum Of Us, a group that describes itself as fighting for people over profits, said from London that PepsiCo suing the four Indian farmers was a bit of a nonsense.The action against the four Patels also set off international protests. I was told that pro-farmer groups in France have initiated a coordinated cyberaction to denounce PepsiCo, said Kapil Shah, the founder of Vadodara-based Jatan Trust, a farmers rights advocacy group defending the farmers.As civil society came forward to challenge PepsiCo, the company felt the issue could blow up into a major political controversy in the middle of Indias general elections, people with knowledge of the companys stance said on condition of anonymity.When the farmers were served the summonses, they didnt rush to a lawyer. Rather, they tipped off the local leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, the influential farm wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The general secretary of Gujarats BKS chapter, BK Patel, hails from the same district as the farmers.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), another affiliate of the RSS, also jumped to the farmers defence. According to Ashwini Mahajan of the SJM, PepsiCos actions amounted to coercion of the farmers.Both BKS and SJM have been outspoken about restricting multinationals to protect Indian businesses and farmers.I was furious, says BK Patel.Patel got in touch with Kapil Shah, who is well known for his advocacy of farmers rights. In a coordinated move, Shah reached out to nearly 200 organisations countrywide.In a rare instance, both right-wing and left-leaning organisations, such as the Leftist All-India Kisan Sabha, joined hands.BKS approached Gujarat deputy chief minister, Nitin Patel, and formally asked the government to intervene on April 24, BKPatel said. In a jolt to PepsiCo, the deputy chief minister on April 28 told the BKS that the state government was considering pleading the Ahmedabad commercial court to make it a party in the case in favour of the farmers.A day after PepsiCo said it was withdrawing the cases, farm activists from both left and rightwing organisations assembled at Gujarats historic Gandhi Vidyapith.When something so drastic and unjustifiable like this happens, everybody likes to work for farmers. Not just for political reasons. Can a multinational be allowed to claim 1 crore from farmers in this country? Left, right, centreeverybody will fight it. The seed must be protected, said Shah.PepsiCo filed the lawsuits on April 5, alleging the farmers were growing the FC5 potato variety, which PepsiCo exclusively uses for Lays potato chips because it has the rights under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Right Act. PepsiCo secured a certificate of registration of FC5 in February 2016 from Indias plant varieties registry, it says.PepsiCo has said that according to section 28 of the Act, as the registered breeder of FC5, it had exclusive rights over the variety. Farm activists argue that the same Act, under section 39, allows farmers to save, use, sow resow, exchange, share or sell a protected variety like FC5 as long as it is not sold as a branded item.PepsiCo also says that the company and its predecessors have carried out extensive research, studies and trials towards developing FC5 and spent huge amounts of money towards the same.The court battle may not be over yet, although PepsiCo announced the withdrawal of the lawsuit in a statement. Shah said on Sunday that PepsiCos lawyer told him in writing that he had received no communication from the company with regard to withdrawal of the cases. Shah has called for more meetings that could see farm associations from the right, left and centre prepare their next round of a David-Goliath farm battle.First Published: May 08, 2019 07:47 IST"

In desperation, the woman along with Panchayat representatives came to the Collectors office on Wednesday to plead for help.The family has no roof over the head and no food to eat. People are helping her but for how long. The Government has to step in and provide her the much needed succour., said Kabita Das, former sarpanch of the panchayat.Das said she met sarpanch, revenue inspector and BDO seeking help for the widow, but to no avail. After receiving no help from the officials, they had to come to the Collectors office. They lodged a complaint with emergency control room officials there.Similar stories abound in the Fani-ravaged parts of the district and scores of such people flocked to the Collectors office seeking help and assistance from the district administration.Another widow, Golap Kandi who stays with her children in Bhoi Sahi under Ward 1 of the city alleged that she has not yet received any help from the authorities.People volunteering to help those affected by the storm corroborated that relief isnt reaching the needy. Polythene sheets and relief materials are yet to be delivered to the cyclone victims staying in Wards 3 and 27. On Tuesday, the authorities distributed some biscuit packets which were not even edible, alleged Urmila Jena, a volunteer.Resentment is also brewing among residents over slow progress of restoration works in Cuttack, one of the worst-affected districts.Before the cyclone made a landfall, the officials said they were ready to handle any emergency. However, the reality is entirely different, Akhay Ranjan Das, a resident.In the Millennium City, which is the hub of business activities, business has taken a beating. Most of the shop owners have downed the shutters at prime locations like Buxi Bazaar, Ranihat and College Square. Retailers in Malgodown are closing their shops in the evening due to unavailability of power supply. A retailer, Prakash Dalei said as several roads were blocked in various parts of the State, transportation of essential commodities including potatoes from West Bengal is getting delayed.A delegation of entrepreneurs met Cuttack Collector Aravind Agrawal on Wednesday and urged him to speed up restoration works in Jagatpur area, on the outskirts of Cuttack city.There are over 800 small and medium enterprises in Jagatpur. As there is no power supply, production in all the industries has come to a standstill, Odisha Industries Association chairman Abani Kanungo said.Power to be back todayCuttack: The district administration on Wednesday asserted that power supply will be restored in 90 per cent areas of Cuttack city by Thursday. Cuttack was affected to a great extent by cyclone Fani and our first priority is to complete the relief operations. Power supply, drinking water, health services and sanitation are major challenges facing us and we are putting in all efforts to meet the requirements, said Collector Aravind Agrawal. So far, power has been restored in about 30 per cent areas of the city. It may take another day to restore electricity at places which suffered extensive damage. Power and water supply will be normal in the City by May 10, he said. Official sources said the date of restoration of power supply was scheduled after observing the extent of damage to CESU network in the City. The administration is also focusing on health services to avoid outbreak of any epidemic, Agrawal added."
2019-05-09,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/may/09/blame-bowel-cancer-on-obesity-1974445.html,Blame bowel cancer on obesity,"Dr Rajshekhar C Jaka ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer among men and the second most common cancer in women across the globe. Even though the incidence of bowel cancer cases was less in India in the past, the number of patients has been increasing day by day with more prevalence among the young crowd. Doctors blame obesity as one of the major reasons for bowel cancer. The changes in food habits and lack of physical exercise and leading a sedentary lifestyle have increased the risk factors in recent days and are leading to bowel cancer.Bowel cancer occurs when some of the cells in the colon or rectum have extra growth. The Western forms of diets are typically high in fat and low in fibre and can increase the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference, thus resulting in bowel cancer. Also, obese people are often found to have increased blood insulin levels.According to studies, India is home to the second highest number of young people with obesity. Almost 49% people in the metro cities have been found to be obese with their BMI being 25 and more and 24% people are in overweight category with the BMI ranging between 23  24.9. These statistics indicate the scary truth of unhealthy eating habits and following a low to moderate sedentary lifestyle. Youngsters fall prey to obesity early due to their ignorance towards following a healthy diet, hectic work schedules, erratic work shifts, and less time to plan on what they eat and consume readily available junk food. It is important to understand the ill effects of unhealthy diets and food habits. A few of the factors that cause more harm and lead to obesity include:Junk food: Junk food has become an inevitable part of diet routine, given that they are cheap, tasty and easy to have. However, instead of adding any benefits to health, they only add extra calories to our bodies.Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that is responsible for allowing glucose in the blood to enter cells providing them with the energy to function. Insulin plays an effective role in obesity. One of the best ways to lower your insulin is to cut back on simple or refined carbohydrates while increasing fiber intake.Sugar: Sugar when consumed in excess contributes to weight gain. Added sugar is half glucose, half fructose. People consume glucose from a variety of foods, including starchy foods, but the majority of fructose comes from added sugar. Excess fructose intake may cause insulin resistance and elevated insulin levels. It also doesnt promote satiety in the same way glucose does.Sedentary Lifestyle: Spending too much time being a couch potato and using electronic gadgets results in reduced physical activity. This can lead to increase of body mass index.Breast Feeding: Breast feeding can protect children from becoming obese to a great extent. Mothers, especially working, find it difficult to breast feed their children for a longer duration as prescribed by the doctors today. Breast milk has been proven to be the best food for children under one year.Obesity imposes a greater risk of bowel cancer mainly for men and premenopausal women. Other symptoms of bowel cancer include diarrhea or constipation, lasting abdominal pain, blood in stool or rectal bleeding, weakness and loss of weight.An obese person is under the risk of not only bowel cancer but also many other health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke etc. Managing obesity helps in leading a healthy life and prevent bowel cancer risk.Also, avoiding physical inactivity and smoking can further reduce the risk of bowel cancer among youngsters. Since almost 50% of the chances of having bowel cancer are attributed to dietary factors, it is important to increase the intake of fruits, vegetables and fiber. Reducing the consumption of red meat will also help in avoiding bowel cancer.(The writer is a Surgical Oncologist,BR Life SSNMC Hospital)"

Brainchild of Chef Sujan Sarkar, Rooh New Delhi opened doors this April in an approximately 160-year-old refurbished haveli that overlooks the quietly illuminated Qutb Minar. Expect typical old-world charm of white walls, high ceilings, niches, arch corridors and mellow lighting.Samrat Banerjee, Director Operations, who greets us warmly at the entrance, briefs us about the moniker.The name is familiar to those who have visited Rooh as the first modern Indian restaurant in San Francisco, and since 2017 it has undeniably been the most visited spot. In India, we like to call it a progressive, modern, contemporary outlet as it brings the spirit of India, where the style and philosophy is not compromised, he feels.As we pop in a compressed amla with wood-apple chutney, a palate cleanser, Banerjee tells us that the fruit is freshly procured from the kitchen farm inside the premise, thus, focusing on local and sustainable produce. We settle in to have the first welcome dish from the 11-course tasting menu prepared by Chef Sujan Sarkar at his live-kitchen-cum-studio.Our menu is a combination of traditional Indian flavours and modern cooking techniques attending to the local palate, he says.Every dish is a piece of culinary art, thats why almost 35 per cent of the space in the restaurant is given to back-end services like kitchen and bar. We have tried to give our diners a perspective to eat, enjoy and take pictures that are unforgettable. Hence, every dish needs to have a story and a why is very important, explains Chatterjee.The offering on the menu is dotted with some surprisingly different looking chaat. Our first dish was the reloaded version of Purani Dilli ki Chaat with puchkas made from passion fruit jelly which bursts in your mouth with the first bite or the white textured dot-like yogurt with a sweet-tangy taste of a dahi-chutney.I sampled the Goat Curd with Parantha and Tomato Relish. It was creamy, especially because the softer-than-usual paranthas were fermented with flour and potato. Melon Rasam with Sea Buckthorn and Tender Coconut was slightly tangy with a rich flavour of melon. Mango Yolk, a dessert that looked like an egg yolk but tasted like mango and tender coconut. From the staples, I liked the sumptuous khichdi, made only from lentils, no rice.The bar menu has nine cocktails (and six mocktails) based on the sensory of Ayurveda: salt, pungent, astringent, bitter, or sweet. Even better, you can choose to any cocktail as a mocktail."
2019-05-09,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/pepsico-s-potato-lawsuit-raises-a-deeper-question/cid/1690173,PepsiCo's potato lawsuit raises a deeper question,"The local arm of the US-based international food giant, PepsiCo India Holdings Private Limited, had recently filed lawsuits against a few small farmers in Gujarat for violating the companys intellectual property rights on a variety of potato called FC5. The damages claimed are over one crore from some farmers. PepsiCo has exclusive rights on the variety by virtue of a Plant Variety Certificate granted under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act of 2001. The company uses this strain of potato to manufacture a popular brand of potato chips. The potatoes are grown in India by participating farmers who are under contract with PepsiCo to sell exclusively to the company. The farmers sued for the violation were not contract farmers for PepsiCo. Clause 64 of the legislation has been invoked for claiming exclusive rights. The farmers, on the other hand, have sought protection under Clause 39 of the same law which states that farmers are allowed to save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share or sell... farm produce including seed of a variety protected under this Act so long as they does not sell a branded seed. After protests by farmers and activists, PepsiCo has announced that it is willing to withdraw legal proceedings if the farmers join the set of participating farmers of PepsiCo or stop further production and sell their current stocks to PepsiCo.Obviously, the letter of the law is ambiguous and needs clarity. However, to settle that issue, a deeper question would have to be squarely faced. It relates to the advantages of IPR and contract farming versus the freedom of small farmers to grow what they want to. Contract farming can be a stable source of income and livelihood for poor farmers provided the crops grown are not harmful for the long term fertility of the soil or are environmentally damaging in any way. If, however, a farmer does not wish to get tied down to a contract, he should have enough freedom to choose his seeds as long as that choice does not infringe upon someone elses rights. IPR has come to stay in todays world of innovations. The need for ensuring small farmers having the capability to earn a decent income without violating IPR would depend on another set of imaginative innovations in the sphere of public policy. These include subsidies, minimum guaranteed incomes and technological improvements for productivity gains for small farmers."

2019-05-09,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-wake-up-call-on-proprietary-seeds/article27075187.ece,A wake-up call on proprietary seeds,"When the news broke that PepsiCo was suing small farmers in India for growing a potato variety that is used in its Lays chips, popular sympathies immediately went, of course, to the farmers. National and international pressure swiftly mounted, and in short order a humbled PepsiCo backtracked, announcing its withdrawal of the lawsuit. There was global schadenfreude at Goliaths PR disaster and, in India, pride at being on the side of the righteous Davids.What should not be a source of pride, however, is the fact that so many small farmers are, like the ones targeted by PepsiCo, reliant, directly or indirectly, on proprietary seeds. Typically these seeds are grown in high input (fertilizer-pesticide-irrigation) environments that, over time, erode local biodiversity. Between the expense of buying these seeds and inputs, and the loss of the skills and social relationships needed to do otherwise (through the saving and exchange of seeds of indigenous varieties), small-scale farming looks set to continue on its downward spiral of lower income, status and dignity.Its time for a paradigm shiftNo one can blame farmers for thinking that proprietary seeds are better. Since the days of the Green Revolution, agricultural extension officers  the field representatives of agricultural modernity  have taught farmers to buy ever-higher-yielding seeds. Taking this science-and-industry-know-best stance on seed quality a little further, efforts have been ongoing, albeit unsuccessfully due to pressures from farmers and NGOs, to pass a new seed law in India permitting the sale of certified seeds only.In the current Indian law regulating intellectual property rights in seeds, the Plant Variety Protection law, this same official preference for the proprietary takes a different form. The law permits farmers not only to save and resow (multiply) seeds, but also to sell them to other farmers, no matter what the original source of the seeds is. This broad permission (called farmers privilege) is considered indispensable for so-called seed sovereignty, which has become synonymous with permitting farmers to save, sow, multiply and use proprietary seeds, as well as proprietary vegetative propagation materials such as what are used for the cultivation of potatoes. Despite the shift away from seed replacement to the right to save seeds, the emphasis remains on proprietary seeds that have narrow, uniform and non-variable genetic builds. Where farmers could be using genetically distinctive seeds adapted to local conditions and farming traditions, they are instead adapting local conditions and traditions in order to use genetically standardised seeds, to ruinous effect.It is time for a paradigm shift. To get a sense of what can be done, it may be useful to take a peep into recent regulatory efforts in Europe. The EU Regulation on Organic Production and Labelling of Organic Products, adopted in 2018, for the first time permits and encourages, inter alia, the use and marketing for organic agriculture, of plant reproductive material of organic heterogenous material without having to comply with most of the arduous registration and certification requirements under various EU laws. Heterogenous materials, unlike current proprietary seeds, need not be uniform or stable. Indeed, the regulation clearly acknowledges based on Research in the Union on plant reproductive material that does not fulfil the variety definition... that there could be benefits of using such diverse material to reduce the spread of diseases, to improve resilience and to increase biodiversity. Accordingly, the regulation removes the legal bar on marketing of heterogenous materials and encourages its sale for organic agriculture, thus clearing the way to much more expansive use of indigenous varieties.Once the delegated acts under the EU regulation are formulated, they will support the creation of markets, especially markets and marketplaces facilitating trade of heterogenous seeds, including by small farmers who are currently the most active in maintaining and improving such seeds in situ. Indeed, multimillion-Euro research and innovation projects being invited and funded by the EU already aim to make this diversity a more integral part of farming in Europe. And here they are talking only of the diversity within Europe.Minimise harm, maximise gainHow can a biodiversity-rich nation like India shift its agriculture from a high-yield ideal to a high-value one, where the values include striving to minimise environmental harm while maximising nutritional gains and farmer welfare?First, small farmers must be educated and encouraged with proper incentive structures, to engage with agriculture that conserves and improves traditional/desi (heterogenous) seeds in situ, rather than with improved, proprietary varieties. Currently, in the garb of protecting this diversity against biopiracy, India is preventing its effective use, management and monetisation for the benefit of its farmers.Second, an immutable record-keeping system, perhaps blockchain or DLT, is needed to break the link between the profitable and the proprietary. Such a system would allow India and its rural communities to keep proper track of where and how their seeds/propagation materials and the genetic resources contained therein are being transferred and traded. It would also ensure, through smart-contract facilitated micropayments, that monetary returns come in from users and buyers of these seeds, from around the globe. These monetary returns would effectively incentivise continuous cultivation and improvement of indigenous seeds on the one hand, and ensure sustainable growth of agriculture and of rural communities on the other.Third, and as a key pre-requisite to the execution of the first two plans, Indias invaluable traditional ecological knowledge systems need to be revived and made a part of mainstream agricultural research, education and extension services. Know-how contained in ancient Indian treatises like the Vrikshayurveda and the Krishi Parashar falls within the scope of what international conventions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity refer to as indigenous and traditional technologies. The revival of these technologies is central to promoting sustainable high value agriculture, not least because of the growing global demand for organic and Ayurvedic products.The withdrawal of the lawsuit by PepsiCo may be a welcome relief to several farmers who can neither afford to defend themselves in court, nor to abandon the cultivation of proprietary varieties. It must, however, be a wake-up call to the government and policymakers who need to do much more to secure sustainable rural societies, protect soil health and promote seed sovereignty for the economic development of Indian farmers and of the entire nation.Mrinalini Kochupillai is a lecturer and Senior Research Fellow at the Technical University of Munich and Gregory Radick is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds"

It is the month of Ramzaan and some of the creaky, time-worn heritage precincts of the city, that have been battered with neglect, suddenly change into bright, shiny bazaars of satin, bangles, beaded caps, perfume and, above all, food. Isnt it a wonderful paradox that a festival observed as a month of fasting should invoke so much preoccupation, passion and zeal for eating and food?The focal point for me is always Mandvi and the lane flanking Minara Masjid towards Zakaria Masjid, off Mohammed Ali Road. Minara Masjid lights up with a thousand lights, and in the shadow of the iconic green mosque shine the even brighter colours of the sweets at Suleiman Usman Mithaiwalla. Pink Raspberry Patiya, dark maroon Anjeer Halwa, flaming yellow Kesar Pista Halwa, orange Badami Halwa, green Pineapple Halwa, snowy white Sutarfeni and golden brown Malpuas, made by mixing yolks, batter and sugar syrup and frying until golden. And of course the ever-popular phirni and aflatoon, both available in an exhibition of colours and flavours.With Suleiman Usman Mithaiwala on one side and Zam Zam Sweets on the other, if you dare to trash through the crowd and jostle your way into the narrow street, youve entered one of the largest roadside displays of food in the country.

Maybe the iconic Chinese n Grill, a restaurant deep inside the mayhem does do a commendable Nihari, yet Id rather walk down the road to Noor Mohammadi and have mine in relative peace and tranquility.If you want to escape the madness, then Bhendi Bazaar, which is just a couple of junctions away, is where Bohri Mohalla is. In there at the junction of Saifee Jubilee Street and Khara Tank Road is Firoz Farsan, who makes Patrel Biryani. I dont know why it is called that, since there is no rice in the dish. Its a thick, spicy gravy of meat with patrel in it. Its available all year round and is unbelievably eye-opening.There is, of course, Surti Baara Handi right behind it, at Kumbharwada, where different cuts of meat like pichhota (buff tail), paya (goats trotters), nalli nihari (marrow) etc are cooked tender in twelve vessels with secret spices, and can be ravaged with huge hot khameeri rotis from a roti fellow next door.Then there is Hamza for kiri kababs, also next door, and Jilani, whose owner Alambhai does great bheja, kheema, liver, kidney, baida roti, paya, and a spicy dry sukha potato. Alambhai is positively in love with me, and makes me feel like Im the king of Pakmodia Street every time I visit. Bhendi Bazaar is also home to Tawakkal Sweets. In this season they make unbelievably delicious Mango Mawa Barfi. Its soft and rich and is made fresh every day. Tawakkal is also known for their Malai Khaja, gentle sheets of puff pastry filled with fresh, sweetened malai.For an even quieter Ramzaan feast, head towards Crawford Market and Nagdevi Street. The Baara Handi here is less spicy and genuinely full of marrow. You can sit calmly at a makeshift table and devour a few plates with some hot roti. In Chippi Chawl at Nagdevi Cross Lane is Ruhani Restaurant; if you dont eat anything else there, just grab a Seekh Paratha, and I wont say more.I have to confess, though, that over the years Ive pretty much stopped going to the streets to eat during Ramzaan. Its hot, crowded and the effort just doesnt seem worth the food. Its a simple case of been there, done that, especially since the food honestly hasnt evolved for the better, and in some cases is under attack by the Chinese. And while I am assuming that I can still eat anything, anywhere, I think my palate has matured to the point where Ive become a tad gnostic.Amidst all this newfound disdain, one redeeming thing is that, a few years ago, Jaffer Bhai, the famous biryani franchise, opened a branch right there at the beginning of Mohammed Ali Road. When in doubt, I just incautiously head there. Their roadside tava counter that appears only during this month has it all  samosa, chicken lollipops, Indianised spring rolls and several things I cannot recognise, all fried, dark orange, and served with an oily Indo-Chine sauce that seems to go with everything and admittedly looks provocative.But I go there for the Khichda, Mutton Nihari, Chicken Leg Barra, Dabba Ghosh, Kheema and Mutton Biryani. Its Jaffer Bhai. Need I say more?Now, having read patiently through my musings, you could also completely ignore all this street food and everything Ive said and maybe turn a corner this Ramzaan and join me in my next column. Next week I hope to take you out of Mohammed Ali Road, to discover some other haunts in some other places, elsewhere. Some fancy, some not so fancy. So until then, dont fill up!First Published: May 10, 2019 17:36 IST"

The battle between farmers groups and the multinational company moves now from the judiciary to the governments next actions.Hailing this as a victory, farmers groups on Friday demanded that the State and Centre take a clear stand that plant variety registrations are subject to farmers rights to grow and sell such registered varieties, as long as they do not sell branded seed.PepsiCo withdrew its legal suits against four farmers in an Ahmedabad commercial court, as well as cases against five farmers in the Modasa district court on Friday. Two other cases against large farmers and traders were withdrawn in a Deesa court earlier this week.A PepsiCo spokesperson said the decision came after discussions with the government, and that the company wanted a long-term amicable resolution of seed protection issues.PepsiCo must apologise to the farmers for filing false lawsuits against them, said Anand Yagnik, a lawyer who represented four of the farmers, speaking to journalists in Ahmedabad. It was an act of intimidation, but the farmers did not surrender to the company.The Government of India had maintained an ominous silence on the legal situation in the country on farmers seed freedoms, taking cover of the matter being sub judice. Now it must make it amply clear that such litigation is not acceptable, said a statement from the Beej Adhikaar Manch, a newly formed association that seeks to protect farmers seed sovereignty.It said a public campaign would continue to urge the government to stand with farmers and instruct all registrants in the Plant Varieties Registry of India that their registration is conditional to the rights guaranteed to farmers in the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority Act, 2001.The law is crystal clear. Nothing less than a reiteration of farmers overriding rights will be acceptable to us and if the government wants to help farmers, it should actually get an undertaking from PepsiCo India that it will not resort to these intimidation tactics ever again, said Gabhubhai Chowdhari of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers group affiliated to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Any reference to some discussions that PepsiCo India was having with the government was not acceptable to us, when such discussions did not involve the affected farmers and farmers organisations and when there was no need for such discussions in the first instance. The Gujarat government can neither persuade nor dictate to farmers of the State that they need to take permission from some company that is claiming exclusive rights which then means that the government itself would be misleading the farmers on the law of the land, said Rajendra Khimani, President of the Gujarat Association of Agricultural Sciences."

2019-05-11,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/will-sps-gamble-work-in-phulpur/article27104339.ece,Will SP’s gamble work in Phulpur?,"A.K. Patel is of the view that the BJP has short-changed the Other Backward Class (OBC) community. His list of grievances is long: tampering of reservations, unfilled OBC vacancies, not providing the community representation commiserate with its numbers, upper castes favoured in jobs, and the 10% quota for general classes.The newly acquired pitch for social justice by the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also attracts him. However, he may still not vote against the BJP. The SP-BSP alliance, he reasons, is not in a position to form a government at the Centre. But the biggest factor lies somewhere else  caste.Mr. Patel, who works at a local court in Prayagraj, is a Kurmi, an agrarian OBC community and the most sizeable vote bloc in the Phulpur seat. While the BJP has again fielded a candidate from the caste, the SP has replaced its sitting Kurmi MP with a Yadav. This has alienated a major chunk of Kurmis. The two dominant OBC castes compete for space and representation.While Mr. Patel favours Backward Class unity and has no qualms about voting for a Yadav, he feels having an MP from his caste suits his interests better. I feel compelled. The candidate is from our caste, he says.Mr. Patel is talking about Keshri Devi Patel, an influential four-time zila panchayat member, who has fought the Lok Sabha election in 2004 and 2009 as a BSP candidate, though unsuccessfully. She switched to the BJP recently.In 2018, the SP wrested the Phulpur seat from the BJP in a byelection, overcoming a deficit of 3 lakh votes in the first display of a winnable SP-BSP arithmetic. Nagendra Patel triumphed over fellow Kurmi Kaushalendra Patel of the BJP by over 59,000 votes.Observers baffledHowever, baffling observers, the party not only denied ticket to the sitting MP, an organisation man, but also decided not to field a Kurmi at all. Instead, the party picked Pandhari Yadav, a senior district leader. A big gamble. Phulpur, which gave India its first Prime Minister, had a Kurmi MP for six consecutive terms from 1984 to 1999 before Atiq Ahmed, also with the SP then, broke the streak in 2004.Across the constituency, which encompasses large tracts of the Gangetic plain, Kurmis appeared largely enamoured of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 6,000 paid annually by the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), new toilets, new rural roads, and the lack of a person who will be the face of the Opposition are working in the BJPs favour.[There is] no guarantee when this coalition will break. And who is its head anyway, asks Dinesh Patel, a farmer in Phaphamau.Also in the fray is Pankaj Niranjan, the son-in-law of Kurmi leader Krishna Patel. Mr. Niranjan is fighting on the Congress symbol. While the party, which forfeited its deposit with just 19,000 votes in 2018, appears a distant third, the alliance hopes the Congress candidate will cut into the Kurmi votes. However, that looks far-fetched as Mr. Niranjan is an outsider and the Kurmis here are backing the Anupriya Patel faction of the Apna Dal. Anupriya is the sister of Pallavi Patel, Mr. Niranjans wife.Santosh Patel, a potato trader at Chandpur Matiyari village, dismisses Mr. Niranjan as a vote-katua. This is the age of 4G. People are aware and know where not to waste their vote, he said.Mr. Santosh is battling his own dilemmas. He is an ardent fan of SP president Akhilesh Yadav but prefers Modi as PM. That fact that the SP replaced its Kurmi MP cemented his choice. They didnt let him enjoy the fruits for even a year, he says.Many Kurmis say they would have gone with the SP had it fielded former SP MP Dhramraj Patel, who stood second in 2014. In 2018, rebel SP candidate Atiq Ahmed, who contested as an Independent, failed to make a difference but got over 48,000 votes. His absence has consolidated the Muslim voters behind the alliance, which is relying on its core Muslim-Yadav formula, apart from the Jatavs of the BSP.Sanjeev Yadav, who runs a sweetmeat stall in the Trans-Ganga area of Prayagraj, accuses the BJP of casteism and says it creates rifts between the OBCs and Dalits.They say the Yadavs ate it all. But look at the open casteism in the Yogi Adityanath government. Only Thakurs, Lalas, Baniyas and Brahmins are being favoured. Show me one SC or OBC SHO (Station House Officer) today, Mr. Sanjeev says.There are many reasons why the SP fielded a Yadav instead of a Kurmi, sources say. The party believes Kurmis did not vote for it in expected numbers in 2018. Whatever votes it got were due to the candidates personal connect. Second, since Yadavs are also in big numbers here, they hope aggressive voting by the community will push its cause. Third, the alliance has not fielded Yadavs in Yadav-dominated seats like Ghazipur and Bhadohi and this will help balance the perception.SP Prayagraj president Krishna Murti Yadav says the party appeased the discontent among the Kurmis by fielding a Kurmi from adjoining Allahabad seat for the first time. For the first time since independence, Allahabad will get a Backward Class MP, said Krishna Murti.The BJP also faces anti-incumbency among a section of OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits.Heera Lal, a Pasi labourer, and Raj Bahadur, a Kurmi farmer, are critical of the regret voting it in 2014. The 15 lakh never came. All we heard was shamshaan ghat and kabristan. The BJP only wants to make communities fight, said Mr. Lal.A BSP voter in 2009, Mr. Lal is also backing the SP this time due to the influence of senior Pasi leader Inderjeet Saroj, who joined the SP and is contesting from the adjoining Kaushambi. Mr. Saroj is expected to get the alliance critical Pasi votes.Mr. Bahadurs disenchantment is loaded with a much larger issue that could hurt the BJP  stray cattle. Modi said farmers income will double. But now, we are having to fill the stomachs of stray bulls, he complained.The only time the BJP won here was in 2014. The party hopes that the other Backward Classes like the Bind, Nishad and Pal, apart from the upper castes, polarise in its favour.But the overall score depends on the voting percentage in the two urban segments  Allahabad North and Allahabad West  and the split in the Kurmi votes, says Heramb Chaturvedi, Professor in the Allahabad University.He believes that unless the BJP increases its voter turnout here, it might not be able to match the alliance arithmetic, powered by rural votes. In the 2018 by-polls, Phulpur recorded a poor turnout of 37.39%, a drop of 12% from 2014. The average voting in the two urban segments was even worse, at 26%. Given the heat wave, the urban voter is less motivated to return to the booth again in case of an Electronic Voter Machine (EVM) malfunction, said Mr. Chaturvedi."

From the Good Samaritans who have been chipping in with relief for those affected by cyclone Fani to common people who have been supporting the aid workers such as those restoring power supply to police personnel going beyond their traditional framework of duty.In Gajapati district, which had faced cyclones in the past and bore the brunt of Titli last year, saw its young Superintendent of Police Sarah Sharma going to people to raise contribution for the Fani-hit.The 2010-batch IPS officer was seen in a new avatar when she went to the public in Parlakhemundi with her staff holding thalis in hand seeking contribution from locals, households and shopping establishments. It was a unique move and people were seen spontaneously supporting the police officer and her team as they went round the district headquarters town.Starting May 8, the campaign concluded on Friday by which time the District Police collected `13.58 lakh from public, police personnel, vigilance and 3rd SS Battalion. Thats not all, her efforts also generated at least 86 quintal rice, 21 quintal chuda besides jaggery, clothes, biscuits, potato, candle, milk powder and a host of food items for the calamity-hit.While the 36-year-old Sharmas initiative has been greatly lauded, she says the real appreciation was the spontaneous manner in which people offered support. Many people complained to us that we could not reach them, she told this paper.In fact, she felt that people were generous in their contribution because they understood the pain of being hit by natural calamities and the memory of Titli was still fresh in mind. That was why they contributed to us as well as to Revenue Department so openly, she said.Her objective was also to show that police force is so much a part of the public and she was proven right. The use of thali was also to invoke the sense of tradition among the people which clicked as people related to the approach instantly."

ITC also diversified at a fast pace into a true-blue consumer goods company making products ranging from Yippee noodles to Fiama soaps to Wills apparel, instead of just being a tobacco company that it had been for most of its lifetime.ITCs revenue shares from its tobacco business under his stewardship declined to 41 per cent from nearly three quarters about 16 years back as part of a conscious decision to grow out of the tobacco business. Today the percentage of employees ITC has in its non-cigarette businesses account for 88 per cent and the percentage of investments in non-cigarette brands accounts for 90 per cent of ITCs total investments.The move away from smoke sticks had started in AN Haksars tenure as ITC Chairman from 1969 to 1983 when Virginia House made tentative forays into hotels and paperboards. KL Chugh, Deveshwars predecessor, had dreams of diversifying further and even launching a charter airline, but spent much of his time fighting state taxation policies against cigarettes.It was left to Deveshwar to vigorously pursue the agenda after selling off ITCs financial arm and edible oils businesses early in his term as CEO. The sales of these two arms came after a vexed initial two years when he had to fight off accusations against ITC of foreign exchange violations and excise tax underpayments from his predecessors time.However, in the first two years of this century, he also launched a successful stationary products range, the Wills Lifestyle Retail chain, set up ITC Infotech, and forayed into the packaged food business under the Aashirvad brand. Over the years he kept adding to that range  Sunfeast biscuits, Bingo potato chips, Fiama soaps and Yippee noodles, not to mention a popular incense brand.At the same time, ITC Hotels kept expanding, taking over existing hotels and palaces and building new properties to turn a 3-hotel brand into a 100-hotel chain. By 2011, 'Yogi' had grown into a brand of his own and the government recognized him with a Padma Bhushan. But for the corporate world, his real epaulette came in 2016, when he catapulted ITCs revenues to cross the Rs 50,000 crore-a-year mark.Cancer struck soon after and Deveshwar named his hand-picked successor Sanjiv Puri as CEO and went on to become a non-executive Chairman. As one of his serving Vice Presidents said, He was a good human being, a tough taskmaster and someone whose thoughts centred only around ITC all his life."

Prices of tomatoes, carrots, beans, avarakkai, chowchow, coriander and pudhina have all gone up since last week.Kilpauk resident S. Sharmila said tomatoes, pudhina and coriander were absolutely necessary for daily cooking and she had noted that the prices of these had gone up. In a non-vegetarian item, there is no replacement for tomatoes like how you can use tamarind in a rasam. When you spend so much on the meat, the other ingredients meant for the masala too need to be just right, she said, adding that for those who cannot afford, such rates would be an issue.R. Ganesan of Sri Ganesh Vegetable store said first-quality beans at his store were priced at 90. I do both wholesale and retail. With the increase in prices, I have not been able to supply to companies at the old rates. I am just about managing now. Hopefully, the supplies will get regularised soon, bringing the demand and prices down, he said.Low yieldKoyambedus Periyar Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association president S. Chandran said every year during summer, with low water availability, the yield automatically came down. Wholesale prices of certain vegetables have gone up by 5-10 a kilo. For instance, take the case of shallots (sambar vengayam). We are not getting supplies from Cuddapah and Kurnool, but from Erode, Salem and Oddanchatram, and the quantity is only 20 tonnes a day, in place of the usual 50-60 tonnes, he said.However, prices of all vegetables have not gone up. Prices of onions and potatoes remain the same. In fact, due to increase in the availability of onions and yam (chenaikizhangu), they are being sold at very low prices. Yam from Andhra Pradesh sells at 15 a kilo and that from Tamil Nadu at 10-12 a kilo."

The activities preparing for bountiful monsoon ahead commences in summer, especially in April and May.Its a common sight in remote villages where men are busy collecting firewood and leaves, while women and children are seen preparing pickles, papad and other eatables for the onslaught of monsoon, which may arrive at any time.Praveenraj from Koila said storing wood and food is mandatory for monsoon season. Food includes rice, papad, varieties of pickle, jackfruit seeds, salted jackfruit or other vegetables and delicacy made from sweet potato. Among the vegetables, selected pumpkins, local cucumber or Mangaluru cucumbers are tied carefully with a rope to ceiling and preserved until rainy season ends. Some also store dry fish, since fresh sea fish is a rarity during the season. Out of these stored items, varieties of delicacies are prepared; some of them are unique to monsoon, he explained, adding that the items are stored as people find it difficult to venture out on rainy days.Apart from food items, villagers who have livestock store dry grass or paddy. Dry leaves are used to keep livestock warm in cowsheds, later converted into organic manure. Despite shortage of labour, collecting and storing firewood and leaves is prevalent in these villages, Praveenraj said.Dayanand Poojary, a resident of Karkala, says as modernisation crept in and many things improved, such scenario of villages preparing for monsoon is a rare sight.A few years ago, when there were not many facilities, villagers irrespective of their social status stocked food items for monsoon. Currently, markets make all food products and grains available at all times of the year, so fewer people stock up on these things, Dayanand added."

Over the next 10 minutes a huge crowd makes a beeline for the tiffin room, waiting for the doors to open.Landmark sweets Chandrahaara: Want to know how the famous MTR sweet Chandrahaara got its name? As a tribute to 1948's Kannada blockbuster Chandrahara, the Maiya family created this sweet, a blend of flour, sugar and thickened milk, spiced with ghee and cloves.Spoilt for choice: Ghee Masala dose with Aalu Palya; Rice Idli with chutney and Rava Idli with Aalu Saagu; Kharabaath; Bisibelebath; Chandrahaara; Mysore pak, Dumroot halwa, Payasa; badami haalu; grape juice.Survival challenge: During the Emergency when the restaurant had closed down, MTR created instant food mixes and had their workers busy. The timing was perfect as ready-to-eat sector, with sambar, rasam, and chutney powders, instant idli, dosa, and other mixes took off.In the limelight: Amongst the thousands of bureaucrats, businessmen, politicians, actors and directors Raj Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Rajkumar, politicians Farooq and Sheikh Abdullah, industrialist Narayana Murthy and his wife, writer Sudha Murthy, poet DV Gundappa, and painter MF Hussain have enjoyed MTR food.For a group of villagers from Tumkur, 40 kilometres away, it is a day to relax after their vegetables have been dropped off at the nearby City Market much before dawn. It has been three years now since I visited MTR , and we cant wait to enjoy a hot MTR Rava Idli with alugadde (potato), and pack some for home too, says an excited Siddappa, a tomato grower from Gowripura. At 6.20 am, vendors selling jasmine and golden champak gather outside the restaurant. People buy flowers only after they are done with breakfast and coffee, they say.From 3 am onwards, the kitchen at MTR bustles with a dozen people. They are getting the mornings dishes ready. Idli and dosa batter is prepared a day before to ferment it. Vegetables are cut in the morning and noon, milk is boiled three times a day, only the vada batter is prepared fresh as that way the crispies emerge golden brown from the oil, says Hemamalini Maiya, daughter of Harishchandra Maiya, who took over from his uncle, Yagnarayana, who was one of the founders of MTR in 1924.Proficient cooks and brothers, Parameshwara Maiya with Ganappayya and Yagnanarayana had left Kota, a hamlet near Udupi to reach Bengaluru where one of their employers had encouraged Parameshwara to start a small hotel in 1924 to serve coffee and idli. That was the beginning of Brahmin Coffee Club. Later Yagnanarayana thought the word club sounded elitist, so changed the name to Mavalli Tiffin Room, named after the locality where it is situated.MTR has a couple of head cooks with nearly two dozen assistants, and a dozen more helpers. Each one has a specific role with their tasks cut out. It is like an assembly line, says Hemamalini, walking through an aisle where almonds are being crushed in a mixer for badam milk; coconut, chilli and coriander are in the blender for the famous MTR chutney, potatoes are being boiled in their skin for the saagu for poori and masala for dosa, fruits are being cut for fruit salad, and grapes are boiled and filtered for juice.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARThe din of plates and spoons are heard even as a mound of diced onions keeps growing. It may seem robotic, but this routine has been followed for decades, says Hemamalini, one of the siblings who with Vikram and Arvind took over the mantle of running this popular place after the death of Harishchandra Maiya in 1999.MTR thrives on loyal customers who have been dining here for generations. The weekends overflow with people. It is humbling to see serpentine queues with poets, actors and businessmen, she says. There are nearly 2,500 walk-ins each day during the weekends, apart from around 1,500 others who drop by just for coffee. Public holidays and Sundays see MTR serving nearly 1,000 masala dosas, 800 plates of rava idli, 800 plates of poori, with about 300 litres of milk used. Nearly 200 litres of onion sambar, and vegetable sambar are prepared each weekend.We get nearly 400 kilograms of vegetables and fruits. Provisions are sourced from long-established vendors who have been supplying us since our grandfathers time, says Hemamalini adding, Nothing much has changed.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARIn 1997, Harishchandra Maiya introduced thali meals as he felt, Dishes savoured at special party hall lunches at MTR should reach every customer. He introduced a huge platter with nearly 30 items for  50 and saw nearly 1,000 thalis sell out between 12.30 pm and 5 pm! We have now brought it down to two dozen items as we notice that people dont prefer some of the sweets and side dishes. After 22 years it now costs 270, says Hemamalini.So, what is their secret? It lies in the preparation that results in dosas that are soft and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside, says Hemamalini, adding that red rice and dollops of ghee lends to their signature taste. Rava idli, she says, is yet another signature dish from MTR. In South Canara, where the family hails from, there was a similar variant generations ago. During World War II, when rice was in short supply, my grandfather, Yagnanarayana , introduced rava idli mixed with curd and a seasoning of dal, cashew and curry leaves. This was paired with alugadde saagu and coriander chutney. The speciality is the rava is sauted to perfection. We train our cooks from scratch, none of them are well known before they join us, she says.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARDespite the no-frills dcor or conspicuously missing menu card, MTR retains its cultural stature, and is under the heritage list of INTACH. The food is wholesome with an abundance of ghee. Perhaps Keto dieters will subscribe to it! adds Hemamalini, and this is what her father wanted to maintain, and not bother with expansion plans. He always wanted peoples choice to decide the course of MTR! she says as we check out the 6,000 square feet of space with 14 rooms. We have basic tables and plastic chairs, and we still have the silver tumblers my grandfather introduced 75 years ago. He was captivated by them during his trip to England. Right now we have only about 100 sets left that we serve only during special meals!Apart from Lalbagh Road, MTR has branches at Indiranagar, Malleswaram, Gandhinagar, Whitefield, St. Marks Road, JP Nagar, Kammanahalli and Kanakapura Main Road; and in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai.A column where we experience the lives of people and places in the city"

Sundari* is busy setting up her juice stall on Marina beach. A few metres away, Manohar is cleaning the plastic rifles and blowing balloons. When it is summer vacation for the kids, it is peak business for us. We cannot afford to lose customers just because the stall is not ready. So, I never use heat as an excuse to start my job late, says Sundari, asking us to sip on something cool and colourful from her shop, as we wipe the sweat from our brows.Thats all the time Sundari has to chat with us because she has to attend to a group of young children and two women who are waiting for sarbat. Summer spells beach time for families. Makeshift shops and pushcarts open early in the day to keep the cash registers ringing.Best time for businessIt is undoubtedly the best time of the year for me. I travel every year from Jharkhand to sell kulfis for six months. I arrive in March and leave towards the end of September when the rains begin to set in. Chennai is a great place to sell kulfis because it is always so hot and humid, says Suresh Kumar, who sells kulfis on a pushcart.The daily earnings help him get past each day of sweat and toil. There are many times when I am going from place to place with my pushcart in the heat and I feel like eating a kulfi myself. Then I remember that it would mean one less kulfi to sell and I cant afford that, he shares, adding that most customers come looking for something to cool their parched throats.For lovers of sun and sand, these ubiquitous sellers are children of the beach. I look forward to summers because it is always good business for me, says K Aishvarya, who runs a beverage stall on Marina beach with her husband. Cold water and lime juice sell like hot-cakes at her stall. Anything cold works. So, every morning, I get a lot of dry ice so that it will last till the end of the day, she shares.A Karunakaran from Nochikuppam, who sells corn on the cob at Marina beach, has breathed the saline air for a few decades. He gets to the beach late in the afternoon because thats when his loyal customers start lining up. By the time it is 4 pm, the beach starts teeming beach buffs, who like to spend a laidback evening between the salty sea breeze and gushing waves.Later in the dayFor Aditya Manivannan, summer is an opportunity to spend quality time with his two young girls. Since he does not get much time off from work, the beach is a great place for the dad-daughter trio to just hang out. I visit Besant Nagar beach with them every weekend and sometimes even during the week because we stay close by. This holiday season we have gotten into the habit of eating this potato crisps stick that is available on the beach. I gave in the first time because it was right after their exams, but now it has become a habit, he says.Kids make the rulesEven for toy sellers and those selling beaded jewellery on the beach, the footfall during summer is reassuring. Where we would have two in ten people looking at our products during other times, during the holiday season, we get at least six or seven people to take a look at what we are selling, says T Jayakumar, who sells toys near Besant Nagar beach.The 45-year-old who has been selling toys for over 10 years knows how to capture the imagination of his target audience. In a short span of time, he convinces them of how much fun they will have if they bought the toy. I rely heavily on children to convince their parents to buy the toys. I have noticed that during the holidays, parents are more relaxed and willing to give in to their childs wishes, either because it is too hot to argue or because they genuinely want to give in. Whatever it is, it is good for business, he says.Another favourite when it comes to beaches are the games that one can play. Be it shooting balloons, the hoop throwing game or even a ride on the carousel, children lay down the terms during the summer holidays. I love the shooting game, says N Shrimati, a student of class 6 who is happy to defeat her father at the game. He has to buy me a chocolate ice-cream now. Playing games on the beach is so much fun. Since we stay in Perambur, coming to Marina beach takes a while but it is worth it. We are coming back next week with my paati so she can also play some games.*Name changed"

Potatoes and tomatoes are selling at Rs 30 and Rs 40 per kg, respectively, at a rate Rs 10 higher than before. The sharp increase has led to a decrease in sales for vendors.We have been selling tomatoes and potatoes at reasonable rates , but we cannot help but increase the prices to keep with the trend. The demand for vegetables has therefore gone down and customers have not been enthusiastic about their purchase, one vendor Salman Kudus said.Our sales have definitely decreased as a result and we do not see as many customers as we earlier did, another vendor K F Naik said.They said that the dayto-day supply of vegetables from neighbouring states has not drastically altered, but the demand certainly has, which means the perishable items remain on their shelves.Despite their desire to make a bountiful purchase, the fluctuating prices have taken a toll on the pockets of consumers, with the lower and middle-class consumers being the most affected.Even though the increasing prices do not affect our ability to buy the vegetables, but our monthly expenditure does increase, and we end up buying smaller quantities of vegetables, consumer Sarla Katariya said.Basic kitchen ingredients like chillies are being sold at Rs 60 per kg against Rs 40 a few weeks ago, while onions are being sold at Rs 20 per kg as opposed to Rs 16 earlier.There is nothing we can do besides cutting out on the costlier vegetables. The government should do something to standardise rates so that people can afford nutritious vegetables, another consumer said."

Among the top orders for munching while watching cricket were chicken biryani, pizza, chicken wings and samosas.Indians also consumed different food from the beginning to the end of the match. While starting orders could be something heavy like biryani, people preferred to end the match with snacks like potato pops or chicken wings with soft drinks. Here's a look."

2019-05-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2019/may/18/farm-distress-among-major-challenges-for-new-government-1978619.html,Farm distress among major challenges for new government,"By IANSNEW DELHI: Once the high-voltage Lok Sabha polls come to an end, the new government will have a major challenge of getting rural economy back on the track, especially, in the wake of forecast of delayed, below normal monsoon this year with chances of drought parts of the country.Despite higher farm output in the country in the previous years, the remuneration to farmers has lowered due to the widening gap between demand and supply ratio.Poor procurement of commodities owing to inadequate number and delay in the opening of purchasing centres by the government agencies forced the farmers to make distressed sale in past few years.In case of vegetables, while the retail prices hovered between Rs 20-30 in major cities, the prices received by farmers for semi-perishable commodities such as potato and onion were found to have slumped to Rs 1 per kg.The fall in crop prices led the agitated farmers across the farmers to vent their anger on streets, and five mega rallies by them were held in the national capital alone in 2018.It had provided the opposition parties of different hues a common ground to rally against the BJP-led government ahead of the ongoing general elections.Farm analyst Devinder Sharma said the farm sector has been in ""terrible distress"" for the past few years and immediate steps were needed to arrest the situation from deteriorating further.""First, Farm Commission should be formed by subsuming Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) to ensure remunerative prices to farmers. In addition, direct income support to farmers should be increased from current Rs 6,000 per year to at least Rs 18,000 per month in order to bring them out of the vicious cycle of indebtedness,"" he said.Sharma also said the government should allow public investment in the farm sector and come up with 'ease of doing farming' on lines of ease of doing business.""Over 50 per cent of the population in the county is dependent on agriculture while what we spent on it is just 2-3 per cent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Setting up the ease of doing farming would help clear bottlenecks and hurdles in the sector, thus addressing about 80 per cent of the farm distress,"" he said.Experts and analysts had last year said that the BJP, which came to power at Centre in 2014 mainly on the poll plank of doubling farm income, would see farm distress haunting them in the 2019 elections.However, the Balakot airstrike changed the narrative.""There were two major issues-- unemployment and farm distress. However, they were successfully ambushed after the Balakot episode,"" said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who is credited for bringing over 200 farm outfits under one banner-- All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).""These issues were definitely sidelined and did not become as important as people thought.""One-third of the country witnessed drought-like situation last year and not-so-good prediction of monsoon this year means farm distress could aggravate, Yadav said.""The new government will have to take immediate measures to tackle drought if monsoon turns out to be below average,"" he said.He also sought the new dispensation to refrain from efforts keep crop prices low so as to control food prices in urban areas under control.""Farmers should not be punished for it,"" he said.Economists need to change their outlook as higher production does not mean higher income, Sharma said.""Economists cannot see beyond what is prescribed in the textbook. Punjab has the highest productivity ratio in the world. However, it has become a hotbed of farm suicides,"" he said.He said growth in real farm income from 2011-2016 was below 0.5 per cent and it was at stagnant for the past two years.It also implies the government's ambitious scheme of doubling farmers' income by 2022 cannot be achieved merely through boosting production.Making credit available to farmers besides expanding agriculture market network and building logistics and transport linkages could be some of the short-term and long-term solution to improve the farm sector, the experts said."
2019-05-18,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/levantine-delights-in-bandra/article27168966.ece,Levantine delights in Bandra,"Dressed in a spiffy jacket, owner Atiq Kapadia is leading multiple conversations on different tables when we visit his new restaurant in Bandra, Arbab. Muffled music streams into the open restaurant from their indoor kitchen, as does a whiff of juicy grilled meat. All the tables are packed, one corner is by occupied Kapadias guests, dressed in beautiful Pakistani suits, who are in for a wholesome dinner of mezze platters, grills, shawarmas and hummus, over a game of housie. If you exclude a cricket match screening, Arbab can pass off as a cool street side caf in Beirut.Food bossWhat does Arbab mean, we ask Kapadia, Its a way of showing respect to a senior person, be it your boss, a good businessman or someone older too, kind of like how Mumbai uses the word boss, he explains. Having worked in Dubai all his life, Kapadia (who has interests in shipping, logistics and real estate amongst other businesses) loved the Levantine offerings the city had to offer, especially Lebanese food, and he wanted to bring the flavours of the country to Mumbai. Aware of the bureaucracy and paperwork, Kapadia knew the city was no place for a newbie to handle alone. So he joined hands with his cousins Fahad and Faiz Kadawalla, who run the old-time Bandra restaurant Tavaa.But Kapadia was firm on one thing, he wouldnt localise the cuisine or use substitute ingredients. There are already many Lebanese and Arabic restaurants in the city. But we wanted to offer authentic flavours, which is why we import our ingredients from different regions, be it baharat [a common seven-spice mix] or zaatar. I wanted the food to taste exactly like it would in Dubai or Beirut, he tells us. This is also why he got chef Raed Askar, who has worked at restaurants in Dubai and Lebanon, to design the menu, and Lebanese chef Shadi Shami as the executive head chef to keep the kitchen running smoothly.Starters and moreThe menu is impressive, with options for all kinds of palates. If its just a quick meeting with your friends, call for Selection of Hummus (Rs. 325) which includes four different flavours of hummus  pesto, avocado, chilli, and Beiruty (which has a smooth, tart flavour thanks to pickles which are blended in). Scoop it up with their beautiful light, fluffy breads, something we keep going back to throughout our meal.Also on the menu are soups, and salads such as Fattouch (Rs. 275), which includes fresh veggies mixed together with lemon juice, olive oil and crisps; Tabouleh (Rs. 250); or Shamandar Chef Signature (Rs. 310), made with beetroot, walnuts, coriander and lemon juice. Other cold mezze options include Moutabbal (Rs. 250) and Baba Ganouj (Rs. 230). Potato lovers get hand-cut fries (Rs. 115), Batat Helweh (Rs. 140, sweet potato fries) or Arbab Special Batata Harra (Rs. 250), a spicy potato cube appetiser, with a strong hint of lemon.For a fuller appetiser, try their Falafel platter (Rs. 320), Chicken Wings (Rs. 340), or Robian (Rs. 690, crispy-fried shrimp). Kapadia insists that we try their Mutton Shawarma Platter (Rs. 310, they also have chicken), which bowls us over. What makes the dish a winner, is thin, grilled pita that the mutton is wrapped in has no sauces, and that the meat is the star of the dish, with no overpowering flavours. Each cut of meat is carefully selected, Kapadia tells us. We recommend that you try this with Arbabs toum, a garlic sauce that is hard to come by in this city, at least an authentic one.The grilled section is another highlight on the menu. If you enjoy sharing your meal over interesting conversations, order Mashawi Mushakkal (Rs. 850) where lamb kebabs, shish tawouk, lamb tikka and lamb chops are served with grilled vegetables. Or for something lighter, we recommend Toshka (Rs. 415), flatbread stuffed with tender kebab meat and cheese. Wash it all down with a mint lemonade (Rs. 190) which is perfect for Mumbais summers, or save room for dessert  which is a delicate baklava or the Umm Ali, an Egyptian bread pudding.Arbab, 149, 28th Road, Bandra, from 6.30 p.m. to 12.30 a.m; 26410000"
2019-05-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/time-to-start-winning-at-the-top-saurav-ghosal/story-wfmjMa6dBTVveMdvITJ2UJ.html,Time to start winning at the top: Saurav Ghosal,"If Saurav Ghosal could choose his last supper, it would be mutton biryani, Kolkata style. The potato is optional but not the boiled egg, he says, breaking with the established norm.Being a foodie with a sweet toothI get that from my mom, he saysdoesnt make it easy for the world No. 10, but when you are aspiring to be in the top five, win a massive, massive event, and leave a legacy, you learn to avoid temptations. Especially because at 32 you have a certain amount of time left in the game. Ideally, till the next Commonwealth Games and Asian Games (both in 2022).Being a professional squash player and doing well is not just about how good a player you are, Ghosal says. Its about everything that comes with it: how you are training, how you get out of bed when you dont want to, how you take care of yourself, your ability to mentally stay there when things arent going brilliantly. You call yourself a professional athlete for a reason, otherwise you are just an athlete.To elucidate his point, Ghosal talks about his third-round exit at El Gouna International Open (Egypt) in April, which followed a quarter-final loss at Macau Open the same month.It had been a long season and I was probably a bit jaded mentally. Soon after came the Asian Individual Squash Championship in Kuala Lumpur.Somehow I turned it around and my mental space was a lot better in the Asian championships and that is why the level of squash I produced was better, Ghosal says. So, the moral of the story is to persevere because if you are true to what you are doing, at some point it is going to turn around. You also have to be smart about it, like reining yourself in just a little bit at training so that you can release when you really need to.We are inside the 225-year-old Calcutta Racket Club, a two-storey bungalow tucked between a cathedral and a planetarium, where Ghosal learnt the ropes. The squish of shoes on courts and the whiplash of a racket making the soft, dark ball crash into the wall with a dull thud provide the setting for the conversation with the newly-minted Asia champion on a brief stopover at home before the blue riband British Open, where he starts against world No. 4 Karim Gawad of Egypt on Tuesday.The big jumpGhosal, who turned pro in 2003, had been on the fringes of the big-time for a few years. Five Mays ago, he was world No. 15.There is a big jump to be made, squash-wise, mentality-wise and obviously the ability to do it week in and week out. Those three things took me that much time, he says. Since September last year it has been something I have been sort of building towards, something that happily happened for me on April 1 when I made the top 10.Crucial to the jump was signing up with Australian David Palmer, a former world No. 1 who lives in Ithaca, New York, and also trains world No. 2 Mohamed Elshorbagy of Egypt.I have the basic stuff, the foundation in place. How we can make that more lethal? How can we manage to do that at a higher intensity and more consistently against people who are my level and just below and also to be able to do that against players who are higher than I am? Those were the key points we discussed. There were tactical and technical adjustments too but those are very small. Also, there is greater focus on gameplans being individualised. So I think the level of detail is more than what it was two or five years back, he says.Ghosal is the second oldest in the top-10 though there are a few bunched in their 30s.Different people have different trajectories. Tarek Momen, for example, is world No. 3 and he is 31 and he has matured really well over the last one-and-a-half, two years. At nearly 37, Greg (former world No. 1 Gregory Gaultier) would have been in the top 10 but is injured. If I didnt think I had an equal shout of making top 5 as Diego Elias (who is 22 and world No. 8), I wouldnt be playing today.Watching art happenIt was when he became the junior world No. 1 that Ghosal thought he would make squash his calling. It would mean travelling to Leeds to train with Malcolm Willstrop because Ghosal liked the way Malcoms son James (a former world No. 1) played.You have the idea of a conservative English player who is effective but not flamboyant. James was anything but. When I first saw him in the world juniors in Chennai in 2002, it was like watching art happen. Of course, the accuracy of James, no one probably in the history of the game has it but I would like to think I am close. That made me say I want to go and train with Malcolm, he says.He landed in Leeds in September when it was cold and he was miserable. For someone whose only visit to the kitchen prior to that was to put bread in a toaster, life was hard.But going to Malcolm, going to the Pontefract Squash and Leisure Club where I train, I have made friends for life. The relationship I have with Malcolm is beyond words, he says. Ghosal had looked at three years when he first went to Leeds. He ended up staying for eight.In 2013 Leeds was swapped for Kolkata and Chennai as bases.I want to live in India, always did. I want to do things in India. I could do stuff in Europe and USA but that doesnt really interest me. So since I was going to be happier when I am here, I took on the travel bit.Bit? He goes to Leeds for training, to Ithaca for more training, and is often on the road alone for weeks.Ghosals wife Diya, a graphic designer, is squash ace Dipika Pallikal Karthiks sister, but she isnt very interested in the sport.We have other things to talk about. We are interested in art, we are foodies and love travelling.Diya has been to only one tournament where he played, in Switzerland last March. She didnt come to the games because she was too stressed. Ghosal lost in the quarter-final.Art is important for the multiple Asian Games medallist.I want to win in a way that people enjoy watching me do it. That adds to your legacy. Yes the legacy is there in terms of me being an Indian player but what can I do to make that legacy on the world stage? That is what keeps me going.Tradition missedGhosal said while the scene has improved in Indiathere are about 800 playing the junior national championships, up from 300 in his time, but Egypt, which has five players in the top 10, would have that many in a local tournament. And when you train with world champions daily, it is an experience that no amount of coaching or watching videos can substitute, he says.He missed that. If I had a richer tradition in India to look up to, maybe then the expectations would have been higher and maybe that would have pushed me more. But I am a better player and person today because of what I have learnt over all those years.When he started, Ghosal said he was asked to aim for the top 30 because Ritwik Bhattacharya had got to a high of world No. 38. When I passed him (in January 2009), I told myself that I would take it any day that I was five in the world and he was three in the world.Ghosal said his first thought on winning the British Open juniors (2004) was that now an Indian will know it can be done.Whats changed from then is that boys now know what it takes to be in the top 10. Now we are competing at the top end. The next step will be to start winning at the top end.First Published: May 19, 2019 08:33 IST"
2019-05-19,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/rice-on-the-water-anyone/cid/1690773,"Rice On the Water, Anyone?","Today, of course, panta bhaat has made its way to posh restaurant menus, especially during Bengali New Year Source: WikipediaIf you ask people what is the best way to combat the scorching summer  in terms of the food they eat  the answers you get will leave you with almost no surprise.Thats because few are initiated into the simple charms of panta bhaat. But let me rewrite that sentence  few among those reading this would know of panta bhaat, or how it does a cool job of washing away the angst that comes from bearing tonnes of heat and humidity, on your mind as well as your body.Just imagine, yaar Das Auntie gave me some watery rice and alu bhaji to eat, a friend had complained. The anecdote from 20 years ago floats into my platter every time I sit with panta bhaat and begin to enjoy a certain oneness with it. Rana hailed from Uttar Pradesh; he was an urban educated aspiring engineer.Summoned to Bhubaneswar to write an exam, he had to stay the night at a friends place. That friends mother lovingly served him panta  Bhubaneswar was simmering at that time and Rana was like her son, who was working far away from home.One doesnt quite know what transpired at the table that day, but Rana returned to teach us an important lesson in hospitality  to serve watery rice to the uninitiated eater isnt the right thing to do; it is downright insulting.For long years I believed panta was an Odiya thing. Pokhal or pakhala was a staple in many of the Odiya households I was familiar with during my growing-up years. Much later I learnt that Odisha has even set aside a Pokhal Bhaat Day in honour of this fare. Somewhere along the line I came to know that it was a favourite of the Assamese people too. Poita bhaat, they call it. Homecoming for little Pokhi  I saw in an Assamese film by the same name  meant a bowl of cold poita with crispy fried fish caught from the waters of the Brahmaputra.For the Maithils of north Bihar, it comes christened as geel-bhaat. For Tamils, its pazhaya saadham; Telugus call it chaddannam. Theres a saying somewhere in the Northeast that eating panta bhaat gives you the strength of a tiger. Theres one in Bengali that goes  Panta bhaat e noon jote na, begun pora-e ghee. Meaning Cant afford salt for panta, and you want ghee in your roasted brinjal?Truth to tell, panta bhaat is widely known as the poor mans food, an easy morning concoction from the previous nights leftover rice that you fill your stomach with before you head off to the fields or to work in other peoples homes.The fermentation, if you allow it to rest overnight, makes the nutrition quotient swell. Minerals and vitamins of the B group get hugely multiplied. Apparently it also helps keep fat at bay, is good for the bones and so on. Today, of course, panta bhaat has made its way to posh restaurant menus, especially during Bengali New Year. There are also celebrity chefs telling you how to prepare and serve panta bhaat in attractive pans and plates. Fancy food bloggers call it the Buddha Bowl.And why not? Such endeavours are enlightening. I learnt, for example, that panta can be eaten with kasundi, and bits of mango cooked in dal, so on and so forth. But panta is good even sans accompaniment, with just the basic green chilli, raw onion and lemon.A foodie friend tells me about at least 10 ways of preparing it, some of which include mixing it with curd or grated coconut or crushed gondhoraj leaves or pickle. A colleague had once said that as children, they would be given only panta bhaat to eat in times of intolerance, since it was the easiest to digest. There was no escaping it, or its charms, he spoke of it fondly.A few days ago, as I sat down to a dinner of panta with crisp daaler bora and spicy mashed potato, a question was served to me  Do you know theres a song about panta bhaat, asked my worldly-wise kind cook. Of course, I replied, and we regurgitated that Gulzar song from the film, Namkeen, in which Shabana Azmi and Sharmila Tagore sing Panta bhaat e tatka baigun pora... while they go about grinding grain and performing other housework.It was a strangely good film, centred around a family of four women  an ageing mother and her three marriageable daughters  set somewhere in a remote Himachal village. There was much in the 1988 film that lingers, but what comes to mind spontaneously is this quaint song.Ill never know what inspired Gulzar to write those lyrics, but make a guess I can."

Around 18 lakh birds had been killed in Phailin in 2013 and 20 lakh perished during super cyclone in 1999.Since 58,780 Primary and Upper Primary schools in Odisha serve rice with egg curry twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday, the State requires 90 lakh eggs every week for MDM scheme.The daily domestic production of eggs in the State before Fani was around 45 lakh per day against the requirement of 65 lakh. The rest of the eggs were procured from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Sources said the agencies involved in MDM will feel the pinch once the schools reopen on June 16.With prices of broiler chicken and eggs skyrocketing due to scarcity of birds, schools, Self Helps Groups (SHGs) and other private agencies managing the noon meals fear they will have to spend more to meet the requirement.While chicken is priced at `200 to `240 in the market, egg is being sold at `8 per piece. The daily ration cost per student is fixed at `4.58 in Primary Schools and `6.83 in Upper Primary Schools. Is it possible to buy an egg at `8 per piece and provide meals to students at `6.83 which includes the cost of potato, spices for the curry, fuel and rice? We are apprehensive whether the cost of eggs will remain same or escalate as production has come down post-Fani. If the cost increases further, we will have to provide eggs once a week to students, said Muralidhar Nayak, a teacher.MDM State nodal officer Gangadhar Sahoo admitted that the scarcity of eggs will have a bearing on the scheme but said it is up to the agencies to decide whether they will depend on the production in Odisha or procure it from other States to manage the crisis.According to the latest damage assessment reports, over 3,000 broiler poultry units, including around 2,000 small farms, were damaged in the cyclone with Puri and Khurda being the worst-hit districts.Secretary of Fisheries and Animal Resources Development department Vishal Gagan said as per preliminary estimate, the poultry industry has suffered a loss of more than `200 crore.Meanwhile, the State Government has announced to provide compensation of `5,000 to each poultry firm besides an assistance of 75 per cent subsidy, limited to `one lakh per unit of 500 birds, for revival of 2,000 broiler units. It has also decided to extend livelihood support to 30,000 farmers, mostly Women SHGs through backyard poultry in the affected areas."

2019-05-23,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/may/23/the-keeper-of-traditional-recipes-1980693.html,The keeper of traditional recipes,"Deepthi Parthasarathy ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The sweet, fragrant and warm smell of spices, ghee and jaggery fill 43-year-old Chella Rojas kitchen. She meticulously whisks the batter, turns the stove on and stirs the mix to prepare Kavuni arisi halwa, one of her signature dishes. The cooking enthusiast-cum-foodie loves experimenting with traditional rice varieties and herbs, to give healthy dishes a modern twist.After garnishing the halwa with fried cashews and grated coconut, she says, Honestly, I started cooking because it was a need, rather than genuine interest. Twenty-two years ago, after marriage, I learnt the art from scratch. My grandmothers knowledge and my mothers tips and tricks on basic cooking helped me. But after a year, I was bored with regular food and started experimenting from cookbooks and cookery shows.Cut to present, Roja tries out a new dish every week and shares her recipes with friends and family on WhatsApp. Her focus is always about making any dish healthy using alternative ingredients without compromising on quality and taste. This homemaker and a mother of two believes that healthy eating is the key to a healthy life. I can cook cuisines from Kerala, Andhra, Karnataka, Thailand and Italy. For example, pizza is not a junk food by itself. It is the ingredients we use that make it unhealthy. I have tried making pizzas using millet flour to make it healthier. After two to three times of trying, it came out well, she shares.The herbs that one can find in Rojas kitchen are used to make more than just kashayams. She uses tulsi (Holy Basil) in juices and soups; karpooravalli (Indian Borage) in bajji and rasam, vetrilai (Betel leaf) to make rice, aavarampoo (Tanners Cassia) in dosai and curries, flaxseed chutney and idli podi, vallarai (Centella Asiatica) in dosai and pakoda, and sembaruthi in milkshakes and tea.She lists down the alternatives that can be used  honey, brown sugar, jaggery and karupatti, in place of white sugar; vaazhakkai, sakkaravallikizhangu instead of potato; millet flour, ragi, kambu and cholam instead of wheat flour.She also gives details on different rice varieties which can be substituted in place of white rice. For instance, kavuni arisi (black rice) which is rich with antioxidants, B-vitamins and Anthocyanin helps prevent cancer; kattu yanam helps control diabetes; poongar arisi increases the haemoglobin content and restores hormone imbalances; red rice has B-vitamins and helps prevent cancer; maappillai samba rice improves stamina and moongil arisi (Bamboo rice) increases bone strength.I dont use white rice in my house. I use kavuni arisi and make biryani, dosai and halwa which my kids love. I get the satisfaction of serving them food that is both, healthy and enjoyable. I switch between different varieties of rice each month, says Roja.Roja was part of two reality cooking shows, recently. My idea was to spread awareness about traditional rice varieties to people. After it was telecast on TV, many asked me about the availability of these varieties and the recipes, beams Roja.There is a notion that these varieties have been newly introduced in organic stores. But the rice varieties have been around for a very long time. The high price of the unpolished rice is due to the lack of demand and harvest by the farmers. Once people start buying these from stores, the demand will increase and the prices will eventually reduce. This can change the face of the thriving white rice economy, she says.Rojas mantra to healthy eating is a balanced diet. She believes that it is the cooks responsibility to ensure that the right proportion of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and fibre are included in the diet.Earlier, the joint family system meant that there were more people to cook dishes. But now, there is not much time. The key is to incorporate various ingredients into one dish. Five different vegetables can be used in sambar. I use at least ten vegetables in kootu. The nutrient content can easily be identified with the colour of the vegetables, says Roja.Before she heads back into the kitchen, she reiterates an old Tamil saying, marundena vendam yakkaikku, atradhu arindhu potrumin which translates into, man doesnt need to have medicines if he is aware of the nutritious food which he can have in place of medication."

2019-05-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/agrarian-crisis-farmer-suicide-marathwada-drought-modi-5751338/,Farm opening,"Agrarian distress wasnt seemingly a factor in determining the outcome of the recent Lok Sabha polls. Despite sugarcane payment dues to farmers by mills in Uttar Pradesh crossing Rs 11,000 crore, the BJP won 17 out of the states 23 key ganna-growing constituencies. It also practically swept the entire middle and upper Doab aloo belt from Mathura to Kanpur, notwithstanding three consecutive years of low potato prices. Farmers across UP complained about the crackdown on cattle slaughter causing a collapse of the livestock trade as well as their standing crop being devoured by stray bovines. Yet, they voted overwhelmingly for the party of the incumbent, Narendra Modi. The ruling alliance similarly made mincemeat of the Opposition in Maharashtras Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, synonymous with drought and farmer suicides. Farmer leader Raju Shetti losing from his own seat in Western Maharashtra is further proof of cane, milk, onion, grape, pomegranate and turmeric producers reposing faith in Modi than those offering no credible alternative.AdvertisingThere could be three explanations for the above results. The first is, of course, an inept Opposition  its inability to weave a coherent narrative around farmers problems and its focus on issues (Rafale and corruption) having little resonance with rural voters. Secondly, the Modi governments own schemes  the building of about 1.55 crore houses, 9.27 crore toilets and 2.18 lakh km of all-weather roads during the last five years in rural India, besides providing 11.21 crore active LPG connections (between June 2015 and April 2019) and reducing the number of un-electrified households from roughly 4 crore to a mere 18,735  may have considerably neutralised the impact of the crash in agri-commodity prices, especially post demonetisation. Third, low crop realisations would have hurt farmers  specifically those with surplus produce to sell  more than the landless rural poor, who are likely to have benefitted both from benign food inflation and the various Pradhan Mantri asset creation-cum-welfare schemes.It would be a mistake, however, for the Modi government, in its new innings, to brush aside the serious structural problems confronting Indian agriculture. The resounding political mandate it has got provides an opportunity for restructuring the existing farm subsidy regime  based on under-pricing of fertilisers, water, electricity and credit, along with physical grain procurement at market-distorting minimum support prices  in favour of direct benefit transfers. The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi should be extended to every farmer and all current input/output subsidies converted into a fixed per-acre money payment. This is also the time to dismantle all restrictions on farm produce, whether relating to sale, stocking, domestic movement or export. Finally, scrapping the Essential Commodities Act and state-level Agriculture Produce Market Committee laws will help revive price sentiment and attract investments in processing, warehousing, transport, finance, research and extension."

Hailstorms are very rare in the area, but farmers recall that whenever it hits, it leaves a trail of destruction.Though the damage the hailstorm of last two days has caused is yet to be estimated, preliminary reports say orchards and newly grown saplings that were being readied for the main vegetable season in September/October has been heavily affected.The vegetables in the budding stage are the most damaged, according to Sivalingam, a farmer.The fruits, including apple sabar jelly and passion fruit, were in the early stage of growth over hundreds of acres of land, according to the farmers. Passion fruit is a recent addition to the Kanthallur menu and it has proven to be a high-income generating fruit for the farmers.Govindaraj, a farmer, fears if the hailstorm or any such climate variance will affect the quality of fruits. He was particularly worried about apple and the plum trees that were now in the flowering stage.According to him, the days after the hailstorm ones were sunny. The affected vegetables showed symptoms of drying up. If the situation continues, all the vegetables including beans, and cabbage will get spoiled, he says. Vegetables like potato having tubers beneath the soil, though, may not be affected much.Plantain may also not meet the expected yield with the sudden hailstorm stunning its growth.Climate changesSuch climate changes are becoming a mainstay in Kanthallur, according to the farmers. The long spell of the drought season would otherwise have been a rare occurrence, says a farmer. Nowadays, the day temperature seems to have increased and there are visible changes in the atmosphere that otherwise remains foggy with mild rains during the southwest monsoon season. Farmers fear such changes will alter the uniqueness of Kanthallur that favours growth of almost all varieties of fruits.Preliminary reports say saplings that were being readied for the main vegetable season have been heavily affected."

The owner has shifted 50 animals (cows and buffaloes) to an unknown place. His figure of 80 deaths is not acceptable.According to a statement released by Guru Angad Dev Veterinary And Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), disease outbreak occured due to the animals being fed rotten vegetables/potatoes, rotis, bread along with paddy straw.

The glimpse into the familys regal tradition was shared by Yaduveer Wadiyar of the Wadiyar dynasty of Mysore at a panel discussion held on the significance of satvik food in the city on Sunday.The discussion was organised by B.E.S.T Innovation University, Andhra Pradesh, and Heritage at Taj West End as a part of the Ahara series, a workshop that focussed on the aesthetic angle of food and its benefits to the body by keeping Ayurveda, yoga and spiritualism in sync. Moderated by Rakesh Raghunathan, food writer and commentator on the tele-series, Dakshin Diaries, the scions of four erstwhile royal families of India spoke about the cuisine that thrived during their ancestors time and their childhood, and the way they have adapted to the modern trend of eating out at restaurants or ordering in.In Thanjavur, we have two books from the late 1700s - Sampradayika Pakashastra, which mainly deals with recipes and special ingredients to be used while cooking, and Sarpendra Bhojana Guduburam, which gives an in-depth description of nutritious quality and medicinal values of food items, revealed S Babaji Raja Bhonsle of the Thanjavur Maratha dynasty, adding that they had a vegetarian satvik kitchen and a non-vegetarian Maratha kitchen with a Continental butler in the house.Kumbakonam Kadappa, a dish which brings out the Thanjavur-Maratha history, is like potato kurma but it has moong dal, and it bears the seasonings of sambar but also contains poppy seeds, coconut and cashew. Raghunathans interest on how these cuisines have evolved and their ancestors influence in the South brought Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagar Tulava dynasty and his wife Rathna Krishnadevaraya to talk about the evolution that came about in his family.There was a particular cuisine that was prepared for the Vijayanagara kings, which was low on spices to soothe the digestive system. This gave enough strength to their body to fight battles. Back then, there was a time when the whole village was fed one meal of the royal cuisine. The utensil used to cook it is still with us. This is one interesting part of history that we preserve. The prasadam, Naivaidya, still continues to be distributed at Hampi Virupaksha temple. The rice is soaked and ground, and we use chana dal, cashews, raisins and ghee, she said, adding that the wild boar recipe was also an interesting part of the familys culinary history.Recently, the growth of restaurants has peaked. Chefs have the time and patronage to be really creative and take inspirations from ancient texts and revive the recipes of princely states, and add the current trends. We do use ancient recipes during poojas, so in a way, we are keeping the royalty alive. New recipes were always a craze and thats how Mysore Pak came into the scene. It was born out of the urge that one of my ancestors had to bring out a new sweet, said Wadiyar, adding that the legacy is something that makes our Indian heritage richer."

The government is aiming to double the area under horticulture by 2030 while increasing the production to thrice that of the current figure.Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Om Prakash Dhankar told The Indian Express that they were working on multiple strategies to increase the production of fruits and vegetables with introduction of more excellence centres in horticulture sector and Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana (BBY) scheme for vegetables.Dhankar said that they were developing 340 horticulture villages and 140 clusters, which will offer all facilities to the farmers including facility to sell farm produce. Director General, Haryana Horticulture Department, Arjun Singh Saini said they have trained farmers for protected cultivation of vegetables and fruits in the state. Now, we will focus more on increase in production, said Saini.AdvertisingIn 2004-05, the area under horticulture was just 4.04 per cent of the total geographical area of the state. It increased to 8.17 per cent in 2017-18. The production of fruits was 7.93 lakh metric tonne in 2017, a major jump from 2.32 lakh metric tonne in 2004-05. The production of vegetables increased to 71.40 lakh metric tonne in 2017-18 compared to 29.80 lakh metric tonne 13 years back.In fact, the state government is keen on implementing the Beijing model to provide fruits, milk and vegetables to Delhi just like the Chinas capital that developed a peri-urban agriculture zone on its periphery. Dhankar, who had visited China in 2015 to study the Beijing model, believes that it was easier to provide fruits, vegetables and milk to Delhi from Haryana than to the far flung areas of the country. Dhankar has been stating that an annual turnover of Rs 3,600 crore takes place in the International Mandi of Delhi and the farmers of Haryana can reap its benefit by selling their produce there.Aiming to safeguard the interests of vegetable farmers, the Haryana government in 2018 had launched BBY as an MSP scheme for four crops  tomato, onion, potato and cabbage. The MSP in this case, unlike for other crops, is meant to cover only input costs and not provide any margin. By enabling farmers to recover basic production cost, the scheme intends to prevent them from throwing their produce on roads in the event of a price crash.Dhankar says that the scope of compensation for these vegetables will be increased by Re one each per kilogram. In case of potatoes and tomatoes, it will be increased to Rs 5 per kg while offering Rs 6 per kg for cabbage and onion. He said that in the first year of BBY, 10,579 acre land was covered under the scheme and 4,435 farmers were registered, who were compensated with about Rs 12 lakh. In the second year, 20,346 farmers had registered 66,250 acres and they were compensated with about Rs 9.40 crore. Under this scheme, provision of budget amounting to Rs 25 crore has been made for ongoing financial year."
2019-06-13,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/13/staple-experiments-1989572.html,Staple experiments,"Romaa Sharad ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Give me one ingredient and I can make 10 different dishes with it, says Chetna Sudhirkumar Shah. Called Chetna ben lovingly by friends and family, her love affair with food began when she was just nine years old. My mother told me to go out of the kitchen every time I wanted to cook, but I never listened to her, she says. The first dish she made was bhakri no ladvo, laddoos made with bhakri, a thick roti made of wheat, which is a Gujarati staple. The 58-year-old prepares it every Monday to remind herself of when her journey began.Her skills came in handy when her mother fell sick. There were 20 people in my family so the pre-preparation like chopping vegetables and soaking dal would already be done, after which I used to cook for all of them, adds the cook, who has been in the business of preparing traditional Gujarati food for almost 20 years now.However, she likes to take things up a notch. From tomato-flavoured dhoklas to chutneys made of kairi (raw mango) and doodhi (bottle gourd) peels, Chetna loves creating new dishes. I look at the ingredients I have and think of how I can combine all of them to create a new dish. I may not be educated, but I am very innovative when it comes to cooking, says the self-taught cook, who has the ability to create varieties of the same dish by changing a few core ingredients.In her take on the classic puran poli, a flatbread that is made with a dal, sugar and cardamom stuffing, Chetna stuffs the dough with a sweet potato masala or a mixture of peanuts and coconuts. She also prepares different varieties of buttermilk that include orange buttermilk, lemon buttermilk and onion buttermilk. Depending on the type of buttermilk you are making, add a small piece of orange, lemon or onion to the curd with other masalas and blend it before adding water. It is that simple, she shares.However, her not-so-simple twist on the traditional Gujarati snack, bhakarwadi, is one that makes jaws drop. I use hariboot (green garbanzo beans) to fill the bhakarwadis instead of a mixture of coconut, sesame seeds and poppy seeds, she says.When asked if she uses any secret ingredient in her recipes, she shakes her head furiously saying, I do not see what one could possibly do by keeping the ingredients a secret. If one possesses knowledge that can help another person grow, why not share it? Chetna keeps good thoughts in mind while cooking. Agar bhagwan nu naam laine rasoi kare, toh badi vastu sari bane (When you chant gods name while cooking, everything will turn out well), she says."

I was affected by the stories of rural distress and farmer suicides. I took up farming to understand the pains and troubles of farmers, he said.Around five years ago, Sen purchased 27 gunthas (0.67 acre) land and took another 1.25 acres on lease from a neighbouring farmer. If you want to do something extraordinary, then the challenges should be extraordinary as well. Hence, I chose rocky soil. For the first three years, I grew pulses, roots of which are so strong that they can break through rocks, he said.Sen said he also had to implement water conservation methods as the groundwater level in the region was low. In this region, there is either too much rain or none at all. I thought, if people can grow peepal trees on the third floor of their buildings and railway tracks can have banyan trees, I can also grow something on rocky soil. I created huge trenches and allowed rainwater to seep, Sen said. The toil, the singer-actor said, had paid off and the farm now boasts of papaya, coconut and tamarind trees.AdvertisingSen, who has held several shows across the world and even at the Parliament and Rashtrapati Bhavan, said he now invites groups of farmers from around Lonavala to his farm and teaches them methods of trapping water and ways to keep wild pigs, crabs and rabbits in check. The problem is that farmers have become dependent on hybrid seeds. I want to teach them a model where they dont have to buy compost or seeds every year. If you stick to indigenous seeds, you dont have to buy it every year, he said.Another problem, Sen added, is that farmers children dont want to pursue farming anymore. They prefer to drive autorickshaws or take up odd jobs because they cannot rely on their farm yield alone, he said.Asked if being an artist helped him on the farm, Sen said: One of the virtues artistes possess is that they are never in a hurry. We let things happen in their own time."

Since January 23, I started going into the streets to accompany the people.Mr. Salazar, a friar of the Capuchin order who was once a contestant in a Venezuelan survival reality show, uses his iPhone to film a video series called Living the Gospels, a modern take on theology broadcast on Saturdays to 30,000 Instagram followers.The one-minute videos discuss concepts such as inner peace through references to animated film Kung Fu Panda and the 2000 action comedy Miss Congeniality.For me, hes like the rock-star priest, the millennial priest, said student Carol Alvarez, 23, who hopes Mr. Salazar will lead her confirmation ceremony. Mr. Salazar also holds traditional Sunday mass that combines the youthful demeanour of his social media videos with Catholic prayers and traditions.One such mass in May brought about 400 attendees  most significantly older than his typical Instagram audience  who stood in line to greet him and take selfies.His sermons often elaborate on the Instagram posts.I explain quickly and (explain) how people can use it in their lives, he said. People tell me if someone can explain it to me, Ill understand it use it in my life.Mr. Salazar said he got involved in the protests against President Nicolas Maduro because being political is part of being Venezuelan: From the peasant who harvests potatoes to Juan Guaido, the president in charge... we all talk about politics. I cannot exempt myself."

Food transition is as crucial as the energy transition to save the planet and the amazing thing about food is very one can make a difference. It makes food such a powerful tool for change, said Gunhild Stordalen, founder and executive chair of EAT, which is hosting the EAT Stockholm Food Forum to promotes scientifically-validated healthy diets from sustainable food systems.Less meatPeople do change their diets when they have the right information. Red meat consumption has gone down 40% in the United States since 1970, most likely because of health reasons, said Dr Walter Willet, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, and co-author of EAT-Lancet Commission, which created Planetary Health Diet that recommends the world double its consumption of nuts, fruits, vegetables, and legumes and halve the amount of red meat and sugar eaten.North European cuisine is in transition. At The Nordic Food Lab in the department of Food science at University of Copenhagen, Denmark, culinary entrepreneur, professor and co-founder of one of the world/ best restaurants Noma in Copenhagen Claus Meyers explores the edible potential of the Nordic region to promote seasonal flavours and local ingredients.Using local produce, reducing meat and food waste does not mean giving up on flavour. A cuisine must speak truly of its birthplace and be created using local ingredients produced using environment-friendly farming and production methods, said Meyers, founder of the New Nordic Cuisine Movement sweeping Europe. Meyers has just entered a partnership with furniture giant IKEA to provide vegan meatballs made with pea protein, pea starch, potato flakes, oats, and apple that look and taste like meat.Veggie burgers go globalAcross the Atlantic in the United Stares, no-meat veggie burgers have gone beyond beans and aloo tiki (potato croquettes) with California-based startup Impossible Foods crafting an plant-based alternative to red meat that mimics its taste and texture of so closely that it bleeds like beef. The Impossible Whopper, which was added to Burger King menus in 59 restaurants on April 1 this year, is so popular that it will now be available in all 7,200 branches in the US by the year end. Midwest fastfood chain White Castle has Impossible Foods sliders, and Carls Jr. sells burgers from Beyond Star Meat Burgers. Even Tex-Mex is going meatless, with US-based Mexican food chains Qdoba made Impossible Taco and Impossible Bowl part of its menu to in all its 730 US outlets in May, while Del Taco added meatless Beyond Tacos to its 580 stores menus starting April 25.Around 29% people in India are vegetarian, compared to 21% vegans and vegetarians in the world. India has several vegetarian options for meat dishes, we have veg kebabs, veg burgers and veg kofta (meatballs), to name a few -- turning vegetarian or reducing meat is not a problem, but these meat-like alternatives may become popular in urban India, said Rita Teaotia, chairperson, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, which is the countrys food regulator.First Published: Jun 14, 2019 06:52 IST"

2019-06-15,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/55-buildings-unsafe-in-navi-mumbai/article27944595.ece,55 buildings unsafe in Navi Mumbai,"In the last four years, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has identified 443 buildings as dangerous, of which 55 have been declared dilapidated. Of the 443 buildings, 373 are still in use while 70 have been vacated.The corporation has classified the structures under four categories: C-1, C-2A, C-2 B and C-3. Buildings under C-1 are extremely dangerous and unfit for staying, while structures under C-2A need the owners to vacate for undertaking repair work. Buildings classified as C-2B do not need vacating for repairs and those under C-3 require minor repairs.An official from the encroachment department said 55 buildings have been identified as C-1. These structures are completely unsafe and have no scope for being repaired. The onion-potato market and JN type buildings in Vashi fall under this category. There is no other way but to demolish them, which the owners will have to do themselves. While 106 buildings have been classified as C-2A, 226 come under C-2B, and 56 under C-3.As per the notice being issued to C-1 type structures, the administration has absolved itself of any responsibility in the event of mishap and has instructed for their demolition. We will disconnect the water supply and electricity to the dilapidated buildings. We have issued enough notices, and hope people take cognisance of them and vacate the buildings to avoid any kind of loss in case of mishap, NMMC Commissioner N. Ramaswami said.An NMMC official said the ward offices had sent notice to housing societies to submit their structural audit reports. A few housing societies had also presented their audit reports directly to the town planning department, which were also taken into account while compiling the list of dangerous structures.In 2018, the number of dangerous buildings was 367, followed by 315 in 2017, 98 in 2016, and 74 in 2015. The highest number of buildings added in one year was in 2017, when it was 143. Officials said the reason for the increase was the inclusion of numerous CIDCO-constructed condominiums and government quarters, which are largely situated in Vashi.Among the 55 structures are the police quarters in Belapur; Maharashtra State Electricity Board colony, Employees State Insurance Corporation colony, JN-1 and JN-2 type buildings, and B type buildings in Vashi; MAFCO market and onion-potato market of APMC; and many other government quarters.This year, among all the nodes under the NMMC, Vashi has the highest number of dangerous structures at 185."

We are waiting for a decision, Ashok Walunj, an onion-potato trader and director of Maharshtra Rajya Bazar Samiti Mahasangh, said.Onion-potato and garlic traders have been waiting for rehabilitation since the building was declared dangerous in 2003. On March 22, the APMC sent a notice to 234 of the 250 traders to vacate the market by June 1, which was later extended by 15 days, and now till July 15.But the traders have been demanding that the authorities first make an alternative arrangement.In 2005, when I was the director of the market, we had processed a tender and a work order for a new building was issued for 52 crore , which the government was to fund. The plan was to shift each wing to the auction hall in the market and construct a new wing. The project was to be finished in three years. But there was a dispute among traders. While some wanted an increase in FSI, some didnt. Hence the plan was cancelled, and now the entire market is suffering, Mr. Walunj said.Currently, the market is spread across 15 acres with seven buildings. The authorities had given as an option of shifting to a two-acre plot that belongs to the MAFCO market. We are already finding it difficult to operate from the 15-acre plot; working on a two-acre area is impossible, Mr. Walunj said.With around 300 trucks entering the market every day, the traders have urged the authorities to allot a bigger space.Anil Chavan, secretary of APMC, Mumbai, said, We will set up transit camps of 200 square feet at the MAFCO market for each trader. This is the only land available where we can relocate them temporarily. Later, after the processing of tender, the work at the market will start. While the government will fund the work of drainage, road and electricity, the traders will have to bear the expenditure of the construction of their shops."

Any guesses? Ask a Bengali and he/she will promptly tell you, Of course! Its the gondhoraj lebu (lime) thats missing!Over centuries, gondhoraj lebu has been a welcome guest in Bengali households and even today, it is considered as a dear relative of all types of dal and in some cases, fish and chicken curries cooked in the kitchen.Known to be a cousin of kaffir lime and having no such English word in the dictionary, gondhoraj keeps its head held high as the ultimate king of aromas, the essence of which can be felt even from a few metres away. Oh! Calcutta in Church Street is hosting the Gondhoraj Cocktail and Mocktail fest, and true to its spirit, we went Oh! Gondhoraj after the meal.To beat the heat, we were offered Gondhoraj Lychee Cooler, which was simply aromatic, fruity and soothing. The lime and its leaves did the magic of accentuating the magical aroma and lychees in the drink put in more flavour, turning the mocktail into an absolute delight. My dining companion had the Gondhoraj Lychee Caipiroshka, a vodka-based cocktail infused with flavours of the East. The vodka-mixed lychees gathered at the bottom of the glass gave a nice kick to the start of a sumptuous Bengali dinner ahead.Oh! Calcuttas fortnight-long summer food festival, Grishher Khabar, includes innovative yet traditional recipes, keeping in mind the ingredients that are essential to the summer cuisine. For starters, we had Sosha Diye Bhapa Maach, which is steamed boneless fish with cucumber and mustard. Soft bhetki fish topped with slices of cucumber melted in our mouth, with the right amount of spices and mustard that left our Bengali taste buds wanting some more.Coming to the course that is fit for a king, we were served rice along with Jhinge Pabda Aam Jhol, Lau Chingri, Doi Moricher Mangsho, Kancha Aam Diye Maacher Paturi and Enchorer Dalna. Only a Bong will understand the feeling of maa er haater ranna, (moms cooking), especially when he/she is living outside Bengal, and the main course reminded us of just that.The Jhinge Pabda dish, which is butterfish cooked with green mango and ridge gourd, is known for its amazing health benefits. Although the fish was not too fresh, the flavour came out really well, as anything that has hints of raw mango gives a tantalising taste to it.Lau Chingri, or bottle gourd cooked with prawns, is again a common dish prepared back home. With the right amount of ginger, tempered with dry red chillies and cumin, we loved this dish with rice.Chicken or mutton, when cooked with yoghurt, gives a creamy scrumptious flavour to the meat, and Doi Moricher Mangsho was no exception. The mutton, stewed in a clay pot, was cooked with yoghurt and black pepper and its richness got to us quite well.The Maacher Paturi, which is steamed fish marinated with mustard paste and wrapped in banana leaf, was marinated with green mango and stood out as our favourite. It was as soft as it could get, and the spices helped amp up the flavour. The jackfruit cooked in onion and tomato gravy (Enchorer Dalna) was wholesome, which we relished till the end of the course.Lastly, we ordered Nolen Gurer ice-cream, which is date palm jaggery added to the dessert, and ended our dinner on a sweet note. The summer food festival is on till June 25 and cost for two is Rs 1,700 (approx)."

The foundation had approached us with a proposal to serve food to the students studying in Delhi government schools. Their proposal for a contract is still under consideration. However, we have granted them permission to serve food through three kitchens in Delhi to around 10,000 girls students of government schools of classes 9 to 12 from each kitchen, he said.The director said the Delhi government has asked the organisation to cover girl students first. The Delhi government has been thinking about providing some assistance to girls studying in its schools because most of them come from economically weaker backgrounds and do not get balanced diet. Girl students up to class 8 are already getting mid-day meal under the RTE act. Its an initiative to cover those who do not come under the ambit of RTE, Bhushan said.As per the proposal, girls will be served potato curry with mashed vegetables and chapatis, vegetable daliya, rice and curries with mashed vegetables, daal and sambhar along with items like muffins, buns, cookies, cakes and roasted nuts.Bharath Prabhu, strategic communication, Akshay Patra Delhi, said the proposal is in very early stage. We will only be able to share further details after considering all aspects of the proposal, he said.A foundation official, who spoke on the condition of remaining anonymous since he is not authorised to speak to media, said the Delhi governments letter had reached them late on Friday (June 14) and thats why the NGO is yet to discuss the proposal. In all other states Akshay Patra is serving mid day meals with the help of government. But this proposal of is allowing the organisation to go ahead with a pilot project on its own cost. We need to discuss this with the competent authorities, said the official.The Aam Aadmi Party government has been trying to revise the mid-day meal model in Delhi. Last year, after the two incidents of students falling ill at government schools after consuming mid-day meals, the Delhi government had said that it was re-considering Akshay Patras proposal.First Published: Jun 20, 2019 03:58 IST"

As the four-storey, century-plus structure was being evacuated, chunks of concrete were peeling off the second-floor ceiling.ITD ITD-Cementation, contracted to build the 2.45km Esplanade-Sealdah twin tunnels, is having a trying time mitigating the wobbly structure. Despite extensive grouting and propping, engineers are bracing for soil subsidence during the tunnelling operation.The TBMs are negotiating the highest number of old and unsafe buildings in this stretch. Some of them are on the verge of collapse. The route started at SN Banerjee Road. It will cover Nirmal Chandra Street and BB Ganguly Street to reach Sealdah station around March 2020.Surveying a building is key to devising a reinforcement plan to ensure their protection when the tunnel is constructed. Based on this, building condition survey (BCS) report compiled by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of the 16km Salt Lake-Howrah Metro link, we issued a condemned notice to 49 Lenin Sarani, a KMC engineer confirmed. The civic bodys notices to this building and some others came in the wake of the cracks that appeared on Rani Rashmonis house on SN Banerjee Road after Chandi dug past it.Engineers involved in the project took heart from KMCs belated action that now holds the owners responsible for the sorry state of these structures. A walkway for pedestrians has been created around the building since the pavement in front has been cordoned off. A part of the ground-floor is occupied by the famous Lenin Sarani potato chips address.Raju Das, who peels potatoes at the shop, said on Thursday, A notice was given to us last week, asking us to vacate the premises between Friday and Sunday. This is the first time the shop is being closed in decades.ITD ITD-Cementation has been interacting with the Sarbadhikari family that lives on the third floor. They shifted out two members of the family, including an octogenarian, to a central Kolkata hotel on Friday. The building has several tenants and houses a dentists chamber, a hotel, a godown and several shops. When the KMC notice for immediate repair was issued to the occupants, they said the low rent generated from tenants was behind the lack of maintenance. They were wondering where they would get funds for the repairs, an engineer said."

India lost the toss and were asked by West Indies to bat first. ( Getty Images )That year was the first time I felt cricket had become weather-resistant. July was when football ruled Kolkata (then Calcutta); making muddles in a muddy park a favourite post-school activity.That changed in 1983. You slipped and slid alright but to catch a rubber ballusually red and bouncing wildlyor a tennis ball, and the game was cricket. If it landed in a puddle, the batsman would have to stoop to conquer, in the way Ian Botham couldnt to a Kirti Azad delivery in a World Cup semi-final a few days prior. Kapils Devils had made cricket in half-pants kosher, and boys lugging cricket kits on the Kolkata Maidan all year round stopped being unusual.The timing too had a lot to do with the spike in popularity.The dustbins! I went outside with the dustbin, and that was the moment I realised that my country had changed. For ever, as it turned out, wrote Matthew Engel in The Guardian. He was narrating how Englands run in the 1990 World Cup really brought football home. Everyone, Engel wrote, was watching England beat Cameroon as he stepped out on a London rat run street. And there was silence. Engel was sure it would be the same in the semi-final. (England lost to Germany on penalties and it wasnt till 2018 that they went that far).It may be hard for those who believe sporting history began in 1992 (In the beginning God created the Premier League ... and he saw that it was good because everyone would make oodles of dosh) to imagine the state of English football in the 1980s, wrote Engels. Rocked by hooliganism and a series of stadium disasters, sensible people avoided football. Botham was the countrys most popular sportsman, according to Engels.The difference between Engels England and India of seven years earlier was that India had little to offer in terms of world beaters. Less than two months before June 25, 1983, became a red letter day in India, Prakash Padukone bagged bronze in the world badminton championships. The former world No. 1 and winner of the prestigious All-England championships, Padukone added colour to our black-and-white days. At the time Padukone, billiards world champion Michael Ferreira and Vijay Amritraj, who lost a five-setter Wimbledon quarter-final to Jimmy Connors in 1981, were our only bright stars in the sporting firmament.True, India were the Olympic champions in hockey, but half the world hadnt turned up at the 1980 Games in Moscow. The 1982 Asian Games, which New Delhi hosted, did produce Indian champions, but it was really about China emerging as a sporting superpower.So it fit that sport wasnt front page stuff and films like Gol Maal, the 1979 Hindi laugh riot where a key scene involved a hockey match and there were references to Pele in Kolkata and Indian cricketers touring abroad, were rare. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), Paan Singh Tomar (2012), Chak De! India (2007) were ideas whose time had not yet come.Moreover, when it came to the cricket World Cup, India were as snug a fit as a guest in psychedelic pink at a black tie event.Self DiscoveryTalking about the time when he hadnt added the extra K to his surname, Krishnamachari Srikkanth has said the World Cup was to be merely a stopover on way to a vacation in the USA with his wife of two months.You have to understand one thing: In the two World Cups before this, we had beaten only one teama team called East Africa, which was a bunch of Gujjus (Gujaratis) put together, nothing else. In 1979, we lost to Sri Lanka which was not even a qualified Test nation then. So 1983 started like a vacation for us, Srikkanth said at a function in Mumbai that coupled a champions reunion with the launch of the film 83, based on Indias first World Cup win, and slated for release next year.According to the book Miracle Men by Nikhil Naz, which released this month and details Indias journey at that fateful World Cup, Raj Singh Dungarpur (a former first-class cricketer who also became the board president) was asked to interview the captain by the national broadcaster Doordarshan. So, young man, looking forward to your next assignment? he asked. No, came the reply from Kapil, I dont want to look forward. I like to stay in the present.After that, the interview continued in Hindi, writes Naz.This was Team India back then, leaving for the World Cup with no fuss, and promptly getting stopped at the airport for excess baggage.India manager PR Man Singh tried to explain to the airline staff why an exception should be made; the airline refused to play ball. Man Singh billed BCCI. Days later, India, with vegetarians in their ranks, found lunch in a practice game against New Zealand comprised roast chicken, shepherds pie and jacket potatoes. It was only after Man Singh located an Indian fan with a restaurant in Southall that the butter chicken and kadhai paneer arrived.Yashpal Sharma and Roger Binny grab stumps as souvenirs, and Mohinder Amarnath runs off the field as Michael Holding is out lbw.) ( Getty Images )India needed a little luck at the start and got it when the opener against West Indies spilled into the reserve day. When we went back to Old Trafford (in Manchester) the next day, there was a massive cloud cover, and the ball was swinging a lot! according to Roger Binny who was the most successful bowler in that World Cup with 18 wickets. Binny dismissed Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd, Balwinder Singh Sandhu got Gordon Greenidge, and India began with a 34-run win against the defending champions.Kapil Dev running the show with an unbeaten innings of 175 against Zimbabwe is an enduring part of the 1983 lore but a lesser known story is that after being reduced to 17/5 in that match, the players hid from their captain at lunch, leaving a glass of orange juice on his seat. But Kapils match-winning knock re-energised the team. He was a daredevil and a die-hard optimist, and that rubbed off on the entire team. We were all pumped up with confidence because of him, said Srikkanth.On way to the final, it also had fun. I like talking and cracking jokes, and doing silly things to make a fool of myself, said Srikkanth.He (Srikkanth) always thought that he spoke good Hindi, said Binny, and he felt he was a great singer. He would go around singing Hindi songs seriously in a ridiculous accent and completely wrong lyrics, and everyone would be in fits of laughter.Fans swarm the ground and invade the pitch as India defeat the West Indies. ( Patrick Eagar via Getty Images )1983: A Love StoryNaz calls it the greatest underdog story in cricketIndia lost to a team comprising plumbers, farmers and salesmen in a warm-up match. India were 66-1 outsiders who had breached the holiest of holy cricket cathedrals and bested the twice champions. It was like the Washington Generals beating the Harlem Globetrotters, only this wasnt exhibition basketball.1983 is more than a timeless love story because it gave India another sporting identity. As a country, one-day cricket became to us what Don Bradman meant to the Australian writer Thomas Keneally, who wrote: While no Australian had written Paradise Lost, Don Bradman had made a hundred before lunch at Lords.Yes, India had won a Test series in the West Indies and England earlier; yes, over the years, many Indian cricketers had wowed the world, but champions in a multi-team competition had a totally different zing to it. If you still need a reason, heres another: 1983 made Sachin Tendulkar to get serious about cricket. Had it not happened things could have been different for me, he has said.Vignettes of the final burn bright in our minds as we age: that Srikkanth cover-drive off Andy Roberts, Greenidge shouldering arms to Sandhu, that catch by Kapil to send Richards back.At the Lords balcony with the trophy, Kapil, nonchalance personified, had spoken of wanting India to do this again. Will his words ring true this year too?First Published: Jun 22, 2019 15:31 IST"

2019-06-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/in-a-recaptured-district-gains-for-afghan-troops-5795383/,"In a recaptured district, gains for Afghan troops","Mujib MashalAdvertisingThe battle for control of an Afghan district is often fierce, involving car bombs, airstrikes and raids that destroy government buildings and leave a trail of bodies.But the Afghan militarys routing of the Taliban two weeks ago from Khwaja Umari, a district about 10 miles from Ghazni City, capped a rare period of relatively good news for a military demoralized by years of high casualties and territorial loss.More proactive security forces, borne of a generational shift to younger leaders, have been credited with denying the Taliban any major new gains at a crucial time of peace negotiations. The forces have ruthlessly used commandos and airstrikes to bleed the insurgents, waging what has been a more flexible and adaptive counterinsurgency compared with the older ways, when the forces remained less mobile and largely defensive.AdvertisingThe strategy, even if not significantly reducing the casualties of Afghan forces, seems to be slowing the insurgents momentum.Whether the Afghan forces can hold the district from falling again to the Taliban, whose fighters lurk on its edges and still fire mortars on government soldiers, will be a test of whether the military pressure is just the result of a savvy use of force or will translate into deeper changes.The Taliban still remain a major threat to most of Ghazni province, with only three of the 18 districts entirely in government control, according to Nasir Ahmad Faqiri, the head of Ghaznis provincial council. Five districts remain largely under Taliban control. The rest of the districts are contested to varying degrees.We used to not feel comfortable even 2 kilometers outside the city center  the Taliban could easily gather in large numbers, said Faqiri. Now, the security belt has expanded.Col. Abdul Mobin Mohabati, the commander of the Afghan Army brigade in Ghazni province who led the operations to retake Khwaja Umari, which was in the hands of the Taliban for nine months, said about 300 soldiers, 60 of them commandos, were involved in the assault.The fighting didnt last longer than 30 minutes, the colonel said. It was all ground forces, no air power.The districts recapture is part of the plan to break the Talibans chokehold around Ghazni City. Over the past three months, Afghan forces first expanded the security belt around the city, and then pushed to clear the areas surrounding the highway before launching operations to take back two districts close to Ghazni City, including Khwaja Umari.When the Taliban first made a run for Khwaja Umari last April, the assault was so fierce that the districts young governor, Ali Dost Shams, fought to his last man.The insurgents were repelled only when airstrikes killed dozens of them. When reinforcements arrived, the district was saved, but not its governor, who had promised to be home in Kabul for his little daughters birthday when the assault began.The second time the Taliban came for the district, last August, it was part of a larger, ambitious run for Ghazni City. While the collapse of the city was barely avoided, the Taliban took control of neighboring Khwaja Umari.Increasingly, it seems, little fundamentally changes for residents when a district switches hands from the government to the Taliban, or the other way around.Interviews with residents in Khwaja Umari suggested that for much of the time the Taliban controlled the district of roughly 40,000 people, the insurgents showed little ambition for governing. Their officials rarely held large meetings with residents, keeping their movements unpredictable in a cat-and-mouse game with airstrikes and commando raids.The Taliban, however, made sure to collect taxes for sustaining fighters as their units grew financially decentralized. Residents said Taliban fighters would collect one-tenth of all their produce, such as potatoes, apples and plums.Last year, they taxed our apples, said Irfanullah, 18, who like many Afghans uses only one name. But this year, they left before the apples were ripe.In Khwaja Umari, the schools remained open for both boys and girls, and the clinic functioned normally. But the Taliban tried to put their stamp on basic services, even though the salaries of local teachers and doctors still came from the U.S.-backed central government.Female patients at the clinic had to come with a male chaperone, said Ahmad Shoaib, 28, a resident of Khwaja Umari. And at the girls school, students had to cover up in Islamic hijab.In one signature Taliban method of governing, the mediation of local disputes, they had less of a presence, Haji Gul Jan, a local elder, said.In one case, a laborer in Iran had sent money to his family, but the courier was in denial and not delivering it to the mans family, Jan said. When the family petitioned, the Taliban commander gave them a note to bring the latest exchange rate from Ghazni City. And the courier was forced to pay the money right away according to that rate.When Afghan forces have pushed out the Taliban, the insurgents have destroyed government facilities before their retreat, officials say. In Khwaja Umari, the district governors office was left in tatters. Only a couple of rooms in the Police Headquarters, which were heavily mined and damaged, have returned to use.Our estranged brothers are still near that hill, said Sgt. Ahmad Zaki, using a sarcastic term for the Taliban. They still fire rockets at us.The protection of the district now falls to the police, led by another young commander, Col. Khalid Wardak, 33. He spent years in the police special forces before he was made the security chief of Ghazni.Quiet and shy, the colonel lost a leg to a roadside bomb four years ago, but he went to India for treatment and returned to the fight a couple of months later with a prosthetic.AdvertisingIt was a nice little burst of fighting, he told a friend after returning from a skirmish with the Taliban one recent evening. I had a headache all day, and it went away with the smell of gunpowder."

The success of these tiny little shops that would fry unbelievable thin slices of potatoes and pack them for you to take home, led to the mushrooming of plenty of clones all over the city. And even though some might be called Hot Chips, they need not be part of the original brand. But whats even more interesting is that potato is no longer the only ingredient that gets fried at these stores.Mirror goes on a binge across Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Malleswaram, Adugodi and Indiranagar.growing up in the 90s came with a huge advantage; if you were not allowed to eat packaged crisps, you were occasionally treated to Fryums (often remembered for it lovely ad jingle) that was nothing but prettily shaped ready-to-fry flour and cornstarch pellets. Today, almost every little store that sells fried snacks has this almost weightless and addictive snack on their shelves. One would typically find them sprinkled with a dash of red chilli powder.You really dont have to ask everyone who returns from Kerala to bring back bananafor you. From plain salted to really spicy ones, the city does love its banana chips to the core.These faux cookies are ideally made during Christmas and are called Rose De Coque in Portuguese and in Goa. And Rose Cookies are not cookies either, but just deep fried batter made of flour. And the name comes from the shape. Despite being a festival special, youll find Rose Cookies through the year. If youre storing them for later, make sure the container is as airtight as possible. Before serving, you can dust some cinnamon sugar for added flavour.These curlies or deep fried twisted bites of pure calories is nothing but plain refined flour and salt. Light in weight, its hard to stop at one. A word of caution, please stop after a few. And if you want to take them home, sprinkle some rock salt or even chilli powder on it for added flavourite.WHEN: 11am-9pmFor every type of potato crisps that you get at these local shops, theres an identical version made with tapioca. Chip sticks are hugely popular not just as a snack, but also as anaccompaniment with rice and sambar. Usually the sticks are spicier than their potato-twin and have added curry leaves as well.the khara ginger masala chips arent just plain potato chips, they are also tossed with ginger and curry leaves. And theyre hot. Its also something you wont find in packaged form anywhere. Go to one of your local hot chips stores, and pack however little you need.The Pudina Masala chips are the same as the khara masala chips except that the potato is tossed in mint before its fried. Its quite tasty if you take both the versions and mix them up.The super spicy tapioca chips are really difficult to resist. No wonder that they sell as much as the plain potato crisps. You can of course also buy plain tapioca chips if you cant handle the heat from the chilli powder.Muruku or chaklis are one of Bengalurus favourite snacks, and are practically available everywhere. The plain one is a mix of rice flour, urad dal, sesame seeds. But there are plenty of variations available all over the city. One of the most popular types is the spinach muruku."

The late arrival is expected to hit plantation crops in this region, which traditionally receives very heavy rains.Among the four regions in the State, the highest departure in rainfall from the normal, expected during the first few weeks, is witnessed in the Malnad region. Between June 1 and 24, the normal rainfall expected here was 253 mm, while the actual received rainfall is only 140.4 mm, recording the departure at -44.5%.People in this region, where all prominent rivers of the State take birth, are facing acute shortage of drinking water. Agriculture activities have been badly hit. The growers of plantation crops are anticipating the worst year in terms of production.Areca and coffeeArecanut palms have started withering even in places known for high rainfall. Chandrashekhar Shetty, a resident of Manjagalale in Hosanagar taluk, told The Hindu that the arecanut palms in Hiremane and Nagodi villages located on the foothill of Kodachadri, known for high rainfall, have started withering owing to water shortage.Coffee growers too are anticipating a bad year. U.M. Thirthamallesh, president of the Karnataka Growers Federation, a body of coffee growers, said: Even if we receive good rains now on, there are no signs of improvement in our situation. He said last year by this time many parts of Sakleshpur had received over 1,200 mm of rainfall for the whole year, while this year only 210 mm has been recorded so far. Similarly, in parts of Chikkamagaluru this year, around 260 mm of rainfall has been recorded against last years record of 760 mm. With this, the drought period has prolonged, impacting the setting of coffee. There will be a huge dip in production, he said.Amidst the grim situation, the rains in the last couple of days in several parts of the region have prompted farmers to hope for better days ahead. Kiran Kumar M., Deputy Director of Department of Agriculture in Shivamogga, said that the district will receive widespread rain from June 23 and the South West Monsoon will become further active by July first week.Of the total 1.6 lakh hectare of cultivable land in Shivamogga, the sowing for kharif season has taken place only on 3,770 hectares. The potato growers of Hassan are worried about losing the crop this year, with no rains after sowing. Krishnamurthy, a farmer in Arsikere taluk, said: With the rain received so far, we can grow ragi, nothing else.Drinking water situationIn rural areas of Malnad districts, villagers depend on small water sources in the hilllocks (locally known as abbi).For the residents of Manjagalale hamlet in the vicinity of Kodachadri in Nittur Grama Panchayat of Hosanagar taluk, the abbi went dry as early as first week of May. Now, they get drinking water through tankers, unheard of in this region.In Shivamogga district alone, 136 villages get drinking water through tankers. The residents of Shivamogga town are getting water on alternate days.The situation is no better in neighbouring Chikkamagaluru. Arsikere taluk in Hassan is one among the worst drought-hit in the State.At present, 29 villages are getting water through tankers and in another 30 places, the taluk administration is managing the supply by taking over private borewells."

Industries identified for incentives include electronics, consumer appliances, electric vehicles, footwear and toys, according to a trade ministry document seen by Bloomberg.Economies, including Vietnam and Malaysia, have benefited from businesses trying to sidestep tariffs, while India has largely missed out on any investment gains . The trade ministrys effort is part of a larger plan to cut reliance on imports, while boosting exports, and needs finance minister Nirmala Sitharamans approval.The trade ministry didnt immediately respond to an email and a call seeking comment.Other measures include setting up affordable industrial zones across Indias coastline and giving preference to local manufacturers in government procurement as an incentive to win over companies looking for an alternative production base, according to the trade ministry document circulated to stakeholders.The plan will help grow Indias manufacturing base and will aid Prime Minister Narendra Modis flagship Make in India initiative, which aims to boost manufacturing to 25% of the economy by 2020. Doing that will help India narrow its huge trade deficit with China, its largest commercial partner.A sector-wise analysis by the industry department, which oversees the foreign direct investment policy, shows investments by Chinese companies can flow into smartphones and components manufacturing, consumer appliances, electric vehicles and parts, and daily use items like bed linen and kitchenware, 95% of which are currently imported from China.There is also an effort to step up exports in sectors vacated by the US due to the trade standoff.

Industries identified for incentives include electronics, consumer appliances , electric vehicles, footwear and toys, according to a trade ministry document seen by Bloomberg.Economies, including Vietnam and Malaysia, have benefited from businesses trying to sidestep tariffs, while India has largely missed out on any investment gains. The trade ministrys effort is part of a larger plan to cut reliance on imports, while boosting exports, and needs Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharamans approval.The trade ministry didnt immediately respond to an email and a call seeking comment.Other measures include setting up affordable industrial zones across Indias coastline and giving preference to local manufacturers in government procurement as an incentive to win over companies looking for an alternative production base, according to the trade ministry document circulated to stakeholders.The plan will help grow Indias manufacturing base and will aid Prime Minister Narendra Modis flagship Make in India initiative, which aims to boost manufacturing to 25% of the economy by 2020. Doing that will help India narrow its huge trade deficit with China, its largest commercial partner.A sector-wise analysis by the industry department, which oversees the foreign direct investment policy, shows investments by Chinese companies can flow into smartphones and components manufacturing, consumer appliances, electric vehicles and parts, and daily use items like bed linen and kitchenware, 95% of which are currently imported from China.There is also an effort to step up exports in sectors vacated by the U.S. due to the trade standoff. The government has identified more than 150 items where it feels exporters can increase business with China. Some of these are prepared or preserved potatoes, synthetic staple fibers of polyesters and t-shirts, hydraulic power engines, and supercharger for motors."

2019-06-26,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vegetable-prices-soar/article28159800.ece,Vegetable prices soar,"A routine trip to the market is increasingly digging a deeper hole in the pocket, with prices of many vegetables soaring.Coriander leaves, a kitchen staple, has turned into a luxury in the city, with a bunch now touching the 100 mark. Owing to short supply, coriander leaves costs 70 a bunch even in the wholesale market.An entire bunch of coriander usually costs not more than 20. But when I handed over 10, the shopkeeper gave me exactly three stalks, said Chandramathi, a resident of Banashankari.Other vegetables too have become expensive, more so beans and brinjal. A kilogram of beans costs in the range of 90 to 120, and brinjal 100 to 110 per kg. Most of the gourds too are trading at the higher end.The only saving grace has been the relatively low prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes  staple items in most homes. However, garlic, another widely consumed vegetable, has also turned dear at 130/kilo. In the case of lemons, each one costs 5 to 8.Though the monsoon has set in in the State, farmers are yet to take to sowing. The rains that the State is receiving now will take another month or so to have an impact, said G. Srinivasan, member, HOPCOMS.A punishing summer, high temperatures and a severe drought over the past three months have caused stress on the production of vegetables and greens.Most borewells have dried up. Water scarcity is so acute that most farmers have been watering the farms with tanker water. This has only shot up the input cost, said G. Muniswamy Gowda, a vegetable farmer in Devanahalli.Also what has hit vegetable supply in the city is the drought in Tamil Nadu.We get a bulk of the coriander from the Hosur region. We also get Lady Fingers and other vegetables from Tamil Nadu, which is reeling under water shortage, cutting off most supply and pushing the prices upwards, said a senior procurement official from a prominent retail chain in the city.But there is hope. The onset of monsoon and the upcoming Ashaada month, considered inauspicious for holding any programme, is expected to bring down prices over the next three weeks."
2019-06-28,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/how-the-segregation-habit-helps-reduce-household-waste-and-the-size-of-landfills/articleshow/69981576.cms,How the segregation habit helps reduce household waste and the size of landfills,"Representative imageDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityNOIDA: Waste segregation wont just reduce the total amount of waste that goes to landfills, it can also cut down on how much your household ultimately generates.For starters, kitchen waste like potato peels, cucumber skin, carrot crumbs, etc need not go into the waste basket at all  they can just be put in container pots and re-sued as fertilizers.By taking care of biodegradable waste ourselves, we can roughly reduce 50-60% of household waste. The remaining can be handed over to the waste collector, says Swati Singh Sambyal, programme manager for environmental governance (waste management) at the Centre for Science and Environment.Another little homework to get the household waste management process right is to identify what goes into the dry waste bin (blue) and what goes into the wet waste bin (green). This will get you prepared for July 1 when Noidarolls out its segregate-at-source programme that will see pickup vans collect segregated waste from households in 20 sectors and societies.Experts also suggest a red bin for domestic hazardous waste such as batteries, nail paints, pesticide/insecticide containers, paint drums, needles, syringes, expired medicines or chemicals, etc, and a fourth for sanitary waste and diapers. But for now, two  green and blue  will do.The segregation rules are the same for bungalows and housing societies, though the collection and treatment process vary slightly. Housing societies are bulk waste generators according to the solid waste management rules (SWM) 2016, and will need to compost wet waste at source. In a large society that has space, an agency can be engaged for composting in a pit dug within the premises and also by employing machines. If there is no space, a neighbouring green belt could be used. Out of the 200 apartment complexes in the district, 15 have attained almost 100 % waste segregation while 46 are in a semi-prepared state or preparing, says Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NOFAA).But there are challenges. Societies built 15 years back didnt plan for in-house composting facilities, says Singh. Besides, the need for childrens play areas and parking spaces means societies have a space crunch. Noida Authority needs to come up with the concept of clusters where societies can jointly incur the operational cost for waste segregation and machinery and the authority can provide infrastructure and land, suggests Singh.Sambyal maintains more de-centralised methods should be explored. Waste to energy (WTE) plants are a failed concept. Decentralised waste management is essential and segregation should be ensured, says Sambyal, adding NCR should not repeat the mistake of setting up another plant like the one at Okhla. Waste in India is mostly organic, since we dont consume as much packaged food as the west. This makes a WTE plant futile here, says Sambyal.The impact of a landfill site, she adds will be evident in the next 5-10 years in Noida when groundwater becomes contaminated. A landfill site should be as far away from habitation as possible because even at a well-planned site, there is always some leakage that will affect groundwater in some years, if not immediately, says Sambyal.Noida certainly does not want the Mubarakpur landfill to turn into a second Ghazipur dumpsite. It also wants to do away with all dhalaos (roadside vats) that are both a health hazard and an eyesore.The places where the segregation programme will start from on July 1 are Vivek Vihar (Sector 82), sectors 19, 21, 25, 27, 30, 44, 47, 48, 52, 56, 71 B block, 104 and 135, Janta Shiv Shakti Apartments (Sector 71), Silver City (Sector 93), Green View Apartments (Sector 99), Best View Apartment (Sector 99), Dhawalgiri Apartments (Sector 11) and Homes Apartments (Sector 121).The Noida Authority has empanelled six agencies for RWAs to sign up for composting of wet waste."

The fourth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), released in 2015-16  the latest credible findings of health indices  had pointed to the malnutrition factors being prevalent in the country.Some of the key findings of the NFHS-4 were:> Nutritional status of children (percentage below three standard deviations of weight for age, weight for height and weight for age): The survey showed instances of stunting  the main fallout of malnutrition  in 8.2 per cent children below six months, 9.9 per cent children between six and eight months, 14.9 per cent children between nine and 11 months, 21.1 per cent children between 12 and 17 months, 29 per cent children between 18 and 23 months, 28.2 per cent children between 24 and 35 months, 25.9 per cent children between 36 and 47 months and 24.7 per cent children between 48 and 59 months.> Children between 0-71 months who received any benefit under (ICDS): The survey, done once every 10 years, showed that aanganwadi workers were able to provide the scheme benefits (distribution of three and half kg rice, 1.5 kg pulse and 500 gm soybean to parents of children below three years and providing meals at aaganwadi centres to children between three and six years, immunisation) to 53.2 per cent children below 12 months, 57.8 per cent children between 12 and 23 months, 51 per cent children between 24 and 35 months, 47 per cent children between 36 and 47 months and 43.4 per cent children between 48 and 59 months and 39.6 per cent children between 60 and 71 months.> Prevalence of anaemia in children below five years: The NFHS-4 survey showed high prevalence of moderate anaemia (7-9.9 gm/dl) among children. While children between six and 11 months reported 38.9 per cent moderate cases of anaemia in children between six and 11 months, 43.7 per cent in children between 12 and 23 months, 33.5 per cent between 24 and 35 months, 26.5 per cent between 36 and 47 months and 20.3 per cent between 48 and 59 months.> Vaccination: The survey showed that 61.7 per cent children between 12 and 23 months were vaccinated. Muzaffarpur district registered 55 per cent vaccination in this age group.> Poor diarrhoea management: The survey showed a high percentage of children not receiving any treatment for diarrhoea. The survey showed 42.2 per cent children below six months had not received any treatment for diarrhoea. The survey, however, showed that 70.7 per cent people between 15-19 years age group had knowledge of ORS. About 70 per cent people of 20 and 49 years also had knowledge of ORS packets.OPINION | Lets politicise healthAn interaction with the families of some AES-affected children in Bihar reveals that many were not receiving a supplementary diet (such as milk) from aaganwadi centres under the ICDS, and none of the families confirmed having sent their children to a nutrition rehabilitation centre.Raj Kishor Ram, a resident of Jagarnathpur Dok village in Bihars Saraiya, lost his four-year-old son Subodh a fortnight ago. Khichri is all that my child got at the aanganwadi centre. We were not told about any nutrition centre, said Ram.It is job of aanganwadi sevikas and ASHA workers to recommend severely malnourished children to a nutrition rehabilitation centre, where a child below is kept for a month.A visit to the Muzaffarpur nutrition rehabilitation centre revealed a 20-bed centre in a two-storey building. The centre has 20 beds, of which only seven were occupied at the time of the visit. Since June 1, 40 children have been admitted to the centre, but though a child has to kept there for a month, most children were discharged within 15 days.At the centre, two auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANMS) work in two shifts. Since a dietician left the centre this January, no dietician has been posted. Rice, lentil pulse and potato vegetables (dry and with gravy) are served during the day.Sujata Devi brought her six-month-old son to the centre a few days ago. Every child gets 75 ml milk in the morning. Parents get two meals for free. It is surely better than what we eat, but a child should be given more milk, she said.As per norms, a nutrition rehabilitation centre has to provide treatment and management of patients besides nutritious food. ANM Vimla Kumari said: Our job is also to create nutrition awareness and tell parents how to prepare nutritious diet from available food and vegetables.AdvertisingMeanwhile, Muzaffarpur civil surgeon S P Singh said: We are too busy with AES awareness campaign to talk about other things."

The sector provides livelihood to close to half of Indias population and it is very important for inclusive growth, which also matters for this governments agenda of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. Sometime back, I did a study on how much decline in poverty was witnessed when there was 1% growth in agriculture and 1% growth in non-agriculture. I found that agriculture growth had much more significant impact than non-agriculture growth. We should recognise some of the positive changes that have taken place in the agricultural sector. In the 1970s, we were producing 1 kg of food per person per day  and food here includes not just foodgrains, but also fruits, vegetables, milk etc. At that time, our population was about 56 crore. Now, that has gone up to more than 130 crore, but our per capita food production today is roughly 1.74 kg food per day. This has its own implications, as we are no longer living in scarcity.Why Ramesh Chand?AdvertisingA member of the NITI Aayog, Ramesh Chand is seen as key to the Narendra Modi government driving agriculture sector reforms, especially in its second innings. A farm economist of repute, he has been an advocate of dismantling provisions under the Essential Commodities Act and APMC laws that enable restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports, besides preventing large retailers from buying directly from farmers. These views may find resonance in a context where food inflation and shortages have ceased to be a major worry, with the focus now shifting to addressing agrarian distress and doubling farmers incomesHARISH DAMODARAN: Do you think the Narendra Modi government in its first innings was excessively pro-consumer and not pro-producer?I doubt the government was pro-consumer at the cost of producers. We draw this conclusion only because producer prices have risen at a very low rate after 2014-15, when this government came to power. But agricultural prices historically move in cycles. During 2006 to 2012, there was a sharp increase in global agricultural prices, which fell just around when this government came. In 2012, they were at their peak. But still if one looks at the terms of trade for agriculture  the prices that farmers pay and what prices they receive  these had been improving up to 2015-16. Only in the last two years, the prices paid by farmers have increased at a slightly higher rate compared to the prices received. But overall, the terms of trade figure for 2018-19 is higher than 2011-12 This government has tried hard to keep these prices high with a new formula for fixing MSP (minimum support price) and also through procurement. So it is a combination of factors  international prices, demand and supply cycle  that is responsible for the current agrarian distress. It is very difficult for the government to influence prices beyond a point.AdvertisingHARISH DAMODARAN: As you say, the scarcity of the past is over. Is it time now to scrap the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), export controls and other restrictions that are clearly anti-farmer?The farmer is a consumer too. But I agree, the sectors interest today lies in scrapping these restrictions. In the last (June 15) meeting of the NITI Aayogs Governing Council, we proposed some reforms, including on the ECA, APMC (agricultural produce market committee) reforms and enabling contract farming. The Prime Minister announced that a high-power committee of chief ministers would be constituted to examine these reforms. In 2016, the Union government passed an order, after which there are no real restrictions on food commodities with regards to stocking, movement or exports. But people say that a similar order was issued in 2002, but when prices increased in 2006, the controls were brought back. So they believe that unless the Act changes, the government will always find ways to bring back control if things are seen as going against the consumer. The NITI Aayog has suggested a way out  classifying commodities into two categories: foodstuffs and others. There are some commodities such as drugs where the ECA is needed, but not in case of agri produce. If the ECA has to be used, let us clearly define the conditions. If, say, there is a 20% decline in production because of natural calamity of an extraordinary order, or a war, only then can the provisions be brought back.RAVISH TIWARI: How do you deal with political opposition to these reforms being suggested?The supply situation is much better than in the past. The need for ECA to stop hoarding or black marketing does not arise in the case of most commodities, where even exports are happening. When we meet politicians, we give them examples by asking them if they ever felt the need to have ECA on eggs or milk (which are non-perishable and cannot be hoarded). Price volatility may be extreme in onions, but not in most other commodities. The best way to address volatility is through buffer stocks, not by ECA. Recently, West Bengal, for example, imposed movement controls in potatoes under ECA, but that only did a lot of harm to its farmers. Todays India and its agriculture situation are very different.PRABHUDATTA MISHRA: How does the NITI Aayog plan to make MSP more effective on the ground?Everybody wants only the Centre to act. But agriculture is a state subject. It can only be the joint responsibility of the Centre and the states. The total production of all commodities where MSPs exist will be about 300 million tonnes. If the Centre is taking care of rice and wheat, whose production is about 200 million tonnes, cant all the states combined take care of the remaining one-third production? Under PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan), states were given the option to implement MSP by procuring up to 30 per cent of the produce (similar to what the Centre is doing for rice and wheat). If in the process of procurement and disposal, the states incurred a loss, the Centre would bear it up to 30-35%. But the states did this only at a very small level. When the financial cost is being borne by the Central government, the states should come forward and take advantage of PM-AASHA by putting in place a procurement mechanism.HARISH DAMODARAN: But instead of physical procurement, why cant we have direct benefit transfer and simply pay the difference between MSP and market prices into farmers accounts?The NITI Aayog has suggested this as well. If you take the MSP of wheat today, it is actually 30% higher than the international price. So if you procure wheat at MSP, you will only distort the market and exports will be hit, as domestic price is very high. Stocks, too, will pile. Direct benefit transfer is a very good idea and under PM-AASHA, we have the option of physical procurement as well as provision of deficiency price payments. In this case, we dont have to look at the price received by each and every farmer. Farmers just have to register the area they are sowing under different crops before the seasons start on a portal. For every state, the harvest season is defined. So, at the end of the season, we monitor the actual price received by farmers in every district. Every district has 3-4 mandis. We take the average price at these mandis for the produce of Fair Average Quality. If that price is lower than the MSP, the difference can be paid for the area that has been reported by the farmer on the portal and taking the average yield for the crop in the district. I think the Madhya Pradesh governments Bhavantar programme, despite the criticism it faced from some economists, was a good initiative. Today, the Food Corporation of India incurs a cost of Rs 700-800 per quintal in the process of paying Rs 1,600 as MSP to farmers. That can be avoided through direct payment of the price difference.PRASANTA SAHU: Following the implementation of PM-KISAN, should the government now use this scheme to replace fertiliser and other input subsidies to farmers?Income support and subsidies are two different things. PM-KISAN is the former. Subsidy was originally meant to promote the use of a particular input to ensure increase in productivity. When Dr C Rangarajan was the chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council (2009-2014), he asked me to find out the impact on the countrys food security and agriculture production if fertiliser subsidy was completely withdrawn and it was sold at market price. At that time, I calculated that if we do it suddenly in a knee-jerk manner, there will be 10% decline in foodgrain production. I look at PM-KISAN in a different way. It was brought in as some sort of income support, as crop prices remained low, and farmers in many places could not get the MSP. Subsidies are a different issue and they exist in many countries. We must try to make subsidies more efficient than they currently are. Subsidies in water and power are serious issues and must be addressed. Agricultural power subsidy for the country as a whole is about Rs 1 lakh crore. We did calculations to find how many irrigations a farmer would apply in case he is charged for power or if he is not charged anything. They will use 40% less irrigation on paddy alone if power is fully priced. Also in most cases, the yield will not fall.SANDEEP SINGH: Rural consumption is slowing down. The government had talked of doubling farmers income. Where are we on that?It is not proper to use agriculture and rural synonymously today. In rural India, only one-third of the income now comes from agriculture and two-third from non-agricultural activities. The last five years have been unique. For the first time in 65 to 70 years, we have had five consecutive years of less than average rainfall and the current one could even be the sixth. But Despite that, the annual growth rate of the value added in agriculture has been 2.9%, which is not bad. If growth rate becomes 5%, prices will crash and farmer incomes may decline by 30-40%. The slowdown in rural demand may be due to many reasons. One of it could be that loan waivers have reduced the flow of bank credit to rural areas. Industry people were happy when rural demand was good. But much of this demand was debt-based, with people taking loans to buy commodities. But families dont have internal income to buy resources. As far as agriculture is concerned, for doubling farmers income, you need it to rise by over 10% every year. In the last three years, the growth rate, according to my calculation, has been 6%. We can still achieve the target if we are able to do something to prices. If farmers get 10% more than what they are getting, the income elasticity with respect to price would be 1.6. Then, farmers incomes will increase by 16%.RAVISH TIWARI: How can we improve the current level of private and public investment in the agriculture sector?If you look at public investment in agriculture as percentage of the GDP, the latest available data for 2016-17 shows it at 2.35%. For most of the recent period, it was 3%. Almost 85% of public investment in agriculture comes from the states. The Centre invests about 15% and that includes investment on irrigation and agriculture technology. Within private investment, the bulk of it comes from farmers themselves. If investment has to go up, that should now come from the corporate sector, which is currently very low. That is why the Prime Minister said last week in Parliament that corporates should not only see investments in agriculture in terms of making and selling tractors. They should make investments in agriculture, including in backend extension and working directly with farmers. This government wants to create an enabling environment for corporates to invest in agriculture. That will also require making changes in the regulatory environment, particularly facilitating contract farming.RAVISH TIWARI: The private sector can invest in technology. But given the kind of protests against GM technology, how can the private sector be confident about investing?GM technology is not the only technology through which countries have made progress in agriculture. There is public sensitivity about GM technology. But the biggest damage was done when Jairam Ramesh (former environment minister) took the issue of whether GM technology should be adopted to the streets and not leaving it to be decided by an expert body. On GM crops, the NITI Aayogs stance has been  there should not be a blanket ban on the technology. It should not be encouraged in areas where we are able to get success through conventional means. The other thing that we emphasised was to finance public sector research in GM technology in a big way. This was mainly to allay the fears of people that private sector developers were charging hefty royalty. Some of our public sector research institutions were very close to developing a GM chickpea. Moreover, there are many more opportunities for the private sector other than GM. That includes GE or gene editing, which is different from modification (through introduction of alien genes).RAVISH TIWARI: Cattle trade rules enforced two years back disrupted the market. Do such rules help farmers or create trouble for them?AdvertisingThe livestock sector grew by more than 6% in the last five years. If there were so many problems, it would not have been growing so fast. On the other hand, the crop sector, particularly cereal, oilseeds and pulses, is growing at just around 1.15%. This is why the overall agricultural growth rate comes down to 2.9%. But on the whole, I would say that Indian agriculture has now reached a stage where more the intervention by government, the lower will be the growth. The more the sector is liberalised, the higher will be the growth rate."
2019-06-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-boy-named-narendra-damodardas-modi-5806838/,A boy named Narendra Damodardas Modi,"In the days following May 23, when the BJP returned to power riding on another Narendra Modi wave, came a breezy news from a village in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh: of a Muslim woman who had named her child  born on the day of the election results  Narendra Damodardas Modi.AdvertisingLess than a month later, sitting in her unplastered, two-storey house in Parsapur Mahraur village, Mehnaz Begum, 25, says she regrets naming her child that, and blames her journalist cousin for allegedly convincing her to pull off the fraud. The child, it now turns out, was born on May 12, not 23, as Mehnaz declared in an affidavit addressed to the district magistrate and submitted to Assistant Development Officer (Panchayat) Ghanshyam Pandey.Pandey confirms that he received Mehnazs affidavit with the childs name as Narendra Damodardas Modi and that he forwarded it to the DMs office.Humein kya pata tha ki itni aafat aa jayegi. Hum toh apne khala ke ladke ke behkawe mein aa gaye ( I had no idea it would become such a big issue. I fell for what my aunts son told me), Mehnaz says.AdvertisingShe alleges her first cousin, Mushtaq Ahmed, a journalist with Hindi daily Hindustan in Gonda, not just convinced her to name the child after Modi but also spread the word that the child was born on May 23. On May 25, Hindustans Lucknow edition carried a story on Mehnaz and baby Modi on page 12, with Ahmed sharing the byline with Bureau Chief Qamar Abbas.Mushtaq made me mug up a short speech and tell mediapersons that my son was born on May 23 and that I have decided to name him after the Prime Minister. I am illiterate and dont even know much about Narendra Modi, says Mehnaz as neighbours gather at her house.Denying the allegations and accusing Mehnaz of lying about the childs birthday, Mushtaq says on the phone: It was not my suggestion. She told me she would name her child Narendra Damodardas Modi and I agreed to write about it in the newspaper I work for. But I didnt know she had lied about the childs date of birth.Dr Ashutosh Shukla, Superintendent of the Community Health Centre at Wazirganj, 15 km from the village where Mehnaz delivered her child, confirmed that the boy was born on May 12. It was a normal delivery and Mehnaz was discharged from hospital on May 13, Shukla told The Sunday Express.K K Upadhyay, who was Editor, Hindustan (Lucknow), when the story was published, said, We got the story from the village and published it. The story is not false and the childs name remains the same. The story was verified and the mother later told all mediapersons what she told us. Her story was published in all newspapers the same day. Teervijay Singh, who has been appointed Editor, refused to comment, saying he would take charge only in July.Senior Reporter Qamar Abbas, who shared the byline with Mushtaq, said, After the whole thing got a lot of attention from the media, the woman may have been under pressure from her community. She probably fears that her child will be boycotted. Which explains why she is levelling these allegations against my colleague after 10-15 days.Mehnazs husband Mohd Mushtaq Ahmed works as a mason in Dubai and last came home in November 2018. He is angry with the whole controversy and has not sent me any money for June. He usually sends Rs 4,000 a month. Only when he comes again for Diwali this year will I be able to explain to him what happened. I hope he sends me money from next month. This house belongs to my father-in-law and I dont have any other source of income except for what my husband sends me every month, she says, wiping her tears and cradling the little Modi.He has had a cough and cold for a couple of weeks. I have to take him to the doctor every day and he charges me Rs 200 per visit, she adds.Mehnaz has two other children  Mantasiha Fatima, 7, and Zoya Fatima, 4.Saying no local politician or leader visited her and the child, Mehnaz adds, Only the media visited us, took photographs, interviewed us and left. They stopped visiting us after the issue about my sons date of birth came up, she says, asking the neighbours to leave her alone.After they have moved out, she says, Some people belonging to my community have boycotted us because they had issues with me naming the child after a Hindu leader. This Eid, very few people came home to eat sewai, whereas every year, we would be tired washing the dishes.Some people in the village have been saying that I will be sent to jail for lying. Now I am scared. If I go to jail, who will look after my children? she adds.Standing outside Mehnazs house are neighbours Deepak Singh, 28, and Mohd Shamsuddin, 27. She can name her child what she wants. Why should anyone have a problem? argues Shamsuddin, as Deepak nods.Sitting at a tea shop with others, Mehnazs father-in-law Mohd Idris, 61, blames his daughter-in-law and her cousin for the controversy. On May 22, she and Mushtaq were talking and planning something. I dont interfere much in her life. On May 24, Mushtaq wrote in the newspaper about her naming the child Narendra Modi. After that, several other media people came and interviewed us. When I asked Mehnaz about the childs name, she said she had discussed it with her husband, says Idris, dejected.Speaking on behalf of his mother who is the village pradhan, Riyaz Ahmed, 35, accuses Mehnaz of lying. She was told that if she names her child after Narendra Modi, the baby would be adopted by the government and would get benefits. Someone in the village let out to the media that the child was not born on May 23. After that, reporters went to the hospital and checked. No one has boycotted the family. She is saying that because she was caught lying, says Riyaz.At home, peeling potatoes for dinner with little Modi by her side, Mehnaz says she now wants to name the child Aftab Alam Mohd Modi, but needs help filing a revised affidavit.AdvertisingAnyway, at home, I simply call him Aftab, she says."

As potato productivity never materialised, promoters have to depend on neighbouring West Bengal, a major producer of potato.""But, the government is not allowing storage of outside potato and onion leading to losses, said Cold Storage Association Secretary Janardan Sahoo.The cold storage owners have eroded their capital base in the last 4 years due to huge capital investment, electricity tariff, high transportation cost, under utilisation of storage capacity and lack of warehouse receipt finance, he added.The units are on the verge of closure. All the promoters of cold storages have lost their hopes of revival, Sahoo said.The farmers who think that the units were going to provide them a safe landing for their produce and security to their earnings are also at stress.Each cold storage of 5,000 mt capacity provides direct and indirect employment to 300 individuals and could serve 10,000 farmers for storage of their produce.Neglecting this industry affects the livelihood of 10,300 farmer families in the catchment area and closure of these units will have a cascading effect on lives of around 4 lakh farmer families throughout the state."

She was inspired by her father who grew roses and hibiscus flowers. Attending a one-day gardening workshop about organic farming changed her life. Through Facebook, she met numerous friends from across the world who shared seeds with her.Adiga likes to puts her plants in paint drums rather than pots because they are more sustainable and dont get damaged during bad weather. She grows around eight varieties of sweet potatoes, 10 varieties of brinjal, and a few varieties of chilli, melons, turmeric, tomatoes and beans.My plants are like kids to me. Every morning, the first thing I do is just touch the plants and be with them; they can understand and I think they are very sensitive. I can see the number of harvest I get regularly. Every two-three days, I harvest because I am blessed by nature, Prathima says about her daily ritual with her plants.She is a part of a composter group whose main intention is in composting the garbage. If people can start composting and growing their own food, it will make a lot of difference. She recycles her kitchen waste in a khamba, which is a composter. When asked about how people can be more conscious about the diminishing green cover, Prathima says, Lately, people have started realising the value of trees and plants. I request each and everyone to not chop them off as they are a gift from nature. Start growing trees on your own terraces.Like Prathima says, our motivation should be, start growing what you eat and eat what you grow."

The liberal use of quinoa, and vegetables like lotus stems and sweet potatoes to recreate common dishes have paid off richly. The food is not only light and nutritious, but agrees with the taste buds too. One of the unique features of the menu is that they use jackfruit flour instead of the regular all-purpose flour and wheat flour. Jackfruit seed flour is packed with nutrients and is gluten free. So, if you are having Chicken Momos there, you will notice that the dough covering, made from jackfruit flour and root starches, is thicker and has more texture. It is served with an amazing spinach and garlic dip. The Shakarkandi Tarbooz Salad turned out to be a meal in itself.The dish has roasted sweet potato cubes drenched in a citrus dressing, juicy water melon pieces and a handful of pumpkin seeds. The Jhalmuri Salad is the ideal snack mixture which you can gobble up without counting the calories. The mixture has puffed quinoa, makhana, peanuts, onion, tomato and coriander coming together in a citrus dressing. The papdis in the Tri-grain Papdi Chaat Medley, which are made of kuttu, jowar and bajra, were crispier and denser than the normal ones. The Spicy Sprout Filled Golgappas, which came with pomegranate, pineapple and mint water, touched the right spicy and sweet notes.In the main course, Kathal Quinoa Biryani and Six Grain Paranthas were served with Chicken Chettinad curry. In this city of Biryanis, the quinoa Biryani might take some time to find fans. However, the paranthas, made from whole wheat, gram, soyabean, oats and ragi, were delicious and had zero oil. The Chettinad curry was flavourful without being too spicy.Apart from a wide range of creatively done dishes, they have an impressive number of beverages. Their Kokum Coconut coolant is a treat for coconut lovers. The restaurant, which also offers cold coffees and vegan shakes, has a kids menu too. The dessert section has Caramelised Banana Cake, Fruit Payasam and others. The Fruit Payasam seems to be inspired by Elaneer Payasam, with tender coconut being replaced by fresh fruits. They also have two varieties of artisan ice cream  Berry Ice Cream and Coconut Caramel Ice Cream.The interiors of the restaurant is earthy and full of light.

The charred essence unravels with each bite into the meat and you wonder how the chef managed to surprise you with this all-too-familiar starter.As you pack your plate with the first helping and choose a table, you will be served the welcome drink in a clay cup which no prizes for guessing what it is: A thick, creamy lassi. It is ever so slightly sweet and sprinkled with the goodness of turmeric and saffron. Nothing screams the robust, bold relish of Punjabi cuisine like sarsoon da saag and makki di roti. To say that Punjabis would steal for this combination would not be an overstatement but at most food festivals it's a rarity.The fact that chef Saurabh and his team managed to include the saag on the menu during the off-season and more than a thousand kilometres from where it is grown is in itself a remarkable feat. And at the festival, the dish has been rightfully given centre stage. A separate counter dishing out the tangy sour saag with a hearty makki di roti is what food dreams are made of.At the main course station, vegetarian dishes outnumber the non-vegetarian ones. ""It is not hard to find well made non-vegetarian food in Kerala but the real challenge lies in curating a rewarding vegetarian spread. We have taken special care in sourcing our spices and designing recipes so that diners don't feel they have had a better version elsewhere,"" says chef Saurabh.Sample the Amritsari chole, an aromatic chickpea curry infused with cilantro and herbs with tandoori roti served piping hot to the table. Or order the Amritsari kulcha, the uber authentic Punjabi bread which once broken reveals a generous stuffing of mashed potatoes garnished with coriander seeds. The kulcha goes particularly well with butter chicken which is not offputtingly sweet as has become the norm at most food joints. Chef Saurabh says that a genuine version of butter chicken is zestfully spicy and never sweet.""The butter chicken you will taste is spicy and chatpata, this is the original taste of the dish found in the bylanes of Ludhiana or Jalandhar,"" the chef adds. You can wrap up the meal by parking yourself at the dessert counter and struggling to decide what to choose from an array of kulfis, ladoos, gulab janum and other traditional sweets. The tille wali kulfi made with rabri is a winner. The cloud-like phrini, rice powder slow cooked in milk is perfect for someone looking for a light finish. Four Points by Sheraton's all-day dining restaurant, The Eatery, is hosting a Punjabi food festival, The Dhaba Connection, until July 14 Curated by executive chef Saurabh Singh, the festival promises to offer ample taste of the rich cuisine"

2019-07-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/a-fuel-shortage-is-crippling-agriculture-in-venezuela-5819156/,A fuel shortage is crippling agriculture in Venezuela,"Written by Anatoly Kurmanaev and Isayen HerreraAdvertisingIn Venezuela, where hunger is rampant, a farmer recently had to abandon his entire crop. Guiding a pair of oxen, he drew a wooden plow over his field, turning over thousands of shriveled carrots.The trucks that would pick up his harvest never came, he said.A fuel shortage has been gripping the country since May, bringing the nations already struggling agriculture industry to the brink of collapse and threatening more hunger and malnutrition in a nation where nearly half the population is eating fewer than three meals a day.AdvertisingIts all lost, the farmer, Joandry Santiago, said, pointing to the spoiled vegetables that cost him months of wasted labor.Venezuela is an oil-rich nation. But years of mismanagement and corruption in the oil industry, worsened by U.S. sanctions, have dried up gasoline pumps at a crucial moment. First, the shortage prevented farmers like Santiago from getting their produce to markets. Now, it is making it hard for them to sow new crops.The New York Times interviewed dozens of Venezuelan farmers. Nearly all have slashed their planting area this year and some are leaving their fields fallow  steps that are likely to deplete what is left of the food supply and lead even more Venezuelans to join the estimated 4 million who have fled the country.The lack of fuel is the last straw after six years of economic crisis under President Nicols Maduro, whose policies of price controls, expropriations and state-sanctioned embezzlement have wiped out the countrys private sector. His repression of political opponents and Socialist rhetoric have drawn the ire of the Trump administration, which has imposed crippling sanctions on top officials and key economic sectors.The farmers said they have tried to produce despite scarce inputs, price controls, crime, inflation and collapsing demand.Santiagos municipality of Pueblo Llano, in the Andes Mountains of western Venezuela, has accounted for about 60% of all the potato and carrot production in Venezuela. But this years harvest is only half of 2018s because of the gasoline shortage and other problems such as lack of seeds and fertilizer, according to the local farmers cooperative, La Trinidad.Pueblo Llanos downfall is repeated across the sector. In Venezuelas vast plains farther east, sugar cane rots just yards from a refining mill and rice fields are left barren for the first time in 70 years because farmers dont have fuel to transport their produce to distribution centers or seeds and fertilizers to plant new crops.Venezuelas main agricultural association, Fedeagro, estimates the area planted with the countrys main crops, corn and rice, will shrink about 50% this year. And the sugar output in the main producing state of Portuguesa is down to 5 million tons this year from 12 million in 2018, according to the local sugar cane growing association.The collapse is exponential, said Fedeagro President Aquiles Hopkins. The only possible explanation is that the government simply doesnt care.Maduro has responded to the agricultural crisis by promising $35 million in new farming credits in May  a program Fedeagro says is pitifully small and benefits only producers close to the government.Gasoline shortages in the country with the worlds largest oil reserves are only the latest manifestation of a collapse of services under Maduro, which has left millions without reliable supplies of electricity, water and cooking gas.When a fuel import crunch coincided with refinery outages in mid-May, the country plunged into chaos. At least two people died waiting in the gasoline lines that followed.Fuel supply has improved in most major cities since but remains scant in the western half of Venezuela, which accounts for the majority of food production. In the states of Tachira and Mrida, which grow most of the countrys vegetables, residents are limited to 8 gallons of gasoline a month.On a visit to Pueblo Llano last month, 150 cars waited outside the closed gas station for the sixth straight day. Many of the drivers slept in their cars to prevent robberies, braving the frigid weather at an altitude of 7,500 feet. During the day, they walked backed to their farmsteads, a trip that in some cases took hours.While Im sitting here in line, my produce is rotting in the fields, farmer Richard Rondn said as he gave away summer squash as long as his arm from the back of his pickup truck to people passing by. I got nothing to harvest with.The collapse of national food production will be nearly impossible to replace with food from abroad, economists say.Venezuelan imports per capita in April fell to the lowest level since the 1950s, as the country ran out of hard currency amid a worsening economic crisis and the tightening of U.S. sanctions, according to Torino Capital, a brokerage firm. The countrys imports totaled just $303 million in April, down 92% from the same month in 2012.With this level of imports and given the destruction of Venezuelas agricultural sector, it will be very difficult to avoid a significant deterioration in the availability of food, said Francisco Rodrguez, Torino Capitals chief economist.The fuel crunch came at a time when many Venezuelans were already going hungry. In December, the month before America imposed its toughest sanctions, only 55% of Venezuelans ate three meals a day, according to Delphos, a local pollster.The impact of gas shortages in the fields is already felt in the cities. The price of carrots, potatoes and plantains has more than doubled in Caracas main wholesale food market in the past month, overshooting even the countrys runaway inflation rate  estimated at about 26% a month  according to market traders.A 120-pound sack of potatoes now costs five times the Venezuelan monthly minimum wage. Faced with skyrocketing food costs, the majority of Venezuelans have been reducing their consumption of vegetables in favor of less nutritious foods like pasta, rice and processed corn, which many get in the governments subsidized food boxes.Only a third of Venezuelan households bought vegetables other than cheap local root plants on weekly basis in 2017, according to the latest figures from annual nutritional survey co-written by Fundacin Bengoa, a local nonprofit. Consumption of vegetables and other nutrient-rich foods has slid further since, contributing to the hidden hunger of Venezuelans, according to Maritza Landaeta, a researcher with the organization.It cant be possible that the country is going without food and here we are with 6,000 hectares of vegetables, paralyzed, said the head of Pueblo Llanos La Trinidad cooperative, Augusto Alarcn. The area is equivalent to 15,000 acres.Soaring vegetable prices for city dwellers are not benefiting the producers, but only reflect the soaring logistical costs.The expense of transporting potatoes from Pueblo Llano to Caracas has tripled in the past few months, said Oswaldo Garca, one of the last surviving vegetable wholesalers in the region. While car fuel at the pump in Venezuela is nearly free, shortages force logistics companies to make up the shortfall on the black market, where a gallon of gasoline costs up to $6.50, or nearly three times the average price in the United States.Two years ago, Garca operated a fleet of 70 trucks which shuttled 120 types of fresh vegetables across the country. Today, he has 15 trucks left.To deal with the gasoline shortages, some food transporters have been switching to trucks powered by diesel, which has been better supplied. Gasoline, however, remains a crucial part of the farming chain of production, from the transportation and feeding of workers, to the operation of pumps and the sourcing machinery parts.The shortage has hamstrung the time-sensitive rice and corn harvest in Portuguesa state. In May, it prevented farmers from planting a new crop before the rainy season.When its time to harvest again in four months, we will see the full cost of this shortage, said Victor Snchez, a farmer from the Portuguesa town of Turn.His neighbor, Roberto Latini, came to Turn as a boy with his father from Italy in 1956, attracted like hundreds of his compatriots by the offer of free land in a model farming colony built by Marcos Prez Jimnez, the countrys military ruler.Last month, Latini left all his fields fallow for the first time.AdvertisingThis decision has changed my life  it brings fear, anguish, said Latini, who relies entirely on farming and only has enough savings to survive until the next planting season."

The assistance will be to the tune of Rs 20,000 per hectare under TOP scheme of the Centre.The scheme will be piloted in Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts with a cluster approach in the Rabi season to encourage farmers to take up tomato farming in a commercial scale, said sources in the Horticulture Directorate.Tribal-dominated Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj have been selected for Government intervention as these two districts are the top producers of tomato due to suitable soil and prolonged cold climatic conditions during winter. However, farmers, mostly tribals, failed to recover the cost due to lack of storage facility and proper marketing linkage.With the bumper harvest of tomato last year but lack of demand, farmers of Keonjhar resorted to dumping the highly perishable vegetable on roads to register their protest against Government apathy towards their interest.Though the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has operationalised Operation Green, a scheme to stabilise the price of tomato, onion and potato, from last year, Odisha has not taken advantage of it.The scheme, if properly implemented, will lead to enhancement in income of farmers growing tomato, onion and potato, capacity building of farmer producer organisations (FPOs), reduction in post-harvest losses, creation of processing infrastructure, provision of agri-logistics for supply chain and reduction in price volatility of TOP for consumers, the sources added.The State has identified five districts for the development of agro-processing clusters of fruits and vegetables under the Centrally-sponsored Kisan Sampad Yojana (KSY). Apart from Keonjhar and Mayurbhnaj, the three other districts which are major producer of tomato and other vegetables are Balangir, Ganjam and Sundargarh. Balangir is one of the major producers of onion in western Odisha."

Walmart currently sources fruits and vegetables mainly from mandis and the move to bolster direct sourcing comes against the backdrop of Walmart Foundation committing around Rs 180 crore for farmers over the next five years.""Currently, our major focus is on hardy vegetables such as potatoes, onions, garlic and on some other vegetables with slightly longer shelf life compared to greens. This is because in this category, we can have a supply chain advantage rather than just source from mandis. The major focus is on building a supply chain for vegetables. The centres that we plan to open in North India to enable us to directly source from farmers will be outsourced, as it's a pilot project that will help us understand the whole game plan,"" said Krish Iyer, president & CEO of Walmart India.In 2018, Walmart had announced that its Indian arm will grow its direct sourcing from farmers to 25% of the produce sold in its wholesale stores over a five-year period. But apart from focusing on fresh fruits and vegetables, Walmart India is also accelerating its store openings. The company opened its 25th store in Indore, MP, earlier this month.""It takes about three to four years to open a store. The initial period was more about rebuilding the team, revisiting the processes and the basics, and then starting to rebuild the pipeline. We got some experts back into the country to start the process. We are in a growth phase and we are investing for growth,"" said Iyer."

After widespread raids last year, the civic body had held workshops for pani-puri vendors in the city. Recently too, it had held a workshop for street food vendors in the city.But the drive on Wednesday, led the food safety officials to 25 establishments and houses where material for the dish was being made in an unhygienic manner.The civic body destroyed 160kg of material that was to be used for making the dish and was unhygienic. This included rotten potatoes, gram, puris, chutney, spiced water and other material.The drive was conducted in the Khodiyarnagar and Ganeshnagar localities in Sama as well as Khodiyarnagar on the New VIP Road.Sources said that the conditions in which the material was being made were also unhygienic and the environment in general of these localities was unhealthy. Nine persons were issued notices to ensure that they maintained hygiene and samples of the material were also collected for analysis."

But now, theres again a kind of hush: Don is back.The Dalma authorities have issued an alert that the temperamental tusker, known to attack humans, is back at the 192sqkm wildlife sanctuary around 30km from here.Don, who lost one of his tusks after a bloody fight with another elephant over a decade ago, has returned to Dalma after more than three years. He had overstayed in neighbouring Bengal after the annual migration. Foresters recently spotted Don near Bota, the largest jungle inside the sanctuary.Don at the elephant reserve on Tuesday Picture by Animesh SenguptaWith the holy month of Shravan beginning on July 17 and the Shiv temple atop the hills set to witness rush of the faithful, the authorities are not taking any risks.Devotees should take extra precaution and stay away from the elephant. We will shortly fix posters of the tusker at prominent spots across the sanctuary, said CMP Sinha, the Dalma divisional forest officer (DFO).The alert will remain in place till the jumbo was at the sanctuary, he added.Hundreds of devotees visit Dalmas Shiv temple, especially on Mondays in the month of Shravan. They return the same day after offering water to the god. The devotees generally take two routes to reach the temple. One is from the main entry point at Makulakocha village, while the other leads uphill from Fadlugora along National Highway 33.Visitors love clicking pictures of elephants. It is very difficult to predict the mood of elephants and Don is prone to losing his temper, Sinha said.It is always advisable to maintain a distance from elephants. Depending upon their mood, elephants may attack visitors, he added.Don is not part of any herd, said another forest officer: He is a loner who has a habit of attacking and chasing visitors. The elephant had even chased a forest patrol team some four years back.Two families from Jamshedpur had a close shave in July 2010 when Don took a liking to their hatchback and played with it for half an hour near the Pinderbera forest guesthouse before abandoning the car near a drain. Foresters saved the families.In 2014, Don had begun frequenting the Shiv temple and accepting bananas and jaggery from the priests, but a year later the pachyderm went berserk at a potato and tomato farm at Gerua village, barely 35km from Jamshedpur, devouring veggies and chasing away local residents who tried to drive him away."

We love you, take care Hayabusa2, the musician told the team.At about the size of a large refrigerator and equipped with solar panels to keep it powered, Hayabusa2 is the successor to JAXAs first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa -- Japanese for falcon.That probe returned with dust samples from a smaller, potato-shaped asteroid in 2010, despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year odyssey and was hailed as a scientific triumph.Hayabusa2s photos of Ryugu, which means Dragon Palace in Japanese and refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient Japanese tale, show the asteroid has a rough surface full of boulders.The Hayabusa2 mission was launched in December 2014, and has a price tag of around 30 billion yen ($270 million).It has already made history, including with the creation of the crater on Ryugus surface.In 2005, NASAs Deep Impact project succeeded in creating an artificial crater on a comet but only for observation purposes.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

We will shortly fix posters of the tusker at prominent spots across the sanctuary, said CMP Sinha, the Dalma divisional forest officer (DFO).The alert will remain in place till the jumbo was at the sanctuary, he added.Hundreds of devotees visit Dalmas Shiv temple, especially on Mondays in the month of Shravan. They return the same day after offering water to the god. The devotees generally take two routes to reach the temple. One is from the main entry point at Makulakocha village, while the other leads uphill from Fadlugora along National Highway 33.Visitors love clicking pictures of elephants. It is very difficult to predict the mood of elephants and Don is prone to losing his temper, Sinha said.It is always advisable to maintain a distance from elephants. Depending upon their mood, elephants may attack visitors, he added.Don is not part of any herd, said another forest officer: He is a loner who has a habit of attacking and chasing visitors. The elephant had even chased a forest patrol team some four years back.Two families from Jamshedpur had a close shave in July 2010 when Don took a liking to their hatchback and played with it for half an hour near the Pinderbera forest guesthouse before abandoning the car near a drain. Foresters saved the families.In 2014, Don had begun frequenting the Shiv temple and accepting bananas and jaggery from the priests, but a year later the pachyderm went berserk at a potato and tomato farm at Gerua village, barely 35km from Jamshedpur, devouring veggies and chasing away local residents who tried to drive him away."

Some harvested, some did not. The land lied untilled for almost a decade. It's their (farmers') right. During 2018-19, around 792 farmers harvested land. But now, that number is getting decreased. Many are selling off their lands at high price,"" she said.Ten years ago, Tata Motors had built a factory for the world's cheapest car, Nano, at Singur, but the project was abandoned and shifted to Gujarat following a massive agitation by the farmers, led by Banerjee and her party.The project was moved to the western state on the invitation of the then chief minister Narendra Modi.In 2016, the Supreme Court had quashed the Left Front-led West Bengal government's acquisition of 997.11 acres of agricultural land for the Tata Motors plant and ordered its return to the farmers.Though the Banerjee-led TMC government returned the land to the farmers in November 2016, three years later, only 30 per cent of the land could be made cultivable as the plots on which the concrete structures had come up remained barren.To a question by CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty on crops harvested in Singur during 2017-18, Agriculture Minister Asish Banerjee said paddy, wheat, potato and maize were produced in a total of 1,920 bigha (640 acre) land, which falls within the land returned by the state government.After his reply, Banerjee stood up and said that it depends on the farmers what they would do with their land. Our government has helped the farmers in all possible ways and while giving back their portion of the land, we had given them a grant of Rs 10,000 also.Of the 997.11 acre of land in Singur, around 955 acre was returned after the Supreme Court verdict and owners of 41.21 acre were not found, she said. Both farming and industry are taking place in Singur, Banerjee said, without elaborating it.Meanwhile, the chief minister also informed the House that the state government has decided to fill up 33,687 vacant posts in various categories soon."
2019-07-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/this-chennai-restaurant-is-merging-cuisines/article28354106.ece,This Chennai restaurant is merging cuisines,"Its like stepping back into 2017. Everything looks the same: from the quirky portraits of historical figures (look for the one of Emperor Shah Jahan playing golf) to the painted and upholstered furniture, and indoor cabannas with silken drapes. Walking into the soon-to-be-launched Desi Di in Poes Garden feels exactly like walking into the Desi Di premises of Perambur just a few years ago.We kept all the [decor] pieces and furniture from that restaurant to use in this one, grins Chef Aaron Coutinho, back in Chennai after a recent stint in Hyderabad. The chef, who also has some experience under Mumbai-based The Bombay Canteen under his belt, is proud of how much of Desi Di he has managed to keep consistent despite the long pause, and also of the things he has changed.I want this to be a space where people have conversations about food, he says over plates of banana leaf wrapped tawa fish fry and and bhutta (corn) kebab made two ways. To demonstrate his point, he gestures to the fish  soft, pungent with a hint of mustard, but otherwise very familiarly Chennai. This week, we are using an Indian version of puffer fish for this dish. I chanced upon it at the market this afternoon, in a batch of small fishing boats that had just come in. The catch contained many local varieties that arent well-known, and dont sell much. But that is the kind of fish I want to serve my guests, and explain where it comes from, why they should try it.Inspired by IndiaThe mustard in this marination is an idea Aaron borrowed from Bengal. Other dishes are nods to other parts of the country, like the chicken tikka khakhra, which comprises meaty little chunks sprinkled like pizza toppings on a sturdy khakhra. And then there are the two-way corn kebabs: an oh-so-soft potato chikki; and sliced cobs marinated in spicy tandoori masala and, well, tandoored. It is corn this week; well change it to some other seasonal vegetable next week. Brinjal has a lot of scope, says Aaron.He calls it adaptive Indian cuisine  taking flavours from around India and adapting them to the local region. I either give familiar dishes and ingredients a different recipe, or take something hyperlocal yet lesser known and give it a typical Chennai preparation.Its clear that the chef had his fun when coming up with creations. Take, for example, his Naga chicken curry that is served with dosa. Not the dosa you get when you pour batter on a pan, but what you get when you pour the same batter into a waffle maker. This thick, soft dosa waffles are surprisingly just right for dipping into the thick, rich onion-laced gravy and munching along with soft chunks of boneless meat. But the sugarcane chicken kebabs, on the other hand, are just a game of mix and match. The tikkas themselves are just regular seekhs, if a tad too garlic-heavy, but each is skewered on a sugarcane stick instead of a regular one. So you finish your meat and then chew on the skewer too.But Aaron isnt just creative with the big stuff: a large part of his seasonal and local plan is focused on the chutneys, dips and sides. I wanted diners to see that the vegetables we used to hate as children, actually can be a lot of fun, he says. So the sugarcane chicken kebab is served on a bed of shredded gongurra salad, sweetened with oodles of honey and made crunchy with crushed peanuts. The mutton boti kebab comes with a smooth turnip relish fit to replace all mayonnaise dips from dining tables. And at the centre of the chicken khakhra sits a dollop of ridge gourd chutney, which looks exactly like its mint version, but tastes greener. As if plucked fresh from a garden and crushed then and there.Desi Di  Indian Restaurant on Kasturi Rangan Avenue, Poes Garden will be open to the public from July 13 onwards.

Kumaraswamy chaired a State Cabinet meeting on Thursday and took some significant decisions, including constitution of a commission for increasing reservation for Scheduled Tribes and financial incentives for potato and millet farmers for increasing crop areas.The Cabinet has decided to set up a commission to study the demand for increasing quota for STs from the present 3% in jobs and education. The decision was taken following a long-pending demand by the community leaders in the State.The Cabinet also took two decisions that will provide incentives to the farming community. With the potato crop area declining over the past few years, the Cabinet will give incentive of 15,000 a hectare for potato-growing farmers. But, the incentive was limited to maximum two hectares.Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Krishna Byre Gowda said 7,500 per hectare would be given to purchase seeds and another 7,500 for nutrition and plant protection measures per acre. A sum of 25.5 crore has been set aside for this. The crop is being cultivated in districts including Hassan, Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural, Chickballapur, and Kolar.It was decided to sanction 10 crore for increasing the area under minor millets cultivation. An incentive of 10,000 per hectare would be given to each farmer, fixing the maximum limit to two hectares.It was decided that 375 crore would be allocated for modernisation of the right bank canal of Upper Krishna Project under stage II. Works would be taken up from a distance of 0-95 km of the canal. Total estimated cost of the work is 750 crore. The Cabinet will enhance the annual untied development grant to zilla panchayats from 4 crore to 8 crore depending on the population and geographical criteria. However, all zilla panchayats will get minimum 4 crore.The aid for taluk panchayats has been hiked from 1 crore to 3 crore depending on the population and geographical area, while the minimum amount has been fixed at 2 crore per year, from the next fiscal, Mr. Gowda said.An allocation of 29 crore was made for providing 90% subsidy under drip irrigation. The Cabinet will set up horticultural colleges in Alamela in Vijayapura and Somanahalli in Hassan district. A sum of 26 crore has been set aside for a guest house at Tirumala in Tirupathi for pilgrims."
2019-07-11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japans-hayabusa2-probe-makes-touchdown-on-asteroid/article28391865.ece,Japan’s Hayabusa2 probe makes touchdown on asteroid,"Japans Hayabusa2 probe made a perfect touchdown on Thursday on a distant asteroid, collecting samples from beneath the surface in an unprecedented mission that could shed light on the origins of the solar system.Weve collected a part of the solar systems history, project manager Yuichi Tsuda said at a jubilant press conference hours after the successful landing was confirmed.We have never gathered sub-surface material from a celestial body further away than the moon, he added.We did it and we succeeded in a world first.Confirmation of the landing came only after Hayabusa2 lifted back up from the asteroid and resumed communications with the control room. Research director Takashi Kubota told reporters that the touchdown operation was more than perfect. And Mr. Tsuda, with a grin, said he rated it 1000 points out of 100.Preparation laudedThe probe moved perfectly and the teams preparation work was perfect, he said.The brief landing on Thursday is the second time Hayabusa2 has touched down on the desolate asteroid Ryugu, some 300 million kilometres from Earth.Ryugu, which means Dragon Palace in Japanese, refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient Japanese tale.The complex multi-year Hayabusa2 mission has also involved sending rovers and robots down to the surface.Thursdays touchdown was intended to collect pristine materials from beneath the surface of the asteroid that could provide insights into what the solar system was like at its birth, some 4.6 billion years ago.To get at those crucial materials, in April an impactor was fired from Hayabusa2 towards Ryugu in a risky process that created a crater on the asteroids surface and stirred up material that had not previously been exposed to the atmosphere.Hayabusa2s first touchdown was in February, when it landed briefly on Ryugu and fired a bullet into the surface to puff up dust for collection, before blasting back to its holding position.The second touchdown required special preparations because any problems could mean the probe would lose the precious materials already gathered during its first landing. A photo of the crater taken by Hayabusa2s camera after the April blast showed that parts of the asteroids surface are covered with materials that are obviously different from the rest of the surface, mission manager Makoto Yoshikawa told reporters before the latest touchdown.Scientists are hoping the probe will have collected unidentified materials believed to be ejecta from the blast after landing briefly in an area some 20 metres away from the centre of the crater.It would be safe to say that extremely attractive materials are near the crater, Mr. Tsuda said.The touchdown is the last major part of Hayabusa2s mission, and when the probe returns to Earth next year to drop off its samples, scientists hope to learn more about the history of the solar system and even the origin of life on Earth.Musical tributeThe Hayabusa2 mission has attracted international attention, with Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May sending a video to the probes team ahead of the landing.The world is watching. We love you, take care Hayabusa2, the musician told the team.Hayabusa2 is the successor to JAXAs first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa  Japanese for falcon  that returned with dust samples from a smaller, potato-shaped asteroid in 2010. It was hailed as a scientific triumph despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year odyssey.The Hayabusa2 mission was launched in December 2014, and has a price tag of around $270 million."

We made all arrangements for agriculture there. Compared to the past, in 2018-19, farming reduced there. Whether they will farm or not is their business. I cannot intervene there. But we have been extending all assistance to farming, Mamata said.She informed the House that of the 955.9 acres handed over to farmers in Singur since the August 2016 Supreme Court verdict to return the land, 640 acres were under cultivation in 2017-18 and 260 acres  by 792 farmers  in 2018-19.Chakraborty had asked agriculture minister Ashis Banerjee what crops had been cultivated on the Singur land in 2017-18 and the total price of the produce. The agriculture minister, without replying to the part of the question on the price, said a total of 1,920 bighas (around 640 acres) had been under cultivation in 2017-18 and crops such as paddy, jute, corn, sesame, potato and pulses were being produced.Taking over from Ashis Banerjee, Mamata said the agricultural produce from the Singur land had fetched Rs 2 crore in 2018-19.Both are happening in Singur, industry and agriculture, Mamata said, without elaborating, adding there were 13,330 unwilling land-losers, with claim over 293.6 acres, and 9,373 willing land-losers, with claim over 702.51 acres. The unwilling farmers were those from whom the then Left government had acquired land forcibly for the Tata Nano project.Since the question was asked in the House, the government had to furnish facts and figures.The anti-land acquisition movements in Singur and Nandigram had propelled Mamata to power in 2011.After the return of the land, we got the soil tested and gave fertilisers and seeds worth Rs 10,000 to each (farmer). Some have been farming there, some have not. Those farming, the government is helping them, Mamata told the Assembly.The return of the land began in 2016. It had been left unused for 10 years. A lot of people who were initially farming, some of them are not showing interest. Some are getting good price for the land and are selling it. What can I do if they sell it? My commitment, I have fulfilled, the chief minister added.Chakraborty later said Mamatas statements had vindicated the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments stand on the Singur issue and allegedly exposed the Trinamul dispensations lies on the resumption of agriculture on the land.Summing up the Lefts inference of Mamatas statement in the House, Chakraborty said it was an admission of the Singur blunder by the chief minister.She admitted the worst fears of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government regarding Singur. Neither did industry take off in Singur, nor could agriculture resume there, said the CPM central committee member.Her movement not only ruined the hopes of industrial regeneration of the rest of the state, but also ended up ruining Singur, Chakraborty added.Locket Chatterjee, the BJP MP from Hooghly in whose constituency Singur falls, said the chief ministers comments had proved that she had belatedly woken up to the reality.She has realised late, but so many people suffered because of that for over a decade. The fact is, the people of Singur want industry and thats why I have given this call for industry in Singur, Chatterjee said."

Following this, the cabinet has authorised the CM to constitute a commission to look into the demand.The cabinet also decided to withdraw the Act passed by both Houses of the legislature on trifurcation of the BBMP which is pending before the Union Government.Krishna Byre Gowda said the Centre has not given its nod to the Act for the past four years and hence the state cannot discuss other options.

The RKVY assistance are given to farmers for revival of betel and mushroom farming, intensification of potato and onion cultivation, production and preservation, cluster frontline demonstration on production technology, production of certified and registered seed, post-harvest management and marketing of agri products and sustainable alternative to tobacco cultivation.The Chief Secretary asked the nodal agencies to ensure that the sanctioned projects are completed during the current financial year and utilisation certificates submitted in time.The state government has made a budgetary provision of Rs 343.67 crore under RKVY for the current fiscal. As it is a centrally sponsored scheme, the cost of the projects are shared on 60:40 by the Centre and State. Odisha has so far sanctioned 749 projects under RKVY since its implementation in 2007-08.Of the sanctioned projects, 496 have been completed and the remaining 253 are under different stages of implementation."

At the grand feast organised at Whisky Bar - Radisson Blu, Palace Road, recently, the team took diners on a culinary journey through storytelling with the help of a specially-curated menu and carefully-chosen Paul John Single Malt whiskeys.Partnering with the Indian brand proved to be a sensorial experience for the guests as chefs served every course along with a designated drink. We were told to take a neat sip of the first drink, Brilliance, to absorb the flavour and understand what is to be expected as its pairing.We started off smooth with Camembert cheese along with corn dust sprinkled all over. As the next dish came up, we added a few drops of water to our drink and started settling in to get in the flow. Apple Dew with Carraway sounds like an exotic dish, but in reality, it was simple. For a crunchy twist, we were served Potato Nest with Wilted Onions, which were cylindrical in nature, with an outer coating resembling a mesh of twigs. The Bengali in us relished the mashed potato filling. To put the Brilliance course to rest, we had Obulato with chicken pepperoni. It had the look of a pizza, but the base was replaced with edible sheets made from potato starch, soy lecithen and sunflower oil.The next Paul John drink was Edited, which felt a little stronger than the previous one, and we were told to take a few drops of it on our palm and rub it together. Surprisingly, we got a leather-like smell, which indicates the goodness of the whiskey. Presentation of the Edamame, white asparagus and false custard took our breath away. For a grassy whiff with the drink, the next item  Ragi waffle/housemade cheese/cured yolk and crab  was DIY time for which we took a waffle, spread it with cheese and sprinkled it with yolk and soft crab meat, both grated smoothly. Some of us asked for a second helping of this one.Moving on to our next drink, Paul Johns Bold is peated whiskey with 46 per cent ABV, in other words, it heightened our senses a little too much. To add spice to our palate, we were served Toddy Coral, Shrimps and Scallop. Looking like a collective element straight out of the beach, its unique flavour paired really well with the drink. For meat lovers, chefs brought over smoked beef or chicken and vegetarians had their share of smoked celeriac.Nirvana  the last Paul John drink for the night  was smooth and perfect to put us in a state of peace. Accompanying this was Brown Butter ice cream with Araguani Barley, fruit cake pops and honey. We ended the night with succulent crumiel and cherry leather, and explored modern cooking techniques through the lore."

This is expected to benefit over 10,000 farmers in the district. Of the amount, 7,500 is towards subsidy on purchase of seed potatoes and 7,200 towards medicines.Potato is one among the short-term cash crop for growers in Hassan. There were years when farmers would grow the crop in 40,000 acres. In recent years, following a dip in rainfall and late blight attack, cultivation has come down drastically. Last year, over 13,000 acres of land were covered by potato. However, this year it is only 8,600 acres.The government has thought of support price to encourage farmers to take up potato cultivation. D. Manjunath, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu that around 10,400 farmers have submitted applications seeking the support price. The amount will be released based on inspection. Farmers should have the crop on their field, besides receipts of purchase of seed potatoes and medicines, he said. The officer has also appealed to farmers to spray medicines to avoid late blight on the crop."

The notice, which The Hindu has viewed, was issued by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority on June 17. The company has been given three months to respond.We are studying the notice and will be responding to it appropriately, a PepsiCo spokesperson told The Hindu.According to sources the application to revoke PepsiCos registration argues that the firm violated Section 39 (1) (iv) clause of the PPV&FRA [the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001] when it sued the Gujarat potato farmers.Also Read Now, PepsiCo offers to settle case against Gujarat potato farmersThe application reportedly evokes Section 34 (f) of the Act which allows the registration to be revoked on the grounds that the breeder has not complied with the provisions of this Act or rules or regulations made thereunder. The application also reportedly points out omissions from PepsiCos original application for registration, which would be grounds for revocation under Section 34 (c).This move comes in the aftermath of PepsiCos legal action in April against at least nine potato farmers from Gujarat, who were sued for over 1 crore each for growing the potato variety registered by the company in 2016.Also Read Gujarat govt. to back potato farmers in PepsiCo fightFollowing public outrage, boycott threats and intervention by the Gujarat government, the company withdrew its cases in May.Farmers groups have also come together to prevent any future cases against farmers.

And always figuring on top of the list is 'travel around the world'. While a very few cross it off the list eventually, the idea is as far-fetched as the existence of a unicorn for many others. Determined to take its guests on an unforgettable trip around the world, ABAD Atrium's Cafe Royale at M G Road, Kochi, is organising 'Steaks n' Grills' buffet festival featuring over 25 international dishes.Upon entering the cafe, the ambience - replete with country jazz music lingering in the air and servers who look like they are straight from the wild west period - beckons one on a passport-less journey to pamper taste buds and tickle palates. The buffet dinner features 10 soups over the course of the festival. One of the customer-favourites is the laksa lemak. ""It is an Indonesian curry soup with coconut, shrimp and chicken,"" says Anand K S, executive chef. Complimenting the downpour outside the cafe, the soup epitomises richness especially with the taste of coconut.Next on the menu is the curated array of steaks and grills including the jerk grilled fish, Mediterranean grilled seafood, tawa grilled chicken and Korean bulgogi. ""The jerk grilled fish is a barbeque dish made using Jamaican spices such as thyme, crushed chillis and cumin. It is known for its spiciness,"" says Anand. Resonating his words, the subtle flavour from the mix of spices hits one's taste buds before the fish touches the palate.While seafood lovers zero in on the grilled seafood, one cannot ignore the delicious tawa grilled chicken. ""The chicken is soaked in a special mix of spices including Kashmiri chilli. This adds to the texture and taste of the grilled chicken,"" says the chef.In addition to this, the vegetarian side is complete with karahi aloo baingan (potato brinjal gravy in a kadai), paneer koliwada (marinated fried paneer cubes), cauliflower manchurian and rajma masala. However, what stands out is the vegetable au gratin, a French dish with grated cheese on top of baked vegetables.The dinner culminates with an assortment of desserts including orange marmalade pudding, vattalappam, mille feuille and mango browni mousse cake. With pasta and Indian breads on the live counter, the festival will be on till July 21."

2019-07-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/home-truths-housing-for-poor-slums-5829371/,Home truths,"The year is 2007. Commonwealth Games are three years away and Delhi is being spruced up  constructing roads, subways, flyovers and leaving no stone unturned in transforming it into a world-class city. But sprawling slum clusters, authorities believe, need to make way for newer facilities and public infrastructure.AdvertisingA mega exercise is planned to relocate thousands of slum dwellers, mostly migrants from the countryside reeling under an agrarian distress, to upcoming low-rise building blocks on the citys outskirts. Authorities are flush with funds with the launch of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), a new city modernisation project named after the countrys first Prime Minister.The planLocated 40 km from Connaught Place, Bhorgarh is one such relocation spot. Far removed from the din of city life, yet within comfortable distance of the capital, it is more of a location private developers would perhaps describe as a retirees heaven. The government, instead, markets it for the working class.Under the Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) component of the JNNURM, authorities start building housing blocks in places such as Bhorgarh, Bawana, Narela, Ghogha, Baprola  localities that fall outside the coverage areas of the then upcoming Metro network.Between 2007 and 2019, 31,424 one-BHK flats were built under the scheme by various agencies, including the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (DSIIDC), Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Development Authority (DDA). Around 24,000 more are at various stages of construction, according to official data available with The Indian Express.AdvertisingBut a crucial element is missing across the sprawling colonies: people. Not more than 2,000 of these flats are currently occupied, a top official of the Delhi government  under which DSIIDC and DUSIB come  said.In a city of nearly 2 crore people, half of who live in slums and unauthorised colonies, there are barely any takers for such affordable housing. According to official estimates, there are 675 JJ (jhuggi jhopdi or slum) clusters in the city which house 3.06 lakh families, and nearly 1,800 unauthorised colonies, home to a mix of low- and middle-income families.The Indian Express visited three colonies at Bhorgarh, Ghogha and Sultanpuri, which came up in 2011, 2010 and 2015 respectively. There are 1,272 flats at Bhorgarh, 3,434 at Ghogha and 1,060 at Sultanpuri. All are unoccupied.Years of neglect means the colonies are decaying, with overgrown shrubs having taken over most of the area, wide cracks across buildings, broken window panes, doors, damaged floors and rusting metal.Gates at Bhorgarh are locked from inside, but there are no security guards. At Ghogha, two private security guards man the complex, gates of which have collapsed, round the clock. The Sultanpuri project, the newest of the three, is relatively better off.In flats at Bhorgarh and Ghogha, most facilities are damaged to an extent that officials admit it will take several crores to repair.Among the few EWS colonies where people live is the one built by DSIIDC in Bawana in 2008. On paper, of the 1,184 flats, 300 have been allotted. At the colony, conditions are appalling  sewage blocks most lanes and streets are littered with garbage.Of the 300 allottees, hardly anyone lives there anymore. Many have sold the flats to people, who have rented them out. The area has two prominent shops of property dealers. We may be running a business here, but theres no demand. Who would like to live in these conditions? Even those staying would go elsewhere, given a choice. The rent is between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000. Those who have electricity meters installed lease out their connections to others. There is no water pipeline, Jagmohan, a property dealer, said.Bhavna, a homemaker living on rent, said: I have never seen a sanitation worker here. We clean everything on our own. Our children keep falling ill.Ramcharan, a house painter who moved to the colony five years ago on rent, said most families are tenants. With not a single functional streetlight, the area becomes highly unsafe after dark, he said.Geeta, who works in a small fan manufacturing unit and moved here as a tenant nine years ago, said: When we moved here, we never thought we would land in a situation like this someday. The rows of building blocks you can see are all full of tenants. You will not see anyone who has been relocated from a slum here. But we are worse off than those living in slums.What went wrongOfficial records show that from the beginning, there was a lack of coordination among various arms of the government, which also carried out a series of policy flip-flops. It was like the left hand of the government did not know what the right hand was doing. Funds kept coming in and construction was carried out mindlessly, without thinking if there will be any takers, a senior official said.Experts believe part of the reason the projects failed was the location of the colonies. Swati Janu, a visiting faculty at the School of Design, Ambedkar University, said the current model of relocating people to the fringes of the city, far from their livelihoods, doesnt work.Through my work, I have realised that often people do not want to live in multi-storey housing which disconnects them from life on the street. High-rise housing has already been proven a failure in western countries such as US (Pruitt Igoe housing) and UK (Aylesbury Estate). Yet, we are bent on emulating the same models and, hence, the same failures. Mid-rise, high-density neighbourhoods are seen to be more successful models of housing with a vibrant socio-urban fabric, preferred by the residents as well, Janu said.Evita Das, an urban researcher and member of civil society platform National coalition for inclusive urbanisation, said in-situ rehab was the only solution.Das said the housing inventory, mostly on the periphery of the city, does not work because housing is just seen as a structure, not as a right. What about their livelihood, access to basic services, how will they commute to the city? There has been a clear political shift in viewing the urban landscape. A place is being built where urban poor will be made invisible further and further, she said.In fact, construction of houses meant for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) was the simplest part in the early phases, with Central funding being around 40% for every BSUP project.The DDA, for example, built 2,840 flats under the JNNURM scheme but later proposed that the project be dropped altogether. Work on the pending DSIIDC projects has come to a halt as the Centre stopped funding in April 2017. Since progress is about 50%, a huge amount of funds is required for completion of the project. The matter is being taken up for a policy decision, an official note of the Urban Development Department said.While the location of housing colonies, up to 40 km away from the city centre, is a factor, policy flip-flops and one-upmanship are equally responsible for the current mess.In 2010, the Sheila Dikshit government created a policy to govern the allocation process. The year 1988 was decided as the cut-off date of eligibility, which left out lakhs of families. Subsequently, 119 clusters were identified in which the DUSIB carried out a survey and found only 30-35% eligible families.Ahead of the Commonwealth Games, the government became desperate to relocate slum dwellers to those colonies. Not all families were willing to shift to places far from their sources of earning. Eventually, the government managed to shift around 266 families, an official said.Later, the cut-off date was relaxed to 2009 in a new policy which replaced the earlier one in 2013. By that time, the UPA government had launched the Rajiv Ratan Awas Yojana to provide one-time assistance to the urban poor to move into these flats, with the vaunted aim of a slum-free India.Authorities in Delhi signed up for the scheme and pledged to bear 50% of the cost of the flats. The remaining 50% had to be paid by beneficiaries. Under the policy, around 50% of JJ cluster dwellers were found eligible for flats. Still, nothing moved as the state elections took place in 2013 and 2015, and the general elections in 2014. Elections meant relocation of slum dwellers, a political hot potato in Delhi, became a no-go zone, a DUSIB official said.Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain did not respond to calls and messages seeking a comment.Further hurdlesIn 2015, the AAP government rode to power, with jaha jhuggi wahan makaan as a key promise. In its first Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken to halt all demolitions, pending a review of existing policies and framing of an in-situ rehabilitation scheme.That policy, called Delhi Slum and Jhuggi Jhopri Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, was eventually notified on December 11, 2017. The policy acknowledged that building resettlement in faraway places does not work since the poor return to their place of work. It also recognised the PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana), which had replaced the Rajiv Ratan scheme after the BJP came to power in 2014, a decision that was reversed later.Earlier this year, Delhi government decided to rename the policy as Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana, effectively stalling a proposed survey across the 675 JJ clusters to find potential beneficiaries of the scheme. The government then decided to withdraw from the scheme, saying the assistance amount of Rs 1 lakh per flat could be absorbed without any Central help.DUSIB was made the nodal agency for relocation/rehabilitation of slums and the cut-off date was again revised to 2015. The policy also said that any jhuggi that came up after January 2015 will be removed without a promise of alternate housing.DUSIB had floated tenders for construction of 5,310 dwellings at Bhalswa, Dev Nagar and Kasturba Nagar, which would have been the first in-situ project under the Delhi governments policy. But tenders failed. Now the board is trying to use completed projects at Sultanpuri and Bhalswa  having 1,060 and 7,400 vacant flats each  to carry out rehabilitation.One clause of the AAP governments policy, which allows for rehabilitation on the same land or in the vicinity within a radius of 5 km or more in exceptional circumstances is coming in handy in this case, an Urban Development Department official said.DUSIB also aims to partially fill up another vacant colony at Savda Ghevra with around 1,900 families while low-ranking CISF officials, numbering around 2,100, are likely to be allotted flats at DSIIDCs Baprola project. Overall, DUSIB managed to allot flats to 1,927 families in 2018-19 and plans to cover 3,400 families in 2019-20.AdvertisingBut the board is responsible for rehabilitation of only 176 out of 675 slums which are on Delhi government land. Allottees also have to pay Rs 1.12 lakh per dwelling and an additional one-time maintenance charge of Rs 30,000 for five years."

2019-07-15,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-small-uttarakhand-town-is-becoming-a-major-tourist-destination/story-vmHcrnjcakzHEVuTQpIO8I.html,How a small Uttarakhand town is becoming a major tourist destination,"When one reaches Dhanaulti - a picturesque site in the Garhwal region of Devbhoomi (Gods abode) Uttarakhand - one can not but feel the fresh breeze gushing through deodar trees and emitting an earthy, woody aroma. This is when you know you have left behind the hustle and bustle of the crowded city.With Mussoorie - the Queen of the Hills - becoming over-crowded, it is starting to lose its charm and people are now wanting to explore other options. Located just 25 km away is Dhanaulti which is fast emerging as the next big tourist hill station.If one wants to cherish nature at its best, experience fresh air, drink the mineral water coming directly from the Himalayas, then Dhanaulti is the place to be.But, say it a boon or a bane, it is fast getting commercialised and we have been seeing a lot more tourists than before. Though they are good for our business, people leave behind a trail of garbage which is very difficult to clean up. It is ruining the natural beauty of the Himalayas, Anil Kumar, owner of Burans Breeze hotel, told IANS.Kumar, who himself belongs to Delhi, said he wanted to escape the noise and pollution of the national capital and hence built a lodge here from where one can see the snow-peaked Himalayan range.Decoding the name of his hotel - one of the oldest in the area - he said that Burans is for the Burans flower (rhododendron) that grows here which brightens the entire place with its red colour during spring time, and Breeze is for the strong cool breeze that the place witnesses.To attract tourists, we have grown cauliflower, potato, and radish in our gardens and use them fresh in our restaurant, Kumar said.Another hotelier, Rakesh Garg, owner of Silver Dew, bought land here in 1997 when Uttarakhand was still a part of Uttar Pradesh but established a hotel only recently when Dhanaulti started seeing tourists.Back then I didnt know the potential of Dhanaulti becoming a major tourist destination. I bought the land for leisurely purposes but now I see a lot of tourists - from bachelors to families, he said.Speaking to IANS, Ajay Pawar, who is a native and handles several hotels in the area, said the hotel business here is going good. People are liking this place because of its peaceful and chilly environment and the privacy that it offers.Several people are coming here and demanding rooms or cottages which are isolated and close to nature. They dont come here for luxury, they come here to get close to nature, to hear the birds chirp and for the fresh cool breeze.People love this place so much that they want to buy land here but most of it has already been bought and new hotels are coming up there. The prices of land have also shot up in merely last 2-3 years.Gambhir Singh, a farmer who now runs a confectionery shop, said people are shifting from agriculture activities to work in hotels. Even if a person washes utensils in the hotel, he can make more than what he makes in agriculture, he added.Painting a gloomy picture for the future of farming on the hills, he said the new generation here does not prefer farming work because of increasing costs, risks associated with it, governments apathy, and hard work involved which dont pay off.Kishori, manager of hotel Rock Resort, said that tourists demand good surroundings more than comfortable rooms, and hence to attract them, they had have planted apple, plum, walnut, and apricot trees.People are very fascinated with the trees, they come and take pictures with them. We also make fresh chutneys and jams with the fruits, he said.Vinita Chouhan, member of a self-help group based out of Mussoorie, has put up a shop in Buranskhanda as the place has started witnessing lots of tourists. They have also set up shops in Dhanaulti, Mussoori, the Dehradun trade fair, and the India International Trade Fair in Delhi.We sell woollen clothes and traditional Garhwali food items like Urad dal pakora, Jhangore Ki Kheer, Mandve Ki Roti, and Kandali Ki Sabzi.About 100 women are engaged in weaving woollen items like shawls, sweaters, caps, and socks. Another 10-15 women make papad, chips, pickles, and other items, she said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)First Published: Jul 15, 2019 12:23 IST"

Traditionally, the farmers practice flood irrigation for the cultivation which takes lot of water usage and with situation in drought-prone Marathwada getting bad to worse with every year, the figures comes as a surprise to everyone.Highlighting that farmers cannot be restricted from cultivating the crop of their choice since it fetches them good returns, the government as well as experts have emphasized the need for strict use of the drip and micro-irrigation techniques on war-footing for sugarcane.Agricultural superintendent for Aurangabad division S K Divekar on Sunday said that the drip irrigation techniques for sugarcane can ensure judicious use of water. ""Even if not made mandatory so far, the drip irrigation technique is being emphasized by the government. In the wake of drought last year and late arrival of monsoon this year, the area under cane cultivation is likely to come down. The estimated area under cultivation, however, is still high considering the drought-prone nature of Marathwada,"" he said.Notably, a study conducted by advocacy group South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP) on sugarcane cultivation in Marathwada had found that drought-prone region consumed nearly 4,322 million cubic meters (mcum) of water, nearly double the live storage capacity of Jayakwadi project, to irrigate sugarcane standing on 2.3 lakh hectares in 2013.Divekar said farmers should also explore sustainable cropping pattern instead of sugarcane. ""Planting different orchards and cultivating vegetables, onions and potatoes could be also explored by farmers in keeping with the weather conditions,"" he said.As per the official figures, an estimate made by the State Agriculture Department, Latur division of Marathwada will have over 1.25 lakh hectare of cane cultivation, while Aurangabad division will cultivate the cash-crop over 69,305 hectare area. Latur division which comprises of Latur, Parbhani, Nanded, Hingoli and Osmanabad and Aurangbad division, made up of Aurangabad, Jalna and Beed districts, together account for over 1.9 lakh hectare area under cane cultivation.The estimated agricultural area under cane cultivation in Marathwada during 2018-19 was around 2.96 lakh hectare.The sugarcane cultivation takes place under four-identified seasons including 'Adsali' that coincide with the Kharif season, pre-seasonal getting planted preferably during November - December, followed by 'Suru' cultivated in January - February and the subsequent Ratoon season. Marathwada witnesses sugarcane plantation during all these seasons depending upon the weather conditions and availability of water.Deepak Joshi, a progressive farmer from Paithan taluka said sugarcane cultivation has remained prerogative of a section of farmers from Marathwada who have easy access to water from dams and canal systems. ""The stat authorities must ensure judicious use of water for sugarcane cultivation by making drip irrigation mandatory. The farmers cannot be prohibited from cultivating the crop of their choice since it fetches them good returns, but at the same time there is a need for drip and micro-irrigation techniques for sugarcane instead of the traditional practice of flood irrigation,"" he said."

G Jayaraman and his wife Neela, residents of Sainikpuri in Hyderabad, grew up in houses with gardens. Jayaramans grandfather had acres of land where many varieties of trees grew, mainly coconut. He even owned a mill that extracted oil from the coconuts.In their own garden, the Jayaraman's grow fruits including sapota, coconut, banana, lemon, mango, pomegranate, custard apples, avocados and wonder berry. They have grown watermelon, sweet potato, ladies finger, beans and brinjals before.They also have flowers like hibiscus (red, pink, white, maroon layered variety), paarijaatham, jasmine (regular, layered, bud variety), rose (red, pink, white, yellow, mixed colour) and pinwheel flower. Neela has a soft spot for roses. She talks about a particular red rose plant that flowers every time their son comes home from another city. That plant never disappoints us. It might be a coincidence, but still makes us happy, she says.Their daughter, Sowmya, says, I started helping my mom in gardening when I was around 17 years old. We love organic vegetables and fruits from our own garden and she has a special love for flowers. We have grown all kinds of vegetables and fruits according to the season.Explaining how they take care of their gardens bounty, Jayaraman says, We avoid chemicals as far as possible and try to use eco-friendly alternatives. We use cow dung as fertiliser and a solution of turmeric powder and water as pesticide. Its important for plants to get sunlight, and we should provide drip irrigation to save water. We bought a few tree varieties and hybrid flowers from a nursery. The remaining seeds came from the fruits and vegetable we ate.Gardening gives us peaceTalking about their love for gardening, Neela says, Gardening gives us mental peace. My husband offers flowers from our garden to God every day for pooja. I take care of the plants as if they are my children. Parrots are regular visitors here.

The Reply Leaves Him Red-faced,"Bhubaneswar: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which returned to power in Odisha for a record fifth consecutive term in May, has been in an unenviable situation in the state Assembly for two days now. Thanks to two senior leaders of the party.Sparring between Finance Minister Niranjan Pujari and seven-time MLA Pradeep Maharathy on the issue of agriculture has given the Opposition BJP and Congress an opportunity to attack the regional party.Maharathy in the Assembly said that he has not eaten since the time he heard Pujaris reply to his question in the House on Wednesday. I was so shocked by the answer that I could not eat anything, said Maharathy, who served as agriculture minister between 2014 and 2019.Maharathy, who has been representing the coastal constituency Pipili since 1985, had tried to corner the government by asking a question about the cold storages and the potato mission in the state. Replies by Pujari in absence of food supplies and consumer welfare minister Ranendra Pratap Swain embarrassed Maharathy.I only want to specifically know from the honourable minister about the number of multi-purpose cold storages in our state at present, the number of processing units that have been established and how many of them are lying defunct, Maharathy asked in the Assembly on Wednesday.Pujari replied: There are a total of 128 cold storages in the state. Of them, 80 became defunct during his period (of ministership). Forty-eight cold storages are functioning at present.Maharathy also said that since Odishas current potato production at 2.7 MT per year remains far below the annual requirement of 12 MT, the state has to depend on potato imported from the neighbouring state of West Bengal.The potato mission in Odisha had started during his (Maharathys) period and it ended in failure also during his period. The department is trying to revive the mission, replied Pujari, prompting Maharathy to voice his disagreement.Maharathy spoke in the Assembly on Thursday and demanded expunction of Pujaris replies to his questions from the Assemblys record. While a decision on it was yet to be taken by Speaker Surya Narayan Patro, the Opposition BJP and Congress legislators protested against the demand. Maharathy later told journalists that he had actually revived many defunct cold storages and expanded the area under potato cultivation.If a minister states inaccurate facts and figures in the Assembly, such statements are expunged from the records. But the minister has issued a statement in full knowledge of the facts and with total confidence, said senior BJP legislator Jayanarayan Mishra.Senior Congress MLA Taraprasad Bahinipati said: An expunction will be against the law. What the minister has said in the Assembly is the statement of the government. His statement was based on the records available with the government. Pradeep Maharathys protests have no meaning unless a probe takes place to ascertain when and how the cold storages turned defunct.Pujari, sensing a controversy in the making, declined to speak on the issue to journalists on Thursday."

Some right-wing MPs have said her visit is needless, with Julien Aubert of the Republicans describing her as a ""prophetess in shorts, a Nobel Prize for Fear"" in comments denounced by green activists."

(AP)Donald Trump dropped a political hot potato on Narendra Modi on Monday night by claiming that the Indian Prime Minister had asked him to mediate on Kashmir.India has held for long that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.Seated next to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at the Oval Office, the US President said in response to a question from a reporter: I was with Prime Minister Modi two weeks ago. We talked about this subject. He actually said would you like to be a mediator or arbitrator? I said, Where? He said, Kashmir.... I think theyd like to see it resolved. And I think youd like to see it resolved. And, if I can help, I would love to be a mediator.Modi and Trump had met in Osaka last month.As Trumps claim snowballed into a controversy with several political parties weighing in, the Indian external affairs ministry bit the bullet and contradicted Trump within an hour.We have seen @POTUSs (President of the United States) remarks to the press that he is ready to mediate, if requested by India & Pakistan on Kashmir issue. No such request has been made by PM @narendramodi to US President, foreign ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted close to midnight.It has been Indias consistent position that all outstanding issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally. Any engagement with Pakistan would require an end to cross-border terrorism. The Shimla Agreement & the Lahore Declaration provide the basis to resolve all issues between India & Pakistan bilaterally.Trumps remarks put the ministry in a tight spot as India has long rejected all offers from various quarters  the US included  to mediate on Kashmir.What makes it worse for Modi is that Trumps claim would weaken the BJPs narrative against the Congress on Kashmir. Blaming the Congress for the Kashmir situation  particularly Jawaharlal Nehrus decision to take the issue to the UN in 1948  has been a particular favourite with the BJP.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: Is Govt of India going to call @realDonaldTrump a liar or has there been an undeclared shift in Indias position on third party involvement in Kashmir? Personally I think @realDonaldTrump is talking out of his hat when he says @PMOIndia asked for US involvement in solving the Kashmir issue but Id like to see @MEAIndia call Trump out on his claim.Reacting to Trumps claim, Congress media in-charge Randeep Surjewala tweeted: India has never accepted third party mediation in Jammu & Kashmir! To ask a foreign power to mediate in J&K by PM Modi is a sacrilegious betrayal of countrys interests. Let PM answer to the Nation!CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury joined the late-night debate with two tweets: What does this say about our long-held position of sovereignty over the Indian state of J&K as defined in the Simla Agreement? Will our Twitter-friendly PM have the courage to rebut the US President who has made a public statement? India has always maintained its a bilateral issue, with no scope for third-party interference. What is this government up to?The only party to welcome what Trump said was the BJPs erstwhile ally in Jammu and Kashmir, the PDP. Welcome such a positive development laden with potential to establish permanent peace in the subcontinent. Dialogue and diplomacy, not warmongering, the only means which can deliver some respite to the people of subcontinent engulfed in raging fires of hatred, the PDP tweeted."

The Shiva devotees take a dip in the Ganga and fill pots with holy water, meant to be poured at temples near their home. Then begins their return journey via UP and Delhi, for which portions of highways and roads are cordoned off and overnight camps are set up.The Uttarakhand DG, in his letter, said that in the first phase, kanwars walk, but on the last five-six days, they use trucks or trolleys to reach home early for jal-abhishek, and compete on the road this can cause accidents or fighting or an act against an unsuspecting local. He also cautioned about sound systems which can cause accidents and dak kanwars. Dak kanwars are people who run with several pots, relaying them to the next person every one km. The DG wrote about how they may carry hockey sticks, trishul, cricket and baseball bats and become violent if someone challenges them.The DG stated that at the Haridwar border, weapons and sound systems will be seized but the numbers are such that there is always a risk Once they set off from Haridwar, there are three possible routes: Haridwar-Roorkee-Delhi; Haridwar-Najibabad-Moradabad-Delhi; and Haridwar-Roorkee-Saharanpur-Panchkula-Delhi.From July 23-30, schools, colleges and anganwadi centres will be closed, Rupendra Dutt Sharma, Haridwars chief education officer, said.Via UPAround 8,000 security personnel, including Rapid Action Force and BSF, ATS units, snipers on the pattern of Kumbh Mela, drones and helicopters for aerial surveillance, and showering of rose petals  the Yogi Adityanath administration in UP has rolled out the red carpet for an estimated four crore devotees set to criss-cross the 130-km Delhi-Haridwar highway in the state.We have sent a request to UP government we are hopeful the helicopters will come to Meerut by July 25, said Sanjeev Bajpai, SP Traffic (Meerut). There is also a plan to shower devotees with rose and marigold petals from July 26 onwards. We will need five tonnes (5,000 kg) of petals, at a cost of Rs 20 lakh, said an official. A senior official said they expect the cost of helicopters to go up: This year it will cost roughly Rs 17 lakh for three-four days. In another change that came in last year, there are no more curbs on DJ music, on the condition that kanwarias play only bhajans and not film songs. The previous Akhilesh Yadav government had banned DJs following apprehension of loud music provoking communal tension.This time, kanwarias would have to register themselves at police stations in their villages and towns before leaving, and would be provided a registration number. Uttarakhand and UP police have been instructed to record presence of kanwarias at each checkpost.The Meerut police also organised a special workshop for 500 personnel. Always remember three golden words  Please, Thank You and Sorry, Jayant Das, director of the New Delhi-based Skill and Training Company hired by Meerut police, instructed the policemen.Rajiv Singhal, Secretary, Partapur Industrial Association, said they estimate losses to industrial units of nearly Rs 150 crore as production remains suspended for many days.All liquor and meat shops along the route would also remain closed for 15 days, beginning July 17.A Kanwar Yatra app on Google Playstore provides details of medical facilities, police stations, temples, hospitals and camps available over the 130-km route. Last year, it was downloaded 4,920 times. This time, the number will be large, said Udyai Ram, Additional Commissioner, Meerut.The Chief Ministers intention is clear, said Chief Secretary Pandey. This should be a historic kanwar yatra.At Ghaziabads entry points, a team of five traffic personnel will rotate duties every 1.5 hours. With eateries along the route offering free food, RV Gupta, owner of a dhaba, said: Most carry their own rotis so we offer them dal or a potato gravy. For the next 10 days, no non-vegetarian food, including eggs, will be served.Alok Singh, Inspector General (Meerut Division), said: It is a community affair where there is involvement of different groups of people. There is meeting and greeting involved, and the communities act as force multipliers. Its a matter of faith and the effort is to ensure things go smoothly.Destination DelhiFor two traffic constables stationed for 12 hours daily for the next 15 days at a Shahdara traffic junction, the brief is simple: Aage badho shanti se. The aim is to prevent a repeat of the 2018 Moti Nagar incident, when kanwars had overturned a car at a traffic junction after a tiff with the driver.An officer said police deployment has been increased manifold this year.After UP, kanwars enter East Delhi, where 83 camps have been set up, said Joint CP (Eastern range) Alok Kumar. The samitis that host kanwars at the camp have been briefed about law and order. They must use the left side of the road to walk, shouldnt believe in rumours, and camps should have fire-fighting systems and good lighting.DCP (East) Jasmeet Singh said, We have asked organisers to give ID cards to kanwars this will deter anyone from being mischievous and will keep a check on anti-social elements.Special CP (Traffic) Taj Hassan said separate passage for their movement using barricades and ropes has been created.Across Delhi, the state government has set up 173 camps, and an additional 50-plus camps have been constructed by private organisations. At one of the biggest camps near Welcome Metro station, over 10 labourers construct a tent. Its fire-proof and water-proof, and can accommodate at least 500 kanwars. We have placed carpets and mattresses on wooden platforms. At least 40 fans, 20 coolers and 90 LED lights as well as some halogen lights are being installed. We have also placed 20 dustbins and 16 toilets, said Ajay Kumar, in-charge of tent and lighting of three camps.Kumar works for Mahalaxmi Tents. Owner Shyam Sundar said, In 2006, Delhi had 19 camps, and now its 225. After camps are set up, samitis run by area pradhans provide the food  three meals, tea, biscuits andKamal Bansal, president of Delhi governments Tirth Yatra Committee, said, This year at least 25 per cent of the 173 camps will be steel hanger camps, which dont require wood or ropes and wont disrupt traffic as they dont take a lot of time to be set up.AdvertisingDJB vice-chairman Dinesh Mohaniya said the chief engineer of every area has been directed to provide water tankers to camps on an urgent basis."

With the current speed, it would take 12-15 years to achieve this target, so the state needs to race against time, said Adityanath. But, he added, Uttar Pradesh had the potential to become the greatest economy of the country with good connectivity, water resources, manpower and commitment of the government to provide security.AdvertisingAmid criticism from Leader of Opposition and senior Samajwadi Party leader Ramgovind Chaudhary who said that the BJP government in the state has failed to utilise even 50 per cent of the funds announced in the main Budget, the Chief Minister said that everyones support would be required to achieve the ambitious target.We indulge in petty politics, dole out things. We need to change the mindset for permanent solution and development. Efforts should be made to set targets in agriculture, industry, power, water supply and financial reform sectors for the next five years, he said in his over two-hour-long speech.He added that investment of Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore is needed in different sectors to achieve the targets.Adityanath claimed company giants like Samsung and TCS were on the brink of winding up their operations in Uttar Pradesh due to the states political atmosphere, but they stayed back after his government came to power in 2017 and reassured them of safety.When we came to power in March 2017, Samsung, TCS were running away from the state. Today, Samsung has made an investment of Rs 5,000 crore. TCS, which was winding up operations in Lucknow, is investing in other places in UP as well, he said.He also claimed that during his tenure, there has not been any farmers protest, except some at the behest of a political party.Those, who tried to throw rotten potatoes outside the Governor House in Lucknow, have got their lessons in Kannauj, he said, indirectly referring to SP leader and former CM Akhilesh Yadavs wife, Dimple Yadav, who lost from Kannauj Lok Sabha seat this time.Repeating that the perception about Uttar Pradesh is changing, Adityanath said that organising Kumbh in Prayagraj and Pravasi Bhartiya Divas in Varanasi around same time was a step in the direction.He informed the House that 14 new medial colleges are coming up across the state. While token provision has been made in the Budget, approval has been sought from the Government of India, he said.He also maintained that air connectivity has improved during his regime. Today the air connectivity has increased to 55 cities from just 25 places (before he came to power) across the country. The CM went on to announce a new scheme, Mukhyamantri Paryatan Samvardhan Yojna. One place in every Assembly constituency would be identified for developing it into a tourism destination, he said, seeking support of all the legislators to use their local area development fund.He added that government aid would also be there, besides public contribution and CSR funds would be sought for the development of such tourists spots in every Assembly constituency.AdvertisingThe Opposition, however, refused to accept the claims. Chaudhary said such a long speech is anti-farmer, anti-poor, anti-employment, anti-students and anti-women. The chief minister is not a finance minister and the House should be informed that what was the need for a supplementary Budget. There is not a single word on why this supplementary Budget has been tabled. Funds announced in the main budget have not been utilised. Spending in none of the department has gone beyond 50 per cent, while for most it is around 15-40 per cent, said Chaudhary."
2019-07-24,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/weather-too-hot-so-is-chilli-price/cid/1695104,"Weather too hot, so is chilli price","Farmers said the dry spell had reduced the yield of chillies to nearly a quarter of what it was in July last year (Shutterstock)The ongoing dry spell has created a shortfall in the domestic production of chillies, pushing up the price of the produce to Rs 120-150 a kilo as opposed to Rs 50-60 a kilo last July.Farmers said with rain in huge deficit, green chilli plants were struggling to flower and this had severely hit production. To meet the shortfall, chillies were being brought in from adjoining states, including Bihar and Jharkhand.Since green chillies perish fast, the wholesale and retail markets have been witnessing a fluctuation depending on the flow of trucks.We are now selling chillies for Rs 150 a kilo. This price could change rapidly. We dont know where it will stop, said Subol Saha, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market.Since the price has nearly doubled, people are buying less chillies, he said.A senior official of the agricultural marketing department said the lack of rain had severely hit production of chillies in North 24-Parganas, Hooghly, South 24-Parganas and even Murshidabad. These areas are usually known for producing green chillies.Farmers said the dry spell had reduced the yield of chillies to nearly a quarter of what it was in July last year.When the bud appears in a chilli plant, you need rainwater to strengthen the stem for it to hold the fruit, said Narayan Chandra Das, a farmer from Canning in South 24-Parganas. Without rain, harvesting with water doesnt work for chillies, Das said.The TelegraphSources in the agriculture department said Bengal produced nine-and-a-half to 10 lakh metric tonnes of green chillies. After meeting its domestic demand of eight lakh metric tonnes, the state remains one of the biggest suppliers of chilli to other states.Green chillies are most perishable. Unlike potatoes, we dont have any mechanism to store green chillies, said Kamal Dey, working vice-president of the All Bengal Grocers and Vendors Association. Even when chillies are brought from adjoining states, a considerable amount gets damaged.At Gariahat, the price of green chillies varied between Rs 120 and 130 a kilo  a phenomenon that most vendors said they had not witnessed over the past few years.From Rs 90 to Rs 120 a kilo, the price of green chillies has been increasing over the weeks, said Chiranjit Ghosh, who sells vegetables at Gariahat market. We have reduced our buy to cut down on losses due to damages.Across most wholesale markets, including Koley market in Sealdah, bulk of the green chillies is coming Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar.Pradip Mazumder, adviser to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on agriculture and chairman of West Bengal Agro Industries Corporation Limited, admitted: We are witnessing an unprecedented monsoon this year.A green chilli plant has a lifecycle and when it starts flowering you need showers. Watering the farmland alone doesnt help in case of production of chillies. So the result is inevitable."

2019-07-26,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-new-york-a-diverse-new-group-works-the-soil/articleshow/70391491.cms,"In New York, a diverse, new group works the soil","By Ayenat MersieAMAGANSETT, N.Y. (Reuters) - Sporting a backwards gray cap, studded earrings and a thin, head-to-toe layer of dirt, Layton Guenther took a break from the day's fieldwork to talk about their path from an upper-middle-class suburb to a Long Island, New York, farm.""Farming - for where I grew up - was a very unusual career choice,"" said Guenther, 32, who grew up in a New York City suburb and identifies as gender non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. But ""everybody belongs on the land in their own way. None of us should feel alienated from it.""Guenther grows potatoes, squash, wheat and other crops at Quail Hill, the Amagansett, New York, farm they manage on land donated to the Peconic Land Trust, and is part of a growing cadre of gender-diverse college graduates in their 20s and 30s who are changing the face of organic farming.In the same town, Amanda Merrow co-runs Amber Waves farm with Katie Baldwin, whom she met during an apprenticeship program. Merrow said she had, quite simply, enrolled in the apprenticeship ""with the intention of doing something else after,"" but she fell in love with farming and couldn't imagine doing anything else.Women and non-binary people are running some of the best-known organic farms on Long Island, in what is a growing, $50 billion industry nationwide. Women make up a slightly larger share of organic farmers than conventional farmers, 37% to 36%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a share that is likely to continue to grow, experts say.There is no national data on the share of transgender farmers in the United States, but HB Lozito, executive director of Vermont-based Out in the Open, an organization that connects rural LGBTQ people, says it is growing.One reason organic farms are more gender-diverse is that their generally smaller size means less up-front investment is needed, making them more accessible to new farmers, said Sophie Ackoff, vice president of policy and campaigns at the National Young Farmers Coalition.The average organic farm, according to a USDA survey from 2016, is about 350 acres - compared to 441 acres for a conventional farm.These groups, and young farmers new to agriculture in general, are drawn to organic, sustainable farming because of a desire to do work with a social impact, Ackoff and several farmers said.""They're choosing to go organic because of the reasons they are going into agriculture in the first place: to protect natural resources for future generations, to fight climate change, to feed their community good, healthy food,"" Ackoff said.Many are working in New York state, where organic farming is growing twice as fast as the national average, the latest USDA agricultural census showed, thanks in part to strong regional demand for organic, locally-produced foods.New York has over 1,000 certified organic farms, ranking it third in the country, behind California and Wisconsin, the USDA data shows. These farms account for nearly 4% of the state's overall farm acreage, compared with a national average of roughly 0.6%.While organic farming is growing quickly, it comes with high labor costs and potentially lower crop yields than conventional farming, so it can be a tough business for new farmers.""When I look now at the starting of the farm, it seems really audacious,"" Baldwin said. ""But in that environment, in 2008, everybody had lost their jobs and there weren't jobs - so it didn't feel that weird to start something.""At Amber Waves, Baldwin and Merrow grow vegetables, wheat, and herbs on about 20 acres. And along with Quail Hill, Amber Waves trains apprentices - the next generation of diverse, fledgling farmers, new to agriculture and encouraged by the farms' gender-diverse leadership.It isn't just new farms that are sprouting new leadership. Marilee Foster's family has been farming in Sagaponack, New York, for generations. An ancestor, a whaler named Josiah, turned to the land in the mid-1800s as overfishing destroyed his prospects at sea.Marilee, 48, is the first woman in the family to fully co-manage the farm. She recently transitioned to organic farming not just for environmental reasons, but also because it made business sense: ""I farm organically because that's what people want.""(Reporting by Ayenat Mersie in Amagansett, N.Y.; Editing by Leslie Adler)This story has not been edited by The Times of India and is autogenerated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.(This story has not been edited by timesofindia.com and is autogenerated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)"

Reason: The Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission (KAPC) has advised the farmers to stop growing tomatoes and go in for potatoes or onions instead. The suggestion comes in the wake of the worsening water crisis and depleting groundwater levels in the region. The Commission has written to the state and central governments to change the crop cultivation area.The tomato-growing season is from May to August. Tomatoes are supplied to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, New Delhi, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.Of the total 33,000 hectares under horticultural crop cultivation, 8,000 ha are under tomato cultivation in Kolar. According to horticulture department, on an average, 4 lakh tonnes of tomato per year are cultivated.Farmers in Kolar have to go up to 2,000 feet to get groundwater to grow tomatoes. The commercial crop is high in demand, but farmers are suffering, T N Prakash Kammardi, Chairman, KAPC, told TNIE.Farmers in Kolar have to go up to 2,000 feet to get groundwater to grow tomatoes. The commercial crop is high in demand, but farmers are suffering. So we have suggested that Kolar is no more ideal to grow tomatoes. It has also been suggested that the government look into the issue at the earliest as this plays a vital role in crop pricing, T N Prakash Kammardi, Chairman, KAPC, told TNIE.CR Srinath, CMR Tomato Mandi, APMC Yard, Kolar, said that the proposal was good. Farmers spend around Rs 1 lakh per acre to cultivate tomatoes. This high investment pays off because tomato is a commercial crop. Of late, the farmers are facing many problems. Kolar farmer favour cultivating tomatoes because of the soil and climate. But now the groundwater is contaminated with fluoride and pesticides are being used indiscriminately. Earlier, farmers used to grow potatoes. But they turned to tomatoes as this was more profitable. It looks like now the farmers will have to go back to growing potatoes.The Commission has also suggested that farmers in the Mumbai-Karnataka region drop sugarcane cultivation due to the water crisis. Since sugarcane is a water-intensive crop, the Commission suggested cultivating onion and jowar. Shivashankar Reddy, outgoing agriculture minister, had agreed in principle to these proposals. Now after the fall of the coalition government, the proposals have to wait for the new governments clearance."

But do we know which food is processed or ultra-processed? Is it good or bad for your health? What should one look for when we buy packaged food? Food has to go through some processing before it reaches our plate. For example, the white rice from the paddy field has to be harvested, de-husked and milled before it is ready for consumption. But this is a low or no processed food as this has not undergone any industrial process for it to be processed.But imagine the transformation of a potato from a field to the bag of potato chips or of tomato to a tomato sauce or ketchup. This food has to undergo several industrial processes, such as hydrogenation, hydrolysis, extrusion, frying pretreatment and the addition of different substances  dyes, emulsifiers, texturants, sweeteners and various additives to increase colour, taste, texture, shelf life etc. Ultra-processed food contains five or more ingredients and has a very high sugar or salt content.Common foods we are likely to consume:Breakfast cereal: A 30 gm serving of a popular breakfast cereal for children has 11 gm of sugar in one serving. The list on their package reads: Wheat solids, wheat flour, refined wheat flour, added colour, added salt, artificial cream, added flavour, etc.Granola and cereal bars: A 40-50 gm serving of granola and cereal bar has an added sugar content of 27 gm (equivalent to approximately five teaspoons of sugar) in most packs. The list of ingredients, includes added sugar, oil, honey, salt, molasses, emulsifier, lecithin either from soy of sunflower, raising agent, flavouring agents and sodium bicarbonate.Ready-to-eat food: If you are a person who likes eating hot cooked food, there are many ready to eat (RTE) items in the supermarket. But are they healthy? You may be surprised to know that a RTE item like pongal has 7.5 gm of sugar and 1,800 mg of sodium in a 100 gm serving. Why add sugar in a breakfast item like pongal? World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting salt intake to 5 gm/day which is 2,000 mg sodium. If your RTE convenience food is loaded with salt (1,800 mg no less) it is definitely bad for health.Let us look at some healthy snacksBiscuits: A normal biscuit serving of 23-25 gm (four biscuits) has 30 gm (6 teaspoons) of sugar. Advertisements also recommend it as a healthy breakfast option for children. The list of ingredients has the following: Malt extract, milk solids, liquid glucose, leavening agent, invert syrup, emulsifiers, artificial flavours etc.Dried cranberries (or any dried fruit that is packed): Many believe that dried fruits are good for health, definitely so. Beware if it is packed and marketed as a healthy snack. It is loaded with sugars (73 gm for a 100 gm serving). It contains added sugar and also many added agents to increase shelf life and preservatives."

The country used to spend over 10,000 crore annually on pulses imports. Now we have more than what we actually require. We were importing five million tonnes of pulses, but we have had an additional production of six to nine million tonnes during the past three years, he said.Action planIn tune with the Central government target of doubling farmer incomes by 2022, the ICAR had chalked out action plan which had been forwarded to the States, he said.The ICAR had adopted two villages each in every district  more than 1,400 villages in all  to demonstrate that technology intervention and associated activities could help achieve the target. Technologies that slashed farming expenses by reducing the use of fertiliser, water, energy and diversification were key to doubling farmer incomes, he said.Mr. Mohapatra urged farmers in Kerala to interact with ICAR institutes in the State and take full advantage of technology to double their income by 2022."

The move is in line with the companys plan to double its snacking business, which includes brands such as Kurkure and Lays in India by 2022 and is expected to create over 1,500 direct and indirect jobs.PepsiCo is committed to growing its food and beverage business sustainably in India. We have a long relationship with the people of Uttar Pradesh. As we look to double our snacks business over the next few years, we intend to invest Rs 514 crore approximately to expand our footprint in the state, said Ahmed ElSheikh, president and CEO, PepsiCo India, adding that the company is committed to scale up the agri-food business here.The companys senior leadership team signed a memorandum of understanding with representatives of the UP government at the states second ground-breaking ceremony for projects worth Rs 65,000 crore.ElSheikh also pointed out that the companys intended snacks manufacturing operation in the state would also expand its footprint of collaborative farming for potato in the state.Agriculture is at the heart of PepsiCo and our farmers are the backbone of our business. As we expand our operations, we will look forward to a fruitful association that will not only help create jobs and enable ancillary industries, but also ensure the socio-economic progress of potato farmers in the state, he said.Despite being an early bird in branded packaged snacks, PepsiCo India faces tough competition in this category even with a surge in the countrys consumption of such products. The company was a pioneer in this segment, introducing global-standard potato chips under the Lays label and crunchy snacks under Kurkure. Today, it faces stiff competition from ITC, Haldiram Foods and Balaji Wafers in the Rs 28,000 crore snacks market. Parle Products are also catching up.The savoury snacks category grew at a 19 per cent compounded annual growth rate since 2013, the highest among all snacks categories, according to estimates by research firm Euromonitor. This growth will remain high at 22.3 per cent till 2022, again the highest as compared to other categories.Over the last year, PepsiCo has come up with close to a dozen local flavours, changed its packaging to highlight the transformation by placing pictures of regional flavours and spices, and tried formats favoured by Indians.

(iStock)Sir  It has become commonplace for the Bengali bhadralok to express a virulent distaste for anything vegetarian. Yet Bengal has a rich tradition of serving a variety of such dishes; items like fish and mutton are just a part of a diverse meal. The Bengali kitchen churned out dishes ranging from the simplest mashed potato enlivened with mustard oil, green chillies and onion to a miscellany of vegetables that are fried, boiled, roasted or combined with other veggies and seasoned with spices. But the anxiety of meat and fish disappearing from plates across the country is causing the Bengali to rebel against vegetables in general.Kalyan Banerjee,CalcuttaNo one is surprised at the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy in Karnataka PTIPower gamesSir  No one is surprised at the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy in Karnataka. The Aya Ram, Gaya Ram culture in Indian politics that began in the 1970s is now a flourishing business of sorts. One could hope that the Narendra Modi government, which has a huge majority, will bring a more stringent anti-defection law to put an end to this unethical practice. But alas, toppling state governments headed by parties other than the BJP seems to be a priority for the saffron outfit.One only needs to look at the Madhya Pradesh leader of the Opposition, Gopal Bhargava, for proof. Bharghava shamefully claimed that the Congress government in the state would collapse in 24 hours if the Number 1 or Number 2 in the Bharatiya Janata Party issue an order to that effect. The way the BJP is proceeding by grabbing power in one state after another, it seems that its dream of one nation, one election will soon be fructified. India is undoubtedly headed towards becoming a totalitarian state.Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,FaridabadSir  The editorial, Steep fall (July 25), raises a pertinent question regarding the ease with which legislators defect en masse to change the fortunes of political parties without caring for the peoples mandate. This is a breach of fundamental democratic principles. The anti-defection law is not strong enough, making life easier for turncoats. When an elected representative changes his political affiliation, he must be made to seek re-election. This is the only way to ensure that democratic principles are not trifled with.Birkha Khadka Duvarseli,SiliguriSir  The collapse of the coalition government in Karnataka was expected. Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) are traditional rivals who came together not for the betterment of the electorate but to keep the BJP from coming to power. The relationship between the coalition partners was uneasy from day one. As is the case with most political alliances based on compromises, the denial of ministerial berths proved to be the undoing of the Congress-JD(S) combine. It is encouraging that the party in power at the Centre will also be ruling Karnataka. People in the state can now hope to be treated on a par with the citizens of other states.K.V. Seetharamaiah,Hassan, KarnatakaSir  The Congress-JD(S) alliance are as much to be blamed for the state of affairs in Karnataka as the BJP. Each political party is only concerned about holding on to power. When does the government have time to focus on welfare measures if it is busy ensuring that its members do not defect? The BJP is not different. In state after state, members conveniently defect to its benefit. In Bengal, the prime minister openly claimed that he was in touch with elected representatives from the Trinamul Congress. Democracy has gone for a toss in the country.Sanjukta Das,CalcuttaModernity callsSir  The Rajasthan High Court has taken a long overdue step by directing lawyers to dispense with the colonial practice of addressing judges as My Lord or Your Lordship and asked that they simply be called Sir (Dear Sir, July 25). Similarly, the British left the country over seven decades ago, but lawyers in India still have to wear the long black robes that were customary back in colonial times. It is time such superfluous rituals are done away with. Further, it is expected that the directive of the Rajasthan High Court will be applicable all across the country. There is also ample scope of simplifying the language of the legal documents, which are drafted using unnecessary jargons, complicating matters for lay citizens not trained in law.Asit Kumar Mitra,CalcuttaSir  It is heartening to note that the suggestion to address judges as Sir instead of My Lord or Your lordship has come from the judiciary itself. The change in salutation will be a step towards bringing equality between the dispensers of justice and lawyers. One only hopes that this initiative will be the forerunner of other, much-needed judicial reforms .Tarsem Singh,Hoshiarpur, PunjabSir  Cumbersome robes and needless courtesies only come in the way of dispensing swift justice. The directive of the Rajasthan High Court is, thus, heartening. The apex court should now officially ensure that such gratuitous practices are done away with.Rima Roy,Calcutta"

(Pic: Shutterstock)Twenty-five states with tribal populations have sought more time from the Supreme Court to review their earlier rejections of more than 17 lakh claims from forest dwellers for records of rights or pattas over their patches of forestland.These states have filed separate affidavits in the apex court citing procedural lapses in their own decisions rejecting the claims for pattas under the Forest Rights Act, 2005. These decisions were taken over the last 13 years.In February, on a public interest plea moved by an NGO to protect the forests from depletion, the apex court had ordered the eviction of forest dwellers whose claims for pattas had been rejected.Faced with a political hot potato that would involve the eviction of lakhs of families, the states pleaded that the rejections were riddled with lapses and needed a review. The apex court therefore stayed the judgment in April.With a hearing approaching this week, the states earlier this month applied for more time to complete the reviews.Officials in the Union tribal affairs ministry said the states had told the apex court that most of the decisions to reject the claims had been taken without supporting reports from the village committees. In several instances, the rejections were not conveyed to the claimants.The Forest Rights Act mandates the award of pattas to tribal and non-tribal families that claim them, provided they can show they have been occupying the plot for three generations or 75 years before the cut-off date of December 13, 2005. The claimants need to furnish documents such as voter cards and ration cards as proof.Under the Forest Rights Act, these families have to apply for the pattas to the gram sabha, which forwards the claims with its observations to subdivision-level committees in the talukas. These committees forward the claims to district-level committees for the final decision.According to information compiled by the tribal affairs ministry, 42.3 lakh claims for pattas have been filed since 2006. While 19.6 lakh titles have been distributed, 17.5 lakh claims have been rejected and 5.2 lakh are pending at various stages of recognition or verification.Madhusudan Bandi, a teacher at the Gujarat Institute of Development Research in Ahmedabad, said the central and state governments had, irrespective of which party was in power, showed no willingness to implement the Forest Rights Act.Forest department officials now lord it over the forestland and the families living on it (which they cant any more if the pattas are awarded), so they have raised (malicious) objections to the claims, Bandi said.Ashok Bharati, chairperson of the All India Ambedkar Mahasabha, an umbrella body of tribal and Dalit groups, said the bureaucracy had contempt for the tribal communities.They asked the tribal claimants to produce all kinds of proof. The onus was always on the poor tribal families to prove their demand. Its the wrong approach, he said."

Namgyal also demanded that services of local transporters and produce from Ladakhis be procured by the defence forces.He said after the Kargil operation, locals were being hired as porters. ""During the Kargil operation, the locals volunteered to do this dangerous work. But now, the Army has capped the recruitment on the basis of age. During the war, the locals gave their vehicles for transport and whatever crops they produced to the defence forces.""But now we are being told that our carrots, potatoes do not fit the specifications of the Army. How can we match up with the vegetables from Mumbai and Delhi,"" Namgyal asked. He also demanded that the contribution of Tashi be recognised.""Several villages along the border, including Tashi's, do not have telecommunication facilities and amenities like drinking water,"" Namgyal said.National Conference's Hasnain Masoodi said there was panic in Kashmir after the Centre's decision to increase the number of security personnel in the state.

2019-07-30,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/roller-coaster-ride-of-the-triple-talaq-bill/articleshow/70456691.cms,Roller coaster ride of the triple talaq bill,"NEW DELHI: The journey of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill has been one roller coaster ride as the debate on gender here was intertwined with contentious religious and political issues.It was a struggle that played out in the public domain with the issue of instant triple talaq making headlines since the petition was first filed in Supreme Court in 2016. It started with those who suffered the rough end of this practice where their husbands had pronounced instant talaq (talaq-e-biddat) and left them to fend for themselves.As women organisations stepped in and the Supreme Court sought the views of all stakeholders involved, the issue fast gained political momentum even as Muslim minority organisations including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) consistently spoke against political interference citing this to be a matter of personal law and citing talaq-e-biddat as a practice that was defined as bad in Islam.However, they stopped short of taking a stand on declaring it illegal and that is where the triple talaq debate saw minority organisations in a war of words with women organisations like Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, Bebaak Collective, and many other women organisations that stood up for the rights of the Muslim women.The Supreme Court during the course of the hearing asked various women rights bodies, and AIMPLB to give written submissions on the issue of talaq-e- bidat, nikah-halala and polygamy . Women rights organisations like BMMA supported first petitioner Shayara Bano's plea that these practices are unconstitutional. The AIMPLB on the other hand argued that uncodified Muslim personal law is not subject to constitutional judicial review and that these are essential practices of the Islamic religion and protected under Article 25 of the Constitution.When the Supreme Court judgement came in 2017, it was the turning point as the issue fast grew into a political hot potato with the BJP- led NDA government seizing the opportunity to bring in a a law to make the SC judgement implementable.It was seen as a political move to counter the Congress and others opposed to the idea of a law as they suspected the real motive of the ruling dispensation was to rein in the Muslim minority and polarise votebanks. This is when minority organisations stepped up their attack on the government for capitalising on the issue. But at the same time women organisations were also divided over the provisions that were introduced in the bill first approved by the Cabinet and later amended to address concerns raised by various stakeholders. However, the government chose to hold onto the clause that criminalised the offence making it punishable with with three years imprisonment.Many survivors including Shayara Bano and Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan supported the provisions of the bill involving criminalisation with checks like the complaint can be made only by aggrieved woman and her blood relations and bail may be given after the wife is heard by the magistrate.However, the bills criminalisation provisions evoked protests from organisations like Bebaak Collective also a petitioner in the SC case. The AIMPLBs womens wing too swung into action setting off a signature campaign against the bills provisions and holding press conferences citing the bill to be anti-women and anti-Muslim.The bill also went through the pull and push of the legislative process as it was passed in Lok Sabha but could not be introduced in Rajya Sabha . Meanwhile, an ordinance was first brought in in September last year and re-promulgated earlier this year. The bill lapsed once the Lok Sabha elections were declared.The bill was re-introduced by the BJP-led NDA in its second term and now that it has the assent of Parliament, the real test will be in its implementation."
2019-08-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/minister-allays-dairy-farmers-fears/article28776303.ece,‘Minister has allayed dairy farmers’ fears’,"Agriculture and dairy must be kept out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, currently being negotiated by the Indian government with 15 other countries, Indian farmers unions said in a memorandum submitted to the Minister of State of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Sanjeev Kumar Balyan on Wednesday.Dr. Balyan assured us that milk imports would not be allowed and that all efforts would be made to put dairy on the negative list of the RCEP, Kannaiyan Subramaniam, southern secretary of the Indian Coordination Committee of Farmers Movements (ICCFM) told The Hindu after the meeting. Representatives of ICCFM, which includes 12 major farmers movements including the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Shetkari Sangathan and Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, also plan to submit the memorandum to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday. The Hindu was unable to independently confirm the details of this meeting or the assurance from the Minister.The memorandum warns that 15 crore Indian livestock farmers who depend on dairy for their livelihood would be left devastated if the dairy market is opened up. RCEP member-countries New Zealand and Australia are aggressively seeking to access Indias massive dairy market to dump their products, said the farmers unions.New Zealand produces 22 million tonnes of milk products and exports 19 million tonnes. However, there are only 12,000 dairy farmers in the country; in fact, there are more dairy cows than people in New Zealand. India, on the other hand, has 15 crore dairy farmers who produce 156 million tonnes, most of it consumed domestically. R.S. Sodhi, managing director of major milk cooperative Amul, also made a presentation to Mr. Goyal last week, urging the Centre to leave the dairy sector out of RCEP, a senior Amul official told The Hindu.The situation is completely different in India, and the Indian milk producer must be protected. These are people with just one or two cows; many are landless farmers dependent on dairy for their entire livelihood, pointed out Yudhvir Singh, national secretary of the BKU and the ICCFM, speaking to journalists on Wednesday. He claimed that India would lose revenues of up to 60,000 crore if the RCEP was implemented in its current form.He accused the Centre of giving into pressure from the services sector and major corporates in continuing to pursue the RCEP. Farmers are not a priority for this government. Agriculture is being made a scapegoat... The Adanis and Ambanis are pressuring the government for their own interests, but it is not in the interest of the small and marginal farmer, he added.The memorandum pointed out that Indias trade deficit with ASEAN surged from $4.98 billion in 2010-11 to $9.56 billion in 2016-17, after the signing of the free trade agreement. India should have learnt a lesson from the disastrous experience of the ASEAN FTA and the WTO agreements. Instead, the government is sacrificing the interests of its farmers again, said K. Sellamutthu, president of the Tamila Vyavasaigal Sangam.He added that the RCEP would dilute Indias protections of farmers seed rights and make them vulnerable to corporate plant breeders. Look at the recent case of Pepsico against small potato farmers in Gujarat. If RCEP is implemented, they would have had no defence, he said."

""Since he was partially paralyzed, he depended on others for his daily needs. We have found that he had four accounts - each having around Rs 80,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh. A few fixed deposits were maturing around the same time and it seems the assailants were aware of it,"" said an investigating officer. His relatives said that he often sent messages to them asking for support and money would reach him in bulk. ""He would ask people to open his almirahs and hand him over money. Someone present in the house for a day or two would know of his habits,"" explained a source.Sudhin Majumdar, the proprietor of the paint shop and the only tenant who paid monthly rent to Mukherjee, was the Man Friday for the couple. Along with Dilip's attendant Dipak Jana alias Babai, who took him out for walks twice a day, it was Majumdar who would withdraw money from Majumdar's account and hand it over to him. The two had struck a rapport and often went out of Kolkata on trips. It was to sponsor those trips that they had decided to open a joint account at the local IDBI bank . Another Rs 20,000 was kept aside for opening an account for their maid Lata. A family member said he had given Rs 50,000 to Mukherjee too. ""Sudhin used to withdraw big amounts. The money, we believe, was kept in the house for these reasons,"" said an officer.Sources said that at least seven casual labourers had worked on plastering the ceiling and then painted the house over the last few weeks. ""We have been able to trace three of them. They have been detained for questioning. We are looking for the rest,"" said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.The cops, who spoke to relatives residing at Lords Bakery and the family's lawyer, have also ruled out the possibility of the murder over a ""missing will"". ""We are focussed on five possibilities. We have a technical team working on leads and one on financial transactions. The others have drawn up a list of around 15 odd suspects and working on each of them. This includes the most likely possibility of any of the labourers or contractors carrying out the crime for gain, the possibility that he was in some major dispute with his tenants or the promoter angle where they might be aware of the missing will. The fourth possibility the cops are looking at is an ongoing personal enmity and finally an enmity that might have developed due to borrowing or lending in which Mukherjee was involved,"" explained a top detective department official.Mukherjee owned the Bharat Waterproofing Corporation company and ran it successfully till around 2014. He suffered a stroke about eight months ago, which left him partially paralyzed. He depended on rents that he used to earn by subletting his ground floor - a paints shop and a potato godown."

The tribal village under Saptasajya panchayat with a population of around 300 used to supply vegetables to Dhenkanal town, Athagarh and Bhubaneswar. But after the project went defunct, a large part of population is now involved in daily wage labour for livelihood.The people are forced to walk five km to catch bus or auto-rickshaw and then travel rest five km to reach district headquarters town to earn wages, said 60-year-old Sundar Barsha of the village.Sources said in 1986-87, the soil conservation wing of Agriculture department had set up a watershed project over a natural stream flowing from Saptasajya hills to irrigate around 300 acre land in the village. A bund was also constructed to store stream water for the purpose.With the help and support of a voluntary organisation Samajika Seva Sadan, villagers were encouraged to start vegetable cultivation round the year. Within a few years, the village became popular for supply of fresh vegetables like tomato, brinjal, potato, ladies finger and greens to urban markets. Even vendors and vegetable wholesalers were directly procuring their produce from the farm fields.While the reservoir has lost its water retention capacity because of accumulated silt, water failed to reach tail-end due to non-renovation of canals and pipeline, forcing farmers to stop cultivation in 2015, said farmers.Another farmer Bhanja Tudu said their economic condition has started deteriorating due to non-functioning of the watershed project. The piped-water supply system has been damaged and its regulators are not functioning at several places. Despite several requests to the Sadar Block Development Officer (BDO) and irrigation officials, no step has been taken to restore the project, he added.Sources said the district administration has sufficient funds under the Modified Area Development Agency (MADA) which can be utilised to renovate the project but to no avail.District Welfare Officer (DWO) M R Mishra said, We are not aware about the plight of the farmers. The project will be revived soon with the help of a self-help group.Dhenkanal Sub-Collector S M Pradhan said he is not aware of MADA fund. However, he assured to look into the matter."

Till now, there are about 11 teams of NDRF, which include teams that have been flown in from Pune following intervention of the Prime Minister. Almost 7,000 people have been rescued and 4,000 people have been shifted to safer places.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and his Deputy Nitin Patel reached Vadodara on Friday late evening to take stock of the situation on day three of the deluge which has thrown the city out of gear, with several parts of the city still inundated and without electricity for over 48 hours.A total of 840 pregnant women were among those to be shifted to different hospitals in the city, Singh said. Although the trains going to Delhi and Mumbai have started, the Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains are yet to begin operations, he added. He further said that the Vadodara airport has become functional, the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) services have also begun and the National Highway between Ahmedabad and Mumbai has been cleared for traffic. According to Singh, 98 additional medical teams have been sent to Vadodara city.AdvertisingRead | Four more crocodiles rescued as water recedes in VadodaraSpeaking to this newspaper, Singh later said that the government has decided to resolve the flooding of Vishwamitri for the long term with a big plan. We are serious about this issue. The flooding in the city is because while Vadodara itself received almost 500 mm rain in one day, Halol in Panchmahal simultaneously received close to 171 mm, he said. Water has receded in many parts, but Vishwamitri is plagued with encroachments and there will be a big project that we are taking up to avert this situation in the future.Although the level of the water in the river receded by two feet, now at 30 feet at 10pm from 34.5 feet, many residential colonies in waterlogged areas went without electricity for the third day.Of 48 feeders shut in the city by the Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd. (MGVCL) on Wednesday, most were restored by Friday. However, officials added that the transformers located in waterlogged areas were still shut.The Vadodara Fire Department, the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and police teams worked round the clock to provide water, food and relief materials to inundated residents.However, the continuing waterlogging despite a break in the rain showers since Thursday midnight, sparked off much outrage on social media, with residents questioning the BJP-ruled civic body and social media posts blaming the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) for leaving them unaware about opening the floodgates of the Ajwa reservoir on Wednesday evening, which is said to have caused much flooding in the already swelling Vishwamitri.Singh said that the civic body could not be called unprepared because the volume of water that Vishwamitri can flush out is lesser than the rainfall witnessed in the city.When asked about residents blaming the civic body for not being alerted of a possible deluge, Singh said, The water which had come from Ajwa was not as much as the rain received in Vadodara itself. So, the reservoir is not responsible for this flooding. The storm water drainage network is an issue in the city and we are making a medium to long-term plan for the same.Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel visited SSG Hospital in Vadodara, along with Cabinet minister and Manjalpur MLA Yogesh Patel and BJP General Secretary Bhargav Bhatt.We saw pictures of the flooded Kala Ghoda circle and the bridge yesterday.

This while the middlemen and retailers continue to make money.AdvertisingIn the retail market, potatoes continue to sell at Rs 20-25 per kg (Rs 2000 to 2500 per quintal). The middlemen have been selling at a rate of Rs 10 to 12 per kg (Rs1000 to 1200 per quintal).Farmers alleged that traders from other states too were responsible for creating glut like situation by aiding a perception that there was no demand of Punjab potato in order to lower prices ahead of potato sowing in various states from September to November month. Punjabs potato seed considered the best in the country.This is the fourth year in a row that Punjab farmers have been facing losses due to poor rate of the crop.AdvertisingThe rate of Pukhraj and Jyoti varieties was Rs 300-325 per quintal and Rs 250-300 per quintal, respectively on Thursday, against Rs 600-625 to Rs 400-450 per quintals, respectively in May.Similarly the sugar-free potato varities like LR and Diamond are being sold at Rs 600-800 per quintal against Rs 1100 per quintals in May.Punjabs seed is best in the country and every potato growing state takes its seed form here only and if country needs 2.5 mt fresh seed annually, Punjabs 1.6 mt, which is meant for seed only. So, we should have no problem..Government needs to honour the best seed quality of our state by making some policy as Punjab is blessed to grow best seed by nature due to its soil, geographical location, said a senior officer in Punjab Horticulture Department.A farmer from Mallianwal village in Jalandhar, Harjinder Singh, said: Traders have made a nexus and they dont place orders for seed till the time farmers lose hope and sell it at a throw away prices..Only Punjabs potato seed is successful in other states and if government fixes a rate of it, the potato growers here would never be harassed by the traders and entire potato crop of the state would be used as seed in other states.Punjab has around 609 cold stores for keeping potato with a capacity of 2.2 million tonnes.Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing states meet around 65 per cent seed demand for growing table potato across the country.In Punjab, Doaba region of the state is the home of potato production where 98,000 hectares area is under it. Jalandhar itself is a major pototo growing hub. The sowing of potato these takes place in early October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the crop is put in cold storage.Potato grower Gurmail Singh from village Dhadda Haripur in Jalandhar district, who grows potato on over 100 acres after taking land on rent, said that potato seed and table potato costs them Rs 9 and Rs 6 per kg and how can they sell below it below that price."

Sub-stations from Dudhali, Gandhinagar, Nagala Park, Radhanagari, were among those which were kept shut as a precautionary measure.Several parts of Kolhapur and Sangli district faced power outages due to continuous rainfall.About 1.59 lakh consumers in Kolhapur and 1.24 lakh in Sangli have been badly hit due to the power cuts amid heavy rains in the past four days. The floods have damaged 29 power sub-stations and 5,582 transformers in both the districts.MSEDCL officials said that there has been large-scale damage, with floodwater damaging electricity supply equipment. It will be a mammoth task to repair and rebuild the equipment and transformers damaged due to the floods, an official said.For the fourth day the BSNL landlines are not working across the city.Most ATMs (automated teller machines) remained closed because of lack of power supply. Many citizens were seen going from one ATM to another in desperation to withdraw money. Some ATMs with power supply had been deliberately shut because of security reasons.As a result of the acute water shortage and breakdown in supply four days ago, residents have taken to collecting rainwater for drinking purposes. People were seen roaming the streets with empty cans and trying to collect rainwater.The supply of vegetables was also hit for the fourth consecutive day as the wholesale vegetable mandi wore a deserted look. The officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee said the trucks carrying onions and potatoes were stranded on the highway.Despite the scarcity of food grains, the traders did not increase the price of food grains to avoid unrest and anger among the residents.Owing to floods, all entry points of the city have been closed and the district administration has written to all the petrol pump operators to keep a stock of fuel for emergency purposes such as ambulance and rescue operations.Meanwhile, the district health administration claimed they have adequate stock of medicines and injections at hospitals in both rural and urban areas. A senior health official said the stock of medicines has been kept ready to deal with any emergency that may arrive due to floods.First Published: Aug 09, 2019 20:41 IST"

During the holy month of Shravan, the demand of vegetables remains high as most people prefer vegetarian food. But the soaring prices have taken a toll on peoples pocket. Tomato and potato are being sold at Rs 50 and Rs 26 per kg respectively while most green vegetables are priced above Rs 40 per kg.Ramesh Behera, a retailer of Giri Market, said prices of vegetables have doubled in the last few weeks as a result of which his customers are purchasing less than the usual amount. Beans are being sold at Rs 90 per kg while drumsticks are priced at Rs 70 per kg.Similarly, brinjal is selling at Rs 50 per kg while okra, bitter gourd and ridge gourd comes with a tag of Rs 40. Cabbage is priced at Rs 60 per kg and spiny gourd and parval costs at Rs 50. Spike gourd is being sold at Rs 160 per kg. Senior advocate Bhagaban Sahu said vegetarians are the worst hit of the price rise. It has become difficult to manage kitchen expenses with pulses and vegetables going beyond our reach, he said.In absence of proper storage facilities, vegetables become rotten in a few days and to compensate for the loss, traders are enhancing the price as per their choice, he added. Manmohan Sahu, a wholesaler of Badabazar, said usually, local vegetables meet around 30 per cent need of the market. But incessant rains have badly affected the local harvest. This apart, the vegetable supply from other States has also been hit due to heavy rains resulting in price rise.The city receives vegetables from nearby rural areas of Lathi, Bendalia, Saunlai, Randha and Karapali besides Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Howrah. Due to heavy rains since the last some days, transport of vegetables from the Southside has been disrupted and the supply from Howrah is inadequate."

I sent this message to a friend, quite convinced about the answer: Alsa Mall. He recommended Sun Sandwich, opposite the recently-opened Lord of the Drinks, Nungambakkam. Whether this tiny shop is the citys best place for bread omelette is debatable, but it sure serves delicious food.When I started out, we had minimal response. Selling two or three loaves of breed was a big deal back then, says S Kirubalishwari, whose father S Chandrasekar ran a bread omelette shop in Alsa Mall, before they started this one. Kirubalishwari has been managing the shop for the last 17 years.A day in Kirubalishwaris life involves her waking up at 5.30 am and preparing the essentials  mashed potatoes, green chutney paste and boiled chicken  required for the business, and typically ends at 11 pm. By her own admission, her customers, especially the millennials, are drawn to the shop primarily for its delicious green chutney.Her secret sauce has been the chutney  prepared by grinding green chillies, coriander and mint leaves, peanut and lemon juice. Every second bread omelette shop in the city serves with green chutney. Whats so special about Sun Sandwich? I think it has to do with the green chillies I use, she says, while applying the chutney to a bread omelette, before slicing it into four quadrants, adding, Ive had customers saying that they never found a replacement for my chutney.In addition to bread omelette, Kirubalishwaris shop is equally known for its sandwiches  ranging from Schezwan paneer to chicken cheese sandwich  all under 80. She credits a regular who suggested that she try preparing tandoori and Schezwan sandwiches. I went to a nearby restaurant and tried Schezwan food there. I really liked the taste and thought I could also do something similar for my customers, she grins.The shop registers an average footfall of more than 150 on any given day, and Kirubalishwari says she purchases over 45 loaves of bread and 10 trays of eggs (300 in total). Given her loyal customer base, she had thought about the idea of expanding her business when her husband M Shanbabu was around, before his demise in 2017.I wanted to start a new outlet, but the place also needs to be convenient, no? We are generating profits here, even if its not too big, Kirubalishwari tells me, as a customer orders a plate of double egg cheese sandwich. Thanks to word-of-mouth, Sun Sandwich gets tempting offers for college cultural events.For a college event, the order is somewhere between 300-400 plates, she says, adding that her son S Praveen Raj, a Visual Communication student, manages the place in her absence.Kirubalishwari says shes content with her little business and shares a heart-warming incident of how an NRI customer, who paid a visit to her shop a couple of years back, reminisced how she and her friends used to spend their college days visiting the shop. More than money, its instances like these that keep me going, she smiles. Even actors Jayam Ravi and Sivakarthikeyan would visit her shop frequently, before they became stars.This fortnightly column explores the different street foods of Chennai.

2019-08-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/plant-protection-the-next-blockbuster-basmati-crop-5906430/,Plant protection: The next blockbuster basmati,"Onkar Singh has been cultivating Pusa-1121  the basmati variety that, till recently, accounted for nearly three-fourths of Indias exports of the aromatic rice ($ 4.71 billion in 2018-19)  since 2008.AdvertisingThis year, the 53-year-old from Majitha village in the same tehsil of Amritsar district, has slashed his Pusa-1121 acreage to two acres, from 10 acres in 2018. Simultaneously, his area under Pusa-1718, a new improved basmati bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi, has expanded five-fold to 10 acres.Pusa-1718 is essentially Pusa-1121, which they (scientists) have made more disease-resistant. You dont need to spray any pesticides now. I tried it out first last year and got an average paddy yield of 23 quintals per acre, against 18-20 quintals from Pusa-1121. Also, the crop tillered better (more side stems produced from the initial parent shoot), says Onkar, who grows the short-duration Pusa-1509 basmati variety on the remaining 33 acres of his total 45-acre holding.Onkar Singh farms only basmati paddy, which has no assured government procurement at minimum support prices (MSP). Pusa-1509 matures in just 115-120 days, from the date of nursery sowing to harvesting. I can transplant it from June 10 to June 25 and harvest between mid-September and early-October. It gives the flexibility, then, to plant matar (pea) in September and potato in October for harvesting by late-November/early-December. There is time to sow wheat, winter maize or ajwain (celery) even after that, he explains.AdvertisingPusa-1121 is a longer-duration basmati (140-145 days, seed to grain), mostly transplanted during June 10 to July-end for harvesting towards October-end and mid-November. It leaves scope only to sow wheat. Yields, too, are lower than the 24-28 quintal/acre from Pusa-1509. The only advantage is price. Last year, I got Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal for Pusa-1121, whereas Pusa-1509 paddy fetched Rs 2,600-3,000, he adds.This is where the new variety could make a difference.Pusa-1121 was susceptible to bacterial blight. We have basically made it resistant to the pathogen by introducing two genes Xa21 and xa13, derived from a wild rice species (Oryza longistaminata) and a traditional land race (BJ1), respectively. The resultant variety (Pusa-1718) also possesses a non-lodging habit from a strong culm (stem). It is, hence, less prone to falling and can withstand heavy rain or water-logging better than Pusa-1121, A.K. Singh, head of IARIs Division of Genetics, tells The Indian Express.Davinder Singh (30), of Khabba Rajputan village in Tarn Taran district and tehsil, agrees. This farmer has dedicated 20 acres to Pusa-1718 in the current season, from last years two acres, while halving it from 40 acres to 20 acres for Pusa-1121.I did it after seeing how the new variety stood tall, despite being submerged under water for a week after incessant rains in September 22-24. And my yield was 27 quintals/acre, compared to 18-19 quintals of Pusa-1121, states Davinder, whose total 150-acre holding also includes 50 acres each under Pusa-1509 and non-basmati paddy varieties, and 10 acres of other crops (maize, vegetables and pulses).Onkar and Davinder Singh are both bullish on Pusa-1718, which also matures 10 days earlier than Pusa-1121. The traders are paying Rs 200-300/quintal lower for the new variety, just as they once tried to beat down the price of Pusa-1509. But the grain quality of Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1718 is just the same, claims Onkar.According to Davinder, the economics of basmati cultivation today is superior to non-basmati. A yield of 25 quintals/acre from Pusa-1509 and Pusa-1718, at an average Rs 3,000/quintal rate, gives more return than from non-basmati varieties even at a guaranteed MSP of Rs 1,835/quintal on 34-35 quintals/acre. Progressive farmers like him are able to harvest high yields through practices such as incorporating crop stubble into the soil (rather than burning) and applying farm yard manure, in addition to granular sulphur and other secondary nutrients.Talwinder Singh of Nauli village in Jalandhar district/tehsil is growing Pusa-1718 on three of his nine acres this time. Amarjit Singh from Viram in Amritsars Majitha tehsil has, likewise, halved his Pusa-1121 area to five acres, while planting Pusa-1718 on five and Pusa-1509 on his balance 18 acres. Both have cited the same reasons  better disease resistance, less lodging-prone and more tillering ability.Farmers in Punjab have sown a total basmati area of 6.29 lakh hectares (lh) this kharif season, 1.92 lh more than last year, while bringing it down under non-basmati varieties from 26.66 lh to 22.91 lh. They have also stepped up cotton acreage from 2.67 lh to 3.91 lh. The reduced non-basmati area would mean less pressure on government procurement agencies. Within basmati, a significant switch from Pusa-1121 to Pusa-1718 has taken place. G.S. Bal, chief agricultural officer of Amritsar, estimates the new variety to cover 30-35% of the districts basmati area of 1.39 lh this time.Increased planting, of course, comes with price risk. Farmer realisations have been good in the last couple of years due to a rebound in basmati exports (see table). The value of shipments have marginally slipped during April-June ($ 1,255 million versus $ 1,285 million in the same quarter of 2018-19), with the payment problems in Iran adding to the uncertainty.One way to protect the countrys export interests is by preserving basmatis premium quality attributes  aroma, long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking and fluffiness  and minimising use of chemical pesticides. The Punjab government, last month, issued an advisory to farmers not to spray formulations of five insecticides (acephate, thiamethoxam, triazophos, buprofezin and carbofuran) and four fungicides (tricyclazole, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim and propiconazole).An alternative approach to pesticide application is to breed for disease resistance. This is what IARI scientists have sought to do through transfer of specific disease-resistance genes, from landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy, into existing high-yielding basmati varieties. Pusa-1718 is a result of such marker-assisted backcross breeding, which helps avoid use of streptomycin or tetracycline combinations to control bacterial blight.A similar variety Pusa-1637 has been bred by incorporating a Pi9 gene, sourced from Oryza minuta (a wild relative of the normal cultivated Oryza sativa paddy), into the popular Pusa Basmati-1. This gene provides high-to-moderate resistance against leaf and neck blast, obviating the need to spray fungicides such as tricyclazole, azoxystrobin and picoxystrobin.AdvertisingVijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters Association, feels Pusa-1718 is a good variety. But he emphasises that farmers should not put all their eggs in a single variety, while advocating tough action against companies aggressively marketing pesticides. So long as an insects population is below the economic threshold level  at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest  there is no need to spray at all, he points out."

The recipes have been sourced from the kitchens of her family and friends.Sunita says the recipe book is an extension of Lucknows famous Ganga-Jamuna tehzeeb (culture) which melds different cuisine traditions. We wanted to showcase the multicultural aspects of Lucknows food, which has roots in Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan, says Sunita at the launch of her book at Atta Galata in Bengaluru recently.Sindhi, Parsi, Punjabi, Nawabi, Mughlai and British culture find echoes in Lucknowi cuisine. The quintessence of Lucknowi culture is in its plurality, which is reflected in the easy acceptance of cuisines from different communities that co-existed, says Sunita.Sunita and Chand have chosen recipes that travelled with them from different parts of the world. Take for instance the yogurt soup, (dahi ka shorba) that traces its roots to Istanbul, while the use of pomegranates and dried fruit in Lucknow has come from Afghanistan. The original kebabs though have come from Persia, says Sunita. The dishes in the cookbook go beyond Lucknow.When Sunitas parents, Chand and Inder Prakash, first settled in Lucknow after leaving Lahore following Partition, they brought only the memories of home with them. Chand was born in 1925 in Bahawalpur in undivided Punjab, and brought up in Quetta.The book has 230 pages with 18 chapters that cover kebabs, soups, biryanis, pulaos and raitas, daals, mutton, chicken and fish dishes, parathas and rotis, desserts, condiments, chutneys, pickles and murabbas, and Lucknowi coffee.Be it the chaat or the biryanis and pulaos, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, Lucknow had its own distinctive interpretation, says Sunita. The cooking was influenced by the cuisines that travelled down the Silk Road. The recipes in the book are distilled from this rich culinary heritage, she says observing in her preface that the preparation of food is learnt by observation, it is a process of osmosis. With four generations in our family being reasonably good cooks, this book documents recipes we learnt from my mother and other close friends.The Lucknow Cookbook goes beyond food to document a familys journey, an era, a city and a culture where sophistication and urbanity were a way of life. Cooking and serving was the foremost expression of hospitality and was as nuanced as the art, architecture, jewellery and furniture, says Sunita while talking about the chapter, Lucknowi Coffee, High Tea, Cocktail Snacks and Cakes.High teas and cocktail parties were a regular feature because of the large British presence in Lucknow, says Sunita. My mother is a superb baker and has taught three generations of the family to bake her trademark basic sponge cake and chocolate mayonnaise cake with its delicious fudge frosting. She realised that using peanut oil instead of butter made the brownies even gooier.The vegetarian section has a whole chapter devoted to the versatile potato with simple recipes for hing jeere ka aloo and dahiwale aloo, just as the 16 dishes in other vegetables such as bharwan karela with masala or the carrot souffl opens up the world of Lucknowi styles.Sunita would never miss out on Lucknows best contribution to Indian cuisine  biryanis. One needs to know that pulaos, a single pot dish, usually accompanies a meal, whereas biryanis are the centrepiece of a meal accompanied by various side-dishes, she explains."

He said, ""I want to demand something from my farmers today. I cannot let my mother earth be degraded. I want to appeal to all my farmers to reduce use of chemical fertilisers by 30-40% . Just by doing this you will be doing a service to Mother Earth.""He further added that the farmers were an integral part of the country's economic vision saying,""Our focus is the farmers. Their income needs to be doubled. They need to be provided with the optimum price for their produce. Our farmers also need to be taken to the international markets. Why shouldn't we think of becoming an export hub?""He further added that the same could be done to promote the interests of handicraft artisans in the country, ""Every region in India has its indigenous handicraft, its own handloom, its own unique products. Why can't we utilise this to provide India the impetus for becoming an exporting nation?""In 2016, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture noted in a report that the rate of decadal growth of the sector had significantly decreased from 8.37 percent in 1960-70 to 2.161 percent in 2000-2010.The foremost reason for the drop was the uncontrolled use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides that led to deteriorating soil fertility. The Standing Committee also warned that India would not be able to feed itself by 2025.As per the report, 292 farming districts accounted for the consumption of 85 percent of the country's net fertilizer usage. The situation is particularly grim in agricultural states like Punjab and Haryana, where widely consumed cash crops like potatoes, sugarcane, cotton, wheat and paddy are grown.The Agriculture Ministry's policy on subsidy is to be blamed, the report said. ""(The) skewed subsidy policy in favour of urea and high prices of other fertilisers are the real culprit behind the imbalanced use of fertilisers in the country, it read.The committee had also noted that the Central Insecticide Board (CIB) does not conduct it's own research, but advises the government based on national and international information available.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-08-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/the-promise-of-the-calcutta-south-india-club/article29108490.ece,The promise of the Calcutta South India Club,"A thought had been troubling me for a while. How was it, I asked a few friends, that Kolkata, which had a thriving population of people from southern India once, hardly had any restaurants serving food from the region? I had eaten some good Kerala food at a place called Ammini several years ago, but always wondered why there were very few such eateries serving different kinds of southern Indian cuisine.That was when I heard about the Calcutta South India Club. Situated in the heart of the city, near Hazra, it was once a remarkably popular place for people who liked to have a bowl of piping hot sambar with their idlis or vadas or more after a days shopping.It was quite an institution, my friend from the city told me. The club  along with its canteen  was a part of the Kolkatans life, but, she added, the canteen had just given way to a new restaurant called the Roastery.I heard that the Nobel Laureate, Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, used to stay in the club when he was in the city. The scientist was the clubs first president (1926-28) and was followed by S. Radhakrishnan, who took over from 1928, for a year, and later went on to become the second President of India.The club is still there, but the canteen, alas, is not. But, for old time's sake, I went with friends. The Roastery Coffee House (70 B Hindustan Park Road, Gariahat), I learnt, is a southern Indian chain which offers various kinds of coffee.We went there one Sunday afternoon, and were enveloped by the aroma of coffee being brewed. The place was also humming with life. Truth be told, it was humming a bit too much me. I like to hear myself think when I am eating. But the Roastery  clearly a hot favourite in Kolkata now  was not just splitting at the seams with people, but I think also had a problem with its acoustics, which amplified the sounds.We placed our orders. One friend asked for a Prawn Salad, and the other, Lamb-Meat Scotch Eggs. I asked for a piece of Chicken Breast stuffed with Prawns. The Grilled Prawn Salad with a Caesar Salad dressing was crunchy (thanks, also, to the nachos in the dish) and the friend said she enjoyed it. The fried Minced-Lamb-Coated Boiled Egg was covered with a mushroom sauce, which was not a good idea as it took away its crunchiness. The Chicken Breast in my dish had been marinated with olive oil, garlic and basil leaves, and then baked after being stuffed with grilled prawns. Even though I had opted for it, I thought, in retrospect, the combination didnt really work. The chicken was also a bit too hard, though I enjoyed the creamy mashed potatoes that came with it.What disappointed one of the friends  a coffee connoisseur  was the brew. It lacked punch and flavour, he complained  and went back to his favoured club in central Kolkata for a cup of hot filter coffee, which he said he really relished.I am glad I went to the Roastery  if for nothing else the rich history of the Calcutta South India Club. I could imagine Sir Chandrashekhara, in his trademark white headgear, sipping his coffee after eating a fluffy white idli. The times have changed, but its nice to furl the pages of history.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

The situation was so bad that we were not even able to go out. All the women and kids were frightened to say the least, said one of the members of the group, which had gathered with tricolours and pro-India banners to mark Independence Day.The protestors cornered the Indian diaspora who were at the High Commission to celebrate Independence Day and attacked them with eggs, potatoes and water bottles, added another.The demonstration was aimed at countering the anti-India protest, organised by Pakistani groups as well as Sikh and Kashmiri separatist outfits, with the focus largely on the Indian government's recent decision to revoke Article 370 that gave the special status to Jammu and Kashmir.The two demonstrations had been demarcated with metal barriers outside India House but as thousands began to gather, Metropolitan Police officers could be seen struggling to keep the aggressive anti-India protestors from breaking across the divide.""Talked to members of Indian diaspora in London. They are under shock but their resolve is firm. Talked to our High Commissioner. Timely intervention by her resulted into a safe passage to everyone, read a Twitter statement by Vijay Chauthaiwale, the Head of the Foreign Affairs Department of the BJP, who said he has also raised the matter with external affairs minister S. Jaishankar""It's time for (London Mayor) Sadiq Khan, Met Police to take appropriate action against these goons. Hope the British High Commission in India too takes note, he added.The Metropolitan Police, which had said that proportionate policing arrangements with public order trained officers had been put in place for Thursday's pre-planned demonstrations, claimed the protests had been largely peaceful involving a small number of incidents.In total there were four arrests for Section 4 of the Public Order Act, affray, obstruction of police and possession of an offensive weapon, a Met Police statement said.Investigations following the arrests remain ongoing.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-08-17,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/aug/17/potatoes-one-day-the-pope-the-next-2020117.html,"Jagmohan's letter to Rajiv Gandhi on Kashmir: Potatoes one day, the Pope the next","By Express News ServiceThis is the first of three-part series based on a Letter to Mr Rajiv Gandhi, (former Prime Minister) written by Jagmohan, twice Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, on April 20, 1990. The letter, in retrospect, seems to have accurately predicted the Kashmir situation of now while warning against complacency, which, the author says, was wholly ignored by the Congress government of the day. Excerpts..Dear Shri Rajiv GandhiYou have virtually forced me to write this open letter to you. For, all along I have persistently tried to keep myself away from party politics and to use whatever little talent and energy I might have to do some creative and constructive work, as was done recently in regard to the management and improvement of Mata Vaishno Devi shrine complex and to help in bringing about a sort of cultural renaissance without which our fast decaying institutions cannot be nursed back to health. At the moment, the nobler purposes of these institutions, be they in the sphere of executive, legislature or judiciary etc. have been sapped and the soul of justice and truth sucked out of them by the politics of expediency.You and your friends like Dr. Farooq Abdullah are, however, bent upon painting a false picture before the nation with regard to Kashmir. Your senior party men like Shiv Shankar and N.K.P. Salve have, apparently at your behest, been using the forum of Parliament for building an atmosphere of prejudice against me. The former raked up a fourteen-year old incident of Turkman Gate and the latter a press interview, an interview that I never gave, to hurl a barrage of accusations of communalism against my person.Mani Shankar Iyer, too, has been dipping his poisonous darts in the columns of some magazines. I, however, chose to suffer in silence all the slings and arrows of this outrageous armoury of disinformation. Only rarely did I try to correct gross distortions by sending letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines. My intention was to remain content with a book, an academic and historic venture which, I believed, I owed to the nation and to history.But the other day some friends showed to me press clippings of your comments in the election meetings in Rajasthan. That, I thought, was the limit. I realised that unless I checked your intentional distortions, you would spread false impression about me throughout the country during the course of your election campaign.WARNING SIGNALSNeed I remind you that from the beginning of 1988, I had started sending Warning Signals to you about the gathering storm in Kashmir? But you and the power wielders around you had neither the time, nor the inclination, nor the vision, to see these signals. They were so clear, so pointed, that to ignore them was to commit sins of true historical proportions.To recapitulate and to serve as illustrations, I would refer to a few of these signals. In August 1988, after analysing the current and undercurrents, I had summed up the position thus: The drum-beaters of parochialism and fundamentalism are working overtime. Subversion is on the increase. The shadows of events from across the border are lengthening. Lethal weapons have come in. More may be on the way.In April 1989 I had desperately pleaded for immediate action. I said: The situation is fast deteriorating. It has almost reached a point of no return. For the last five days there has been large-scale violence, arson, firing, hartals, casualties and what not. Things have truly fallen apart. Talking of the Irish crisis, British Prime Minister Disraeli had said: It is potatoes one day and Pope the next. Similar is the present position in Kashmir. Yesterday, it was Maqbool Butt; today it is Satanic Verses; Tomorrow it will be repression day and the day after it will be something else. The Chief Minister stands isolated. He has already fallen-politically as well as administratively; perhaps, only constitutional rites remain to be performed. His clutches are too soiled and rickety to support him. Personal aberrations have also eroded his public standing. The situation calls for effective intervention. Today may be timely, tomorrow may be too late.SUBVERSIONISTS SWELLAgain, in May, I expressed my growing anxiety: What is still more worrying is that every victory of subversionists is swelling their ranks, and the animosity is being diverted against the central authorities. But you chose not to do anything. Your inaction was mystifying. Equally mystifying was your reaction to my appointment for the second term. How could I suddenly become communal, anti-Muslim and what not?When I resigned in July 1989 there was no rancour. You wanted me to fight as your party candidate for the South Delhi Lok Sabha seat. Since I had general revulsion for the type of politics which our country had, by and large, come to breed, I declined the offer. If you had any serious reservation about my accepting the offer of J&K Governorship for the second term, you could have adopted the straightforward course and apprised me of your views. I would have thought twice before going into a situation which had virtually reached a point of no return. There would have been no need for you to resort to false accusations.May be you do not consider truth and consistency as virtues. May be you believe that the words inscribed on our national emblem  SatyamevaJayate  are mere words without meaning and significance for motivating the nation to proceed in the right direction and build a true and just India by true and just means. Perhaps power is all that matters to you  power by whichever means and at whatever cost.(To be continued)"

And soon, weather officials sent out a warning saying the deluge is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. While this would substantially reduce the citys current monsoon deficit of 44%, it has also brought cheer to hilsa lovers who have not been able to indulge in their favourite fish as much this season. Thanks to a dismal spell of rain, the supply of hilsa has remained largely affected this season. But with the current weather, theres no stopping Bengali foodies, who are all geared up for khichuri and ilish maachh bhaja for their Sunday lunch.I just bought a stock of 1,000 kg of ilish. Finally, I have some good stuff here, said Ratikanta Bar, a wholesale fish seller in Howrahs Kalibabur Bajar, on Saturday morning. So, after months of small, inferior catches, at last good-quality ilish has just started to come in. However, with the depression that set in on Bengal in the last two days, the fishermen boats are stationed in the harbours. There is a weather alert and no boat can go fishing now. It is a government instruction. If anyone disobeys, he has to pay a fine. But this is temporary. Since good fish has started coming in, I presume all the markets in Bengal will be stocked up with quality ilish in a weeks time, he added.Talking about the price of ilish here, he added, Any catch between 700-800 gm is available at around `800 per kg. We are selling one-kilo ilish at `1,200 per kg. Fish weighing 1.2 kilo to 1.5 kilo is available for about `1,500 per kg. There is absolutely no fish coming from Bangladesh. However, given the trend, now we are getting pretty big-size catches too.According to an official from the state fisheries department, until Friday, the amount of rainfall received here was rather low. So, the fishermen havent been able to get a good catch this season. But they expect the situation to improve by month-end. The current downpour that Kolkata is experiencing is a result of a cyclonic circulation over south Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh. We are hoping that the situation will improve by the end of August. With more rain, the supply of hilsa is expected to normalise. However, in between, small amounts of hilsa have been caught from the coasts of Digha and Diamond Harbour , said Chandra Nath Sinha, the West Bengal minister for fisheries. Actor Ritwick Chakraborty, who loves to gorge on ilish, said, ""While my father is from Dhaka, my mom is epar Banglar. So, ilish dishes at home have always been influenced by both the sides. I love the patla jhol of ilish or even bhapa. Even fried ilish along with steamed rice, mixed with the bhaja tel, is so appetising!""When do you say your ilish has gone bad? It is never when the curry is too jhaal or nunpora. Ask Bengalis and they will tell you that ilish goes bad only when it is not served in plenty.Way before the silver harvest started pinching a deeper hole in our pockets, a middle-class Bengali familys monsoon feast would include three to four varieties of the fish  ilish maach bhaja with ilish bhaja tel, begun diye kalo jeere-knachalonkar jhol and ilish maach bhaapa or shorshe ilish. Be it jora ilish on Saraswati Puja and special items on Jamai Sashthi, what the queen of fishes enjoys in Bengali households is pure love.While certain dishes of ilish, including shorshe bata, paturi, bhaja and bhape, are Bengalis staples, there are several other items that are as delish but do not enjoy the same popularity for their region of origin.In the eternal cultural fistfight between Ghoti and Bangal, ilish is one of the biggest stakeholders. While Bangals claim they can cook more than 400 different items, some unique dishes, including ilish maacher tok and posto ilish, were introduced by Ghotis. Santanu Bhattacharya  a Kolkata-based HR professional, who hails from East Midnapore  said ilish maacher tok is cooked regularly in his household. Besides shorshe bata ilish, my father prepares this chutney with tamarind pulp and ilish maacher matha. We have it with rice or on its own, he told us.Not just in Midnapore, in 24 Parganas too, the chutney is popular. Kakoli Bhattacharya, who hails from Bakhrahat, South 24 Parganas, said, I remember my mother making this chutney in our childhood. But none of our siblings were fond of it and, hence, she stopped making it. Instead, they lapped up a curry that had panch phoron (a mix of fenugreek seed, nigella seed, cumin seed, black mustard seed and fennel seed in equal parts). My mother used to make ilisher jhol with alu-begun and dhonebata (potato, aubergine and coriander seed paste). She would add a dash of mustard paste and after the jhol was done, she would temper it with paanch phoron. She would also make pui shak (Malabar spinach) with ilisher matha, Kakoli told us. The fishermen community of South 24 Parganas has a unique recipe for their time of sailing. Bimal Bera, owner of a couple of ilish-catching mechanised boats near Sagar, said, Our trawlers travel for over 18 hours at the average speed of 15 kmph. We travel almost 300 km from the harbour. There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Meanwhile, several households in other parts of Bengal use locally available ingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacing mustard with posto (poppy seed). We prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is common in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Ilish became hilsa in the kitchens of our colonial past. Not all British households in India could debone ilish with fork and knife and, hence, the khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire. British rulers are gone more than seven decades ago. However, smoked hilsa remains popular. Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later. It is seasonally available at some traditional restaurants in the Park Street area.While a lot of areas in Bengal have their own version of ilish preparations, many items have a strong Bangal influence too. Sandhya Roy , whose family hails from Barisal and is settled in the colony area of Garia, said their cooking involves garlic. We take a heavy-bottom pan with a lid. We lay about two banana leaves. On the top of the leaves we arrange the fish with garlic and kochu shak with mustard oil. We close the lid and put it on low flame. We often replace kochu shaak with mustard paste, Sandhya told us. The influence of Bangal recipes is visible in North Bengal, where nona ilish is common. Sayantan Sarkar, a businessman from Cooch Behar , claimed that his early memory of ilish mach is all about nona ilish  ilish dried with salt. We are from Mathabhanga and fresh ilish was not widely available in my childhood due to lack of proper roads and transportation. I remember my mother and grandmother preparing nona ilish with onion and garlic. I think the dried fish used to come from Assam. Now, we get a lot of fresh fish and, hence, the supply of nona ilish has gone down. Our staple fresh ilish preparation is with potol, jhinge and danta (pointed gourd, ridge gourd and drumstick)  an obvious influence of Purbo Bongo, he said. The post-Partition settlement in North Bengal has influenced the local peoples diet a lot. Mandabi Bhattacharyya, a city-based NGO worker, who hails from Jalpaiguri, said, Earlier, there used to be days in the festival season when people used to buy fish from the other side of the border at a cheap price. My father and uncles used to go there. Ilish maach is usually prepared with kalo-jeere (black cumin seeds) and aubergine. We temper it with fenugreek seeds and add diced pumpkin.The way she movesAccording to food writer Amitabha Malakar, every province has its own story of ilish. Take Sylhet and Noakhali for example. Ilisher shnutki is popular in both these places. In Sylhet, people make shnutki because of lack of availability of ilish. In Noakhali, people dry ilish for its abundance. The same happens with ilisher tok in this part of Bengal. In Midnapore and 24 Parganas, tok is made of tamarind pulp. As you move west, the same tok is made of chalta (elephant apple) and kamranga (star fruit). Some Bengali diaspora grill ilish like they grill salmon, he said.Several households are other parts of Bengal have made use of locally availableingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacingmustard with posto (poppy seed). We usually prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is prettycommon in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Not all British households in India could debone ilish with elan with fork and knife and, hence, their khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire... Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later. It is seasonally available at some traditional restaurants in the Park Street areaThe fishermen community of South 24 Parganas has a unique recipe for their time of sailing. Bimal Bera, owner of a couple of ilish-catching mechanised boats near Sagar, said, Our trawlers travel for over 18 hours at the average speed of 15 kmph. We travel almost 300 km from the harbour. There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Both my parents are Ghotis. At my house in Santiniketan, my mother makes two types of ilish. One is the bhapa preparation. For the other one, ilish is first fried and then put into a curry, which is made of tomato, ginger paste, coriander powder and kalo jeere. Salt and sugar are added as per taste. It is a light curry but tastes heavenly. For me, having ilish is a task, what with all the bones. I need someone to help me remove the bones from the fish. Ma amake kaanta bechhe daye. So, outside home, I prefer having boneless ilish only. Aparajita Ghosh, actressI am a die-hard ilish fan. Though I am a Ghoti, my wife is a Bangal. So, every ilish recipe cooked at our place will always have the Bangal essence. I am fond of all their hilsa dishes, but my most favourite is the one made with doi, kalo jeere and begun. This season, I have already had hilsa thrice. But since monsoon has just begun properly here, I look forward to gorging on a lot more hilsa in the coming days. During the rainy season, we make hilsa at home at least twice a week, if not more. I not only love eating this fish, but I have also learnt a lot of Bangal hilsa dishes from my wife and at times I like to prepare them myself too. Kharaj Mukherjee, actor"
2019-08-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/paddy-tube-wells-and-depleting-groundwater/article29112950.ece,"Paddy, tube wells and depleting groundwater: Why Punjab’s water resources are under strain","Gurmeet Singh, 60, a tall land-owning farmer in Bhattiwal Khurd village, which is located in Punjabs Sangrur district, has yet again planted the water-guzzling paddy crop this summer (kharif) as he is sceptical of any other crop fetching him a remunerative price.Standing on the edge of the Ghaggar branch canal, which flows barely a few metres away from his field, Gurmeet reveals that hardly anyone in the village irrigates his/her field with canal water. That is because motor-operated tube wells, with their powerful submersible pumps, have become an easy and preferred choice for most of the households to extract groundwater, he says.Punjabs policy of providing free electricity to farmers, in place since 1997, along with the Central governments favourable attitude towards paddy cultivation, are the key factors that have motivated farmers like Gurmeet to persist with paddy, despite the grave groundwater crisis faced by the State.Most of us here in the village have tube wells installed, be it on our farm or inside our houses. We use groundwater for irrigation, drinking and other domestic purposes. In 1977, we got our first tube well drilled at a depth of 35 ft-40 ft. Water at that time was easily available at 15 ft-20 ft. Since then, we have drilled as many as four tube wells as the water levels have been consistently falling. I got the latest one installed two years ago at around 300 ft. It cost me around 1,00,000, he says, his head dropping in despair as he mentions the high cost of his latest tube well.The green revolution impactGurmeets father Magar Singh, 90, intervenes to point out that farmers like him shifted to cultivation of rice and wheat during the hara inquilab (green revolution); till then, he says, crops like pulses, maize, vegetables and cotton were mainly grown in the village.Paddy (rice) requires far more water than other crops and as farmers started cultivating paddy, the need for tube wells arose. The extraction of groundwater only increased as farmers shifted from the use of monoblock pumps in the 1980s to other types like submersible pumps, he says.Ideally, groundwater should be available at a depth of 50 ft to 60 ft, but in Punjab, its level has significantly dropped to 150ft to 200 ft in most places. Many attribute this drastic fall to an indiscriminate extraction of groundwater in the last two decades.Further, deepening of tube wells, and purchase of the powerful motors to carry out the deepening, is costing farmers 1,100 crore per year, according to government data. The State, which gives free power to farmers, is also facing an increased financial burden due to the rising use of electricity. This year, the total power subsidy to the farm sector is estimated at 9,674 crore.To counter this, the Punjab State Farmers Policy, drafted by the States Farmers and Farm Workers Commission in June last year, suggested rationalising of power subsidy and asked the government to restrict the subsidy to the non-income tax payee farmers. It also recommended that cultivation of paddy on common lands be disallowed. Common (shamlat) village lands, whose utilisation is regulated under Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act 1961, have been increasingly used for paddy cultivation over the years. Experts feel that a restriction on such usage can help arrest groundwater depletion. The government, however, is yet to take a final call on these policy proposals.The Punjab government is well aware of the fast depleting groundwater reserves. Last month, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh directed the State Planning Board to chalk out a comprehensive crop diversification model. The Board was also directed to undertake a detailed review of the various schemes of the agriculture department to bring in much-needed reforms in the sector.The Chief Minister, who has been stressing the need to prioritise the cultivation of crops that consume less water like maize, cotton and sugar cane, asked the Board to come up with a strategy to persuade the farmers to shift to these crops.However, while the State government has been advocating crop diversification to save groundwater, farmers dont seem to be keen on shifting to other crops unless they are given an assured market and a guaranteed price for their produce. I am aware that paddy consumes more water than other crops but what is the alternative? Government agencies purchase rice and wheat (during rabi season) at the minimum support price (MSP), which assures me of a remunerative return. But in the case of other crops, theres hardly any such assurance. The government should purchase all major crops at MSP as is done in case of rice and wheat; until then, it's difficult to shift, says Randhir Singh, 51, who grows paddy at his three-acre farm in Bhattiwal Khurd village.This sentiment is echoed in other parts of the State as well. In Fatehpur village, located in the Chief Ministers pocket borough of Patiala, Karamjeet Singh says that after suffering financial loss owing to a price crash in the market, he stopped the cultivation of potato a few years ago. Three years ago, I planted a potato crop in my field but prices in the market crashed badly. The potato was fetching as low as 2 per kilo in the market. I couldnt even recover the cost of my crop and suffered a loss of around 3,00,000. Since then, I have stopped its cultivation and have been sowing rice and wheat, for which I am assured of getting a remunerative price as government agencies will purchase my produce at the MSP, he says, as he takes a seat along with his fellow farmers at the public shed in the village.Wrong to blame farmersAs the farmers beat the heat and humidity of an August afternoon under a fan mounted on the sheds ceiling, Ajaib Singh, 62, points out that it is wrong to blame farmers for groundwater depletion. There are industries and factories that are extracting a huge amount of groundwater  legally and illegally. Not only this, the unsystematic disposal of waste from these industries is contaminating the water, making it increasingly alkaline, he says.For Dilbag Singh, 43, usage of water from the Kherimala branch (canal), which flows barely three km from the village, is an affordable and doable way to reduce dependence on groundwater. The government needs to upgrade and work on maintenance of canal irrigation system. It needs to ensure the supply of water at tail-ends [the last part of the water outlet]. If an underground pipeline system can be laid, it will help us optimise water use. Also, it will check the theft of canal water, he says.Farmers like me are using tube wells because its an easy way of extracting water with powerful submersible pumps these days, but if the government develops a mechanism and lays a pipeline till my farm, why would I need to invest in a tube well? I remember we used to get water in canal outlets and also from wells for irrigation during the 1980s, but now almost every house in the village has a tube well, says Kesar Singh, 52, who has sown rice in his five-acre farm.Another rice-growing farmer, Nirmal Singh, who is a farmer leader as well, points out that the government needs to focus on establishing an assured market mechanism. What farmers want is a market  where the purchase of their products is guaranteed and they get an assured remunerative price, he says.Punjabs economy is highly dependent on agriculture. The sector. however, is experiencing slower growth as the States cropping intensity and irrigation potential have been fully exploited and the growth in productivity has also reached a saturation point.The intensive groundwater extraction in the last five decades through installation of shallow tube wells is reflected in tube well numbers  which have increased by almost 200% in 35 years, from six lakh in the 1980s to 14.76 lakh in 2017-18. Also, the area under rice cultivation has increased from 11.83 lakh hectares in 1980 to 28.86 lakh hectares in 2017-18. On an average, there are 34 tube wells per sq. km of net sown area in Punjab (2015-16).According to the Draft Dynamic Ground Water Estimation Report-2017, 109 blocks out of the 138 blocks taken for its study were over-exploited, two blocks were critical and five blocks were semi-critical while 20 blocks are in safe category. The water table was declining in nearly 80% of the area of the State.The report also said that while the annual replenishable groundwater resource in Punjab was about 17.5 million acre-ft (MAF), the annual draft (extraction) was 29 MAF, implying that the extraction rate outstripped availability by quite a few notches.If this trend continues, it will adversely affect the agricultural economy of the State and it is apprehended that irrigated area may decrease by up to 15% in the year 2025. Further, in the coming 20 years, supply from about 60% of top aquifers may be jeopardised. There will be an increase in the cost of raising crops, placing an increased financial burden on farmers and the government. A shortage in water supply could also act as a deterrent when it comes to investment in industries requiring water. Around 30 million residents of the Punjab region may face a collapse in agricultural output, says S.K. Saluja, Superintending Engineer, Directorate of Ground Water Management.Salinity in waterThe report also raised concerns about the deteriorating quality of groundwater due to pollution caused by urbanisation, industrialisation and an increased use of fertilisers and pesticides. It said that while nearly 50%-60% of groundwater was fresh and fit, 20%-30% was moderately saline and of marginal quality. Further, about 15%-25% of the groundwater was saline, alkaline and not fit for irrigation.Water in south and southwestern districts  like Sangrur, Muktsar, Bathinda and Mansa  came under the last category, containing varying concentration of soluble salts and its use for irrigation will adversely affect agricultural production, said the report.Farmers in Fatehpur, Patiala, looking at an abandoned well, which once used to be a major water source for irrigation but has now run dry due to over-extraction of groundwater.An increased awareness about the need for safe drinking water has caused many households in Bhattiwal Khurd village to install RO (reverse osmosis) water purification systems. I felt the need for RO system at my home after my family members started falling ill due to water-borne diseases at regular intervals. We have been consuming groundwater directly from tube wells for a long time, says Randhir Singh.Untreated industrial effluentsP.S. Rangi, a noted agriculture economist and a former adviser to Punjab State Farmers Commission, says that water quality is being impacted by untreated or inadequately treated industrial effluents and sewage that flows into rivulets and rivers in Punjab.Also, traditional water bodies such as ponds and wells in the villages are under threat. In most of the places, ponds have been filled and encroached upon while in other places, they have become a dumping ground for sewage. The problem is further compounded by the mixing of storm water and sewage in various municipal towns. The pollution and contamination of water resources due to industrial waste, sewage and excessive use of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a major cause of concern that needs immediate attention, says Rangi.Given the grim situation, Punjabs Department of Water Supply and Sanitation is planning to implement 10 surface water projects at a cost of 1,021 crore. These projects intend to provide potable piped water supply to 1,021 quality-affected villages, making them less reliant on groundwater and more on canal water.A total of 130 such villages  including 85 uranium-affected villages in Moga and 45 iron-affected ones in Roopnagar  have so far been shifted from groundwater to canal water.Lakhwinder Singh, professor of economics at Punjabi University, Patiala, who has been mapping rural Punjab for decades, asserts that agriculture in the State thrived in the past due to easy availability of both groundwater and surface water but, over the past few years, the availability has reached a saturation point.Increase in indebtednessSuccessive State governments invested on drainage systems that saved crops from damage in the case of heavy and untimely rains. Over the years, due to an incentivising of groundwater irrigation by the government and an irrational increase in the number of electric tube wells, water tables have receded. Experts have been time and again cautioning the State on the long-term consequences of excessive exploitation of groundwater. Now, farmers are forced to borrow from informal and formal sources to install tube wells, causing indebtedness and farmer suicides, says Lakhwinder, adding that that faulty public policy and irrational cropping system should be blamed for the scenario.Governments never visualised a scenario where agriculture would block the natural groundwater recharging process and create conditions for falling water tables, he says.He proposes that the drainage system be used for artificial recharge of groundwater. There is also a dire need to change the cropping pattern, especially in major parts of Malwa, which need to take up cotton cultivation again, he says, adding that water recharging system, if put in place, can solve weather-related problems and economic incentives can be used to change farmers mindsets, making them shift to multi-cropping system.He feels that a major policy shift with long term vision can solve both the agrarian crisis and the problem of water depletion.Realising the magnitude of agrarian crises, the draft policy framed by Punjabs Farmers and Farm Workers Commission points out that a decade of business as usual has left farmers in an unenviable position.The policy strikes a cautious note in telling that the State is struggling to meet the aspirations of its farmers and the time has come to take a critical look at the deteriorating resources, the changing economic environment and the emerging market scenarios."

2019-08-22,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/olive-and-twists-insta-worthy-cafe-and-its-cloud-kitchens/article29220122.ece,Olive and Twist’s Insta-worthy cafe and its cloud kitchens,"Our first cloud kitchen opened in June 12 this year. By June 12 next year, we plan to have at least 24 to 27 branches functioning across Chennai, says Farhaz Ahammed, operations head of Olive and Twist Hospitality, the latest food and beverage name in town.Over the past three months, the team has already had a caf  the experimental Canvas By Sketch  a co-working space called One Vibe, above the caf in Alwarpet, and two cloud kitchens up and running in Nungambakkam. Two more cloud kitchens, one focussing on simple South Indian fare and another on desserts and bakery items, are in the pipeline.Our cloud kitchens are essentially different brands operating out of the same physical kitchen. The food is delivered within a five-kilometre radius, says Farhaz. Though each serves a different cuisine, the focus is comfort food.Mirchi Bazaar focusses on North Indian cuisines, from parathas to dum biryanis, while Curry on Fire is Asian. Our third cloud kitchen, called South Market by Sketch, will also operate out of the same kitchen, he adds.Sketch is the name of an outdoor catering company that is one of many brands under Apollo Sindoori Hospitality.But though it is owned by Sindoori Reddy, the woman behind Apollo Sindoori Hospitality and her business partner Sameer Sethi, the team behind Olive and Twist hastens to reiterate that they are not connected to the older group.They prefer, instead, to be seen as the new and adventurous kid on the block, and Chef Arul Santosh has a large role to play in creating this image.The man is responsible for training cooks and creating menus for all the initiatives under Olive and Twist Hospitality. He reiterates Farhazs statement about the cloud kitchens, saying, The menus in these are limited, and include the staple favourites. The idea here is not to experiment, but focus instead on standardising across different cities. I can guarantee that it will all taste familiar and authentic, right down to using just the right amount of butter in the dal makhani. Expect favourites like bhuna gosht and paneer butter masala from Mirchi Bazaar, as well as Thai curries, momos and manchurians from Curry on Fire.Its in Canvas by Sketch, adds the chef, that he channels his innovations. From customising preparations for allergies and diet choices to tweaking preparations and playing with coffee brews, this caf is his experimental playground, so to speak. We toss our wontons in chilli sauce, instead of just serving the sauce alongside, he says by way of example.The innovations also show in choice of ingredients, like zucchini zoodles and potato starch instead of refined flour. Then there are the pizzettes, with thin crispy crusts and Mediterranean-inspired toppings.The creativity at Canvas doesnt restrict itself to the kitchen, it can also be seen in the chic interiors, from pink flamingo murals to a number of Instagrammable corners.Blatantly targetted at millenials and Gen Z, this cafe is the more clear reflection of the young energy that the group as a whole is trying to put out.For now, though, the main focus of the team is in expansion of the cloud kitchens. We can only take orders and deliver food through delivery apps, says Farhaaz, But once we have enough different kitchens to coordinate among, we will hire delivery personnel, and move to our very own app."

Members of various depressed sections of society had issued warnings against the demolition.On Wednesday, lakhs of people from Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and several other states assembled in Ramlila grounds to register their protest. They argued that if Ram temple couldn't be relocated from Ayodhya, why the followers of Ravidas should allow the 500-year-old temple to be relocated.""Those who are asking us to simply relocate our temple, are often the same people who have been agitating for Ram Mandir for the past several decades. Why the double standards when it comes to the rights of schedule castes?"" asks Rakesh Bahadur, executive president, All India Ambedkar Mahasabha, who led a number of protesters from Haryana to Delhi.However, the protest ended up being discussed not for its central demand - the reinstatement of Ravidas temple by November 26 following which Dalit organisations across the country have threatened a pan-India protest - but for the violence that unfolded in various parts of the city late night.Police detained several protesters, including Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, and alleged that the protesters became ""unruly and violent"". However some Dalit leaders who participated in Wednesday's protests blame the state for the incidents of violence.""Our agitation does not run on hired goons. Our agitation was a result of a genuine pain that people from across the country felt at the demolition of the temple of our revered saint. Similar colour was given to our Bharat Bandh protests on April 2 last year when violence was forced upon us,"" said Ashok Bharti, a Dalit rights activist.He added: ""And yesterday (Wednesday) also the same modus operandi was followed. If we remained ""ruly"" throughout the day - during the agitation at Ramlila Maidan - and other places, why would we commit violence at the end of a long day?""Binoy Korivi, a Dalit activist and member of Dalit Bahujan Group, who led a team of protesters from Andhra Pradesh, said there is a separate cult among the scheduled castes for Saint Ravidas because there is no space in the larger Hindu society for him. He is not like an ordinary TV guru for us. Please understand he's our spiritual guru.""If the argument, based on which the demolition of the temple has been carried out, that it was built on forest land is to be implemented across the board, Korivi argued, then you would have to also demolish the Sabarimala temple, Tirupati temple, Jaggi Vasudev's Coimbatore ashram and the Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga located in Srisailam, Andhra Pradesh.""The legacy and teachings of Ravidasji are part of our culture. Most of the people from depressed sections of the society classes are followers of Ravidasji's teachings. This is an issue of faith of over 30 crore people,"" Korivi said.For now, all the protesters have returned to their homes. Dalit organisations say they will stick to the deadline of November 26. If the government doesn't rebuild the temple by then, a pan-India agitation would follow, they threaten. With assembly elections scheduled in Haryana and Delhi, the Ravidas issue could become a political hot potato as well.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

I could cook only a few chappatis and had to serve them with salt,"" the elderly cook said. Mirzapur District Magistrate (DM) Anurag Patel blamed the teachers for the mismanagement .""As per the orders by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath the menu of mid-day meals across the districts is fixed.

A month ago, the tuber was being sold at Rs 15 to Rs 20-a-kg.Traders attributed the rise in price to floods in Maharashtra and Karnataka besides ongoing strike by truckers in West Bengal.Odisha is largely dependent on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in floods in two major onion producing States.A trader at the Unit-I market said the State is not getting the commodity from Nashik, Bengaluru and Tadepalligudem (Andhra Pradesh) as per demand.We are now completely dependent on Nashik where the onion was priced Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,200 per quintal. What can we do if the product is highly-priced at the source? The price may come down after the arrival of new crop from Andhra Pradesh, he said.Similarly, potato price also witnessed a rise of 20 per cent due to the truckers strike in WB. The commodity, which was being sold Rs 12-a-kilo, is now priced Rs 15 in the retail market.Since there is a huge gap between demand and supply, the retail price is bound to increase. The State Government has warned traders against hoarding. The officials have been asked to keep a close watch on hoarders and black marketers.Meanwhile, workers of Samajwadi Party led by its State president Rabindra Nath Behera staged a demonstration on Thursday demanding check on onion and potato price."

The incident has been reported from Pethiya village which is part of Machauri Raiyat village panchayat in Harsud area.A self-help group (SHG) Bismillah Swayamshayata Samuh operated by middle-aged woman Shanno (she is also the cook of MDM) had been tasked since last few years with preparing MDM to students at a primary school and a middle school with 100-plus students.A food department team which inspected the MDM at the two schools in Pethiya village on Thursday allegedly spotted that the meal wasnt being cooked in the room allocated for that purpose in the school premises. Instead the MDM was being prepared by Shanno in her house since a fortnight.Also, the inspection revealed that instead of cooking the stipulated Pulao and Karhi for the students, the SHG head and MDM cook Shanno had cooked Pulao (preparation from rice and boiled potatoes) only for the students of the two schools.Further inspection of the place where Shanno was cooking the MDM in her house, led the food department team to a steel box containing animal fat, which is suspected to have been used for cooking the MDM for school students  in violation of norms which make it mandatory for MDM to be cooked in edible oil fortified with Vitamin A and Vitamin D.The food department inspection which was caught on camera inside Shannos house shows Shanno telling the officials that she had kept the goat fat in the box for cooking food in her house and not MDM for school.But sensing something fishy in the matter, the team collected samples of the Pulao cooked for MDM as well as the animal fat remains kept in the steel box for further lab testing.Primarily it had come to our notice that adulterated food was being served by the SHG as MDM in the school, after which the food department team has seized MDM and other samples, which have been sent to Bhopal for lab testing. Till the time the findings of lab testing are known, the concerned SHG has been removed from the task for preparing MDM and alternative arrangements for MDM are being made. If the lab test deliver adverse report, action will be initiated against the concerned SHG as per the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, Khandwa district panchayat chief executive officer Roshan Singh said on Friday.Importantly, in Hinauta village of East UPs Mirzapur district, instead of balanced diet, salt and chapatis were reportedly served to students of a government school in the name of MDM. Coming to know about it, the district authorities suspended a teacher of the school and launched a probe into the incident on Thursday."

During the 2014 elections, he twice came to our shop and relished the Amritsari kulchas and lassi.

Part of Jaitley's family had moved from Lahore, while his maternal relatives belonged to Amritsar. He had many relatives in Amritsar and many old memories too. He knew each and every nook and corner of the city and all the shops where good food is available. He spoke fluent Punjabi at home. Whenever anyone from Punjab visited him in Delhi for any work, it used to be done immediately. His wife Sangeeta Jaitley was born in Amritsar.""In a Facebook post titled ""The Campaign Diary - 30th April, 2014"", he elaborated on his love for Amritsari food.

Having spent past six weeks in Amritsar campaign in this heat, it will be time for me now to move to other states where elections are still being held.

The kulcha Chana is a preferred menu for breakfast, lunch or even dinner.""""Breakfast in Amritsar is still the stuffed Parantha or the Poori Chhole. The city has a tradition where households still prefer to outsource the poori chhole from the famous Halwais rather than cook it at home. Most parts in the old city have their own special Halwais. But the most famous one in the city isnow Kanahiya at Lawrence Road. The chanas are mixed with potatoes for the curry preparation. This breakfast is highly recommended but should be taken rarely because of its high caloric value,"" he added.He further wrote, ""The Amritsari Lassi is available at most of these Halwai shops. But Ahuja and Gyan have acquired a special reputation. Either of them will provide an excellent treatment for insomnia. Kesar still continues to dominate the vegetarian preparations. It enjoys a reputation for beingthe most famous dhaba in the city. Bharawan with its chain of dhabas, under the name of Bharawan or Brothers, is also recommended for vegetarian food for the tourists and the locals.""For the non-vegetarians, it is Surjit all the way. His Tandoori chicken, Amritsari fish and mutton champs (cooked like Old English cutlets) are highly delicious. The Makhan fish has been a gourmets delight. What I have not tried so far but has been recommended to me is Beera known also for its high-quality chicken,"" he stated.Jaitley wrote, ""The morning tea at the Giani Tea Stall initiates the entire gossip which circulates in the entire city.

Copies of the notifications were made available on Saturday.Zero toleranceThe move was preceded by Education Minister Partha Chatterjee earlier asserting that the government will do everything to ensure children get the proper kind of midday meal and there will be zero tolerance to any attempt to deprive children of their prescribed meal."
2019-08-26,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-kovalam-has-emerged-as-the-surfing-destination-of-asia/article29260583.ece,Dancing with the waves at Kovalam,"The last of the competitive standup paddlers finish their laps. The sun begins her slow descent. Then, the drumming begins.The cajons, and didgeridoos follow, all played by one man, coaxing revellers closer to the stage. Among them are professional surfers from across Asia, unwinding after a long day of competing under the intense Kovalam sun. It is day two of the seventh edition of Covelong Point Surf, Music and Yoga Festival and in that moment, it is Israeli musician Yogev Haruvi is determined to ensure everyone has a good time.Today, the festival attracts professional surfers from different countries year after year, competing, partying, mingling with athletes and partygoers from across the country.A major driving force is the enterprise of the home team, most of whom are fishermen from the village. One of our students from last year was a medallist at the National Under-16 level this year, says Sekar Patchai, pointing out one of the many success stories of Covelong Point Surf School founded by Murthy Megavan with Arun Vasu of the TTK Group years ago. A product of the school himself, Sekar is an international level standup paddler and a Kovalam boy through and through. As he speaks in the quieter confines of a board room that stocks surfboards, muffled away from the raucous chatter of people feasting, drinking and enjoying the night, it is clear that he has seen the festival grow before his eyes.Seven years ago a casual discussion between Arun Vasu, Murthy Meghavan and Yotam Agam resulted in this fest, fusing surf, music and yoga. In the early years, we had to have big musical names and yoga to draw people in. Now, though the music and yoga are still good, people come here for the surfing, he says proudly, adding that international participation has risen steadily. Sekars statement is backed by Arun: Weve had 200 surfers participating this year, of whom 35 are from outside India.What does the presence of global athletes mean to the local talent participating here? Well, people like me can teach the children to an extent. We need guidance and tips too, and just sitting back to interact with surfers from other countries for a couple of hours helps so much, says Sekar, rattling off a list of manoeuvres that surfers from Maldives, Bali, Thailand, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have taught him. Cut back: which is in the shape of an eight; bottom turn: where you go down and turn a 360; aerial: where you go riding ahead and hit a point that lets you jump... His list goes on and his fingers keep tracing out move after move on his palm, as if it were the sea.Whats going on? Balance the windOn the beach, over three days of the festival, were setups for spike ball, obstacle course racing, Ultimate Frisbee, slacklining and trapezing.Trapezing is a sailing technique, and was being demonstrated by Asian Games medallists KC Ganapathay and Varun Thakkar, on their trusty 49-er sailboat perched on the sands. Most boats have one line, but this one is twin trapeze since the boat is so powerful, with its massive sail, explains Ganapathay. Trapezing is basically hanging from the trapeze line, to help balance the boat against the wind  a challenging task that involves putting your weight against the taut line.Wild Warrior Races also set up a 100-metre, 10-obstacle long course. Approximately 200 people attempted to qualify on Saturday, and the eight fastest were selected among men and women [for the finals on Sunday], says Varun Gunaseelan, co-founder of Wild Warriors. The hardest obstacle was a floating peg board leading into a warrior transfer, which contained a rope and hanging rings at different heights.Go localLooking up from the roasting a corn cob at her stall in the Village Santhai, Shabana Begum is waiting for the bands to take a break, so that she gets more customers. I live nearby, she says,  And I have been seeing this festival take place for the last two years. This time, I thought I could also set up a stall here, and earn more money. Having consulted with Sekar Patchai, she invested 5,000 in the stall. Much like Shabana, there are many others from the fishing community here with stalls selling ice golas, spring potatoes and chaat. The most popular stalls, however, were those selling freshly caught and fried fish, calamari, praws and crab, all slathered in the local red masala and dusted with chilli powder.Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes is attempting to convince surfers from Australia to participate in the fest. Rhodes has been an ambassador of the festival right since its inception, and never misses an edition or a chance to ride Kovalams waves. While local students sometime seem unimpressed by the waves here, when they see people from outside India doing great in their own backyard, they realise they cant make any excuses for not performing just as well, Rhodes says, perched on the arm of a chair on the balcony of Surf Turf, which offers a vista of the beach and the main stage, from where tunes of musical performance after performance float up.Looking EastArun is proud of the surfing possibilities this stretch of the East coast offers: India is still mystical to a lot of the surfers coming here, he says. Andaman and Lakshadweep have world class waves, but access to them is still difficult. Which is where, Kovalam comes in.Sekar says the waves make Kovalam and Mamallapuram very special for surfers. The rocks underwater at Kovalam are structured such that big waves get created when the sea hits them, he says. The sunken temples around Mamallapuram also create the same impact, he adds.It also helps that the fest is associated with Surfing Federation of India (SFI) and the International Surfing Association, the latter being recognised by the International Olympics Committee. So this is an Asia level contest, and those who win here officially have the standing to compete in events abroad, Sekar says.The festival has boosted the economy of the area; local markets see crowds 15,000-strong, homestays find takers and local autorickshaws are hired to ferry participants. This, according to Rhodes, is a big reason for the festivals success: surfers simply feel welcome here. We can never be sure of the waves in a place, but we can always be sure of the Indian hospitality."

Tuta Absoluta is a South American moth that rapidly began spreading in India in 2014. It can lead to loss of 100 per cent yield of tomatoes.When we conducted studies, we found that these insects get attracted to the colour yellow. We designed a system where an incandescent light bulb is placed above the plant to attract both male and female insects. Soap water or water containing pesticide is placed at the bottom. Alternatively, a suction is placed with a mesh below, instead of the soapy water bowl. The insects get attracted to the light, hit the surface, lose balance and fall into the mesh or bowl, said Dr V Sridhar, principal scientist and secretary, Division of Entomology and Nematology, IIHR.We applied for a patent a few days ago but have already shared the technology with farmers from across the country, Sridhar said, adding, The same technology can be used in open conditions with a few modifications. For one acre, four or five light traps are enough. Tuta is more active from 7-11pm. The light-cum-suction trap is being patented. Suction mechanism enhances the trapping efficiency of adult insects.Though tomato is the main host, Tuta can also attack other hosts, like potato, eggplant, tobacco etc. Young larvae mine into tomato leaves, apical buds, stalks or fruits. Feeding results in blotches and pinholes on fruit which are generally covered with the frass (excrement of larvae). In one to two months, the technology will be commercially available. This method is part of a larger Integrated Pest Management (IPM) module developed by the institute.We have been popularising the technology among farmers by training them in it. Weve had farmers from Kolar, Andhra Pradesh border, Maharashtra and other states as well. As this is an emerging insect, not many farmers are aware of it. It can multiply in lakhs within one week. This can cut down cost and affect chemical sprays used by farmers, said another scientist from the institute."

Traders claimed that the supply has been affected post rains and they are bound to sell vegetables at a higher price to meet their ends meet.The retail rates of onion , brinjal, pumpkin, bottle gourd and okra have seen a slight increase. The price of tomatoes has been slashed by 50%, whereas prices of vegetables such as cucumber and potatoes remained the same.Apparently, the wholesale prices have also seen a sharp rise as onions used to cost Rs 20 per kg earlier as compared to Rs 30 per kg now. Brinjal was of Rs 300 for 18kg to 20kg, but its price has touched Rs 500. On the other hand, same quantity of bottle gourd costs Rs 300 which was earlier Rs 100.One of the traders, who sells potato at Rs 20 per kg, claimed that: Potato is stored in a large quantity before the monsoons so its price was not affected, but the quality has been compromised. Only the supply of pahari potato has been affected due to the monsoons.Tomato is being sold for Rs 40 per kg as compared to the last week when it was sold for Rs 80 per kg. But in Mohali , it is being sold at Rs 50 to 60 per kg.Tomatoes are supplied from Solan and due to the recent landslide the supply has been affected as all the vehicles couldnt reach the city. Only 100 crates were delivered. Now, after the roads have been cleared, 200 crates have been delivered and the rates have gradually decreased, said Shiv Kumar, a tomato vendor.Onions were being sold for Rs 20 per kg before the monsoons and then the prices increased to Rs 30 per kg last week. But it now costs Rs 50 per kg and the quality has also been compromisedRate of bottle gourd has seen an increase of three times and is being sold for Rs 30 now. Brinjal was being sold for Rs 50 as compared to last week at Rs 30.Traders who sell it have faced a major loss as they are now bound to sell only one vegetable as they cannot afford to buy four different vegetables due to the prise rise.Cucumber has seen no such increase in its price and is being sold for Rs 40 from the past one month.Pumpkin which has only a limited number of buyers was being sold for Rs 10 per kg and costed Rs 20 per kg last week. It is now priced at Rs 30 per kg.Okra was being sold for Rs 60 per kg last week and is now being sold for Rs80 per kg."

This issue has also been discussed at several meetings. The government would consider their demand, he said.Mr. Prakash said that the situation in the district was serious and the farmers have suffered badly due to the loss of standing crops. There were incidents of house collapse and loss of property. During the interaction with the farmers it was found that they have suffered severe losses. In one case it was found that a farmer has lost entire quantity of crops on his 32 acres of farm land. However, the total loss needs to the assessed as the set parameters. This is the first visit and the team would pay one more visit after receiving the memorandum by the State government, he said.Mr. Prakash has appreciated the district administration and the State Government officials for competently handling the situation during the heavy and floods, particularly, the rescue operation and relief works.The team has visited different villages and received first hand information about the loss of crops, private and public properties. The team has Alagawadi village of Navalgund taluk and received information about the damage caused to the district major road, bridge and crops like brinjal, green gram, maize, potato, sunflower and cotton.In Kiresur village, the team members have visited the fields of the farmers which have been submerged during the floods causing crop losses due to the crop loss and interacted with the women. Later, they visited the Unkal, Hanumanth Nagar and Devi Nagar areas in Hubballi where the bridges and other public properties have been damaged. In Gokul village, the team has visited the areas where houses have been damaged during the floods. They also visited several other places.Team members S.C.

As the river kept growing wider on the eastern side, the flow of water nearly stopped on the opposite side facing Okkal region. What remains of the Periyar on that side is water left brownish, stagnant, lifeless; of Okkal Thuruth is a 60-acre landmass left extremely vulnerable by years of indiscriminate sand mining.After the State government clamped down on sand mining in various rivers in Kerala in 2015, mining along Okkal Thuruth, near Perumbavoor, came to a stop. But, the harm had already been done, say islanders. Every monsoon, more land erodes, especially in the absence of a protective outer wall. For two consecutive years now, the island, despite its location several metres above the river level, has faced heavy flooding. Last year, when water threatened to sink the entire island, all the residents were shifted to relief camps in a daring rescue operation. The floodwaters only wash away more soil, says Lisha Dinesh, who lives close to the banks.The bridge connecting the island to neighbouring Okkal.

VibhuWith every passing year, more residents are deserting their houses on the island and shifting to safer locations. Out of the 32 families that lived at Okkal Thuruth earlier, only 22 remain. While several people build houses on other shores with the money they earned by aiding sand mining, some of us cannot afford to shift, says Sasi M.K., a resident. The islands susceptibility to flooding and land erosion discourages outsiders from buying land here, he adds.However, 78-year-old Ammini, who shifted to nearby Perumattom more than 10 years ago, visits her abandoned house every single day. Sitting on its verandah, sorting the nutmegs she picked from her garden, she says, My husband and I underwent a lot of hardship to build this. Each brick that became our home, was brought in boats. I cannot bring myself to abandon it. Every family here shares a similar history of woe.It was only 10 years ago that a small bridge came up at the island connecting it to neighbouring Okkal. Until then, boats were the only means of commute for the residents. However, the bridge was built too low and more as a stopgap to ease the immediate transportation problem. During the monsoon, when water rises in the Periyar, the low-lying bridge is the first to be submerged, leaving the residents marooned. The bridge must be reconstructed immediately and its height raised, says ward member Anwar Marakkar. According to him, all families on the island earlier owned boats that enabled them to get to the other side. When the bridge was built, people gave up their boats. The government should also consider starting a ferry service for the islanders as an alternative means of transport, says he.Another facility that needs to be renovated on the island is the drinking water supply system maintained by the panchayat. Water is supplied to all houses free of cost from a water tank connected to a common well. With the river stagnating on one side, the handful of wells is drying up, says Marakkar.Though sand mining was suspended in the Periyar along Okkal Thuruth in 2015, more land erodes every monsoon in the absence of a protective outer wall. Despite its location several metres above the river level, the island has faced heavy ooding for two consecutive years. | Photo Credit: H.

Jalaja Vasu, now 70, remembers that when she reached Okkal Thuruth nearly 50 years ago as a young bride, the islanders depended on the river for drinking water.The island abounds with nutmeg trees, and on the courtyards of most houses are batches of nutmegs and maces laid out for drying. The islanders are also engaged in cultivating plantain and various vegetables including Chinese potato and cowpea. There is a lot of demand for these pesticide-free vegetables cultivated on riverine soil, says Suresh. However, the recent floods have caused huge losses to the farmers here. Ramanan, a small-time farmer, says he has lost his plantain cultivation for two consecutive years now.Earlier, most people on the island and nearby Okkal were involved in bamboo and reed weaving. Traders from far and near would arrive here with their bamboo and reed. It became a place where they would get together (orumikkuka in Malayalam). Gradually, the word orumikkuka was shortened to okkal and that is how the region earned its name. And the island nearby became Okkal Thuruth, says Suresh.There is on the island a Sree Narayana Guru Temple, near the spot where the spiritual leader and social reformer is believed to have sat in meditation. All the families on the island belong to the Ezhava community. It is believed that four members of the community were brought to the island by the erstwhile Cochin royal family as hirelings and the current occupants are their successors. Suresh says that for the royalty, the island was a summer retreat, from where they could travel to the nearby Aluva Mahadeva Temple to offer prayers. The island also hosts the Okkal Sivarathri festival annually, a tradition begun 27 years ago to help protect the riverbanks from sand mining.While the residents collectively own 20 acres at Okkal Thuruth, the remaining 40 acres are government land. Though an ambitious tourism project was proposed several years ago, nothing has materialised. Suresh believes that the islands location, surrounded by the Periyar on all sides, and its proximity to the Cochin International Airport (which is 7 km away) and the Aluva Manappuram make it ideal for destination tourism.The development of tourism is also the only hope for those remaining on Okkal Thuruth. They believe it will bring jobs and also improve infrastructure on the sinking landmass. Life here is difficult during the monsoon. Otherwise, it is a beautiful, tranquil place, says Sasi."

Villagers Gurmeet Singh Kumbran, Kamalpreet Singh Bunny, Jagdish Singh Kumbran, Narinder Bibu, Jagtar Singh Kumbran, and Rakesh Lakhotra led the protesters who cordoned the business and forced it shut. Gurmeet Singh Kumbran said: We left stray cattle at the outlets door to discourage people from drinking.The residents of Sector 69 have long been after Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) and the excise department to close down this liquor shop in their neighbourhood to keep youth away from alcohol. They accuse the two offices of conniving with the liquor mafia to allow this business. Kamalpreet Singh Bunny said: We gave them time until August 9 to close the shop, but they failed and forced us to lock it. If the shop stays, we will now protest in front of the Gmada and excise department offices.Mohali Housing Society president Gurlzar Singh said: Even months of protesting failed to move the authorities concerned. It was ridiculous to open a liquor shop in a residential area. What is worse, it was opened adjoining a hospital and a temple. Who approves these decisions? Resident Kamlesh Kaur said: The colonys boys and young men have taken to drinking since the shop opened. The government is making drunkards in order to make revenue. The excise department said: The shop is licenced and far outside the forbidden residential zone.

I feel lucky because I got to be deep in everything from the inception to the construction and interiors to the menu decisions to the branding, says Kasim proudly, Ive learned so much and I have Conu to thank for exposing me to much of that before this.Kasim Ali Khan of Farine | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniHe also jokes about getting messy on the construction site, showing no job is too small for him as an entrepreneur.So how does Farine set itself apart? Its not like Conu but it does breathe a little bit of the same air, as expected. We have the same desserts menu as Conu, and everything is carefully brought in daily from the central kitchen which is pretty close. We are working on expanding the kitchen but we wont let that slow us down.Not just sweetSavoury-wise, Farine has a compact but diverse menu for many palates. Divided into Small Plates and Big Plates, it proves the team wants to start off slowly and build organic growth to the menu rather than overwhelm straight off the bat. The small plates menu offers dishes like the very Instagrammable watermelon and feta salad with a raspberry vinaigrette, pita pockets in both vegetarian and chicken variants and a number of other eats such as Peri Peri fries and bruschetta.Beef burger and French fries on Farines Big Plates menu | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniI dive straight into the bigger plates. First a beef burger nestled between soft and fresh buns (I wouldnt expect anything less from a place whose name literally means flour) and teamed with sliced gherkins, slightly tangy cheese and fresh lettuce. A good beef burger doesnt need to be fancy and the meat should speak for itself; the one at Farine ticks all the boxes here. The meat isnt dry to the point of chewiness, the buns stay neatly intact and the combined flavours are moan-worthy.As if the burger wasnt enough, a plate of honey-glazed chicken with sprinklings of rosemary, along with mashed potatoes is set before me. Not a major fan of chicken breast, Farine has been mindful to keep the fillets minimal in size so as not to kill the existing flavour of the meat. The rosemary is subtle and the mashed potato is polished off in no time at all.Interiors of Farines front dining area | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniAnd, of course, is a trip to Farine complete without a sweet-gasm? Ever the choco-holic, I dig into the Nutella red velvet cupcake which didnt disappoint. Dont worry, Ill be back for more."
2019-08-29,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/aug/29/part-and-parsi-of-madras-2025860.html,Part and Parsi of Madras,"Vaishali Vijaykumar ByExpress News ServiceAmid the clamour of a bustling Royapuram lies the Parsi fire temple, offering a moment of tranquillity from the chaos outside. The porch is dotted with simple chalk images of fish and flowers. The doorway is adorned with intricately woven and beaded torans.As we enter the building, which shelters an undying fire, we are told that the priest alone can tend to the fire. He is the only person permitted inside the sanctum sanctorum. Entry into the prayer hall is restricted to Zoroastrians who offer sandal sticks to the priest, who throws it into the fire on their behalf.On a warm Sunday morning, some senior members from the Parsi community hosted an engaging talk on their cultural practices inside the 110-year-old Jal Phiroj Clubwala Dar-e-meher, and a breakfast comprising heirloom delicacies, as part of Madras Week celebrations on Sunday.Generations of styleDressed in their fineries, the women are draped in their gara (saris) in the native Parsi style. They tells us that earlier, Parsi women would cover their head with one end of their sari during rituals. Hence, only one earring was made, usually with gold or silver.The communitys elaborate embroidery work has its influence from China. Blouses either match the sari or are left plain. The garments are difficult to maintain and are expensive. We send them to Mumbai for dry cleaning. These are passed on to us by our mothers and grandmothers, says Tehnaz Bahadurji.The men are dressed in their traditional dagli made of thin cotton cloth paired with white trousers and a white cap. Sapat is our traditional footwear made of velvet or leather. The demand has gone down because of dwindling numbers in the artisan community. People continue to order it from Mumbai, says Tehnaz.Quaint customsThe men and women also wear sadra, a white muslin vest that stands for innocence and purity, and kasti, a holy thread wrapped around the waist thrice. It consists of 72 threads, for each chapter in the holy prayers, and is mandatory to wear after Navjote, a holy communion performed for children between seven and 13.We are hardly a 250-member community in the city. We seldom have marriages. Two priests pray primarily over the bride and groom in an archaic language called Avestan. That apart, we celebrate new years day, which is after the spring equinox on March 21, in the memory of King Jamshedji Nowruz who started the festival, shares Tehnaz.She explains that its not the fire they worship but their prophet Zarathustra, who brought the message of the creator Ahura Mazda. As fire is said to be the most powerful and incorruptible of the five elements, it is symbolic of their creator on Earth.Early yearsWe move to our next location  Parsi Anjuman Baug Dharamshala  a few buildings before the fire temple. Zarine Mistry, the communitys historian, was ready with her facts to take us through their early settlement in Madras and stories of prominent contributors.The first Parsi came to Madras in 1795 from Coorg. A Parsi man, Heerjibhai Maneckji Kharas, bought the first plot and kept adding to it. By 1822, we had 32 grounds taken on lease. When the Crown assumed sovereignty in 1858, all the property became our own, she says.The Madras Parsi Zarthosti Anjuman was formed in 1900. When the son of the philanthropist Phiroj M Clubwala died, he donated the fire temple in his sons memory, which was consecrated in 1910. The Parsi club was formed in 1930, where the community meets once a month.Community outreachDespite dwindling numbers around the globe, the community has maintained a stable count in the city, making their presence felt through their philanthropy. Hormusji Nowroji was a civil engineer who was said to have built the Kilapuk waterworks and introduced piped waterlines to the city. Philanthropist-trader Phiroj M Clubwala built the Anjuman Bagh for guests from other cities to stay, says Zarine.Minoo K Belgamwala was a well-known figure in motorsports and horse racing. Adi Merwan Irani was a popular cinematographer and Dinshaw Tehrani, a reputed sound engineer started Newtone Studios in Kilpauk.Mary Clubwala Jadhav was the daughter-in-law of PM Clubwala. After her husbands death, she joined the Guild of Service in 1935 and went on to introduce social service to well-to-do ladies. In 1940, she set up the Indian Hospitality Committee to help soldiers in the world war. She started the first school of social service in 1952, Madras School of Social Work, and was the first lady sheriff of Madras, says Zarine.For the love of foodAs the talk concludes, Mahiar Shroff and his wife Zavera Shroff set the table with elegant crockery and a sumptuous spread of copiously buttered buns, scrambled eggs and paneer, minced meat, roasted potatoes and a dessert made of semolina.We try to include meat in some way in our food. For instance, broad beans are used in kebabs, cluster bean is cooked with shrimp and all vegetables have egg added to them. We have a month dedicated to the angel of animals when we avoid meat, says Tehnaz as we down cups of piping hot Parsi chai.The walk was curated by Rajith Nair from Travelling Gecko."

The production of horticulture crops  vegetables, fruits, spices, flowers and plantation crops (arecanut, cashewnut, cocoa and coconut)  is estimated at 313.8 MT in 2018-19 as compared to 311.7 MT in 2017-18.Except for plantation crops, output of all other horticulture crops is estimated to be marginally higher in 2018-19. Overall vegetables production is estimated to be around 185.8 MT, higher than last years 184.3 MT, while fruits output is estimated at 98.5 MT in 2018-19 as compared to 97.3 MT in 2017-18.Spices production is pegged at 9.2 million tonnes in 2018-19 as against 8.1 million tonnes in 2017-18. Farmers planted horticulture crops in 25.49 million hectares in 2018-19 as compared to 25.43 million hectares in the previous year."

Women dressed in colorful salwar kameezes disembark, their dupatta body scarves billowing as they make their way past hibiscus bushes and posters proclaiming, Our aim, no accident.The night shift at Foxconn Technology Groups mobile phone plant in Sri City is ending, and thousands of young women are punching out as others stream in to replace them. One of the arrivals is Jennifer Jayadas, a tall, slim 21-year-old who lives several miles away in a two-room hut with no running water.After gobbling down a free breakfast of chapatti flatbreads with a potato-and-pea curry, she dons a checked white hat, apron-shirt, static-resistant footwear and tiny finger gloves. Then Jayadas takes her place at a testing station where she will spend the next eight hours making sure the volume, vibration and other phone features work properly. Smartphones used to be all made in China, she says. Now, we make them here.Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., opened its first India factory four years ago. It now operates two assembly plants, with plans to expand those and open two more. India has become an important manufacturing base as the Taipei-based company looks to diversify its operations beyond China.Female employees work on the factory floor at Foxconns Sri City assembly plant in the state of Andhra Pradesh, on July 11. (Photo | Bloomberg)Succeeding in India has become all the more urgent since U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war last year and announced tariffs on thousands of products manufactured in China, including the gadgetry Foxconn makes for Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and others.In late August, Trump ratcheted up the rhetoricordering American companies to start pulling out of China and citing a national security law as justification. He backed off two days later, but many companies have resigned themselves to an inevitable and costly rethinking of their global supply chains.Its a good business principle not to put all your eggs in a single basket, says Josh Foulger, who runs Foxconns India operations. We have to find viable and reliable alternatives. Obviously the alternative location has to be competitive. We cant put a factory in Mexico for manufacturing mobiles. It might have worked 10 years ago, it just won't work today.Foulger, 48, grew up in Chennai and attended the University of Texas in Arlington, before returning to India in the mid-aughts to set up manufacturing for Nokia. He joined Foxconn four years ago to help founder Terry Gou establish assembly plants in India, now the worlds fastest-growing smartphone market.Jennifer Jayadas, center, at her testing station. (Photo | Bloomberg)Foxconns first India facility started in 2015 in Sri City, a special economic zone where goods can be imported and exported with limited red tape and foreign companies make everything from diapers to train carriages. Foxconns plant employs almost 15,000 workersabout 90% of them womenand assembles phones for various manufacturers, including local best-seller Xiaomi. In recent months, workers began testing and assembling Apples iPhone X, which will be sold in India first and eventually exported.A second mobile phone factory opened in 2017 in Sriperumbudur, about two hours by road from the first facility. It employs 12,000 and is partially automated. By 2023, Foulger says, both factories will be much larger and well add two more locations.Foxconn currently ships parts in from China, but hopes one day to manufacture displays and printed circuit boards locally. Foulger is angling to capture a third of the domestic smartphone market and 10% of the global one (up from a 2.5% share today). Eventually, he plans to add other products, including Amazon Echo speakers, to the mix. Until now, India has made for India, he says. Soon India will make for the world.Seated in an office overlooking the hubbub of the Sriperumbudur plant, the strapping, bearded executive ticks off Indias pluses: labor costs that are half that of Chinas, a vast pool of workers including talented engineers, a government eager to help.Employees arrive by bus for the 6 am shift. (Photo | Bloomberg)They have a staunch partner in Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is under pressure to bring down a jobless rate that currently exceeds 6%. His governments four-year-old Make in India policy seeks to turn the country into a manufacturing power by offering incentives to foreign companies to open factories. The plan is to expand Indias $25 billion phone manufacturing to $400 billion by 2024, says Pankaj Mahindroo, who heads the Indian Cellular & Electronics Assn. A substantial portion of it will be for the export market.Theres a long way to go: A mere 700,000 electronics manufacturing jobs have been created since Make in India started, according to Mahindroos industry group. Skilled workers such as industrial designers are in short supply, and there isnt yet much of a supplier network providing crucial components such as batteries, semiconductors and processors. India is not there yet, says Anshul Gupta, a senior research director at Gartner India. But things are beginning to fall in place. India can bolster its manufacturing capacity and help the world cut its reliance on China.Foxconn was integral to Chinas transformation into a manufacturing colossus, and Gou has told Modi that Foxconn could help India do the same. But it took China 30 years to get there. Chinas advantage was its massive labor pool that could produce quite cheaply, and they built on that by investing heavily in logistics and transportation, says Andrew Polk, a founding partner with Trivium China, a Beijing-based research firm. Even as their labor pool advantage is dissipating, they have invested in processes and systems so they can produce efficiently at scale and get the goods to the market.Workers eat breakfast in the canteen before the start of the morning shift. (Photo | Bloomberg)Catching up will require the Indian government and private sector to invest heavily in roads, rails, ports and other infrastructure. When China did it, global supply chains were fragmented and there wasnt another China, Polk says. India will not only have to get it right but they have to get it right in a way to better China, and trade wars can only help at the margins."" China also had the benefit of being able to grow without worrying too much about the environmental impact. With concern about climate change growing, thats not going to fly these days, he says.As a two-decade veteran of supply chains in India and elsewhere, Foulger is painfully aware of the challenges. I can twirl my mustache and say, India can replicate China, he says. The reality is that we have shortcomings. While the state government provided land, water and power connections for the Sriperumbudur facility, Foxconn, Dell, Flextronics and other companies banded together to build the industrial park for their factories. Even so, Foulger still needs to ferry in water for his thousands of workers because Chennai city and nearby areas have a severe water shortage.Foulger decided early on to recruit mostly women. Female factory workers are commonplace in China, but unusual in India, where rural women are typically consigned to unpaid household or farm work. Women in this region werent even allowed to work at night in factories until the local government and the courts intervened four years ago.Employees on the factory floor of Foxconns Sriperumbudur plant. (Photo | Bloomberg)It was Foulgers mother who planted the idea and persuaded him to give women the opportunity. A teacher whose students often hailed from underprivileged backgrounds, she told him girls are curious, hard working and committed but family circumstances prevent them from going to college. Many are forced to start work early or are pushed into marriage and child rearing at a young age.Foulger says that because most Indian manufacturers prefer to hire men, it was easy to hit his hiring targets. But hes had to make accommodations. For instance, the air conditioning had to be turned up to 26 degrees because the woman have never experienced it before. A line manager brought up the issue of sanitary hygiene, and Foulger was initially hesitant. What would be the reaction in their villages, he wondered? Still, he listened and had sanitary pad dispensers installed in the washroom. Foulger also has to pay for extra security for his female recruits and provide buses and dormitory accommodation for those who live far from the factories. But he says its well worth the extra cost because women work hard and appreciate the chances given to them.Josh Foulger (Photo | Bloomberg)Over the years, Foxconn has been criticized for gruelling working conditions at its China factories. A string of suicides of young migrant workers earlier this decade shocked the world and prompted the company to create a help hotline, boost pay and install safety netting to discourage jumpers. In August, Foxconn fired two executives at a Chinese plant that assembles devices for Amazon after a labor group alleged it slashed wages and flouted laws to help deal with rising U.S. tariffs.During visits to Foxconns two India factories, there was no visible sign of sweat-shop conditions. Workers there mostly complain about the monotony. From the minute they enter the shop floor to the end of an eight-hour shift, work repeats in a relentless cycle. The daily production target has to be met at all costs. Row upon row of women put together each phone part by part, inspecting each handset for visible defects. Shivaparvati Kallivettu, 24, spends her days testing the phones audio and examining batteries and SIM card trays, explaining that her main respite comes every morning in the factory canteen when she has breakfast with four close friends.Employees have the option of returning home by company bus, as Jennifer Jayadas does, or staying in dorms that are available in both Sri City and Sriperumbudur. (Photo | Bloomberg)Most women take the jobs with specific goals in mind, such as sending their kids to better schools or clearing family debt. The pay hoists them over the poverty line. Jayadas gets about 9,000 rupees monthly ($130, which is about a third of the average Chinese factory wage), free bus rides and two wholesome meals. To help avoid tedium, the company teaches workers at least 10 skills in the testing, packing and assembly sections of the line so they can be rotated to different jobs. Still, many of the workers treat the job as a stop-gap. Recently, 400 women failed to show up for their daily shift. Managers discovered they were all taking the governments teacher recruitment exama job that pays a third of what they make at Foxconn but provides less tangible compensations.Jennifer Jayadas, left, with her mother, Stella, and her father, Edvert, at their two-room home. (Photo | Bloomberg)After her shift, Jayadas boards the bus, reaching her home a little before 4 p.m. She helps with the cooking, then fetches 12 buckets of water from a street tap for the familys daily needs. Her fathers income repairing radios and DVD players is meager and erratic, and her entire paycheck goes to her parents. First, the house has to be fixed, Jayadas says gesturing toward the flimsy roof and decrepit walls. Then, I want to save up for a beauticians course."

A DGP cant dare to write such a letter which is against the interests of state government without the consent of the CM, he said.Khaira said that Amarinder was taking a stand in public that CBI should return the case files because it (CBI) has no jurisdiction to continue the probe after Punjab Vidhan Sabha passed a resolution withdrawing the case from the central agency. But in practice he was trying to support the accused by asking CBI to continue the probe. What is going on in Punjab? he asked.AdvertisingThrough the actions of Amarinder one can easily read between the lines that he is hell bent to white wash sins of the Badal family, Khaira said, adding that the murder of dera follower Mohinder Pal in the high security Nabha jail shall be seen in this light only. Mohinder Pal was a key witness and only link to reach to real culprits, he said.The PEP chief said that there was public outrage against the hundreds of cases of sacrilege of holy Guru Granth Sahib during Parkash Singh Badals tenure as chief minister and Sukhbir Badals as the home minister. He said that various judicial commissions and SITs set up to probe the incidents had indicted Dera Sacha Sauda followers and also raised an accusing finger of Badal family for their involvement in the heinous crime.Khaira also pointed out the conflict between CM and his cabinet colleagues over the handling of sacrilege issue. Referring to a statement of cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Khaira said that he (Randhawa) had also questioned Amarinder and described the DGPs stand contradictory to Punjab government.Khaira asked CM if Prabodh Kumar had written the letter with his consent and if no then what action he was taking against the DGP. If the answer is yes then under what circumstance was CBI told to continue the probe while in the court state challenged its closure report. If CBI has taken the U-turn to reopen the cases, it is due to political conspiracy in which Amarinder Singh and Badal family are fully involved, he said.Former deputy Speaker of Vidhan Sabha, Bir Devinder Singh, meanwhile said that the entire Congress Legislature Party needs to explain as to how the probe into the sacrilege cases was being buried and the entire Sikh community was being fooled by their government.The missive of Prabodh Kumar to the CBI, in contravention of the explicit resolution of the Vidhan Sabha, seems to be a malicious attempt, which has left nobody in doubt that Amarinder Singh is audaciously working on various mechanisms to absolve Dera Sacha Sauda of the crime, he said.Otherwise, he said, why a top ranking police officer would write to the CBI, violating the unambiguous direction of the state legislature to withdraw all cases from the CBI that pertain to the sacrilege of Sri Guru Granth Sahib?Bir Devinder, wondered why the entire state legislature was in slumber over such a brazen breach of the privilege of the House committed by Prabodh Kumar with the consent of Amarinder Singh.The Taksali leader also demanded that Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa must resign not only as a minister but also as a member of the House, for his colossal failure in not ensuring the implementation of the motion that he himself moved."

Shashikumar BS (42) travels 60 km to and fro each day from his home in Tumakuru to Yelekyathanahalli village in Nelamangala taluk on his two-wheeler to teach at the Government High School.Fondly called Shashi sir by students, he is among the two from Karnataka who will receive the national award for teachers from the Union Human Resource Development Ministry on September 5. Shashikumar, along with 45 other teachers, will also be meeting PM Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind on September 3 and 4.Hailing from Tumakuru, Shashikumar is an MSc, MPhil and BEd graduate and has previously worked at the Morarji Desai Residential School and other government schools. At present, he works as an assistant teacher at the school in Yelekyathanahalli village. Shashikumar not just inspires his students to do well in Science, but was also instrumental in setting up a Science lab.His speciality is that he does not dictate notes to students, but instead gets them to jot down their own notes based on what they have learnt in the laboratory. This helps them in exams. He also tells his students to make presentations on particular topics and uses technology aids. Mere textbooks will not interest students, he said. After school hours, he not just takes special classes for Class 10 students, but also drops them home.Shashikumar organises Science-themed rangoli competitions. I make my students draw kidneys, heart, lungs and other diagrams. The students creativity comes to the fore, he said. For instance, while teaching the process of osmosis, he uses potato and water mixed with sugar. I set up everything and show them videos too, he said.Shashikumar also creates awareness on plastic usage, water management, etc, among the students.After school hours, we take special classes for Class 10 students. At present, we have 16 students in the class. I drop off those who come from far-off places or pay for the autorickshaw ride as classes go on till 6.30 pm. Ever since I joined this school about eight years ago, we have got close to 100 per cent results in SSLC. I am proud that my students are scoring 92 to 95 marks in Science. All these students are from economically-weak backgrounds. My school teacher kindled an interest in Science in me and I am just passing it to the next generation, he added.Dr Nareshachari, who is studying MD in Emergency Medicine at Mysuru, was his student at the Morarji Desai school. Shashi sir was the one who inspired me to take up Science. The manner in which he taught Science was inspiring. I am happy and proud my teacher is getting the award, he deserves it, he said."

2019-08-31,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/aug/31/from-punjab-with-love-2026700.html,"From Punjab, with love","Deena Theresa ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: I accidentally discovered Punjab House six years ago. Now, Im positive that recognition would have dawned on almost every Kochiites parents face. Owned by a Punjabi family settled in the city years ago, the restaurants fame is solely contributed by word of mouth. I remember the decades-old building, nestled in a by-lane in Broadway. My tastebuds can fondly recollect the piping hot plate of aloo ka paratha with a slab of butter shimmying its way and the lassi which guarantees you a ticket to seventh heaven.Wanting to relive the experience, I went back, to the place, and in time. The current owner, Brahamdev K Dhuper, has hospitality writ large on his face. The restaurant was started in 1969 by my mother, Pushpa Krishanlal. Back then, we just had one north Indian restaurant in the city. My father was in the Armed Forces. He was commissioned into the Indian Air Force, after the Partition and was posted in Mumbai. Our relatives were in Kochi and we would stay with them often.It was then, my mother noticed the lack of Punjabi restaurants. After my fathers retirement, we settled here and she started the restaurant. Now there are several north Indian restaurants but ours is a humble place with reasonable rates, says 64-year-old Brahamdev, a former engineer with Sony, who took over the place 14 years ago. The restaurant has a good name and I wanted to make it better, he continues. His mother is now 94 years old.Punjab House is unlike your regular Punjabi restaurants. It serves no tandoori or non-vegetarian dishes; Just your simple, humble homely vegetarian Punjabi food, according to Brahamdev. Our most favoured dishes are the aloo ka paratha, gobi ka paratha and the lassi. Also, we make some subjis (vegetable curries) such as the karela pyaz, which no restaurant in the city makes. Sev tomato, Shimla mirch aloo and papad sabji are among the rest, he says.Albeit, one can never find the same dish every day. We have customers who dine at the restaurant twice a day. Just like how it is in our homes, where the menu changes so that children do not get fed up with the food, my mother had introduced this wherein the menu changes by the day, he smiles. Now, thats some variety I need in my life.Im served their famous aloo ka paratha with boondi raita and paneer curry, the days special. Accompanying my meal is none other than the lassi. You wont find a lassi like this, says Brahamdev. And how right he is. I immediately sip the lassi. A plethora of memories rush in, along with the cold, sweet yet tangy flavour of the lassi. The answer to all my troubles.The paratha, stuffed with potatoes tastes even better with the raita. And the curry reminded me of home. Wait, didnt Brahamdev say that homely food was their USP? When we began, not many Malayalis were not accustomed to eating chappattis. Now, our Malayali customers have overtaken north Indians! Also, here you can see people across various states having food under one roof. That is my mothers specialty.She has curated the food in such a manner that everyone would develop a liking to it, shares Brahamdev. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His son, Aayush Brahamdev, runs the Urban Paratha brand, across three outlets in Kochi. Urban Paratha serves non-vegetarian and tandoori dishes, says the proud father. Brahamdev is also a HAM radio operator. Probably that explains how he connects various communities under one roof, this time, in the name of food."

Shashikumar BS (42) travels 60 km to and fro each day from his home in Tumakuru to Yelekyathanahalli village in Nelamangala taluk on his two-wheeler to teach at the Government High School.Fondly called Shashi sir by students, he is among the two from Karnataka who will receive the national award for teachers from the Union Human Resource Development Ministry on September 5. Shashikumar, along with 45 other teachers, will also be meeting PM Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind on September 3 and 4.Hailing from Tumakuru, Shashikumar is an MSc, MPhil and BEd graduate and has previously worked at the Morarji Desai Residential School and other government schools. At present, he works as an assistant teacher at the school in Yelekyathanahalli village. Shashikumar not just inspires his students to do well in Science, but was also instrumental in setting up a Science lab.His speciality is that he does not dictate notes to students, but instead gets them to jot down their own notes based on what they have learnt in the laboratory. This helps them in exams. He also tells his students to make presentations on particular topics and uses technology aids. Mere textbooks will not interest students, he said. After school hours, he not just takes special classes for Class 10 students, but also drops them home.Shashikumar organises Science-themed rangoli competitions. I make my students draw kidneys, heart, lungs and other diagrams. The students creativity comes to the fore, he said. For instance, while teaching the process of osmosis, he uses potato and water mixed with sugar. I set up everything and show them videos too, he said.Shashikumar also creates awareness on plastic usage, water management, etc, among the students.After school hours, we take special classes for Class 10 students. At present, we have 16 students in the class. I drop off those who come from far-off places or pay for the autorickshaw ride as classes go on till 6.30 pm. Ever since I joined this school about eight years ago, we have got close to 100 per cent results in SSLC. I am proud that my students are scoring 92 to 95 marks in Science. All these students are from economically-weak backgrounds. My school teacher kindled an interest in Science in me and I am just passing it to the next generation, he added.Dr Nareshachari, who is studying MD in Emergency Medicine at Mysuru, was his student at the Morarji Desai school. Shashi sir was the one who inspired me to take up Science. The manner in which he taught Science was inspiring. I am happy and proud my teacher is getting the award, he deserves it, he said."
2019-08-31,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/somewhere-over-the-rainbow-mahabaleshwar-monsoon-rain-5954742/,Somewhere over the rainbow,"Every year in June, as monsoon comes to Mahabaleshwar, the residents know how to prepare for the next four months. They ready their coal-heaters, umbrellas and, if they can afford, de-humidifiers. They also wait for tourists to drive down to enjoy the monsoon.AdvertisingBut this year, things were different. Tourists were fewer and the rainfall extreme.Part of the Western Ghats of Maharashtra and surrounded by valleys, Mahabaleshwar got more rain between June 1 and August 8 than Cherrapunjee in Meghalaya, which holds the Guinness Record as the wettest place in the world. The hill station, located 285 km south east of Mumbai, got 6,031.5 mm of rain, against 5,397.5 mm in Cherrapunjee. The all-time high for total rainfall in August in Mahabaleshwar is 4,007.4 mm, back in 1900.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), in the first eight days of August, Mahabaleshwar got 200 mm-300 mm of rain every day. Says Vishal Ramchandran, Assistant Scientist, IMD, Mahabaleshwar, The town is known to get heavy rainfall. The anomaly was the strong, intense spell My concern was taking accurate reading of the same.AdvertisingThe IMD, Mahabaleshwar, records rainfall twice a day, 8:30 am and 5:30 pm.However, while the Mahabaleshwar rain had the rest of the country buzzing, Ramchandran says they didnt realise this right away. It was only later that some worry set in when they came to know the town was the rainiest in the country.Over the past 10 years, rainfall has been declining in Cherrapunjee, which entered the record books with 24,555 mm of annual rain in 1974. This years reading, till August 30, was 6,023.9 mm, a negative departure of 1,442.8 mm from 2018.Experts say the reason for both that and Mahabaleshwar getting rainier is changes in topography and weather systems. The Bay of Bengal branch of monsoon winds that bring rain to Northeast states have been weak this time. Factors such as urbanisation and depletion of green cover should be studied. On the other hand the Arabian Sea branch has been strong, resulting in above average rainfall for not just Mahabaleshwar but also entire western Maharashtra, says Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK.But Mahabaleshwar handles its rains better than most. On August 4, it got 305.8 mm of rainfall over 24 hours. The same day Mumbai got 204 mm, and went under. Putting on an electric heater to reduce the dampness in the air, Amita Dagde-Patil, Chief Officer, Mahabaleshwar Municipal Council, says, We dont have any infrastructure problems barring some branches falling and electricity cuts. Before the monsoon, the drains are cleaned. We are an eco-sensitive area, and hence there is no unplanned urbanisation. The natural course of rainwater flow has not been altered with. An eco-sensitive tag means restrictions on mining, industries and construction in the area.With a population of 13,000 and floating numbers of over 30,000 during weekends and peak tourist season, the plateau town, spread over 25 sq km, generates roughly 7.5 tonnes of waste every day, which is nearly all segregated and processed. In the Union governments Swachh Survekshan 2019 survey, the town secured an all-India rank of 8, an improvement from 19 in 2018.The highlight are the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags on 2,500 dustbins, both public and personal, installed over the past two years. The RFID tags register details of the house to which the dustbins belong, the owners name, as well as the timing of the garbage collection. Every household and commercial property has been given dustbins. Waste is not collected if not segregated at source, says Dagde-Patil.With hotels and restaurants running till late night, the Municipal Council has begun night-sweeping in the market area and garbage collection post-midnight. Since 2012, the town has had a complete plastic ban.With two sewage treatment plants of total 5 million litres per day capacity, and a plan for three more, the Municipal Council recently approved a proposal to treat the water to sell it to commercial bodies for Rs 300 per 2,000 litres.But, similar to cities, the rains do exacerbate the problem of potholes and broken roads. The Mahabaleshwar Municipal Council has been struggling, with Rs 2.5 crore of its Rs 75 crore budget set aside to fill potholes this financial year.There is another worry. Mahabaleshwar supplies over 80 per cent of the countrys strawberries, which may be affected if the rains continue. Strawberry planting begins in September.Says strawberry farmer Santosh Mohite, Last year, the rains continued till September. It killed the plants. If we plant late, strawberries will not be ready by Diwali, when we have the highest number of tourists.During monsoon and the off season for strawberries, some farmers cultivate potatoes, French beans and peas. However, Sashikant Bhilare, another strawberry farmer, points out, The rainfall and heavy winds killed our young potato plants this year. They are all rotten.Pushplata Dhanak, who has been living in Mahabaleshwar for 11 years, worries about the rising cost of using coal heaters. There will be no sign of sunlight till October. We dont use the heater to keep warm but to dry clothes and reduce the dampness inside the hut. I spend Rs 100 extra every day for five months.Businessmen and restaurant owner Ajay Purohit, however, clings on to hope about what the tag of the rainiest town might mean. We want the Tourism Department to market the town not only as a summer destination but also a monsoon one, he says.For now though, the customers are down and, packing his leather goods at his shop, Ganesh Gaikwad warns, I have been living here 15 years. Usually, we get some customers during long weekends like the August 15th one, but this year, no one came.AdvertisingThen he cheers up. Maybe we will be lucky next year After all our town is the rainiest."
2019-09-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cbi-files-fir-in-phone-tapping-case/article29311026.ece,CBI files FIR in phone-tapping case,"The Central Bureau of Investigation filed a First Information Report (FIR) on Friday in the phone-tapping case. This is expected to become a political hot potato for JD(S) and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.The BJP government in the State had handed over the probe to the CBI into the alleged phone-tapping of bureaucrats, politicians, and their associates in the State during August 2018 to July-end 2019, a period when Mr. Kumaraswamy was Chief Minister.Charge against policeIt is alleged that the Bengaluru City Police tapped phones of MLAs, leaders, and their associates during the political crisis that brought down the JD(S)-Congress coalition government. Several rebels had alleged their phones were tapped.A.H. Vishwanath, disqualified MLA, had even alleged that Mr. Kumaraswamy misused the audio tapes to blackmail the rebels to switch back to supporting the coalition government, an allegation Mr. Kumaraswamy has denied.The issue came to light when a conversation between the incumbent Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao and one Faraz Ahmed was leaked, where Mr. Rao is heard lobbying for the top post.A preliminary inquiry on the particular audio tape led to an FIR, which has been transferred to the CBI now. The preliminary inquiry report, now part of the CBI FIR, that has for the first time become public, indicts the then Police Commissioner, Bengaluru, Alok Kumar, though not by name.Police inspector, in-charge of Technical Support Team of CCB, who intercepted the call, has said in his statement that he downloaded the conversation from the server, put it in a pen drive and handed it over to then Commissioner [Alok Kumar] in his office on his instructions, at 2 p.m. on August 2. Interestingly, this was just hours before the Commissioner was transferred out and Mr. Rao took charge. The audio tape was leaked to the media a day later.However, despite the preliminary inquiry indicting the then Bengaluru Police Commissioner, neither the FIR registered by Cybercrime Police, Bengaluru, nor the fresh FIR registered by CBI names anyone as accused.The FIR by the CBI, a copy of which is with The Hindu, names unidentified public servants and unidentified private persons, as accused.The FIR is registered under Section 72 of Information Technology Act, 2000 and Section 26 of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885."
2019-09-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/there-or-their-sticklers-twitch-at-trump-posts-5955564/,There or their? Sticklers twitch at Trump posts,"(Written by Sarah Lyall)AdvertisingIt was late May, and the president of the United States could not seem to get off Twitter. The low IQ-ness of Joe Biden. The idiocy of the Democrats. The Wall! The opinions spewed forth like unguided missiles, delighting those who support Donald Trump and dismaying those who do not.As he followed along from Texas, Bryan A. Garner, the author of Garners Modern English Usage, could feel his blood pressure steadily rising. But it was a particular phrase in a particular presidential tweet about Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.  their is nothing bipartisan about him  that sent him over the cliff of indignation.You mean, There is nothing bipartisan about him, Garner tweeted back, directly addressing the president. Not their, which is the possessive form of they. Wouldnt it be worth $75,000 a year to pay for a Presidential Proofreader so that youll have the semblance of literacy?AdvertisingAt a time when nerves are stretched to the point of snapping and every political issue seems to verge on the apocalyptic  climate change; immigration; gun violence; race relations; what the president said or claimed to say or did not say about China  it might seem needlessly picayune to dwell on the writing style of the occupant of the White House.But for people who care about the English language and how best to use it, Trumps continual flouting of even basic writing conventions is a serious matter indeed. Trumps impulsive tweeting and concomitant error rate seem to have grown this year as his frustrations with topics that upset him, from the Mueller report and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to immigration and 2020, have intensified. On Friday, in a bad-tempered Twitter screed about one of his current preoccupations, the Federal Reserve, he wrote that he was reigning in bad trading partners. On Saturday morning, he congratulated Sean Hannity on being the number one shoe on Cable Television!, though the message was later corrected.After he has spent nearly three years in office, Trumps critics ask, why does he remain intent not only on making egregious errors, but also on deliberately failing to correct them? Leaving aside its splenetic tone and in-your-face ad hominem attacks, knee-jerk defensiveness and ugly, dog-whistle language, why is so much of the direct communication from the president to the world heaving with bad grammar, bad spelling, bizarre punctuation, muddy diction and inexplicable random capitalization?If you care about literacy and the correct and accurate use of language, then this president has got to be driving you crazy, regardless of your political point of view, Garner, who says he is apolitical but considers himself a liberal Republican, said in an interview.The Democrats hope that in 2020 the country will elect a new tweeter in chief, perhaps even one who knows how to spell. But Trumps Twitter style has served him well with supporters who applaud his maverick resistance to rules. So far, no other politician has managed to pull off his sui generis mix of pugnacious content and my-way-or-the-highway approach to English composition.He is not writing standard English the way you and I would do it, but hes clearly an effective communicator, and its clearly working, said Peter Sokolowski, a lexicographer and the editor at large at Merriam-Webster. A lack of respect for convention is what his supporters like about him, and his rhetoric does seem to ring true with his persona and his character.Trump is not the first president whose use of language has provoked ridicule and dismay. Former President Bill Clinton claimed there were different ways to define the word is.Former Vice President Dan Quayle believed the word potato had an e at the end and did not seem to care that his home mailbox identified his family as The Quayles. And former President George W. Bush once declared, with inadvertent accuracy: Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?Weve always had presidents who commit embarrassing verbal gaffes, like George W. Bushs misunderestimate, said Jonathon Owen, a linguist, editor and writer. His biggest Trump-related irritation, he said, is how the president uses parentheses to restate or explain things that werent unclear, as in the tweet: I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen.But what I think bothers me most about Trumps sloppiness is that it seems so deliberate, Owen added, via email.Indeed, rather than being embarrassed, the president seems to be proud of his mistakes  or even to believe that because he has committed them, they are not mistakes at all. This makes him a poor role model, said the lexicographer and writer Kory Stamper. After he won the election and his writing style came under scrutiny, people said that once he took office, he would rise to the occasion, she said. But you can see that some of the things he does have gotten worse, like the rampant capitalization of weird words.A report last year said that members of the presidents staff sometimes deliberately add errors to the tweets they ghostwrite for him, to make them seem authentically presidential. Its unclear what criteria the White House uses to decide what tweets merit copy-editing interventions. Someone corrected Trumps tweet calling Joe Biden Joe Bidan; nobody did anything when he used council instead of counsel. Sometimes the incorrect words sit out there, enshrined forever on Twitter. Principal for principle. Covfefe for whatever.Trumps language philosophy brings to mind the approach of Humpty Dumpty, the giant bloviating egg in Lewis Carrolls Through the Looking-Glass. When Alice questions his claim that (among other things) glory means a good knock-down argument, Humpty declares that when he uses a word, it means just what I choose it to mean  neither more nor less.The president, too, appears to feel that he is the master of his prose, not the other way around.After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake, he tweeted last year, successfully managing to both dangle a modifier and misspell a four-letter word in the course of a single sentence.As for his creative capitalization technique, he wrote, I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!That is not the correct way to capitalize, said Mary Norris, the former New Yorker copy editor who wrote Between You & Me: Confessions of a Comma Queen. Norris particular Trumpian pet peeve, she said, is how the president has taken one of her favorite devices  the distinguished Homeric epithet, as in swift-footed Achilles  and used it to lob insults at his enemies, as in Crooked Hillary and Lyin Ted.Trump thinks he can get away with stuff simply because he does it, she said. But hes not king of the language. Hes not king of anything. And who took Humpty Dumpty seriously in the long run? Hes famous, of course, but only for being all cracked.Anyone who spends any time in the roiling waters of Twitter knows that many Trump critics are eager to point out the presidents linguistic and other missteps. One of these is Benjamin Dreyer, the copy chief of Random House and the author of the best-selling book Dreyers English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style.Dreyer said that correcting the presidents errors in real time helped him channel some of the anger he feels when he thinks about Trumps policies.It gives me the chance to make fun of something that I find truly horrifying, he said. Its like releasing a valve on the pressure cooker.Beyond the questions that Trumps Twitter feed raises about his relationship to matters of writing style, Sokolowski, the lexicographer at Merriam-Webster, said that there is a larger issue here.At a time of self-evident transgressions against truth, when even facts are up in the air, he said, the presidents approach also draws attention to the importance of individual words and their meanings. George Orwell touched on the point in Politics and the English Language, about the relationship between the way people think and the way they speak and write. If thought corrupts language, he wrote, language can also corrupt thought.Stamper said she would like to feel that even a political leader she disagrees with would show some respect for the conventions of the English language.Trump seems to flout the rules of everything, so wed like him at least to have a basic grasp of English composition, said Stamper, who said she was particularly pained by the presidents habit of calling the wall Wall, as if it were some sort of anthropomorphic fence  or a military acronym, like NORAD.So just punctuate correctly! she continued. Put a period there instead of a comma.Some Trump supporters seem to regard his tweets as cryptic puzzles,  la the film National Treasure or the book The Da Vinci Code.Trump himself encouraged that notion when he implied that his 2017 covfefe tweet was not a mistake and had some sort of supersecret meaning.No, said Stamper.AdvertisingIf you are the president of the United States, your words have power, she continued. Whatever you say will be judged by future generations. It would be nice if we were not judged by covfefe."
2019-09-01,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2019/sep/01/will-jio-cinema-be-the-nemesis-of-multiplexes-2027229.html,Will Jio Cinema be the nemesis of multiplexes?,"Gurbir Singh ByExpress News ServiceThe latest offering from Reliance Jio by Mukesh Ambani threatens to disrupt and monopolise communication and entertainment as never before; that is if he has his way. Telecom competitors like Airtel and Vodafone Idea might have to kiss goodbye to any hope of getting out of the red; and there is the chance that it will be curtains for the multiplex cinema industry as well.As it is entertainment habits are changing fast. An outing to the multiplex near your home is a Rs 2,000 hit. Two tickets for Rs 1,200, plus popcorn and a couple of Cokes is fun while it lasts; but hurts when you sleep on it. In comparison, an annual subscription for Hotstar or Amazon Prime ranges from Rs 299 to Rs 999. A movie, a delicious home-grilled sandwich, and a cold Coke, all for less than Rs 100!Sounds a better option, doesnt it? No wonder average multiplex occupancies have fallen to less than 30 per cent.Poaching audiencesNow lets see what the Ambanis have announced. From September 5, when Jio will be three years old, the Jio fibre plans for fixed-line broadband will launch with lightning high speeds of 100mbps and packages starting at `700 a month. Calls anywhere in India will be free.Jio fibre customers who opt for annual lifetime plans will get an LED 4k HD TV and a set top box too absolutely free. Thats the first hit against multiplexes. Then the finale. For couch potatoes on the premium plan, Jios First-day-first-show will beam newly released films to your drawing room.It was not surprising that shares of the two biggest listed multiplex operators, PVR and INOX, who account for around 1,500 screens, fell sharply by over 2 per cent after the announcement.But PVR and the rest are putting up a brave face. They say the at-home and multiplex audiences are exclusive. The dividing line is protected by a film industry standard that allows movie producers to sell their rights to digital platforms only after eight weeks of theatrical release in cinemas.But these gentlemen from the PVRs and INOX-es are either living in fools paradise, or do not know Mr Mukesh Ambani well. Look at history. The sanctity of theatrical rights was protected about two decades ago for six months after release; then it declined to three months and now it is eight weeks.What stops it from being chipped and chopped to a couple of days?Second, it is all about money! If Reliance Jio works out packages that give the movie producer not only a handsome upfront payment for his rights, but a tiny share too in the first-day-first-show revenue, the sheer volume of millions who watch will ensure better revenue to the producer; and the film industrys theatre embargo is out of the window.Digital monopolyReliances target is a takeover of the digital over-the-top (OTT) space, in preference to other traditional areas like TV and the movie theatres. There are over 40 OTT services today like Hotstar, Netflix and Zee5 offering entertainment to viewers over the Internet, bypassing cable, broadcast and satellite television platforms.Television, which is in close to 300 million homes is still ahead, but OTT is catching up fast. With the smartphone riding cheap Wi-fi and easy access to these app-based services, the smallest screen is what is galloping the fastest with estimates currently ranging from 80 million to 300 million paying subscribers. A recent Assocham-PwC study estimates OTT to be a `5,300 crore market by 2022. Its the future.Jio intends to outflank competition. It will provide the pipes and distribution platform. It will provide exclusive content. It has bought into movie producer Eros International; it has bought out 26 per cent of TV series and film production company, Balaji Telefilms. It pretty much controls the cable network through buyouts of the largest distributors, DEN and Hathway. Now, their fibre optic networks are in the process of being linked to the bigger Jio universe.Jios march may not have been possible without a cosy regulatory regime. An India Ratings report says by 2022 Jio will hold 45 per cent of the subscribers for 4G services. This feat would not have been possible in three years without the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) looking the other way at the predatory pricing that has knocked competitors out of the market.The latest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms for digital media also seem to have been designed to help Reliance. There were earlier no restrictions for foreign investment in digital media, unlike print (maximum 26 per cent) and television (49 per cent). By default, foreign players could come in with 100 per cent. The new norms will restrict FDI to 26 per cent making capital scarce for new and old players in the digital space.Will offshore digital firms like HuffPost, Google and Microsoft India have to now dilute?Isnt it convenient that after Jio set up its infrastructure, a new FDI notification comes into restrict the growth and expansion of competitors?"
2019-09-02,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/a-homage-to-the-high-priest-of-haute-couture/cid/1684025,A homage to the high priest of haute couture,"As the exhibition, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, devoted to the French fashion icon, opened last week at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, I noticed people were standing in silent homage in front of the haute couture garments on show as though they were in a temple. Christian Dior made an immediate impact with his New Look, when he founded his fashion house in Paris in 1947. He died, aged only 52, from a heart attack in 1957, but was succeeded as creative director by his talented 21-year-old assistant, Yves Saint Laurent, and subsequently by the rational style of Marc Bohan, the flamboyance of Gianfranco Ferr, the exuberance of John Galliano, the minimalism of Raf Simons....If there is one image which captures the exhibition, it is that of Princess Margaret, photographed by Cecil Beaton in a Dior ball gown in organza for her 21st birthday. The exhibition presents over 500 objects, with over 200 rare haute couture garments alongside accessories, fashion photography, film, vintage perfume, original make-up, illustrations, magazines and Diors own possessions.On his travels, Dior picked up ideas, most notably from India, as the label to what looks like an embroidered sari dress makes clear: From embellishment techniques to the vibrant fabrics of the sari, the rich textile traditions of India inspired Christian Dior. Saris and draped fabrics of the Indian subcontinent are evoked in his 1953 evening dresses, some named after cities such as Agra and Soire de Lahore...In 1962 under the direction of Marc Bohan, the House of Dior staged its first fashion show in Mumbai and Delhi. Bolan would later create The Indian Year collection at Dior... Gianfranco Ferr, who had lived in India, paid homage to a country he loved in his Indian Passion collection of 1996. The following year John Galliano featured dresses inspired by the jewels of the Maharajahs.V. S. Naipaul The Telegraph pictureFraught relationshipDiana Athill, who died in London on January 23, aged 101, was a patrician lady and one of Britains most distinguished literary editors. For close to 50 years, she was based at the publishing house, Andr Deutsch, where she looked after many famous authors, including VS Naipaul, whose career might not have taken off had it not been for her support.He was never our biggest selling writer, she once said. We hung on to him because in those days we could afford to, if we admired someones writing. If it was today, I doubt he would have had a career like that, because publishers cant support writers who dont sell.She said she found the future Nobel laureate easily the most difficult writer Ive ever worked with. When she expressed mild reservations about one character in his 1975 novel, Guerrillas, Naipaul was so offended he walked out on her. It was as though the sun came out, she rejoiced. I didnt have to like Vidia any more.When Athill became an author herself and wrote several candid volumes of memoirs  I very much enjoyed her thoughts on growing old in Alive, Alive Oh! And Other Things that Matter  Naipaul said unkindly about her literary efforts: My publisher, who was so good as a taster and editor, when she became a writer, lo and behold, it was all this feminine tosh... I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me.Old connectionLord Swraj Paul has just been offered the honorary fellowship of the Zoological Society of London. This is the organization that runs the London Zoo and which he rescued from bankruptcy in 1990 with a gift of 1 million. This was in recognition of the happy times he had spent there with his four-year-old daughter, Ambika, in the closing days of her life in the 1960s.Pleasantly surprised  especially [considering] the company I am in, says Swraj. The elite list of fellows includes the Duke of Edinburgh (1977), Emperor Akihito of Japan (1991), Sir David Attenborough (1998), and, going back in time, Charles Darwin (1839).Perhaps this latest honour will remind the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, that she had asked Swraj to help with the modernization of Alipore Zoo  which, he tells me, he is more than willing to do, provided he is presented with specific proposals  financially or otherwise.Strange caseFrom lengthy experience, I can attest to the fact that The Daily Telegraph in London is a very cautious newspaper, where in-house lawyers scrutinize  and often cut out  anything potentially libellous. But it has apologized unreservedly to Melania Trump and agreed to pay her legal costs plus substantial damages after carrying a not-especially- scurrilous article about the First Lady of the United States of America, suggesting she did not have much of a modelling career until she met Donald Trump in the 1990s.What is odd is that the magazine cover story by the US journalist, Nina Burleigh, is based essentially on her book, Golden Handcuffs: The Secret History of Trumps Women, which has been published in the US without attracting action from Melanias legal team.'Sweet potato biriyani' Amit RoyFootnote"

Those aware of it know it as an annual feature, but for the uninitiated, it can be an experience. Huge earthen ovens belch smoke. Elsewhere, sack after sack of flour is neatly stacked against an aged, yellow-painted wall. Along the opposite wall are stacked logs of wood as a team of cooks is busy firing earthen ovens. Welcome to the over-180-year-old Bawarchi Khana!The Bawarchi Khana, or the Royal Kitchen, is believed to have been established by Muhammad Ali Shah, the third King of Awadh along with iconic Bada Imambada in 1838, to ensure the preparation of tabarruk (sacred offerings) distributed among thousands of azadaars (mourners) as part of the 10-day-long Muharram ritual.Besides, the King, before his death had also formed a trustHussainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) in 1839 at a cost of 12 lakh to carry out religious practices (including distribution of tabarruk) during Muharram. Interestingly, the trust is still functional and is carrying forward the royal legacy.We have allocated a fund of Rs 26 lakh this year for the distribution of tabarruk and other religious practices, which are a tradition during the Muharram period. Since we have to cater to a large congregation of mourners and around 300 families of the descendants of nawabs, the preparation of tabarruk has started well in advance at the Royal Kitchen, said district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, who is also the custodian of HAT.The DM said that true to the over-180-year-old tradition, this year too, they have the same menu for tabarruk. In the menu we have tale huye aloo ka salan (fried potato curry), chane ki daal (split chickpea lentil), sheermaal (saffron coloured bread prepared in milk and sugar), Khamiri roti (yeast bread) and Royal Bread or as it is known, Bakarkhwani. This bread weighs around 750 gram and is only prepared for 300 families that are enlisted with trust as the descendants of Nawabs, he added.Not only is the menu long, but the preparation is equally arduous. And to ensure the distribution of authentic tabarruk, HAT ensures that it hires only traditional cooks. We have been preparing tabarruk for quite some time, hence, we are well aware with the quantity, quality of edibles we are dealing with, said Sadiq Hussain, a cook who is heading the team of cooks.Hussain said that the preparation begins well in advance. He said it takes more than a dozen cooks, more than 20 tonnes of flour, more than 15 tins of cooking oil, tonnes of milk, dry fruit and more than 50 tonnes of wood to prepare the entire menu. Of the entire menu, the preparation of Bakarkhwani, is perhaps the trickiest. One has to be extra cautious while handling its dough, which is a mixture of flour, semolina, sugar, a pinch of salt, saffron, poppy seeds, dry fruits, butter and milk. Its a part of Mughal cuisine, he added.HAT officials said that the distribution of tabarruk is aimed at feeding the masses. We have made sure that the food that is being distributed, is adequate to meet the needs of the people. We start distributing tabarruk from the 2nd Muharram to the 9th Muharram. The trust ensures the distribution of tabarruk at Bada Imambada, Chhota Imambada and Shanajaf Imambada after a religious ceremony (majalis), said HAT officer on special duty (OSD) Habibul Hasan. Hundreds of azadaars consume tabarruk at all the three places, he said.Hasan said that the tradition of distribution of tabarruk on such a large scale also makes the City of Nawabs different from others. And its perhaps the only city that has a dedicated trust to do so.Other than the tabarruk distribution by the trust, the city also witnesses tabarruk distribution by hundreds and thousands of Shia Muslim families and individuals. Lucknows Azaddari (mournings and rituals performed to commemorate the martyrdom of Prophet Mohammeds grandson Imam Hussain and his 72 companions in Karbala in 680 AD) is world famous and is the most authentic one, as its the only place in world where Muharram is observed for two months and eight days. Distribution of tabarruk is the most important part of the set of rituals performed during Muharram, said Nawab Meer Jafar Abdullah, a descendant of the royal family.Abdullah said it is that time of the year when gas stoves of most Shia families go off as every second house in the state capital organises religious meetings followed by the distribution of tabarruk. The families ensure that not only those who were a part of the meetings but that tabarruk reaches all the families known to them. Perhaps that is the reason why generally food is not cooked at homes during Muharram. The state capital has more than 5 lakh Shia population, said Abdullah.However, the City of Nawabs has witnessed a change in the menu of tabarruk as it is no more restricted to distribution of traditional food like Biryani, Haleem or fry potato curry only. Yes, now tabarruk can be in any form  it could be in a form of a pressure cooker, which is distributed among the faithful, soft drink cans, tazbi, umbrella, any utensil or it could be ice cream and so on, he added.S Mohammed Haider, mutwalli of Sibtainabad Imambada, said, Tabarruk distribution is a tradition which enables us propagate and inculcate the art of giving in the younger generation. The entire process, from procuring the raw material, up to its preparation and distribution is taken care of personally, ensuring purity and sanctity of the tabarruk, a divine offering.Not a Muslim-only affairIts a time for mourning for the citys Muslim population and so also the time for the closure of a 60-year-old juice shop, situated just a few yards from busy Hazratganj crossing. The juice shops closure is an annual ritual, to mark the onset of Muharram.The shop is owned by Pappu Rani Kinnar, a Hindu. Pappu Ranis shop, a fellow shop-owner saidm is known for its unique tradition. The juice shop is replaced by a grand tazia a replica of Imam Hussains mausoleum in Iraqduring Muharram. Besides, the place is used to offer Muharram rituals and offering prayers, said a local pan shop owner. She also distributes tabarruk among the azadaars. She said that the tradition began in 90s, when the owner of the tea stall opposite her tea stall fell seriously ill. While they were rushing him to the hospital, they came across a Muharam procession. I made a wish that if his heath stabilises, I will start keeping tazias during Muharram. And miraculously he started recovering. Since then, I have been following the tradition and distributing tabarruk, said Pappu Rani Kinnar, as she displayed the tazia, prepared all in silver.Other than Pappu Kinnar, there are many non-Muslim families in the state capital that not only distribute tabarruk but also follow Muharram rituals religiously.caption: Sibtainabad Imambada distributed Rice and soya nuggets pulao, as tabarruk among the azaddars on the first day of Muharram here in Lucknow on Sunday. sourcedFirst Published: Sep 02, 2019 13:50 IST"

While the good quality onion is being sold at Rs 40 per kg, the inferior one is priced at Rs 35 per kg. Again, the abrupt rise in onion price is attributed to the short supply from Nashik in Maharashtra.A roadside retailer claimed that with the wholesale price at Rs 35, he is selling onion for Rs 40 per kg as in a bag of 50 kg, at least 10 per cent gets damaged. The prices have continued to go up by Rs 4-5 per kg in every 4-5 days, reaching Rs 40 on date. The city needs around 130-150 quintals of onion daily and majority of the supply is catered from Maharashtra.Apart from onion, the price of potato too has gone up as some retailers were selling it for Rs 20 per kg, a hike of Rs 8 in a fortnight. Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said a meeting with the onion wholesalers will be called and necessary steps would be taken to keep the prices under control.Former president of Rourkela District Congress Committee Biren Senapati, however, alleged the price rise was being abetted by local civil supplies authorities in connivance with unscrupulous traders. The CSO has marketing intelligence personnel to keep track of any abnormal price hike, but they would not act. The delay in taking action is designed to benefit unscrupulous traders, he alleged."

He chaired a meeting of all state food and consumer affairs ministers and secretaries.A consumer affairs ministry official said there is a dire need to change some of the provisions as for almost all offences, there is a jail term - minimum three months and maximum seven years. This is over and above the fines that the offenders need to pay. The Act also has provision for confiscating the stored items and seizing godown and vehicles carrying such stuff. In some cases, even the seized property can be forfeited to the government. The law empowers court to bar a repeat offender from carrying on any business on the particular commodity for at least six months.Most of these are draconian provisions and need to be changed. After getting feedback from states, we will submit it to the Niti Aayog committee under Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , said an official.The panel under Fadnavis was set up in July at Niti Aayog meeting to suggest policy interventions in the agriculture sector including the required changes in the EC Act. Though initially the think tank had mooted the proposal to take out all agriculture produce out of the EC Act, it was felt that the law has proved effective in taming prices of food stuff such as onions, potatoes and pulses on several occasions. The law empowers the Centre to notify any product as essential commodity and can put limits on their storage, transport and distribution. it deals with the stock limit and hoarding of goods.After chairing the first meeting of the committee in August, Fadnavis had said the Act would only be applied in extreme situations like famine and war. He had said that there was a broad consensus that the entire Act should not be repealed. The provisions related to agriculture, which affects the prices of produce, should remain in force, he had said.Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said a meeting has been called on September 9 to find an alternative to the plastic bottles used for sale of packaged drinking water. He said industry representatives, including manufacturers of packaged drinking water, would attend the meeting."

2019-09-04,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/sep/04/cooking-methods-to-get-the-most-from-your-meal-2028416.html,Cooking methods to get the most from your meal,"Dr Vinitha Krishnan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI : In simple terms, lifestyle-related diseases are caused due to the health-damaging choices that we make in our day-to-day life. Cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, sleep-disorders, stress, obesity and some forms of cancers can be listed under this umbrella term. Modifying cooking practices to retain the gamut of healthy nutrients it contains may help to either prevent or delay the onset of lifestyle diseases.With starch being a major part of our plate, modification of starch in food by cooking will be a simple and economical way to deal with lifestyle diseases. Resistant starch (RS) is a unique carb that resists digestion and leads to several health benefits. While some foods are more resistant starch than others, the way food is prepared can also impact how much is present. Cooking methods including baking, steaming and autoclave cooking increases the amount of RS foods, but pressure cooking decreases the amount of the RS foods.The resistant starch in potatoes, rice and pasta can be increased by cooling these foods after cooking and reheating them later. Use of vinegar and lime juice in cooked food may increase the amount of RS. Fortification is another simple way to benefit the targeted population group at large. RS is known to positively influence the functioning of digestive tract, gut microbial flora, blood cholesterol, and glycemic index levels and assists in the control of diabetes, protects from colon cancer, diverticulitis, and haemorrhoids.Almost everyone can benefit from cutting back on unhealthy fat. The simplest way is to bake, grill, or broil food rather than fry it in fat. Chicken can be made healthier by removing the skin before cooking. While some nutrients are heat-sensitive, particularly those in fruits, slow cooking at low heat improves the bioavailability of various essential nutrients, for example, preformed vitamin A from meat, and beneficial phytochemicals like carotenoids from vegetables and leafy greens, particularly in the presence of fat or oil such as olive oil. Nutritional value of legumes, meats, fish, grains/cereals, and vegetables [with oil] is improved by slow cooking.By contrast, the nutritional value of most fruits is not improved by cooking. Fresh seasonal fruits, washed well and eaten with skin may retain the nutritive value of fruits.Staying hydrated is important for good health. Sweetened drinks like fruit juice, soda, sports and energy drinks, sweetened or flavoured milk, and sweetened iced tea, add a lot of sugar and calories to your diet. Boiled and cooled water is the best choice for all age groups.We now understand that spices and herbs have a meaningful role to play in bringing flavour to the forefront of todays health and wellness conversations. Curcumin, fennel, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, basil, chill peppers, mint and oregano when used in cooking, not only improves flavour but helps prevent certain lifestyle diseases when used regularly in prescribed amounts.Good nutrition doesnt come in a pill. Eat a variety of foods and give importance to adopt cooking methods that would preserve the goodness in food.The author is a nutritionist at Fortis Malar Hospital."

And ahimsa is a fundamental tenet of their religion. They dont eat any of the root vegetables such as onions, potatoes, garlic, etc. as they believe that microorganisms living in the soil get injured when the plant is pulled up! Numbering a little over a lakh in the city, Jains are celebrating Maha Paryushan Parv this week. Jains celebrate their festivals by fasting, as they believe in celebrating the natural qualities of the soul, which is not nourished by over-eating and indulging in merrymaking.Jains are divided into Shwetambar and Digambar. There are sub-categories under Shwetambar like Terapanth, Sthankwasi, Mandirmargi, and in Digambar, Khandelwal, Porwal etc.All for one, one for all:Jain Seva Sangh is an autonomous body of the community, comprising a majority of Shwetambar Jains. Similarly, for Digambars, there is Digambar Jain Sanstha (DJS), which helps maintain their temples and assists in organising festivals and other activities. Whenever a Guru (Maharaj) travels to the city, DJS reportedly that takes care of all the arrangements. Within DJS, there is another group called Yuva Yuvati Mandal (YYM), founded by youngsters.One of the unique aspects of YYM is that there no positions of Secretary, President, etc. in the group. Using a lottery system, a five-member bench is elected every three months, which will carry out the activities. The main agenda of the group is to help youngsters in need. They also donate blood to the needy. There is another body called Jain International Trade Organisation (JITO) which is a worldwide organisation of businessmen, industrialists, knowledge workers and professionals, says DJS PR Lokender Jain.Food fundas:As far as food is concerned, Jains dont eat anything grown under the soil, and believe in preparing all masalas, wheat flour and all other flours at home, apparently due to hygiene concerns. Most Jains are in businesses such as money lending, jewellery, pharmaceuticals, real estate, food grains, etc. In the healthcare sector, Mahavir Hospital in the city is part of a Charitable Trust run by Jain Seva Sangh, which reportedly provides dialysis to patients at nominal prices.Festivals:Paryushan Parv and Mahaveer Jayanti are their big days. Maha Paryushan Parv is observed to put an end to needless desires, unwanted passions and all types of immoral behaviour. This annual event is celebrated for self-purification and upliftment by adhering to ten universal virtues viz. Uttam Kshama (forgiveness), Uttam Mardava (gentleness), Uttam Aarjava (straightforwardness), Uttam Shauch (purity), Uttam Satya (truth), Uttam Sanyam (restraint), Uttam Tap (penance), Uttam Tyaga (sacrifice), Uttam Aakinchanya (giving up possessions) and Uttam Brahmcharya (chastity).The festivals main aim is to help people in understanding the real nature of the soul and to stay away from worldly desires. It cautions against being too involved in material comforts and motivates practitioners to lead a simple and fulfilling life. During the festival, Jains shun fashionable clothes, eating outside food, spending too much time on social media, etc., adds Lokender.While the Paryushan Parv for Shwetambar Jains finished on September 2, the event began on September 3 for Digambar Jains, which continues till September 13."

But some human foods are dangerous for dogs and can harm them like grapes, onions, chocolates and avacado. Even cinnamon, oranges, corn and cherries are not good as these might make your dog sick. Now the question is what can dogs eat and what they cant off your plate? Weve made a list of some human foods you might offer to your pet.Healthy human food choices for your pupBlueberries: Berries make a great snack for your dog. Blueberries especially are packed with antioxidants that reduce inflammation and help the body heal and provide vitamins like Vitamin K and C.Apples: Apples contain a ton of fibre and have a sweet taste that dogs go crazy for. You can even dry apple slices on low heat in the oven for a tasty snack.Carrots: Dogs love carrots. They are packed with vitamins like Vitamin K and beta carotene and contain fibre and antioxidants. Due to its hard structure, dogs eats them very slowly. Eggs: One of the best people food for dogs are eggs. Your dogs system is built to utilise the protein and fats found in animal foods. You can grind up eggshells to add calcium to your dogs diet.Occasional treatsBananas: Bananas are packed with a lot of healthy vitamins and minerals, but also contain a fair amount of sugar, and that makes them one of the foods dogs should not eat much. Potatoes: While cooked potatoes are one of the safest foods for dogs, uncooked potatoes are poisonous for them. Cooked white potatoes can be diced up and given as treats or mashed and mixed with kibble for a special holiday meal.Shrimps: Shrimps contain high levels of Vitamin B12 and niacin, which are important for your dogs gut and metabolic health. They are also high in protein and low in fat which is great for dogs with pancreatitis or other fat-sensitive diseases.Bread: Many dogs love bread. But while bread isnt one of the worst things to feed a dog, it doesnt have a lot of positive health benefits."
2019-09-05,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sending-out-a-message-through-theme-ganeshas/article29336089.ece,Sending out a message through ‘Theme Ganeshas’,"Vinayaka Chavithi was celebrated with a difference in the city this year as many youth associations in the city tried to send out a message by coming up with innovative, theme-based pandals.Based on concepts like physical fitness, avoidance of excess mobile phone usage, playing indoor games, and the perils of plastic were brilliantly showcased through the highly creative pandals that drew hundreds of admirers from across teh city.Four years ago, I pondered upon why many people put ceramic tiles depicting Gods and Goddesses at public places. I realised that it is done to dissuade people from spitting and urinating on the walls and stairways of the buildings. In India, people are god-fearing and respect anything that is done in the name of god. This inspired us to install Ganesha idols based on a public message that would highlight a certain issue, said Sai Srinivas, a member of the Ganesh pandal committee near Satyam Junction.This year, the committees theme was to highlight the importance and benefits of playing indoor and outdoor games and a reduction in playing mobile phone games.Nowadays, young people spend all their free time time on their mobile phones and are becoming couch potatoes, instead of indulging in outdoor or indoor games. This is affecting both their mental and physical faculties and that is what we want to highlight by showcasing Ganesha playing games with his friends and not wasting his time on the mobile phone, Mr. Srinivas said.Last year, the same group had highlighted the importance of adhering to traffic rules and in 2017, the theme was on the importance of blood donation.Creative ideasStriking a patriotic note, the youth association at Railway New Colony depicted Lord Ganesha saluting the Tricolour unfurled by his father Lord Shiva.On a contemporary note, the youth association at Fishing Harbour based their pandal on the theme of plastic pollution. They created a pandal made entirely with plastic bottles, with the message that it is high time they be banned.We as fishermen have been facing a lot of problems due to dumping of plastic waste in the ocean. Our catch is depleting fast because of the plastic menace, said Nookaraju, a member of the Fishing Harbour Youth Club.In Chilakapeta, the youth association sought to highlight the plight of farmers, with the Ganesha idol seen laboriously carryng a plough on his shoulder.At Jalaripeta, the theme of the pandal was based on physical fitness where Lord Ganesha is seen working out in the gym to build a well-toned body."

This can have dramatic consequences for farmers around the globe, as a case in India shows. For years Haribhai Devjibhai Patel has been growing cotton, peanuts and potatoes in the western Indian state of Gujarat. For years he and his family have used seedlings from one harvest to plant the next years crops on his four acre field.AdvertisingLast year he planted a new potato variety known as FC5. It was a decision that ultimately landed him in court, because the US company PepsiCo had already claimed the rights to that very same potato variety.Patel claims he wasnt aware of the potatos name, much less PepsiCos claim.I had no idea whatsoever and how I had been dragged into this mess, he said in a statement to DW.AdvertisingIn April he and four other farmers from the region were sued by PepsiCo India for cultivating and allegedly infringing on its patent on FC5.According to the plaintiffs lawyer, Anand Yadnik, the lawsuit alleges that the FC5 potato is especially bred for PepsiCos subsidiary company Lays and their internationally distributed product: potato chips.PepsiCo was seeking 10 million Rupies or $140.000 ( 126.000).I was completely devastated. I was afraid. Not in my lifetime would I ever have been able to pay the kind of damages that were being claimed by PepsiCo, Patel said.The 46-year-old farmer has two children and earns around $3,500 per year.The lawsuit was based on findings that PepsiCo gathered from Patels field. According to his lawyer, the company hired a private detective agency to provide the data.They took secret video footage and collected samples from farmers fields sans disclosing their real intent, he told DW .Privatized resourcesThe case is another example of an ongoing global trend of companies claiming property rights for plants or genetic material of plants across the globe.Resources that used to be available to mankind as a community have now been confined to privatization, Judith Desberg from NGO gene ethical network told DW.The United States first introduced the idea of patenting living materials in the 1980s and Western countries soon followed their lead. The number of patents on plants worldwide has increased a hundredfold from just under 120 in 1990 to 12,000 today  3500 of them are registered in Europe,according to the European initiative No-Patents-On-Seeds.What kind of invention?By patenting a plant or a plants traits, the patent owner has mostly exclusive rights to breed, grow and sell the product. This restricts farmers from sowing, planting, harvesting or breeding that variety without permission.Patents are often applied to plants with special characteristics or to individual gene sequences in the plants, such as disease resistance or resistance to the effects of climate change. There have also been examples of companies such as Monsanto developing plants resistant to pesticides they themselves sell.The patentability of traits as an actual invention is a problem. Because plants develop and their genes mutate naturally, Judith Desberg told DW. So if a trait like an apple with pink dots is patented and a farmer accidentally finds an apple with pink dots on his trees he theoretically could be sued by the patent holder.Patented pollen spread by the wind could, for example, cause an accidental intermixing of genetic material found in different fields.In 2004, the multinational company Monsanto sued Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser for replanting saved soybeans after one harvest without Monsatos permission. The farmer claimed that his field had been contaminated years ago by genetically modified pollen. Monsanto proved right in court. However, due to the small amount of patented genes in Schmeisers crops the court ruled he didnt have any advantage and thus didnt have to pay damages.BiopiracyMonsanto claims that upholding patent laws is necessary because it also guarantees the financing of new inventions. Not protecting them would hinder the development of newer and better technologies.Commenting on a similar case, Monsanto stated that it invests millions of dollars every day in the research and development of its agricultural products. [] For every $10 a farmer spends on seeds, Monsanto re-invests $1 in research and development.However, critics argue that patents block access to genetic material for farmers and minimize biodiversity, the diversity of species and increase farmers dependency on seed producers.But Bayer, Monsantos parent company, told DW in a written statement: Farmers have the choice of whether and which products they buy from which supplier. [ ] Each farmer decides freely. [] Farmers will only use our products if they gain a clear advantage.In Europe, a case involving Monsanto and a particular breed of melon drew media attention several years ago. Monsanto had discovered that an Indian melon variety was naturally resistant to a specific virus. At the European Patent Office it then successfully applied for a patent on that trait after breeding into other melons.From this moment on, not only did this trait belong to Monsanto, but so did every melon variety containing it, including the Indian melon from which it originated. Patent opponents call this practice biopiracy.The patent was later revoked by EU institutions on the grounds that the trait could not be considered an invention.A mega market and a threat to food security?According to the Indian-based market research agency Mordor Intelligence, revenue in the seed sector will reach $90 billion by 2024 compared to about $60 billion in 2018. And over 50% of the worldwide market share is in the hands of Bayer-Monsanto, Du Pont and Syngenta.Bram de Jonge from Oxfam Netherlands argues the growing number of plant patents and increasing consolidation in the seed industry threaten farmers rights as outlined by the UN to store, use, exchange and sell seeds or crops from their own harvest.This is something that is not just happening in the US or Europe, its happening around the globe, said de Jonge.Who will decide in the future what lands in the fields? It will be the big corporations, de Jonge told DW. Patents were actually created to protect human inventions like a radio or a cellphone, but not for living material.The UN report The right to food has also raised concerns about food security caused by the oligopolistic structure of the input providers warning that it could also cause food prices to increase and deprive the poorest of food.A further concern is who owns the seeds and who produces the food. According to the NGO Germanwatch, most of the seed producing industry comes from the Global North, but 90% of biological resources (agricultural products, natural materials come) from the Global South.While patenting laws remain more restrictive in the Global South, an Oxfam Study shows that big global players appear to be finding loopholes.In India, for example, the law is not being applied properly, leaving farmers vulnerable, according to Varnika Chawla of the international law firm Bryan Cave LLP.In India, although the patentability of isolated genes would be excluded if the law were strictly interpreted [] patents on isolated genes have been granted, Varnika Chawla wrote in the Journal for Intellectual Property Law and Practice.The danger for the farmers is that courts misinterpret badly or simply wrongly or the laws are simply changed, Yagnin told DW.Massive protestsPepsiCos lawsuit against farmer Patel and the other plaintiffs led to massive protests by Indian farmers who are calling for a boycott of the multinational company. Politicians also criticized the company.In May, PepsiCo India unexpectedly withdrew the complaint after closed door meetings with the state government. Despite several DW requests for comment, PepsiCo India had not responded by the time of publication. Although Patel is relieved the suit was withdrawn, he still has concerns.There are still chances of the company initiating such cases against me in the future and Im not competent to stand against such giant multinational companies.AdvertisingNevertheless he will grow the potato FC5 again this year, as a matter of right."

He is being framed falsely. Murari Lal did everything deliberately. It was due to his apathy that children were served just with salt and roti,"" said Rukmani Devi, the cook who served salt and roti to over 100 primary school children in Mirzapur on the day of Janmashtami last month.The incident came to light only after journalist Pramod Kumar Jaiswal shot it and made the video viral on social media the same day.Initially, the administration took notice of the incident through the video clip and acted against headmaster Murari Lal and a few basic education department officials but later the district administration booked Jaiswal also on charges of criminal conspiracy allegedly to malign the image of the state government.Jaiswal was implicated along with Rajkumar Pal, a representative of the village head, who had alerted the reporter about the alleged deception in the scheme.While the cook Rukmani Devi supported the journalist, angry villagers also backed him for bringing the truth to the fore. They even demanded that the administration revoke the FIR lodged against Jaiswal.The majority of the villagers and their children said that it was a routine of the principal to usurp grains, milk, fruits and vegetables supplied for mid-day meals to be given to the children.Rukmani claimed that she hardly got the full quota of vegetables and other items to cook for the children. Many times I had to dilute the milk by adding water so that everyone could get it, she claimed while talking to the media.We were given just 2.5 kg of potatoes and 250gm of oil for a week. Sometimes students only got half a roti each, she said.On any given day, there are close to 50 kids in school. Whenever she used to bring it to the notice of Murari Lal, he would ask her to cook with whatever she had. At least twice in a month, the children were given rice and salt.Several angry parents also claimed that whenever they raised the issue with the school principal, he would turn them away saying he was doing the best he could.The expose has proved to be a boon for the school. Grains, fruits, milk and vegetables are now present at full capacity here. The earthen oven had been replaced by a LPG gas stove and cylinder. Moreover, schools in adjoining areas have also spruced up their mid-day meals and other facilities."

With Onam nearing, people thronged the stall to buy farm produce. It is one among the many stalls offering farm produce at subsidised rates as part of the governments intervention to control market prices.Onam markets will be organised from Saturday to Tuesday, whereby vegetables will be made available at heavily slashed rates.Two hundred such stalls set up jointly by the Agriculture Department, Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council (VFPCK) are slated to be opened in the city offering vegetables.The prices of farm produce in major vegetable markets in the city are skyrocketing. The sellers are charging triple the prices we are offering. All vegetables will be available at 20 per cent discounted rates at our stalls. If the prices in the markets increase further, then more discount will be provided to keep a check on the rates. The rates will be fixed on a daily basis depending on the prices in the vegetable markets, says Krishna Prasad P K, manager of the outlet in Palayam.All the farm produce necessary to celebrate Onam have arrived at the market in Anayara. These will be up for sale from Saturday at discounted rates, he said.Apart from the Horticorp outlets, several new Onam markets will be set up until Tuesday.The produce sourced from Kerala and those from other states are placed at different counters, thereby making it easier for the public to buy naadan varieties. Some vegetables such as tomatoes, beans, onions, potatoes, beetroot and such are not being cultivated here in large numbers. So we have to procure them from other states. We have stocked up enough to cater to the Onam demand this time, says Krishna Prasad.For people like Jayachandran B who regularly buys vegetables from Horticorp, the special Onam markets are a godsend. Such markets help arrest the prices and we get to buy fresh farm produce. During such festive occasions, retailers hike prices. These interventions help provide farm produce at affordable rates, says Jayachandran, a retired government servant.Anne John also echoes the same sentiment. Apart from arresting the prices, we also get local produce. I always buy from Horticorp and only get the produce made in the state, she says."
2019-09-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/for-pope-francis-a-perfect-moment-for-an-unsettling-warning-on-the-environment-5976889/,"For Pope Francis, a perfect moment for an unsettling warning on the environment","Written by Jason HorowitzAdvertisingIn a nature reserve on the banks of the clay-colored Katsaoka River, an 8-week-old crowned sifaka clung to its mothers back as she leapt across tree branches. Nearby, other lemur species combed their youngs backs, nibbled on leaves or lounged in the sun.Some had white fur, or brown patches, or tails with 28 black-and-white rings. All had one thing in common: endangerment by rampant deforestation and climate change, which threaten the island nations future.Pope Francis used his first full day in Madagascar to hammer the same point home.AdvertisingYour lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal biodiversity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit, Francis said Saturday in Madagascars capital, Antananarivo, about an hours drive from the lemur reserve. The last forests are menaced by forest fires, poaching, the unrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands.Francis has been making a similar case since his election in 2013, when he put environmental protection and global warming at the top of his agenda. He championed the Paris climate accord and, in 2015, became the first pope to dedicate an encyclical to protecting the earth.But the timing of his visits to Mozambique, which ended Friday, and to the islands of Madagascar and later Mauritius seemed unsettlingly fitting.In recent weeks the Amazon has burned, fires have raged in Angola and Congo, and a glacier has melted in Iceland.The appeals of Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager and environmentalist, have spread across Europe. And yet another deadly storm has been bearing down on the United States, where calls for a Green New Deal have gathered liberal momentum.The visit is an occasion for this subject to come forward, said Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a confidant of the pope.Parts of Mozambique were devastated in March by a cyclone that the United Nations called one of the worst in recent memory and another that followed soon after; Madagascar, Malawi and Zimbabwe were also affected. The storms caused severe flooding, killed more than 1,000 people and caused acute food insecurity for more than 1.5 million, according to the US Agency for International Development.Before the popes arrival we had many meetings with young people about what the pope said about climate change, said Bishop Antnio Juliasse of Maputo, Mozambiques capital. He called it a big issue for us, saying: We know the consequences from that. We know because we suffer it.So do others.This years Global Climate Risk Index lists Madagascar as the seventh most affected country in part because of the toll that droughts and floods have taken on the islands poor, who rely on small-scale farming or fishing.Throughout his trip, the pope has denounced the exploitation of natural resources. In Mozambique, the World Bank estimates, nearly 20 million acres of forest have been lost, an amount about the size of its onetime colonizer, Portugal.At times it seems that those who approach with the alleged desire to help have other interests, Francis said Friday at a packed stadium in Maputo. The stripping of resources, he said, is the price to be paid for foreign aid.Hints of Chinas deep investments in Mozambique are everywhere, from the signs that bear Chinese writing to the spring rolls on the hotel menus. China has also taken much, importing large amounts of Africas rosewood and other hardwoods for luxury furniture.They said, We come to help you, Augusta Alinda, 16, said of the Chinese, but they made it worse.In Madagascar, nearly half of the forests have disappeared in the last 60 years, according to the French agricultural research center CIRAD. The Primate Specialist Group, a network of scientists, has deemed its lemurs the most endangered primates in the world, owing to illegal logging, poaching for food, slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production.In the wild, they need at least three hectares for each group, Diary Rafalimanana, a guide at the lemur reserve, said as he watched a cramped family. Across the river behind them, villagers planted sweet potatoes, fished for tilapia and did what they could to get by.Intense droughts, storms and floods have wreaked havoc on agriculture in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries. More than 90% of its 26 million people live on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations World Food Program.While condemning environmental devastation, Francis recognized on Saturday that the poor often had little alternative to illegal logging or stripping the earth of minerals. Indeed, on the roads west of Antananarivo, climate change did not seem to be a pressing concern.Instead, getting across the road seemed challenging enough. Taxi vans, scooters, bicycles and bull-drawn carriages loaded with bulging sacks of wood barely slowed for barefoot children rushing across the street. Shopkeepers in open-air butcher shops, vegetable stands and chicken spots brushed up against vendors selling brooms, license plates and sneakers. Men and women balanced bags of rice, stereo speakers, tires and baskets of live chickens on their heads.Francis image in these parts was minimal. There were a few signs of him smiling and waving, and closer to town a woman sold sunhats adorned with his face. But in the periphery of the population Francis so wants to reach, he and his message seemed peripheral.Everywhere smoke billowed. From exhaust pipes, from fires in the fields and from under the pots where children sell corn heated by brick ovens on the roadside. Many men wore orange shirts emblazoned with the face of Madagascars president, Andry Rajoelina.Rajoelina, an event promoter turned power broker, has tried to bolster the countrys finances by allowing a surge in deforestation. Much of the felled rosewood and ebony found its way to China, and a large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace, according to a European Parliament resolution calling on Madagascar to curb corruption and better protect its environment.The pope had the same message Saturday.In a word, there can be no true ecological approach or effective efforts to safeguard the environment without the attainment of social justice, Francis said next to Rajoelina, who promised on this day to repair and rebuild Madagascar.For some of Francis believers, at least, the message was getting through.AdvertisingThe pope and now everybody is talking about the environment, said Angelo Chambule, 51, who works in imports in Maputo. That we have to do something or we wont have a future."
2019-09-08,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/217-farmers-ended-their-lives-since-2011/article29363853.ece,‘217 farmers ended their lives since 2011’,"Pratima Kuikuri and Sanatan Dhara travelled all the way from Hooghly and Purba Bardhaman districts respectively to take part in a farmers rally called by All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the peasants wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), at Kolkatas Rani Rashmoni Avenue.Both Ms. Kuikuri and Mr. Dhara have lost someone close to them to agrarian distress in the State. Sharing her plight with the gathering, Ms. Kuikuri said: I have come all the way from Tarakeshwar in Hooghly. My husband was a potato farmer. He had a loan of 3 lakh.Mr. Dhara said his brother Dinobandhu Dhara killed himself on May 29, 2015, after his crop, cultivated on 5 acres of land, failed.The rally, organised recently, aimed to highlight the crisis being faced by farmers in the State. Representatives of AIKS brought family members of more than 40 farmers who had killed themselves in the State since 2011 when the Trinamool Congress came to power.Gayatri Malik from Bardhaman and Asha Durlad from Haripal in Hooghly, whose husbands had ended their lives, were also on the stage. We do not have much education to speak on stage, but we have not got any help from the State, Ms. Malik said.According to the AIKS, 217 farmers have killed themselves in West Bengal since 2011 due to farm distress. In 2019, as many as 22 farmers ended their lives till August-end, claimed AIKS members.AIKS State secretary Amal Halder said that out of 217 deaths, 150 had been reported in Bardhaman alone. Mr. Halder, a central committee member of the CPI(M), said Bardhaman (both Purba and Paschim) and Hooghly are the worst-affected by agrarian distress.Do not take your own lives, instead fight against those who are putting you in such a situation. It is better to die fighting, taking a bullet from police than wasting your life in helplessness, an AIKS leader said while addressing the gathering.Multiple reasonsDismissing the allegations, West Bengal Agriculture Minister Asish Banerjee said that the CPI(M) and its farmers front are spreading lies. Not a single case of farmer ending their lives due to agrarian distress has come to our notice since the change of government in 2011, he said. The Minister said multiple reasons such as ailments and family problems have led to farmers death, but not agrarian distress.According to data on accidental deaths and people killing themselves in the country, published by the National Crime Records Bureau, in 2015, West Bengal recorded 14,310 deaths, the third highest after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Despite high incidence of farmers taking their own lives, the State government has not admitted agrarian distress as the reason for even a single case.Suicide prevention helpline: 033-24637401/033-24637432; website: www.lifelinefoundation.co.in; e-mail: lifelinekolkata@gmail.com"
2019-09-09,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amid-acute-poverty-saharia-children-battle-malnutrition/article29369050.ece,"Amid acute poverty, M.P.’s Saharia children battle malnutrition","On July 9, when Akki Adiwasi returned home after working in the fields, she found her 18-month-old son lying unusually quiet, with eyes closed. She nudged him  even shook him  but to no avail. By then, Amir Awadesh, his chest shrivelled and cheeks sunken, had died of hunger.He didnt die of hunger. Usse sookhe ki bimari ne cheen liya (the disease of drought snatched him away), quips Akki, a resident of Tiktoli village in Sheopur district.While her husband is away in Gujarat for three months to work as an agricultural labourer for 150 a day, their half-an-acre arid field here lies fallow. Only milk from a few goats, shoring up their one-room ramshackle hut, and wheat given by neighbours, keep Akki, who is pregnant, and her other son, aged three, alive.Loss of livesAcute malnutrition among Saharias, a particularly vulnerable tribal group, due to crushing poverty, delayed breastfeeding, premature pregnancies and seasonal migrations is continuing to take away lives. As a result, every second child under five in the Shivpuri and Sheopur districts of central India is underweight. Even the country, in the 2018 Global Hunger Index, ranked an abysmal 103 out of 119 countries, consistently showing a downward trend on wasting and undernourishment parameters.Mitti Adiwasi, an anganwadi worker in Nonheta Khurd village in the Shivpuri district, breastfed her 10 children, two dead now, for the first time, three days after being delivered of them. Until then, they were fed only jaggery syrup or honey.The first milk is impure. Thats because it is extracted from breasts after nine long months, she says.Chipping in, Danmati Adiwasi, wife of a school teacher who earns 22,000 a month, says, Moreover, women become polluted at the time of a delivery. They need to bathe after three days and only then feed newborns, otherwise the milk would only cause them harm. Right after the birth of her son a few years ago at a hospital, when she was prompted to breastfeed him, she just put his mouth to her breast, and received 1,400 in the name of an institutional delivery.According to the National Family Health Survey 2014-2015, just 43.2% of children under three were breastfed within the first hour of their birth in rural parts of Sheopur district.Seasonal migrationAlmost all the 35 families in the village, taking their children along and leaving behind the elderly, migrate to Rajasthan and Agra to harvest wheat and potatoes every year.When families returned in July this year, the anganwadi workers noticed that more number of children had come back weaker. While three boys and four girls out of 83 children were underweight in April, 15 girls and four boys are in the category this month.Girls are most affected as parents mostly take them along with them to fields where they are neglected, wander under the sun, dont get food, and contract diseases easily during the monsoon, says an anganwadi worker.For each bigha of wheat they harvest in Rajasthan, 6-7 labourers get a quintal in return. And each villager manages to bring back at least two quintals. Individual families have no more than two acres each to themselves, mostly arid, and completely dependant on rain.When we run out of it, we barter PDS (public distribution system) rice,which is unsavoury, in exchange for wheat from a local vendor, says Parmal Adivasi. Married at 15, he lost two infants who were born weak. In the past fortnight, two meals of chappatis with dry onions or chilli chutney is all he and his wife have been eating.We dont have breakfast. A vegetable dish or dal is a luxury. And children dont get to eat until they start howling out of hunger. Toddlers get only a roti each in a day, he says. Seven individuals in the village, including children, suffer from tuberculosis (TB). Ajay Yadav, a social worker who has been working in the area for 18 years, believes higher incidence of tuberculosis among Saharias is linked to the high malnutrition level among them and vice versa. An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study revealed that, among Saharias, TB prevalence is an alarming 1,995 per 1,00,000 persons."
2019-09-11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sinking-of-soil-now-spreads-backwards-towards-hind/articleshow/71072691.cms,Metro mishap: Soil sinking now spreads backwards,"KMRC workers dismantle the building at 11/1 Durga Pithuri LaneKOLKATA: Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation officials have noticed fresh subsidence or soil settlement along a section of the East-West Metro between the Hind Cinema crossing and Bowbazar , along Nirmal Chandra Street, where tunnelling has already been completed apparently without any hitch.An 85-metre stretch to the southwest of Durga Pithuri Lane (the zone where the KMRC is struggling to contain the fallout of the August 31 underground accident) has subsided by 8 mm over the past three days. That, admit officials, is 10 times the maximum soil settlement along the stretches  including SN Banerjee Road and Government Place East  where tunnelling had been completed earlier.This has now prompted KMRC to plan a fresh survey of buildings along Nirmal Chandra Street to check for cracks that may have appeared over the past few days. TOI on Monday ran a front-page report on cracks discovered by residents and traders in buildings along this very stretch.We have managed to arrest subsidence around the north, east and west of Durga Pithuri Lane after extensive grouting since the underground aquifer was pierced accidentally on August 31. But, over the last few days, ground settlement has been noticed in the direction of Esplanade till around 85 metres from the subsidence epicentre, a KMRC insider told TOI, adding that this was a concern.Officials said the stability of buildings, under which the twin tunnel-boring machines Chundee and Urvi had traversed, would be checked. Chundee, which is boring the west-bound tunnel, has travelled 1.6 km; Urvi, which is boring a parallel tunnel for the line in the opposite direction, has traversed 1.2 km.Topographically, the 2.45-km East-West Metros underground route from Esplanade to Sealdah is characterised alternately by sticky clay and sandy soil. The former is condusive to tunnel construction but the latter is not.The TBMs that are boring the tunnel from Esplanade to Sealdah Station (east-ward direction) have already covered nearly half the journey. It is only after 49 Lenin Sarani, a three-storeyed building at the Lenin Sarani-Nirmal Chandra Street intersection that houses a couple of popular potato chips outlets, that the soil character changes more frequently.The soil is sticky clay up to Wellington Square; it that has no permeability and is, hence, compact and good to bore through. But, after that, the soil character changes to sandy; it is porous and allows water to trickle through and accumulate, leading to formation of shallow aquifers. Chundee negotiated one such sandy layer between Wellington Square and Hind Cinema. The soil was sticky clay again after that and it was a smooth run till it ran into the large aquifer under Durga Pithuri Lane that caused the unprecedented subsidence, an official explained.Grouting is being done but it will not be effective until the water stops seeping. Hopefully, the water seepage has not caused too much instability for the structures located along Nirmal Chandra Street. But we can find that out only after a thorough survey. Thankfully, the degree of settlement is declining, another engineer said.The TBM that is driven by the earth pressure balance has stopped digging and is exerting its own weight of around 450 tonnes on the soil. This may be adding to the soil settlement towards Nirmal Chandra Street where the tunnel is still flooded with water that seeped in, say engineers.The soil is the safest about 300 metres from the Sealdah Station complex and tunnelling will be a challenge till this point. TBM Chundee had already crossed 150 metres of sandy soil along the 431m of curve from Chaitan Sen Lane before it hit the aquifer and water started charging out at 11 to 15 cubic metres per hour, leading to a complete halt to work in the zone."
2019-09-11,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/sep/11/city-institutions-usher-in-onam-2031921.html,City institutions usher in Onam,"By Express News ServiceKOCHI: Festivals are usually occasions of pomp and gaiety but they also give us a chance to reflect on virtues of compassion and benevolence. As Onam fervour reaches a crescendo, heres a roundup of how educational institutions in the city ushered in the festivities with acts of generosity and togetherness.Around 35 patients of the palliative care unit of Ernakulam General Hospital and mentally challenged students of Buds School, Mulavukad, joined the Onam celebrations at St Alberts College recently. I am grateful to everyone who organised this celebration. At a time when senior parents are being abandoned by their children, this is a warm gesture, said Ramachandran, a patient. The college management organised the event to foster a sense of compassion among its students. A dance performance by the students of Buds left the audience in awe. 33 per cent of the funds collected was earmarked for supporting relief activities in the aftermath of floods.The students of the Commerce Department of St Pauls College, Kalamassery, celebrated Onam in a noble way. The fund allotted for procuring flowers for pookalam was instead used to buy vegetables to make the mandala and later donated to an orphanage run by social activist Theruvoram Murugan. There are around 27 to 30 inmates in the orphanage who were rescued from the streets.The orphange sustains itself through contributions. I asked the students to think about doing something different and they came up with the idea of making a design using vegetables, said Jibin Jacob, assistant professor, who mentored the initiative. We used 150 kg of vegetables to make the carpet. The vegetables were selected keeping in mind the needs of the inmates, added Jibin. The carpet comprised of an array of veggies including brinjals, beetroots, tomatoes, onions, drumstick, French beans, pumpkin, elephant foot yam, cucumber, colocasia, banana flower, carrots, ladys finger, ivy gourd, snake gourd, cowpea, potatoes and shallots.Onam celebrations held at Toc H Public School saw students presenting dance and music performances which highlighted various traditions associated with the festival and artforms unique to Kerala. The celebration commenced with toddlers of kindergarten welcoming everyone by reciting the popular song Vannalo vannalo onam vannalo. Boys and girls attended the function dressed in traditional outfits.Major highlights of Onam celebrations at Greets Public School was the mega Thiruvathirakali performed by the girl students and the vanchi pattu presented by the boys. The programme began with shingari melam and pulikali. The mega Thiruvathirakali and the vanchi pattu were organised to send a message of unity."

Many of the restaurants and cafs that I had unearthed during my junkets and contemplated as new, unique and exciting, had shut shop. Even Cafe Zoe, one of my happy favourites, tragically announced closure this week.With a sense of wistfulness and melancholy, I started wondering about restaurants that start with such bright beginnings only to fade into the dark abyss of extinction. Some estimates say that 90% of all new restaurants fail in their first year. More conservative figures put that number at 44%, with 33% of the remaining establishments failing within the second year, and 23% of those still left, shutting in their third year.Yet some restaurants in Mumbai have managed to not only survive the test of time, but still remain crowded and as popular as when they first opened. Take Gaylords, for example; over 50 years in, you cant get a table without a booking. Copper Chimney opened in 1972 and has a clientele that covers three generations. Cream Centre at Chowpatty, where my parents dated for Gods sake, even today has a queue outside on the pavement on the weekends. Sher-e-Punjab has survived under the radar of glamour, by providing consistently fantastic food to their core customers. Leopold, thanks to Lonely Planet, its never-ending menu, quick service and its legend, has survived since 1871.Lings Pavilion has been running to packed houses since 1991, China Garden still attracts customers even after Nelson Wang, the force behind the movement, moved to Canada. More recently, Indigo Deli turned 14, which is a huge achievement given that it serves neither Indian nor Chinese cuisine. And then there are the likes of Pancham Puriwala, Balwas, Bawarchi, Delhi Darbar, Gulshan-e-Iran, Mondegar, Mahesh Lunch Home, Trishna, Olympia, Gypsy Chinese, Panshikar, Prakash, Goa Portuguesa, possibly a few that I may have missed, and all the Irani cafs that have withstood the test of time.On the menu at Gallops are baked favourites like Cottage Pie and Eggs Mornay. The food always tastes as it always has. Nothing changes, and thats the endearing charm of these pockets of the past.Of course they may have survived because of old rents and low overheads, or because they own their spaces, but they have also persevered because of great food, consistency, a certain quality of service  and habit.One more such iconic Mumbai institution turns 33 this week. After a long battle with the RWITC, on whose property this iconic Mumbai restaurant sits, Gallops is once again thronged by regulars. I cannot remember when I first ate at Gallops. Its like its always been around. A calm green bit of beatitude in the middle of chaos.A small stroll amid thick grass and aged tree trunks takes you past the white picketed edge of the race course to a glass chamber, ornately appointed. The exteriors overrun by thick Boston Ivy-like creepers. Rolling turf at one end, and surrounded by foliage more than a hundred years old.A heavy door opens up into a cavernous space, much like an old British-style study, with walls of stone and oak and warmly lit chandeliers. The tables all covered in starched white cloth, china and silver, and the ever-kind slightly-old-fashioned waiters.You sit on velvet, stare out 225 acres of pasturage and order High Tea. Scottish Salmon Sandwiches, Parsee Chutney and Cheese Sandwiches or Cucumber and Dill Sandwiches, some Orange Flower Water Madelines, with a pot of Mint Tea. If you feel like going desi, the Chilly Cheese Toast on a wet rainy day is ecstasy. At lunch or dinner my favourite has always been the French Onion Soup, followed by a course of Shrimp Cocktail and Mutton Dori Kebabs (fine mutton mince bound together by thread and barbecued) as starters. The Mutton Nihari is exquisite and the Chicken Maharaja (Butter Chicken) is one of the finest in the city.Thats my order usually. But on September 16, as Gallops completes 33 years, the owners Rahul and Jasmine with their respective sons Yajush and Mikhail will bring back the menu from nostalgia or what theyd call 1986. When Mumbai had great restaurants like Gaylords, Talk of the Town and The Society, which excelled at a combined menu of Continental and Indian favourites including old-time greats such as Chicken a la Kiev or what we used to call The Chicken Bomb (breast of chicken, filled with a knob of butter and crumb-fried), Cottage Pie (minced mutton baked in nutmeg-flavored potato puree), Eggs Mornay (sliced hard boiled eggs topped with mushrooms, Mornay sauce and gratinated), Fish in the Basket (fried fish served with golden fries and tartare sauce) and the Butter Chicken that tastes the same after all these years, Chicken Maharaja. Even Mutton Kofta Curry (dumplings of minced meat spiced and cooked in a light gravy) or Kofta Naram Dil, literally meaning soft-hearted koftas (vegetable dumplings stuffed with dry fruit and gently simmered in a royal gravy), dishes which have long left the pages of menus all over the city.And theres more. Since Gallops is hosting a 1986 menu to celebrate nostalgia with its loyal patrons, on one particular day, theyve priced the menu at 1986 rates as well. So the Chicken a la Kiev, which is the most expensive dish on the menu, costs Rs 55. I am definitely going, not only because I want to eat a full fancy meal under a hundred rupees, but because I was there when Gallops started and I dont want to be there if it ever shuts down.First Published: Sep 13, 2019 21:42 IST"

But we bet that nothing made Prime Minister Narendra Modi happier than the sight of his favourite dishes arranged neatly in shiny copper thali, and served to him lovingly by his mother.He is super busy handling the reins of the nation but, on his birthday, PM Modi always finds the time to meet his mother and seek her blessings. His 69th birthday on Tuesday was no different. After an action-packed day including a visit to Sardar Sarovar dam, the PM  clad in white kurta-pajama and a saffron Nehru jacket  visited his mother Hiraba and had a simple but sumptuous lunch with her at Vrundavan 2 in Raysan village in Gandhinagar, where she resides with his younger brother Pankaj Modi.The PM is known for his austerity. Its well-known that he is strictly vegetarian and loves simple Gujarati food. So, the thaali had sliced cucumber-tomato-carrot salad, kachcha-paka tindora nu salad (stir-fried ivysalad), alu-mattar sabji (potato-peas), fangavela mag (sprouted moong) and mixed kathol (pulses), tuvar daal, rice and Gujarati rotli. It also had puran polis (flat bread stuffed with a sweet lentil filling)  another favourite of the PM.The PM was to meet his mother early on Tuesday before the Sardar Sarovar event but there w a s a change in the schedule and he decided to have lunch with her. The food was cooked by Unnati, daughter-in-law of Pankaj Modi, who along with his wife Sarita were out of State when the PM came visiting. After sharing some light moments with his mother, the PM left 35 minutes later.An old-timer who has worked closely with the PM when he was Gujarat CM said sukhdi was his alltime favourite sweet. Every time, a close friend or relative met Narendrabhai, he would carry the simple Gujarati sweet made with wheat flour, jaggery and ghee. Narendrabhai also loved Gujarati farsan such as bhajiyas, handvo, dhokla, fafda and gathiya and used to have them during state- or national-level meetings with BJP leaders, he said.Though the PM enjoyed the lavish fare at meetings, his daily diet was restricted. His breakfast comprised green tea and rotis made out of bajri. He did not have ghee in his daily diet. He would have rotis made of some grain during lunch with vegetables, lots of leafy vegetables and salads. Wheat was a big no. Dinner comprised of khichdi or porridge, very light food, he added.After PM Modis White House visit in 2014 its a well-known fact that he also observes a fast during. And during this time he consumes only lemonade and a cup of tea during the day.I love Gujarati thali. Since it is difficult to make at home, we go out to have it at least once or twice a month. If I have to chose one thing from the thaali, it will be Gujarati daal. I love it. We have it at home several times as we have a Gujarati cookGUJARAT CHIEF SECRETARYI relish Gujarati food as there is a wide range of texture in the dishes. The Gujarati daal is my favourite as it has a complex yet subtle flavour because of the multi-layer taste. I also like bhakri. We try to make Gujarati daal quite regularly in our kitchen if possible as it is thinner yet full of richness.ABAD POLICE COMMISSIONERGujarati thaali has a lot of variety and offers a wide spread of dishes. I have been on a diet for long, and I also travel a lot. Thought all kinds of Gujarati dishes are prepared in my kitchen, bajri no rotlo,and ringan bhartha find prominence.RIL GROUP PRESIDENT (CORPORATE AFFAIRS)I am a big fan of the Gujarati dinner thaali, especially bajra no rotolo, adad daal and ringna nu shaak. Since I found out that bajri is good for diabetes, I have incorporated bajra no rotlo and daal in my daily meal schedule. Besides being yummy, it is highly nutritious too.MP AND DELHI BJP CHIEFGujarati thaali is a well-balanced meal. Phulka gives carbs, daal gives protein and vegetables give fibre. Ghee on roti or as tadka on daal is good fat. None of the items have heavy cream, hence its light on stomach and low in calories. I love dhokla. I have thepla daily but nothing beats fada ni khichdiNUTRITIONIST AND AUTHORThe Gujarati thaali has a perfect blend of flavours, I just love the assortment. Looking at one gives me a sense of wholesomeness because you can tell that all the food has been prepared with so much love. I love all the dishes, but I would pick the Gujarati daal over everything. In fact, chundoo (a sweet mango pickle) is a regular delicacy in our household.ACTOR"
2019-09-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/sep/18/a-trove-of--information-2035214.html,A trove of  information,"Shevlin Sebastian ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: A few years ago, G Balagopal, who was a former deputy secretary in the Information and Broadcasting Ministry was standing in line at the airport at Jeddah to gain entrance to Saudi Arabia. All the hand-bags were being checked. Behind him stood Parminder Singh (name changed) from the Ministry of External Affairs. Parminder leaned forward and whispered, I have a scotch whisky bottle in my bag. When Balagopal heard that, he felt an alarm within himself. In front of him, a man was having his bag taken apart, and even the chocolate pieces had been broken to see whether there was any alcoholic content. So, Balagopal knew a major fracas was about to take place.Soon, it was his turn. The security officer opened the zip and took out the contents: There were a shaving kit and a few underwears, apart from shirts and trousers. The officer was not glad to see the undergarments. He twitched his nose and asked Balagopal to pack and close the bag and sent him ahead. When he looked at Parminder, he was probably expecting the same. Instead of checking his bag, Parminder was waved on. It was one of the closest shaves in my life, says Balagopal. I heaved a huge sigh of relief. This anecdote has been recounted in management consultant P Jayaramans Random Explorations, which has been published by Prism Books. It is an eclectic mix. There are long profiles (7,000 words and more) on Dr M V Pylee, the father of management education in Kerala, G Balagopal, former civil servant and C Balagopal, the noted entrepreneur. Then there is a study on power and inequality.Here are some fast facts from the chapter:Indias richest one per cent owned 58 per cent of the countrys wealth.The top 10 per cent earned 80.7 per cent of the total income in the country.India accounts for almost half the worlds poor but the total individual wealth is $5600 billion. Not surprisingly. India is the second-most unequal country in the world. In another chapter titled, Some recent trends in management, Jayarams tips for career success in todays turbulent world are insightful: The word loyalty has been replaced by business contract. You remain in a job as long as you are the best person to execute a role. It has, therefore, become essential for you to learn continuously for your sheer survival. Tenure has been replaced by relevance. Every job is for a limited period. Once a CEO, always a CEO is no longer valid. One should focus on short-term plans in todays rapidly-changing environment. Long-term planning has become impossible and of little value.In another section, he talks about speed. In this age of disruption, only fast learners can survive and flourish, says Jayaraman. Traditionally, people used to treat information as power and hoard it as a method of control. But todays organisations can ill afford to be hoarders. They have to absorb new information every hour, every day. Companies should instil curiosity and experimentation to succeed.The next section is about travel. Thanks to his son, Anand, who is based in Geneva and a daughter, Deepthi, who is living in Nottingham, Jayaraman has travelled to several countries, including Greece, Poland, Croatia, China, Czechoslovakia, Norway and Australia. For each, he has written a history, some of the best places to visit, the archaeological sites, weather, literature, economics, demography, the characteristics of the people, food and beverages.Regarding food in Norway, the most common dish is polse (hot dog) with pancake, which is topped with raw onions and various dressings. In Czechoslovakia, the staple food is pork, beef, birds like duck and pheasant, and carp. In Poland, Jayaraman enjoyed the Placki Ziemniaczane, a pancake filled with potato and topped with a meaty sauce.The last section is about the books he has read. These include Half Lion: How P V Narasimha Rao transformed India by Vinay Sitapati, India Rising: Fresh Hopes, New Fears by Ravi Velloor, and An Era Of Darkness: The British Empire in India by Shashi Tharoor. In Tharoors book, Jayaraman quotes F J Shore, a British civil servant in Bengal who testified in the House of Commons that the fundamental principle of the English has been to make the whole Indian nation subservient in every possible way.In 1600, when the British East India Company was set up, Britain accounted for just 1.8 per cent of the world GDP, while India was contributing 23 per cent. In 1940, Britain accounted for nearly 10 per cent of the world GDP while India was reduced to 3 per cent. All in all, Jayaramans sixth book is a remarkable work, well-researched and sincere. Theres enough food for thought to last a long time.FOOD FOR THOUGHTThe book is an eclectic mix comprising extensive profiles on Keralas prominent personalities including Dr M V Pylee, the father of management education in the state, G Balagopal, former civil servant and C Balagopal, the noted entrepreneur. It also gives a rundown power inequality in the country and provies tips for career success in todays turbulent world"
2019-09-19,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/sep/19/wash-what-goes-in-your-mouth-2035703.html,‘Wash’ what goes in your mouth,"By Express News ServiceCHENNAI: Washing your veggies before cooking can be a tiring task, but that doesnt mean you should skimp out on the process. Popular chef Uma Raghunathan, who runs the handle @masterchefmom, shares her tips on how to ensure your produce is clean and fresh before you begin your culinary process. Uma follows a two-wash process  first, she washes the produce under running water, and then drops the cut products into a small-holed colander for another cleaning. This ensures maximum removal of outside bacteria. Adding natural cleaners like vinegar, lemon, salt or baking soda to a bowl of water before washing will ensure that the produce is properly cleaned. For vegetables like lettuce and cabbage, she peels apart the first layer of leaves and discards them. She then washes the vegetable leaf-by-leaf. Trickier vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower require more attention. She cuts them up into florets, which she boils in a water and vinegar solution for five minutes. Root vegetables like potatoes, carrots and yams require repeated cleaning with the force of your fingers to remove additional dirt. Certain fruits like apples, strawberries and grapes, have a thin layer of wax on them. She recommends soaking these in a 8:1 ratio of water and vinegar to remove this coating. Mushrooms must be thoroughly cleaned with running water, as they are the dirtiest of produce. Using the vinegar solution is also helpful here. Certain vegetables such as ladies finger cannot be washed after cutting. Therefore, ensure it is properly cleaned beforehand. For those houses with low amounts of water, Uma says produce can be washed by collecting water in two bowls, and adding vinegar to one.The produce can soak in the vinegar mixture for five minutes, and then rinsed off in the other. Green vegetables are sprinkled with some water at the grocery store. Ensure that these are patted dry and stored with some tissue or covered in newspaper to ensure they last longer."

ISKCON, however, has denied the allegation.The DEO, Arun Kumar, also claimed that the food is prepared in unhygienic conditions and served in a stale condition to students long after it is cooked.The matter has been raised by DEO Kumar in a letter written to the director, elementary education, Haryana.Talking to Hindustan Times, Kumar said the quality control committee constituted by him repeatedly directed the authorities of ISKCON Kurukshetra to improve the quality of food being served to students, but they did not take the required steps to do so.The DEO said he, along with other officials, visited a primary school in Bhiwanikhera village of the district on September 16 and found that stale food was being supplied by ISKCON.The next day we visited the ISKCON kitchen and store and found that moth-eaten, stale potatoes were stored there indicating that rotten veggies are used to cook food meant for students, he said while adding that he had also taken up the issue with higher officials.In his letter, Kumar sought stern instructions from the director , elementary education, to ISKCON to ensure good quality food for students of all schools.ISKCON VersionMeanwhile, Narayan Prabhu, in-charge of ISKCON Kurukshetra, refuted the allegation and claimed that they serve hot and fresh meals prepared with the highest standards of hygiene and quality ingredients while meeting nutritional requirements.We dont have any motive of earning behind this initiative. We purchase best quality products and vegetables to prepare food for the school kids. Our 150 employees working in the kitchen eat the same food every day, he said.Asked why they have only one kitchen to prepare food for thousands of students, he said, This is our old kitchen and we start preparing food at 3am to ensure that it reaches all students before recess. We get the food examined by teachers every day and get their signatures in our meal book, he added.ISKCON provides mid-day meal to about 42,000 students of 542 schools in three blocks of the district and the government pays the society Rs 4 per day per child. The government also provides it free wheat and rice as per their requirement.Officials in the education department said the cost of food being prepared in the schools is the same but the quality of the food served by ISKCON is poor.However, ISKCON functionaries maintained that they supply meals to about 3.5 lakh students of 2,500 government schools from four state-of-the-art kitchens in Kurukshetra, Gurugram, Palwal and Faridabad districts in Haryana and they never faced any such allegations.First Published: Sep 20, 2019 08:04 IST"

With price of onions rising sharply over the last few days, home budgets are sure to take a hit. Making matters worse, the price is only going to rise for the next two months till fresh yield is available in the market, say traders and farmers.On Friday, onion was selling at Rs 50-60 per kg in the retail market in Bengaluru and at Rs 40 in the wholesale market. According to Hopcoms, the price of onion per kg was Rs 60. On Thursday, the price was Rs 52 per kg and on Wednesday, it was Rs 47. Hopcoms officials say that prices are rising by about Rs 4 per kg every day.The situation seems to be the same in other parts of the state too. In Mysuru, onion was selling at Rs 50-56 per kg on Friday as against Rs 47 last week. Kalaburagi saw a sharp rise from Rs 40 per kg on Wednesday to Rs 60 on Friday. While onion was selling at anywhere between Rs 40 and Rs 50 in Mangaluru, it was Rs 45-48 in Shivamogga. Ramu, a wholesale merchant in Shivamogga said the price will touch Rs 50 by Saturday. The red onion variety is arriving in Belagavi from Nashik in Maharashtra.The import not enough to meet the requirement due to which the price has shot to Rs 3,500 per quintal at APMC in Belagavi. In the retail market, onion is sold at Rs 40-45 per kg. Kalleshi Chandgadkar, a wholesale onion merchant, said, The high price of onion at this time is common every year since stocks of the previous season drying up. Fresh yield will start arriving in a couple of weeks from Karnataka and the price is expected come down.Hoteliers, homemakers feel the pinch of rising priceThe rising prices have already started impacting restaurants and small eateries which have resorted to reducing the quantity of onions used in food items and salads. Homemakers are also using less of onions so that the home budget is not disturbed in the middle of the month. Veerendra Kamat, treasurer, Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association, said the rise in price will definitely have an impact on the quality of food as onion, potato and tomato are three major ingredients. It will also have an impact on customers. He added that restaurant and hotels can stock onions for a maximum of 15 days.Sumitra M, a homemaker, said: Increasing prices are a worry as Dasara festival is just round the corner. Our monthly budgets will be affected. The government should look into the issue of price rise.BN Prasad, Managing Director of Hopcoms, said onion price had touched the highest of Rs 60 per kg in the last one-and-half years. Stocks available in Karnataka presently is 6-8 months old from Maharashtra. Since quality is good, the prices are also high. The fresh stocks which came from Chitradurga andGadar are not that good, he said. Good quality onion is judged by its deep pink colour, pungent smell and bulb size.Uday Shankar, an onion trader, told TNIE that heavy rain over the last few months has damaged the crops in most parts of Karnataka including Chitradurga, Gadag, Hubballi-Dharwad, Challakere and even Maharashtra. This has led to a shortfall in supply. Around 50% of the onion consumed in Karnataka, especially Bengaluru, come from Maharashtra.Shankar added that so far, there was no effect on import and export. We will have to import onions when prices touch Rs 100 per kg, but it may not rise so much. Spot sales to traders from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh has also come down, he said. Usually, around this time, the market yards see the arrival of around one lakh bags per day, but that has now dropped to 50,000 bags. Each bag holds about 50-55 kg of onions, depending on the size.GOING NORTHD 50-60/kgOnionD 15 (native) D 20 (hybrid)/kgTomato D 26 -28 /kgPotato"

But an economical Gujarati thali is hard to find with only a handful of places offering homely food from that state. Tucked inside a quiet bylane of Jaihind Enclave in Madhapur, Savlas Home Food is one of the places serving home-style Gujarati thalis to the food lovers of the area.Two decades ago Rajiv Savla had migrated to Hyderabad from Kutch and set up a garment business in Ameerpet. His wifes passion for cooking led him to the catering business, which resulted in setting up this small outlet in Madhapur. The place can accommodate about 30 people, as the lunchtime approaches. The main attractions here are the Gujarati vegetarian thalis, where one can choose between phulkas, theplas, or parathas along with Gujarati dal, couple of curries, papad, farsan, and buttermilk. The phulkas laden with pure ghee and the three different chutneys from the chutney platter add to the taste of the food. While the simple thali is available for `100, you can add special side dishes to it from the items mentioned on the display board at an additional charge.The mixed vegetable delicacy undhiyu is mostly preferred for this, while shrikhand or dudhi halwa is popular with dessert lovers. You can decide to skip the meal altogether and gorge on sabudana khichdi, dry kachori or Kaman dhokla from the a-la-carte list. The place is open only for lunch and dinner for weekdays. On Sunday, a special thali is served in the afternoon which includes some snack items and sweets too. The popularity of this thali draws in a lot of crowd.Rajiv says that their clientele has grown due to favourable word-of-mouth. The food delivery providers have also enhanced the business accounting more than half of it currently. Savlas have an option for Jain food too, where ginger, garlic, and potato are not used in the meal. During Navratri, Janmashtami and Maha Shivratri they also serve food which is preferred by persons fasting such as sabudana khichdi, and puris made from Rajgira flour. While quite a large number of his customers are Gujaratis, the place is a hit with North Indians and even a few local vegetarians. Recently, they have also started paying guest accommodation close to the restaurant accommodating about forty people mainly from Gujarat.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"
2019-09-21,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/in-search-of-an-odisha-favourite/article29476300.ece,In search of an Odisha favourite,"The festive season is upon us, and there is talk of laddoo and modak. But when I hear about Indian sweets, my mind wanders off to the east. One of my all-time favourites is the Chhena Poda of Odisha. I got to know of this truly sublime sweet  made of cheese curds (the chhena)  relatively late in life, and now I cant have enough of it. There was a time when it came to me all the way from Odisha in a special parcel. But now the sweet can be found in many parts of the city  including in Chittaranjan Park, where some Bengali sweet shops sell it.As friends talked about laddoos, I thought of looking for Chhena Poda. I had heard about an Odisha restaurant somewhere near the Thyagaraj Sports Complex, and I pass the stadium often. Last week, on my way from South Delhi to East Delhi, I decided to look for the eatery. I stopped to ask for directions, only to be asked to look out for a Jagannath Temple.Opposite the stadium, there is a lane going towards the Lodhi Colony Railway Station. There is construction work happening there, so you will see a fence of blue prefab walls. I parked outside the fence, and walked in (though, I later realised, one can drive in, too). I turned right and continued to walk quite a bit. Finally, to my left, I saw the Jagannath Temple. I entered the premises and found a small canteen right there. It offered only sweets and snacks; for Odiya meals, I was told, I had to go to Dilli Haat.Dahi Vada Alu DumIn a display counter they had rasgullas (20 for a large one) and samosas, or singaras, as they are called in east India (10 per piece). They had Chhena Goja (20) and, I was happy to see, Chhena Poda (50 for 100 g). Also on the menu are Alur (potato) Chop (10), Dahi Vada Alu Dum (40 for two; 25 for one) and Vada Ghugni (30).I asked for Chhena Poda, Singara and Dahi Vada Alu Dum. Id heard paeans sung to the Dahi Vada Alu Dum  an Odisha special, which is special indeed. The dish consists of vadas dunked in curd. To this, some pieces of curried, asafoetida (hing)-flavoured potatoes are added. This is topped with fried sev. Overall, the dish is different  delicious.I like the singara, too, which is vastly different from its northern counterpart. The potatoes are small, diced and fried, sometimes with bits of the skin, and tempered with peanuts. The flour casing is also thicker.I rounded off my meal with the Chhena Poda, or roasted chhena. For this, chhena is kneaded with sooji (semolina flour) and sugar. This crumbly mixture is then baked. Originally, it was wrapped in sal leaves, and then roasted over a low fire for hours.The sweet is sublime for several reasons. It is only mildly sweet, so you dont get the sticky, syrupy feeling that other sweets sometimes leave you with. Then, since it is roasted, it is wonderfully light. I love its crumbly texture, and the dark bits, which add colour and a sharpness to the dessert.The festive season has begun. Ring in the Chenna Poda!The writer is a seasoned food critic"
2019-09-21,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/sep/22/opening-the-gateaus-2036101.html,Opening the Gateaus,"Nivi Shrivastava ByExpress News ServiceThe street food culture in Mauritius is reflective of its history and the cultural mosaic of a diverse people who form the country today. The earliest known history of what we now know as Mauritius starts from 900 AD when it was spotted by Arab sailors travelling for trade. In the 15th century, the Portuguese colonised the island, followed by the Dutch, French and the British. In the 1800s, post the abolition of slavery, indentured labourers from India were sent to Mauritius to work in the sugarcane plantations.The migrant labourers from India, Malaysia, China and Africa, many of whom stayed back in the country, have added to the diverse local food scene. You might be staying at a luxury resort and partaking gourmet cuisines, but Mauritius is incomplete without its streets, beaches and markets and the varied delicacies these places have to offer. Heres a list of 10 Mauritian street foods that you must try.Dholl PooriThis is the most iconic and must-eat food in Mauritius. While it is called poori, it is not a deep-fried flatbread like its Indian counterpart. Ground and crumbled dal is stuffed in a refined flour paratha, served with a slather of chutneys, bean curries, rougailles and pickles. It is sold all around the island, either out of glass boxes mounted on scooters or in market stalls and with a fairly consistent taste. A pair of dholl pooris topped with all the accompaniments and rolled up in paper is a perfect snack to munch on and explore the street food scene in Mauritius.Gateau PimentChilli cakes in Mauritian Creole, this is a spin-off on the South Indian dal vada made using chana dal, with a blend of spices and chillies. They are also known as gateau dholl. Mauritians are not afraid to use a proper punch from chillies in their dishes and gateau piment is just one example of that. These are served stuffed inside a buttered warm baguette or a pain maison.BadiaSimilar to the Indian pakoda/bhajia, badias are made from chickpea flour with the addition of finely chopped vegetables and spices and served with chutneys on the side. Eggplant is a popular choice for these vegetable fritters (bringele frire). These, along with gateau piment, are some of the most loved snacks that the locals call gadjak, which are served with drinks.PineappleDo not miss feasting on the Victoria pineapple in Mauritius. Smaller in size with an intensely sweet juicy flesh, the street vendors cut it in the form of a large lollipop with a dusting of salt and chilli powder so you can eat it on the go without getting your hands messy.Gateau (gato) MerveilleNot unlike our chaats, gateau merveille is sold in stalls in and around Port Louis and Mahebourg waterfront. Deep-fried, crisp flour pooris topped with green chutney and tamarind chutney are a popular local snack.Gateau PatatesSweet potato cakes in Mauritian Creole, these can be bought from vendors at the entrance of Port Louis Market. Mashed sweet potato is mixed with flour to make a dough, which is filled with desiccated coconut, raisins and sugar. These are deep fried until golden brown. Sweet potato cakes are a special during Diwali, which is celebrated in a big way in Mauritius.Du Pain FrireThis translates to fried bread. Stale bread is dipped in a gram flour and refined flour batter and deep fried until crisp and golden brown. A good way to turn stale bread into an inviting snack or appetiser, these are sold by many street vendors around the island.Chinese street foodsMauritian street food also has a strong Chinese (Hakka) influence. Mine fret (fried noodles), bol renverse and boulettes are some of the well-loved Chinese dishes served on the streets of the island. Boulettes are dumplings filled with chicken, vegetables or seafood. Bol renverse is a convenient single portion of a chicken and veggie stir-fry served with rice and a fried egg on top. The dishes are best found in Port Louis, China Town or at vendors on beaches such as Mont Choisy and Flic en Flac.NapolitansWhile technically not a street food, this cross between a cake and a cookie is a local favourite. Two shortbread cookies are sandwiched with jam and covered with a pink icing. Some eateries stock it up in their glass display boxes.Gateau MoutailleNot many countries, other than India, serves up jalebis in their cuisine, but Mauritius does, under this fancy sounding name. These syrupy sweet and crispy treats find an important place in the street food fare, and what better way to end a street food tasting."

Only potato prices have remained stable since the last month. Now potato prices will see a hike during Navratras. Today, onion prices are three times the price a month ago. Green vegetable prices have doubled in the last month.

And sandesh isnt the same unless it is from Balaram Mullick. The argument over who invented rosogolla can be solved over a couple of the sugar-soaked chhena dumplings  we can conclude that it simply doesnt matter. With Durga Puja around the corner, Bengalis around the country dont have to travel all the way to Kolkata to sample these signature dishes. JustMyRoots (JMR), a food-tech platform, offers to bridge the gap by shipping speciality dishes from iconic restaurants to 21 cities across the country.CEO and founder Samiran Sengupta says the idea is to tap into the nostalgia that Indias largely migrant population have for the food of their hometown. Apart from the sweets, savouries and cooked dishes, their offerings include fresh fish like hilsa and produce like gondhoraj lebu. The platform has also partnered with restaurants in Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai and Lucknow, with plans to expand to Chennai, Hyderabad and Kochi, among other cities, by the end of the year.Taste of homeThe concept is simple: visit the website or app and order like you would on a food-delivery platform like Swiggy or Zomato. The only difference is that you have to wait a few days before it reaches you. However, Sengupta reiterates that the food reaches their customer within 24 hours of being prepared. Another option that JMR offers is Direct From Home. This is a big hit with parents whose children stay in different cities. They can ship a home-cooked meal to their child for special occasions, or simply because they are missing home, he explains. The food is picked up and packed much like it is from their restaurant partners, and delivered within the same time period.Their other USP is the packaging, he says. Although other sites like PlaceOfOrigin.in ship sweets, snacks, dry fruits, namkeen, pickles, jams, tea and coffee, the fact that JMR deals with freshly-cooked dishes, put the focus on the supply chain. We spent nine months to a year just perfecting the packaging based on both customer and partner restaurant feedback. We finally settled on a product from Israel, which maintains the temperature of the food between five and eight degree Celsius, which is ideal for transportation, he says. Customers will have to heat the food before consuming, as it will be maintained at this optimal temperature while it is being shipped. Future plans include expanding to China and other South East Asian countries by the end of this year, or early 2020, to cater to the Indian Diaspora population. It is also close enough to fulfill their 24 hour promise.Details: justmyroots.com"

Read MoreNEW DELHI: Vendors at west Delhis Tagore Garden fruit and vegetable market had a new sales pitch on Monday: not only did they have to vie with each other to attract customers, but also had to convince them to buy cloth bags or bring carry bags of their own the next time.The market on Sant Shiromani Maharshi Balinath Marg became the first one to be declared plastic-free by South Delhi Municipal Corporation . Twenty more markets would follow suit, an official said. Early in the morning, there werent many customers, but the vendors did have their hands full, with many people arguing over having to pay for the bags.Many sellers could be seen pointing towards banners and pamphlets detailing the harmful effects of non-biodegradable plastic. Nanku Prasad, a potato vendor, said he was happy to lose a few customers if it helped serve a cause. When officials are putting in so much effort, why cant we support them? They have been visiting the market for 15 days, trying to convince everyone to be part of the initiative. The future generations will pay if we dont act now, he said. Polybags at the market have given way to cloth bags, costing Rs 20 and with a capacity to carry 8-10kg of vegetables.Sunil Kumar, another vegetable seller, said that since it was the first day of the plastic ban, they were patient with the customers. To the needy, we even offered cloth bags (given to us by SDMC ) for free. For small transactions, paper bags are being used, he said.Amrit Singh, a customer, praised the initiative, but said that other shops in the neighbourhood must follow the norms for it to be a success.An SDMC official said that this was just a start and more markets swould be covered. People need to support us to make this drive a long-term success. Why we started with a fruit market was because its here that a huge amount of plastic bags is used and then dumped on the roadside, Rajiv Jain, superintending engineer, SDMC, said. Corporation spokesperson Radha Kishan said 20 more such markets in south Delhi will be made plastic-free by October 2. We have identified most of these markets and officials have started informing the trader associations about it , he said.SDMC standing committee chairman Bhupender Gupta said they were making arrangements for smooth implementation of the project by tying up with NGOs that could provide cloth bags at cheaper rates or no cost in the initial days. The idea is to make things easier for shopkeepers after convincing them to be part of the drive, he said."

It is a riddle Sanjoy Das had been wanting to solve throughout his multiple years of experience with hotels. The answer, he hopes, lies in Mixed Caf, a place that serves ready-to-go healthy food, which helps you keep track of your calories and macro count. The brainchild of Sanjoy, his wife Moumita Roy, and brother-sister duo Praveen and Dr Sunitha Raja, the cafe was launched on the first floor of Express Avenue this past week.Few places invite self-indulgence as a mall does. And nestled among mannequins and candy shops, here is an outlet with sleek black exteriors, asking you to try out their healthy food options. A batch of salad ingredients in cool bain-maries line one side of the counter, and on the other, a display of shot glasses in which you can taste a variety of soups. No refined flour, no refined sugar! exclaim the boards outside.There are other restaurants that offer healthy or vegan food, but we wanted to bring that concept into the quick service restaurant business. When you are shopping in a mall, and want to grab a quick bite, it need not be a pizza or a burger, you can still eat healthy food thats in your budget, says Sanjoy. He and his wife approached Praveen and Sunitha a year ago, knowing they would have the same ethos  the duo run shredify.me, a website and social media account that helps people understand nutrition and fitness. Sunitha is also a State powerlifting gold medalist.Everything that we have on the menu is nutritionally balanced, says Praveen, who helped design the menu with the chef. The outlet sells salads with protein, which can be customised according to your preferences  make your own, or have the chef recommend what goes well, sandwiches that use only whole wheat bread, and desserts such as tofu peanut butter slices, almond and orange slices and oatmeal raisin cookies.We use palm jaggery instead of sugar, even with beverages, he says, pointing to the table next to us, where a young man is mixing jaggery in his cup of coffee. The restaurant does not discriminate between food preferences: options range from shrimp soups to coffee with almond or soy milk for vegans.Dinner time has not started yet, but the outlet has almost run out of soup  business is picking up. Sanjoy offers us a taste of each variety; they taste distinctly homely (the drumstick and lentil soup is plain sambar, no doubt). We use potatoes or sweet potatoes as thickeners, instead of cornstarch, says Sanjoy.It is essential that the food gets sold out by the end of the day because the caf has a fresh food policy. The first two days that we started, there was so much wastage, he recalls with a shudder, But now we can gauge how much food to make. In keeping with the whats healthy for the planet is healthy for you philosophy, the cutlery and packaging are biodegradable. We also try to use as many local ingredients as possible, like swapping quinoa for millets, adds Praveen. The team is now working on printing fresh menus with the calorie count and macro content for each dish listed."
2019-09-25,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/onion-prices-expected-to-fall-over-next-few-days-in-gurugram/story-Tth36lVObUVieAOURr60wI.html,Onion prices expected to fall over next few days in Gurugram,"gurugramUpdated: Sep 26, 2019 00:03 ISTGurugram Officials of the district agricultural marketing board expect the soaring onion prices to decrease in the next few days, as they are keeping a check of traders to prevent hoarding of the stock that comes in from Nasik and Indore.Haryana goes to polls on October 21 and the state government has directed the departments concerned to control the hike in the price of onions, a staple in most households, to prevent it from becoming an election issue, said officials familiar with the matter.In the last 10 days, onion prices in the retail market have soared up to 60-70 per kilogram from 35-40/kg. Even the wholesale price in the Gurugram market has gone up to 45/kg from 25/kg. We are keeping a watch on the market to neutralise the price, which has spiked in the last 10 days, said Virendra Yadav, secretary, district agriculture marketing board.Heavy rains in onion-producing states, such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and other southern states have damaged crops, due to which cities, such as Delhi, Kolkata and Patna, have witnessed a price surge over the last few days.Affirming that the supply is being augmented, Yadav said, Traders and farmers in other states stock onions, waiting for the apt time to sell their produce at the optimum price. Onion comes under non-perishable items, but farmers and traders are now looking to clear their stocks. Therefore, going by the data (see the box), the offloading of onions has increased to 1,500 -2,000 quintals from 700-800 quintals.Yadav said, Before the price increase, 1,000-1,500 quintals of onion from Nashik and Indore were offloaded in the mandi daily. Due to floods and heavy rainfall in the onion-producing states, the overall yield has come down. Traders are currently selling the old stock. By mid-October, the new stock will also arrive in the market and the price will decrease further, said Yadav.According to him, there are 50 onion traders in the city dealing with traders in Nashik and Indore. Yadav and his team monitor free and fair trade, and keep the prices in check, as the product changes hands from middlemen, wholesalers, traders and commission agents to retailers.The marketing board functions under the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961, and Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets (General) Rules, 1962. Its task is to regulate the purchase, sale, storage and processing of agricultural produce, including fruits and vegetables.The price mechanism of fruits and vegetables cannot be regulated like crops, but the market fluctuation of non-perishable items, such as onions and potatoes, has to be prevented by not allowing unnecessary stockpiling by traders, he said, adding there is no cartel system in Gurugram, as mandis are not huge.Narendra, an onion trader at the Badshahpur mandi, said, Stock holding is being done by traders in big mandis, which affects the overall price. The government is currently keeping a strict vigil, due to which there is no chance of onion prices soaring further.Ravi, a wholesaler, said that the prices cannot be controlled in Gurugram. Considering heavy rainfall and floods in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, farmers have little produce to sell in the market.Haryana is among the five states that have demanded onion from the Centres stock. The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) manages the onion reserves at the Central level. NAFED might be releasing its stock, but Gurugram has not received any, so far, said Yadav.First Published: Sep 25, 2019 22:21 IST"

Then, he talks about whether North Koreans raise pet dogs, what type of profanity they use and whether there are any transgender people in the country.The 32-year-old Jang is among a handful of young North Korean refugees in South Korea who have launched YouTube channels that offer a rare glimpse into the everyday lives of people in North Korea, one of the worlds most secretive and repressive countries.While mainstream outside media reports on North Korea focus on heavy subjects like the Norths nuclear program or its internal power hierarchy, these young YouTubers feed a growing demand for softer news related to daily life in their former home country.Their rise comes amid increased public attention to North Korea, whose young leader, Kim Jong Un, has made global headlines with a provocative run of weapons tests and high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump.Everyday storiesThere are people who yearn for real scenes showing how people in North Korea live. There is a niche market for that, said Jeon Young-sun, a research professor at Seouls Konkuk University. Simply speaking, some people are curious about what beer North Koreans drink and what cookies they eat.Jang uses his Samsung smartphone to film himself at his small Seoul apartment, and sometimes invites fellow North Korean refugees as guests and has friends shoot him when he ventures out. He often appears with his trademark dark fedora, but sometimes with a colourful wig, a false mustache or even a Kim Jong Un mask.Video clips uploaded on Jangs 2-year-old channel showed him saying that ordinary North Koreans usually raise dogs, rabbits, pigs and chickens, but to either eat or sell to markets. He said that calling someone a baby born by a young female slave is considered a profanity in North Korea, and that people there say Do you want to have the order of your ribs revolutionarily reorganised? when trying to intimidate others.Jang, who has about 7,000 subscribers to his channel, said he does manual labour and delivers fried chicken as a means of living because his YouTube-related income is too small. But he feels its worth it to keep his YouTube career going because some subscribers have left messages saying his broadcasts helped resolve their misunderstandings of North Korea.They cheer me up and make me be positive. They are the reasons why I shoot YouTube videos today and tomorrow, Jang said, petting his Maltese.Other North Korea-born YouTubers talk about why they left their homeland and the experiences theyve had in South Korea. Some also broadcast themselves putting on North Korean-style makeup or eating foods from the country.Fighting stereotypesThe young YouTubers are mostly stylish, contrary to the stereotype of North Korean refugees as being rough and unsophisticated. About 32,000 North Koreans have fled to the South over the past two decades to avoid poverty and political repression.Kang Na-ra, a North Korean escapee who regularly appears on two YouTube channels and two TV programs, is called Princess Na-ra by her fans. The 22-year-old with long, brown-dyed hair said she has a 200-member fan club that has sent her a cake topped with a mini-Kang doll on her birthday for the past three years.When Kang, dressed in a North Korean military uniform, showed how to put on North Korean-style makeup on her YouTube channel, her subscribers wrote, You are so pretty even without makeup and Youre such a beauty.I like communicating with people by posting responses to the messages that they put on my channel, said Kang, wearing two rings on each of her hands. I want to let the people know about North Korean culture and show more about how I am living in South Korea.Fair share of hatersThe YouTubers, however, also have anti-fans who often vent their anger at them when North Korea does something provocative like conduct a weapons test.Kang said she feels a little sad when she reads malicious messages from people such as Go back to your country and Why does a Red live here?Jang said some messages have been left for him wishing for him to be assassinated with a poisoned needle or banished to a North Korean coal mine.In this photo, North Korean refugee Jang Myung-jin edits his YouTube footage during an interview at his house in Seoul, South Korea. | Photo Credit: APWhile there have been some TV programs in the South featuring North Korean refugees, some experts say they dont fully carry the escapees voices because they were directed, filmed and edited by South Koreans.On YouTube, defectors can speak whatever they want without being filtered and edited. ... Given that, I would say their programs provide content that the TV shows cant provide, said Lee Kwang Baek, the South Korean head of a YouTube channel on North Korea.Their YouTube programs are also believed to help address the widespread misinformation about North Korea in the South. Jang said a middle school student once asked him if North Koreans eat dirt when theyre hungry, while another escapee-turned-YouTuber, Lee Pyung, said he was asked whether North Koreans give potatoes instead of money to a driver when they take a bus.Not all fun storiesThe YouTubers most popular content is stories of their dangerous escapes to South Korea.Kangs escape story, posted on someone elses YouTube channel last year, has received about 1.7 million views. She said she thought she was going to die when she was carried away by water while crossing the Tumen River to go to China before coming to South Korea in December 2014.Kang said she ran away from her home in North Korea after fighting with her stepmother. Then her biological mother, who had already resettled in South Korea, hired brokers who helped her come to the South about two weeks later.Besides her longing for her mother, Kang said her wishes to wear jeans, dye her hair and date handsome South Korean men also pushed her to make a perilous journey to the South.Jang hasnt posted his escape story yet because he said he wants to fill his channel with more amusing content.Jang said he had a big crush on the 11-year-old girl with fair skin and big eyes, who lived with her grandmother. He recalled how the two would hold hands when he walked her to her house.After the girl didnt come to school for two to three weeks, their teacher asked Jang to go and check on her. When he arrived at her home, he found the girl, then all skin and bones, lying dead with her eyes and mouth open, while her grandmother had disappeared.Terrified, Jang immediately bolted out of the house and reported the girls death to neighbors before crying all day.A few months later, he fled North Korea with his parents and younger brother.Before his family walked across the frozen Tumen River, his father told him to turn back and look at the country they wouldnt likely return to.While looking at my hometown for about five minutes, I thought about that girl, Jang said.I thought that her only fault was being born in the wrong country, he continued. If she had come to South Korea, she wouldnt have starved to death ... and could have become a YouTuber like me."

As the only restaurant exclusively serving Italian-American cuisine, once you are inside the cosy and comfortable eatery, you just cant wait to taste the food.The hands-on owner-cum-chef of the 48-seater bistro, Philip Abraham, has tweaked his menu with some freak-out dishes to celebrate his seven-year success story. And it is delicious news for his loyal customers and a delectable surprise for his new ones.Tables are fast getting booked, he smiles bringing me the carrot and cumin soup  a puree of roasted carrot flavoured with cumin and finished with cream. With rains and nip in the air, the steaming bowl of creamy soup warms me up instantly.With food plating and presentation increasingly becoming central to keep guests happy, Philip too showcases his creations to demonstrate to his guests that they are getting their moneys worth. The sweetest of watermelon chunks placed with long thin slices of cucumber rolled up and tossed in citrus (orange) glazed dressing drizzle with cute little homemade cottage cheese balls is a fine visual and edible masterpiece of a salad.What arrives next is a surprise! Who puts fried aubergine and even deeper fried palm-sized basil leaves on your pizza? Philip does to deepen your allegiance with the Ratatouille pizza and further tops it with zucchini and bell peppers. The perfectly crusted pie layered with melted mozarella disappears in the mouth as does the delicate crispy fried folded pizza with minced meat and cheese called the chicken calzone.The tomato risotto with vegetables is perfectly prepared Italian rice cooked in broth to a creamy consistency with tomato and a liberal dose of diced seasonal vegetables. With a feeble promise to myself that I will start exercising from day next, I say yes to the chicken and cream cheese ravioli (pasta stuffed with chicken, cream cheese and tossed in cream and basil sauce) that looks appetising in a lovely shade of green. And oh, the other new dish  fish francaise, fillet fish coated with egg and pan-fried and served with lemon butter sauce, grilled vegetables and mash potatoes. The flavours in all the items are well balanced for the perfect bite. And each deserves some time on the plate to relish it to satisfaction.Ever since he set shop in K K Nagar in 2012, Philip has rarely let you down. He says he does not believe in fusion but likes to experiment with everything that is fresh. His desserts are usually the best to wrap-up the culinary journey. He recommends the eggless banoffee pie (tart filled with toffee, glazed banana and topped with cream) and berry cheese cake which is cookie-based topped with a mixture of cream cheese, strawberry and blue berry. I regret neither.As part of the celebrations, there is a 15 per cent discount on your food bill till September 28."

A large meal will slow you down physically and mentally as the process of breaking down and digestion of a large meal takes time.- Some food items should be avoided before or during exams as they are brain blocking foods. Cookies, cakes, and muffins require added time and energy to digest, food high in refined sugar, such as chocolates, desserts, and sweets, carbohydrates such as rice or potatoes can make you feel heavy and sleepy.- Drink enough water before and during your exam. Dehydration can make you lose your concentration and lowers your energy.- Eat brain-boosting food. Protein-rich foods that help in mental alertness are eggs, nuts, yogurt, cottage cheese. For breakfast, take almonds, walnuts, raisins, orange, banana whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk, toast with jam, porridge, oatmeal, or sugar-free muesli.- Avoid consuming outside food until the end of your exams, junk and oily food slows down your body.- Plan a diet rich in omega-3 fats which are heart-protective and play an important role in memory, concentration, and calm depression. Sources of omega-3 fats in the diet are oily fish like salmon, tuna, seeds like flax, chia, melon seeds and sunflower.Bonus tip: Many students have the habit of studying late at night, wishing to pack more information into their already drained brains, stop studying the night before your exam.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Umeshwari Machani of Green Light Foods is talking about the vaccum-fried vegetable chips that she trialled at the recent Gourmet Bazaar. Since it was successful, she is hoping to launch it in the next three months as part of Monsoon Harvests product list.When the brand was launched in 2015, Umeshwari and her husband Srivardhan Sethuraman introduced millet-based muesli, which won the Great Taste Awards earlier in the year, and animal-shaped cookies. Now the range is expanding. Breakfast cereals for kids and buttermilk-millet crackers are already out. The first has a mix of oat clusters and ragi flakes with freeze-dried fruit. Its not puree or essence but chunks of actual fruit. The crackers showcase the smaller millets like samai, varagu and kudhiraivali. We use buttermilk to soften it as butter would have made it very heavy.They are looking to add granola (grain-free and vegan), nut bars and trail mix apart from the vegetable chips. It takes about 18 months from concept to launch, explains Umeshwari. We have to go through different stages: experimentation, sourcing (which can be a problem sometimes), ensuring consistent supply and finally appropriate packaging. For the vegetable chips, they have settled on ladys finger, beetroot and sweet potato in three flavours. We are experimenting with carrot, beans and karela too. Most of their products come in resealable packets that can be reused. That came about, she says, because once you open a packet, whats inside invariably gets soggy soon if you dont put it away carefully. Weve also realised that the Indian consumers want to see what theyre buying so were introducing little windows so that they can see what theyre getting.Going forward, Umeshwari says that the focus on the breakfast and snack segment will continue. We will look at expanding our portfolio and penetrating newer markets, while ensuring that whatever we have introduced continues to be available.While Monsoon Harvest can be found easily online, the main issue is getting into retail stores, she says. But she doesnt want to get into the hassle of opening their own store. We ship across India, not just to big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai but also to smaller centres like Ranchi, Guntur and Kurnool. Punjab is actually becoming a big centre for us. Were looking to move into the eastern India as well.She also hopes to apply for the Great Taste Awards again, may be in other categories as well. I want to continue to bring out products that are new and not available in the market, she smiles.For more details, visit www.mon soonharvest.in"

The sub-inspector was suspended following an inquiry.According to Bazarkhala circle officer (CO) Anil Kumar Yadav, who investigated the matter, Talkatora SI Dinesh Chandra went to buy the fast food for himself and his colleagues.He asked Kanhaiya Lal, the van owner, to quickly pack the food.

As asked, Lal showed his van registration papers, but the cops booked him for not wearing a seat belt.The police officer told Lal that he was paying the price for not serving him food on time.

Boman Kohinoor, the man behind Britannia & Co passed away. And for a mere restaurateur, an unprecedented amount of ink was poured in tribute. Which in itself goes to show that Kohinoor, wasnt mere at all. He was part of the fabric of Mumbai that is now slowly being frayed and is turning threadbare. In him, we have lost one of the few remaining symbols of a city that represented another more gentle and upright age.I must have first visited Britannia when I was a kid. In those days, driving to the heritage precincts of Ballard Estate was no great thing. We did not give even a second glance to those grand buildings of this European-style business district designed in the Indo Saracenic style. We just drove past the Mint and took a left at the tall Port Trust World War I memorial and hopped off right outside Britannia. The streets were thinly populated, hardly anyone owned cars and finding parking wasnt even a glimmer of a problem.In those days, the signboard above the restaurant read Britannia & Co High Class Restaurant. On the sides of the worn tin signage were two advertisements for Dukes Mangola and Lemonade. Remnants of crystal chandeliers with tiny golden globe lights, high ceilings and arched doorways hinted at a time when Britannia was indeed a high-class restaurant. It catered only to British Officers and served only European food. Like many prime properties in Mumbai at the time, Britannia too was acquired by the army to house soldiers during World War II. When the war was over, Britannia was handed back to the owners, but all the officers and Europeans had gone and the ground floor of Neville House, on Currimbhoy Road was never the same. But the Iranis and the Kohinoor brothers were not going to take things lying down.Come Independence, the restaurant was back with nationalistic vigour, with a spicy mainly Parsi menu and dishes based on recipes from the Kohinoor home.We were young, and Boman Kohinoor by that logic was a much younger man. When we all trooped into the restaurant as children, running around deciding on which table to grab, the bright green checkered table linen beckoning us, a large red rooster with a black plumed tail, and a ruddy Kohinoor who both sat majestically, one on top of and the other behind the cash counter greeted us. If he ever spotted you struggle with the large menu cards tucked under the glass that covered the tables, he would spring into action to help.The usual order was the Mutton Berry Pulao. That was the single most important dish at Britannia. The Britannia Berry Pulao comes closest to the Irani Zereshk Polow as it can to a Persian dish. Zereshk Polow is a simple steamed rice dish flavoured with saffron, sprinkled with sour barberries (berry) and served with chello kabab, kibbeh or chunks of meat. Some Persian homes cook the meat and rice together and then finish it off with saffron and the berries. Britannia, added fried onions and tomatoes, Parsi spices, potato and served it as a robust pulao. It came flavoured with Parsi garam masala, saffron and sprinkled with nuts and berries imported from Iran.Kohinoor would come to the table, greet you, the bottles of Raspberry would appear as hed explain the menu, snap at a waiter, order your choice and then regale you with his sentiments about British RoyaltyWe would sit under those creaky fans hanging a mile above our heads and sweat with joy eating Berry Pulao with Britannias dark, thick, loaded masala dhansak dal, like it was our last meal. (Their dhansak which nobody ever talks about, is also incredible) Of course it wasnt our last meal. Along with the pulao, there was always an order of Britannias eminent Sali Kheema (mutton) that we wiped back with soft large rotlis, and deep fried lacy mutton cutlets  soft mince spicy patty dipped in crumbs and egg and fried. During the right season, they served fried bombils and Patra ni Macchi as specials but I never ventured there.Kohinoor would come to the table, greet you, the bottles of Raspberry would appear as hed explain the menu, snap at a waiter, order your choice and then regale you with his sentiments about British Royalty. Hed insist you try the queen of desserts, the caramel custard. Originally a classic French dessert, called Crme Caramel, its been completely claimed by Irani cafs and Parsi housewives. Chilled wobbly custard with sweet and bitter burnt caramel on top. In the old days youd get jelly too. But I cannot fathom when such a quintessential Irani place added Bengali mishti doi to its menu, which Id always prefer over the custard, much to Kohinoors vexation.Mind you, though the walls were unpainted and the plaster was peeling, the meal wasnt cheap. It did set you back a bit. But then, whats a few extra rupees for a trip to another time, place and dimension. A few years ago the rooster left his roost and now hangs on the wall as a photo in frame. Sadly the next time we go there, so will Boman Kohinoor. My only prayer is that while he will be sorely missed by his many patrons, may his legacy live on for a long time in Britannias Mutton Berry Pulao.First Published: Sep 27, 2019 21:46 IST"

2019-09-28,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/stars-without-a-fault-the-benefits-of-star-fruit/article29528617.ece,Stars without a fault: The benefits of star fruit,"Our President may not know about this, but the sprawling estate where the head of the state resides in central Delhi was a favourite haunt of mine, and of my equally scruffy companions, when we were kids. We werent so much interested in the splendid architecture of the complex than in the fruit trees that lined one part of it just outside the estate.That was where we would pluck a fruit we could never have enough of. It was the kamrakh, and it was so sour that the very thought of it makes my lips pucker up even after all these years.Packed with Vit CJust the other day, I saw an elderly man selling kamrakhin another part of Delhi and remembered the pleasure the fruit gave us way back in the 60s. The curiously shaped fruit has ridged vertical lines. The vendor cuts the fruit down the lines, and then seasons the pieces with salt and masala. And there it is  a delectation, just for a few rupees, for those who love their food sour. If cut horizontally, the pieces come out shaped like stars. Hence its name: star fruit.The image was still in my mind when I reached home that day, and found a book waiting for me. I had been eager to get my hands on it ever since I heard that a new edition of First Food: Business of Taste published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), was out.And, as it often happens when something is echoing in your mind, the first page I opened was about kamrakh also called amrakh. The fruit, in fact, figures in two chapters in this informative book about little-known, or dying, food and ingredients.Star fruit is considered a superfood now, and is a part of many a health conscious salad-eaters diet. It is full of vitamin C and is believed to help control blood sugar. But those with a kidney problem should steer clear of it, the book tells us.In one chapter, CSEs Vibha Varshney recalls how vendors would sell the fruit with tamarind, guava and ber, and how it was used to garnish sweet potato chaats. The fruit, she adds, grows in abundance in Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh, about 200 km from Delhi. Star fruit is apparently used in Surinam for preparing wine and as a preserve in southern China.Cure for hangoverStar fruit is a one-stop medicine shop as well. According to traditional Indian medicinal systems, its consumption can treat haemorrhage. The dried fruit or the juice extracted from ripe fruit can cure fever. In Brazil, the fruit is recommended for eczema. According to the Chinese, consumption of star fruit can quench thirst and increase salivary secretion, the author writes.Star fruit is believed to have originated in Sri Lanka and the Moluccas and then spread to different parts of the world. Averrhoa carambola, its scientific name, the book informs us, is derived from Averroes, the Andalusian astronomer, philosopher and physician of the 12th century. What he had to do with the fruit, however, is not clear.This edition of First Food  glossier than its earlier avatars  also comes with recipes, some of them from top chefs. In the star fruit section, there are recipes for chutneys and pickles.For a portion of suitably sour chutney, take star fruit (one piece), coriander leaves (50g), mint leaves (50g), green chillies (3-4), coriander powder (1tbsp) and salt to taste. Grind them all together and your chutney is ready.For pickled star fruit, take kamrakh (500g), nigella seeds (20g), chilli powder (20g), fennel seed powder (20g), mustard seed powder (20g), salt (50g) and mustard oil. Cut the fruit into thick slices. Add salt and wait till the fruit releases water. Remove the slices. Keep the saltwater aside.In a bowl mix the star fruit slices with the seeds and powders. Transfer all this to a glass bottle and pour the saltwater over it. Add mustard oil till it covers all the slices of the fruit. Leave the bottle in the sun for 2-3 days. The pickle is ready to eat, First Food tells us.Such a small fruit but so useful. And theres more. Kamrakh, the writer tells us, also treats hangovers. You live and learn.The writer likes reading and writing about food as much as he does cooking and eating it. Well, almost."

I bought 60 kg onion of the best quality. My wife cut them and fried them. We keep these fried onions throughout the year and add them to curries in place of onions. This form of storage is useful because we live in a small house of walled city where there is no space of keeping onions. So we fry it (known as birista) and store it in small containers.Shamimbanu Siddiqui stores around 300 kg onions every year at her home in Jamalpur. We are a joint family. So as per the requirement of my family, I buy around 300 kg onion from APMC, Vasna, which trades only in potato and onion. I buy it around May-June before the onset of, when the season is in full swing. I buy it for Rs 9-10 per kg and spread the stock on the floor of the room. Then I keep rotating the onions. This ensures they dont get spoilt. We store onions just for the best quality, which is available during the season. But, when prices go up it also feels good that your budget does not get disturbed because of it."

Though our temples are all decked up and we observe fasts due to spiritual reasons, it is also scientifically said to be a fast observed to give rest to the gut due to seasonal change. Even though it is tied up with religion, experts believe it is good to fast during this week to let the liver rest and rejuvenate. However, it is important to do it right. Heres how one should fast right this season:1. Eat small meals at regular intervals to keep your metabolism running and have sustainable release of energies.2. Drink lot of water to keep yourself hydrated. You can also have green tea, infused water or coconut water. Lemon, mint (as per the religious rituals) can be infused in water. Have it early in the morning as it cleanses and detoxifies your body. Also, for lassi, smoothies or yogurt as they will keep you full and help in maintaining optimum fluids in your body.3. Avoid eating fried food as the nutrients are lost when you fry something. Go for roasted or baked options. Avoid eating pakoras and namkeens as snacks instead have handful of nuts such as walnuts, pistachios, almonds or roasted makhanas, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, raisins or a mix of all. Also, replace fried aloo-chat with boiled chat and yogurt.4. Try having Kuttu ki roti rather than puri made from Kuttu atta - buckwheat is extremely rich in dietary fibre; making us full, Calcium and protein however it absorbs a lot of oil hence puri should be avoided as far as possible. You can also use amaranth flour to make roti as its lighter and lower in calories as compared to kuttu ka atta.5. Potato is the main food during navratri but try to limit its intake as much as possible; or mix potatoes with lauki and make muthias out of it. There are a lot of food items that can be eaten during this period. One can experiment with food to make it more interesting. You can try Banana walnut lassi, amaranth ki kadi, beetroot cutlet, badam and tulsi ka shorba, makhana kheer or pumpkin soup.6. Opt for skimmed milk rather than using whole milk. You can also have double-toned milk. But make sure you dont have too much milk. Two servicing of milk or milk products in a day is enough.7. Some food groups are increase the glycaemic index and hence should be avoided. Sabudana khichdi or chaat is one such dish. It shoots up the sugar level soPeople fast for nine days and refrain from eating daily food items like rice and Indian bread.

Were backing startups that provide technology and working capital to make kiranas more efficient, so that these mom-and-pops can become e-commerce and lending enablers in their communities, Tung added.From the poshest neighbourhoods to teeming slums, typical Indian kiranas are cramped spaces that can just about fit a king-size bed but are chock-full of sacks of rice, lentils and dried chili peppers. Their floor-to-ceiling shelves are stacked with toothpaste and cooking oil, and their shopfronts festooned with colourful bags of potato chips, tiny sachets of shampoo and pickles. With their personalized service, the stores usually offer door-step delivery and interest-free credit.GGV, which has focused almost exclusively on China and the U.S. for two decades, is bullish about India. We are seeing the same movie played out a little differently in emerging economies, said Tung. India can be very big over the next 10 years. As much as 20% of the $1.9 billion fund raised by the VC firm last year will be allocated to India as well as Southeast Asia.India has the market size and talent pool to make things happen and now investors are lining up with capital, said Foo. GGV Capital will write $5-10 million in checks in the case of very early-stage entrepreneurs and $50 million checks for later-stage startups, he said.The firm has built an investment strategy around kiranas based on the premise its better to play with a model that already exists rather than building new supply chains that could take as long as a decade to materialize. GGVs first such investment amounting to tens of millions of dollars is in Udaan, a Bangalore-based B2B marketplace for small businesses, the partners said. More recently, GGV has put money in Khatabook, a mobile app thats a digital version of the bahi khata, or the hand-written ledger that owners of tiny businesses traditionally use to keep track of daily accounts. Its an earlier-stage bet so the investment is lower, Tung said.Large global investors like Tiger Global Management, Lightspeed Venture Partners and even consumer giant Unilevers investing arm are backing technology startups that serve kiranas but GGV Capital is the first to crystallize a proposition that goes beyond India to include the neighbourhood-store equivalents of kiranas in Indonesia, Vietnam and Latin America.Across these countries, the value of the average online order is still low and the cost of last mile logistics is very high, said Foo. Entrepreneurs are finding a different way by empowering the mom and pops and that can get e-commerce going.In India, even the biggest conglomerates including Tata and Reliance have been unable to diminish kiranas dominance while newer online retail entrants Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are trying to embrace them, using the shops to facilitate deliveries or offer assistance to customers going online for the first time. Reliance has already said it will equip kiranas with technology as part of its online-offline e-commerce model.GGV also sees the neighbourhood stores as more than a place to shop. If you power them up and earn their trust, they can be the place to serve the community far beyond just groceries and daily necessities, said Tung.First Published: Oct 01, 2019 10:56 IST"

But he has no regrets. A right-wing sympathiser he said he did everything for his God, Lord Ayyappa, the presiding deity of Sabarimala.A relatively peaceful state Kerala had witnessed large-scale violence and five shutdowns in two months following the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to pray at the Sabarimala hill temple last year.For the first time, more than 50,000 people were booked and many jails were packed to the brim.As the first anniversary of the Supreme Court verdict passed off peacefully on September 28, a majority of protesters feel what they did was right and another section says political parties have dropped them like hot potatoes.A regular at the hill shrine, Jayakumar said hes worried now and that he never expected anything positive from the Communist government in the state but pinned much hope on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre.He said though the Centre is hiding behind technicalities hes sure it will not let down devotees like him. Injured during a baton charge, doctors have advised him rest but he has to keep the hearth burning so hes working as a sales executive in an automobile shop.Besides baton charge, I was also tortured in police custody in Ranni police camp. I cant stand too long now. I did everything for my faith. But I havent lost all hope either, he said.Many like him had spent days together at the hill shrine nestled in the Western Ghats and nearby areas after the verdict keeping a vigil on women in the 10-50 age groups.P Abilash, an engineering student, spent 40 days at a tea shop disguised as a helper. He also has four cases against him for rioting, violence against women and flouting prohibitory orders.He said hes getting legal aid from the Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an apex body of Hindu outfits formed in the wake of the temple struggle, but many others complained they find it difficult running from one court to another.My uncle Chandran Unnithan (56) sacrificed his life during the struggle. When he was leading a hymn-chanting procession, stones were pelted from the CPI(M) office in Pandalam. Injured badly, he died on the spot. We lost him badly but we hope his sacrifice wont be wasted, said his niece M Mini adding she is hoping against hope.Protesters are worried because many political parties, including the BJP, which exploited the issue to the hilt are silent now. During the campaign for the Lok Sabha election, both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah had said sacrifices of devotees wont be wasted.They expected an announcement after the second Modi government came to power but they were taken aback when Union Law Minister Ravishankar Prasad said the Centre had no plan for legislation on the issue.As the ruling CPI(M) and Congress scaled up their attack on the eve of five assembly by-polls, which is being touted as the semi-final before the assembly election due in 18 months, the BJP defended its position.What the Union minister said is since review petitions are pending before the apex court the government cant take a decision now. We dont need a certificate from our opponents on the issue, said party general secretary K Surendran, also a candidate in Konni (Pathanamthitta) assembly constituency.Having burnt its fingers, the CPI(M) is treading cautiously after the party had lost on all but one seat in the general elections and the temple issue was cited for the drubbing. It has also forced to lean right a bit carrying out a state campaign saying it was never against believers.The BJP and Congress cheated believers, maintained Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.But the Congress reiterated that if the Union government brings legislation it will support it. As the blame game goes devotees who face innumerable cases are a worried lot as they hop from one court to another.Bindu Ammini, one of two women of menstruating age who entered the hill temple last year making history, said she too is worried over some of the progressive outfits diluting their stance for vote bank politics.We thought a steady flow of women after our entry. But it did not happen, she lamented.First Published: Oct 03, 2019 08:04 IST"

Our lab and others have studied how different kinds of diet -- such as vegetarian versus meat-based diets -- impact the microbiome, said senior author of the study Peter Turnbaugh of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in the US.The researchers, including those from UCSF, examined how cooking impacted the microbiomes of mice by feeding diets of raw meat, cooked meat, raw sweet potatoes, or cooked sweet potatoes to groups of animals. Earlier research had demonstrated that cooking altered the nutrients and other bioactive compounds in both meat and tubers, the study noted. The research team found that raw meat had no discernible effect on the animals gut microbes compared to the cooked ones. However, the study noted that raw and cooked sweet potatoes significantly differed in their impact on the animals microbiomes.The researchers added that the microbes patterns of gene activity, and the biologically crucial metabolic products they produced differed between mice that ate cooked and those that fed on raw food. They then used a more diverse array of vegetables, performing what they called a mad scientist experiment - feeding the mice an assortment of raw and cooked sweet potato, white potato, corn, peas, carrots, and beets.The researchers said that as the host soaked up calories in the small intestine, it left less for hungry microbes further down the gut. They added that many raw foods contained potent antimicrobial compounds that appeared to directly damage certain microbes.We were surprised to see that the differences were not only due to changing carbohydrate metabolism, but also may be driven by the chemicals found in plants, Turnbaugh said. The study, the researchers said, highlighted the importance of considering the other components of our diet, and how they impacted gut bacteria.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and TwitterFirst Published: Oct 02, 2019 14:48 IST"

I say Rogan Josh.I have been to Kashmir several times, but the first was in 1970. We were too young to even realise that there was any sort of strife in the valley. Kashmir was this snow-clad land of plenty, with lakes, chinars, shikaras, house boats and rosy-cheeked people. The folks were all wrapped in warm woollen gowns called pherans and they all tucked away a kangri (an ember filled, earthen pot, encased in a small wicker basket with a handle) inside the layers of clothes to keep themselves toasty.In Srinagar, the Dal Lake shimmered in the early morning sunlight as wed wake up and huddle on the intricately carved wooden balcony of a houseboat, drinking steaming cups of kahwa (green tea infused in boiling water, with saffron, cinnamon, cardamom and Kashmiri rose petals), as ducks and drakes would float by looking for a peck. It was a land of apples and walnuts and slopes, which were ideal for skiing or singing a Shammi Kapoor song.Wed go back nearly every other year, visiting Pahalgam, which had carved wood houses, deep valleys, and clear water rivers. Gulmarg, nearly 4,000 metres above sea level, had knee deep snow throughout the year. Sonmarg was inaccessible in winter, otherwise called, Jannat. But then the 90s happened and we never went back.In early 2000, I did return to Srinagar and drove up to the border on the Baramulla Srinagar Bandipura Road, along the Jhelum River, all the way up to Gurez. When I returned to Srinagar after a couple of days, famished after having driven all night, I hit pay dirt. As my driver drove me into Srinagars Aali Kadal area of the old town area, a small queue had already started to form in the early hours of the morning outside what looked like a small house. It was foggy and freezing and the air was filled with the aromas of spices and cooking meat. This is where Ijaz Ahmed Bhat cooks what his forefathers have been cooking every morning for the last 150 years. Harrisa, or mutton kheema, slow cooked until it turns soft and pasty. The meat, along with a concentration of rice and spices, has been cooking for hours in a hole in the ground. It is served with a splash of flaming hot oil and Kashmiri rotis. For a meat lover this is like reaching the Promised Land. The meat is smoky and just melts in the mouth, and on its way around your palate leaves behind hints of saffron, garlic and saunf, with a piece of hot, finger indented, girda and noon chai (salt tea). Its a breakfast you come alive with.Harissa meals prepared by a cook and served in plates in Srinagar in 2018. ( Waseem Andrabi / Hindustan Times )Much has been said about the Kashmiri wazwan, which is a thaal full of meat. Cooked by a specialist cook called a Waza, this is an array of 36 dishes, including the valleys most exalted foods like rista (meatballs in an oily red Kashmir chilly gravy), lahabi kabab (mutton kababs cooked in yogurt), waza kokur (halved chicken, deep fried and cooked in saffron gravy), daeni phoul (mutton shank), doudha ras (mutton cooked in sweet milk) and rogan josh (mutton cooked in spices till the oil floats on top). There are several places in Srinagar which serve a decent Wazwan, but try finding good Kashmiri Pandit food. That proves quite a task.I was lucky to eat at the home of a friend, Uday Kaul and taste his mothers cooking. It was a simple meal in a simple house, one of the few remaining in the older parts of Srinagar. Sitting on a divan right in the middle of Udays mothers kitchen, we chatted while she cooked and spoke at the same time. The Kashmiri Pandits, like the Gaud Saraswats, are one of the few Brahmins who eat meat. The food is cooked without onion and garlic; these condiments are replaced by asafoetida to compensate. Paneer and curd also form a major part of their cooking.A hot flavourful Kashmiri kahwa is the classic way to unwind in the bitter cold. ( HT FILE )They say that the Pandits introduced the use of yoghurt, asafoetida and turmeric powder to Indian cuisine. If so, the meal was full of it. Like veth chaman. Chaman, meaning paneer in Kashmiri, is cooked in curd and with spices like saunth (dry ginger) and saunf (fennel). Or chaman qalian (a creamy paneer dish flavoured with cardamom and fennel), nadru yakhni (lotus stem in yogurt sauce), nadru palak (in spinach) and chok wagun (brinjal cooked in sour and spicy gravy with tamarind). And the piece de resistance: dum aloo. Nothing like the dum aloo you get in a restaurant in Mumbai. This is a dark red preparation, with whole baby double-fried potatoes. Theyre deep fried and then cooked in oil with dry ginger powder, aniseed powder, asafoetida and Kashmiri red chilli powder until the scarlet oil permeates the potatoes.We ate that whole meal sitting on the divan in the kitchen, the bright sunlight streaming in through the curtains on a chilly winter afternoon. After that meal, I spread myself across the mattress and stretched out to sleep. I lay there feeling satisfied, content and at peace. I hope the Kashmir too can someday soon descend into satisfaction, contentment and peace.First Published: Oct 04, 2019 21:56 IST"

The chain is known for its live on-the-table grill experience. You can add your choice of seasonings from lemon, black pepper or chilli flavours and barbecue the kebabs before savouring them, piping hot, says M Chinna, chef and city head.At this 134th outlet, the ambitious menu attempts to offer something for everyone, so there are rotis, gravies and biriyani sharing space with pizzas, pastas and south Indian fare. They also offer panipuri, shawarma and dosas, as well as a range of relatively exotic meats such as duck, quail, turkey, and rabbit. As we settle down, Cajun-spiced baby potatoes make an appearance. I dunk the buttery wedges in mango-mint chutney and savour the flavours. Next, it is time for the zafrani paneer tikka. The paneer cubes are succulent and marinated with minimal spices.Oriental grilled vegetables and Mexican mushrooms at the Barbeque Nation | Photo Credit: S.SIVA SARAVANANThe restaurant primarily uses marinades made with curd, Kashmiri chillies and coriander powder. They also spice up the food with their signature mustard paste. For clients who prefer more international flavours, there is Peri Peri and teriyaki dressing.The spread includes a range of grilled veggies. Try the creamy, spicy baingan. Also the crisp okra, dusted with ground spices. I follow it up with bell peppers, broccoli and corn-on-the-cob. An interesting sweet and tangy grilled pineapple continues the line up.

Maine cook ko bol diya ab se khana mein pyaaz bandh kardo (I do not know why you stopped exporting onions to us, I have instructed my cook to stop using the vegetable in our cooking),"" Hasina said at an investor summit here, with a wry smile.The barb was meant for Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal who was present at the function and had in a knee jerk reaction to rising domestic prices, banned exports.""Pyaaz mein thoda dikkat ho gaya hamare liye. (Onions have created a problem for us),"" the Prime Minister said, with an understated humour.India, the world's biggest seller of the tuber, banned export of onion last week after an extended monsoon delayed harvests leading to shriveled supplies and runaway prices. India sold some 2.2 million tones of onions in the international market in 2018.The result of India's ban was that prices of onions have shot up from Taka 30 (Rs 25.16) a kg to more than Taka 100 (Rs 83.86) a kg in Dhaka.Bangladesh has frantically tried to ship in onion supplies from Egypt and China but delivery will take three weeks to one month, a Bangladeshi diplomat complained.Also Read: Cabbage, potato all set to replace onions, say hoteliers in KovaiOnion is a politically sensitive vegetable in the entire sub-continent. While India's export ban was meant to check rising prices at home, it has also created a political headache for its neighbor.""Some notice (about the ban) would have been nice,"" Hasina said, adding with a smile, ""It was stopped so suddenly that it has become difficult. The next time you decide to do something like this... some advance notice would be nice.""Indian exporters say that Malaysia another importer of Indian onions is facing a similar problem.""In international trade such bans create problems, as our market is taken away by others as buyers see us as unreliable. The better way out would have been to fix a minimum export price to discourage excessive exports,"" said Vikram Sahney, a commodities trader."
2019-10-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ecb-the-hundred-kp-snacks-sponsorship-6054026/,ECB’s The Hundred under fire for KP Snacks sponsorship,"The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has come under fire from health advocacy groups who said their new domestic tournament The Hundred promotes junk food with its sponsorship deal with KP Snacks.AdvertisingThe 100-ball format tournament, which will be played during the English summer starting July 2020, was launched on Thursday and all eight city-based teams kits prominently feature logos of the British-based brands products, which are mainly maize, potato, and nut-based snacks.KP Snacks was announced as the tournaments official team partner in July by the ECB in a bid to grow the game and encourage families to be more active but health advocacy groups said it would have a negative effect, especially on children.Junk food brands sponsorship of popular sporting events is just another way they make sure their unhealthy products take centre stage in childrens minds, Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance said in statement.AdvertisingWe know that the relentless exposure to junk food marketing that children today are exposed to influences their food choices and how much they eat.KP Snacks said they recognised they had a responsibility to provide people with healthier snacking choices, adding that they had reduced the amount of salt content in their core products.We believe that snacks can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a KP Snacks spokeswoman told Reuters. We have also reformulated existing recipes and introduced new lower salt products.The ECB said the partnership with the snacks brand was an opportunity to use their unprecedented reach to grow the game.We agree its critical to promote this partnership responsibly and well use our own platform to educate and promote health, activity and balance as a core message, an ECB spokesperson told Reuters in an email.As part of our partnership, well get the opportunity to tap into their platform to engage with our core cricket fans, wider sports fans and families who were targeting as part of The Hundred.Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the United Kingdom should follow the example of the city of Amsterdam that put an end to sports sponsorship by similar companies, which eventually led to a fall in obesity levels.The ECB could have found any number of rich philanthropic organisations to fund its laudable objectives, Fry told Reuters.Sadly it didnt, with the result that our children will shortly see their heroes turned into advertising hoardings. (Its) quite irresponsible and unbelievably sad."

2019-10-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/poised-for-golden-chapter-india-bangladesh-look-to-build-a-bright-shared-future-6055711/,"Poised for ‘golden chapter’, India-Bangladesh look to build a bright shared future","Behind the noise over the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC), New Delhi and Dhaka are looking at consolidating the gains from the bilateral relationship of the past decade, and to make the progress irreversible.AdvertisingWhat started as an attempt to reset the relationship with Dhaka back in 2008 when Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister, is today Indias good-news story in South Asia.The reset in the relationship was particularly important after Khaleda Zias BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government, which was a bitter experience for New Delhi in terms of terrorist attacks and anti-India activities from Bangladesh soil.In Hasinas first term, Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs government found the momentum to initiate the resolution of the long-pending Land Boundary. But while the text was finalised, it was stalled by the BJP in Parliament. And in 2011, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stalled the Teesta water-sharing agreement for the first time.AdvertisingAfter Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, the BJP made a U-turn on the land boundary agreement, leading to the resolution of the historical dispute. However, on Teesta, Dhakas biggest complaint has been New Delhis inability to deliver on its commitment over the last five years.On Saturday, Hasina said that the people of Bangladesh were awaiting early signing and implementation of the Framework of Interim Agreement for sharing of the Teesta waters, as agreed upon by both governments in 2011. Modi said that his government was working with all stakeholders in India for conclusion of the agreement soonest possible.Its not that we dont want to sign. But political compulsions have prevented us from signing, a source in the government said.Now, with the BJP in West Bengal challenging Banerjee, it seems that this diplomatic hot potato has become an even more complicated question.Read | India, Bangladesh sign security, trade deals, speak in one voice on terrorBut the two sides are confident that they will not allow this to become an irritant in the relationship. As Modi met Hasina on Saturday, he is learnt to have told her in Bangla that the two countries are poised for a shonali adhyay (golden chapter) in the soon-to-be 50-year-old relationship.Indeed, over the last decade, the two sides have broadened their areas of cooperation from economy to nuclear, and from connectivity to terrorism. They are now looking at shared prosperity and opportunity, cutting across fields, and at a shared future.The PM has already assured Hasina that there should be no worries on account of the NRC. Government sources said that he reiterated to Hasina on Saturday that the NRC was an ongoing process which was court-mandated, and one has to see how that process unfolds.An Indian government source told The Sunday Express that the process would take a least 5 to 7 years to reach a stage where some action might take place, and the two sides have decided to work on opportunities that exist right now, and not think about the medium-term future. Last year, then Home minister Rajnath Singh had assured Dhaka that nobody would be deported.A Bangladeshi diplomat said on Saturday: There is a saying in Bangla, Jodi-r kotha nodi-te, which translates literally as worries about ifs are best thrown in the river. For the present, the two countries were looking at a mutually beneficial partnership, and to make the progress they achieve irreversible, the diplomat said.Bangladesh is growing at a rapid 8% annually; its economy has grown by a huge 188% since 2009. Its per capita income is around $ 2,000, and the value of its exports to India crossed $1 billion in 2019, a year-on-year growth of 52%. Hasina wants Bangladesh to rise from being a Least Developed Country (LDC) to a Developing Country by 2021, and a developed country by 2041. Both India and Bangladesh are now looking at a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).For decades, India has faced difficulty in accessing the Northeast of the country, having to negotiate the so-called chickens neck in North Bengal. The friendly government in Dhaka, with an assured political mandate, has more flexiblility in giving access to Indias Northeast through Bangladeshi territory. Several insecurities of the past are fading.The joint statement said that the two leaders welcomed the conclusion of Standard Operating Procedures for the use of Chattogram and Mongla ports for movement of goods to and from India, particularly to and from the North East of India, which could create a win-win situation for both economies.A Bangladeshi diplomat said that the two countries were now the most-connected in the South Asian region. After Hasinas visit, the two countries will increase flights from 61 to 91 per week in summer, and to 120 per week in winter. The frequency of the Maitree Express will go up from 4 times to 5 per week, and that of Bandhan Express from once to twice per week. Both sides on Saturday welcomed plans for a Dhaka-Siliguri bus; there are services between Kolkata and Dhaka and Agartala and Dhaka already.Beyond its own 162 million people, Bangladesh can be the connecting landmass to a combined market of nearly 3 billion people. With this in mind, the two sides agreed on Saturday that regional and sub-regional cooperation is a priority area for the two countries.As the SAARC has become moribund due to Pakistans attitude, New Delhi and Dhaka have focussed their energies on BIMSTEC, a key grouping in which they have shared interests.New Delhi hopes that as Bangladeshs economy improves and more people come out of poverty, the illegal migrations into India would automatically stop.AdvertisingThe case of movement of people is a global issue. There have always been issues relating to mobility of people among neighbouring states, said Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque said, citing the example of a similar issue between the US and Mexico."
2019-10-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/in-this-parched-bihar-district-how-farmers-keep-drought-at-bay-6055673/,"In this parched Bihar district, how farmers keep drought at bay","The dry belt of Naxal-hit Katoria and Chandan in Bihars Banka district has mostly been a one-crop zone  paddy or sugarcane. Agriculture was entirely dependent on rainfall with the state government only recently starting work on reviving old sources of water such as rivulets, embankments and ponds.AdvertisingBut over the last decade, at least 10 panchayats in the region have brought about a green revolution of sorts on their own  they are no longer dependent on rains alone.Today, because of the efforts of a 70-year-old farmer, Anirudh Prasad Singh, Katoria and Chandan blocks are home to about 150 ponds, check dams and lift irrigation.Local officials and residents say Singhs initiative has directly benefited about 1,000 farmers from 30 villages, while at least 10,000 farmers from 200-odd villages have followed his model to harvest water on their land. And since their success, these farmers have been growing two crops, paddy and wheat.AdvertisingThe experiment has now expanded to mobile lift irrigation  taking water up to 1,000 feet away from the origin by linking foldable pipes. The main beneficiaries are farmers from the panchayats of Kathaun, Katoria, Harhad, Bhikhuvasar, Bhairoganj, Lalpur and Varney, all semi-hilly and sandy areas with a mixed population of OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, mainly daily wagers, sharecroppers and marginal farmers.At Panjarpatta village, farmers Malik Singh, Rajinder Yadav, Naresh Singh, Dwarika Yadav and Dukhan Yadav help Anirudh Prasad Singh, whose legs are partially paralysed, move around their green paddy fields.Five years ago, Singh suffered serious injuries on his legs in a road accident and is now been helped by his son Chiranjiv Singh. But that has not deterred him. What he has done is visible. When the state government declared drought in several districts including some blocks of Banka, Katoria was not on the list it had completed about 70 per cent paddy cultivation, says Malik Singh, a farmer of Panjarpatta.A lot has to be done. More government and individual efforts are needed. I am happy about the impact of my work Our land is very conducive for potato but we are not yet able to get the water required. We have been working with farmers on how to do it, says Anirudh Prasad Singh.Malik Singh, who has five bighas of cultivable land, says: For us, Anirudh babu has been the green man. I have been growing two crops a year for the last six-seven years. Growing wheat was unheard of in this belt earlier.For instance, around a 50060 ft pond in Dumarsolva, constructed in 2008-09 by Singhs Mukti Niketan Bhagalpur with funds from NABARD, paddy is now being grown on about 50 bighas of land.Before the pond came up, this area was largely arid and dependent on rains alone. The paddy crop yield was about 500 kg per 20 cottah, its now about 1,000-1200 kg. Fields on the edge of the pond hardly need to be irrigated with the presence of constant moisture. The pond had made our dream of two crops a year a reality, says Bhuneshwar Tanti, a farmer. (One cottah is approximately 720 sqft)Anirudh Prasad Singh, a resident of Domsarani village of Katoria, says he is a Physics graduate, who had participated in the JP movement. I returned to my village in 1976 and tried to spread the movement but was unsuccessful. Then, I bought five acres of land in 1983 and set up the Mukti Niketan two years later. I travelled across 18 states working as a volunteer to spread awareness on water conservation, he said.I also raised the issue of water scarcity in Katoria and then Bhagalpur district but no one gave a solution. In 1991, Banka became a district and the then district magistrate gave me three lift irrigation projects to complete and promised to give 100 more if I succeeded. But before the completion of my project, he was transferred and the promise remained unfulfilled. Since then, I have not approached the district administration.He says he got his first major boost in 2008 from the Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology (CAPART), a nodal agency that acts as an intermediary between voluntary groups and the government for sustainable development in rural areas. He went on take the lead in desilting 30 old water bodies, constructing 20 wells and 35 lift irrigation machines, and installing 40 hand pumps. It was followed by the construction of 30 ponds, 25 checkdams and 10 lifts. That was the beginning, he says.According to him, the governments policy of selling sand has severely hurt the cause of water conservation. Sand is home to water. On one hand, the government is talking about greenery, and on the other, they are selling sand from small rivers and eroding the very source of water, he says.Five years ago, Anirudh Prasad suffered serious injuries on his legs in a road accident, and is now being helped by his son Chiranjiv Singh.AdvertisingDistrict Agricultural Officer, Sudama Mahato, told The Indian Express: From the government end, water conservation measures such as the revival of old water bodies are done under the MNREGS and by the minor irrigation department. We are aware of the good work done by Anirudh Prasad Singh and how farmers have benefited."

The reason: this festive season, a kg of garlic costs Rs 232, while peeled garlic costs Rs 267 per kg. Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HoPComs) officials said that while good quality garlic is usually quite expensive, now, even low-quality garlic is no less than Rs 120 per kg.B N Prasad, MD, HOPCOMS, told TNIE the price of garlic has been steadily increasing in the last one-and-a-half months. Even the price of onion did not rise this much. Earlier, in Bengaluru, the price never crossed Rs 80 in the retail market, he said.The costs of some kitchen staples, such as onion, garlic and ginger, have been on the higher side of late. However, the prices of both potatoes and tomatoes are stable now. According to HOPCOMS, a kg of onion costs Rs 54, potato Rs 29, ginger Rs 200 and tomato Rs 34.Prasad said that garlic is not grown much in Karnataka, and is imported from Madhya Pradesh. He also added that the price of onions, which was high till the end of September, has now started to drop. This is because onions are grown in Karnataka, and the price will only drop further in the coming days. To ensure that potato prices are stable, potatoes coming in from Agra are being stored in cold storage units, and its the Hassan crops that are being released in the market.In the case of other vegetables, HOPCOMS said that in general, prices are on the higher side for the last two weeks or so, and have not come down yet. Officials maintained that the price rise has nothing to do with the festival season, as it is assumed, but actually due to continuous rainfall.Unprecedented rainfall in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and in the outskirts of Bengaluru (Ramanagara, Anekal, Chikkaballapur, Doddaballapur and other areas) is the reason behind the price rise, Prasad said.Ashraf U F, a vegetable vendor in Indiranagar, said that during festival season, vendors tend to make a little more profit.Vegetables are a daily necessity, and during festive season, prices hike by about Rs 5 or Rs 10. Though it is not a big amount, it is sufficient for us, he said.Beulah amma, another vegetable vendor at Halasuru market, said that she has been getting 30-50 customers per day for the past one week, and has been able to make enough money to get through the festival season.We make a profit of Rs 100-Rs 200 per day during the festival season, unlike other days. However, this year, since it has been raining, we have also lost a few customers, as they prefer to shop in big retail shops, she said."
2019-10-06,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/new-good-food-destination-chefs-home/articleshow/71460737.cms,New Good Food Destination: Chef’s Home,"On a plate, with loveThis table busts mythsMaking memories over foodPopular in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Pune, the appeal of food pop-ups is trying to find room in the brick-and-mortar tradition of Delhi-NCR. They might not stick to one place for long, but the culture is here to stay, a logical corollary of the shrinking spaces and high rentals in metros. Sakshi Virmani and Sharad Kohli report on an eating-out trend thats hosted at the chefs home, making the experience much more personal.I find pop-ups are personal  strangers turn into friends after one pop-up itself, Sneha Saikia says with a laugh.For people in search of food with a backstory and atmosphere, or sometimes nostalgia, pop-ups have become must-save dates in the calendar. Customers are looking for an experience in an intimate space, says Osama Jalali, food historian and home chef. Theyre also looking for authenticity, which fine-dining cannot always bring.Through pop-ups, he adds, one can appreciate the full range and delights of Indias food heritage. Many Assamese pop-ups are coming up, for example, because people want to go beyond the regular fare.In Delhi-NCR, the concept hasnt gained as much acceptance as it has elsewhere, believes Srikant Vijaykar, one half of a duo thats on a journey of introducing the lesser-known but delicious Pathare Prabhu cuisine . Still, whether the venue is a Mumbai flat or a sprawling Delhi kothi, the pop-up is bringing on a platter the countrys culinary diversity.For long, food pop-ups have been part of Indias streetscape, in the form of makeshift stalls around which hungry folks would gather. Now, cuisines from regions across the land are being curated by home chefs, who are digging through old recipes and older ingredients to present local gastronomic cultures to an eager audience.When Sunetra and Srikant Vijaykar moved to Gurgaon from Mumbai in 2016, they knew little of how unique their cuisine was. The Vijaykars are a very small community from Maharashtra, the Pathare Prabhu community  worldwide, we number over 6,000, even smaller than the Parsis, says Sunetra.In fact, there is, as Srikant points out, more Gujarati and Rajasthani influence in their cuisine than there is Maharashtrian.The couples pop-ups, organised every three months at their Gurgaon pad, usually accommodate around 15 people. Each time, the response is phenomenal. Little wonder, considering the mouthwatering preparations that are served up. Some of our popular dishes are Paplet Bhujane, a white pomfret curry; Chimboree che Khadkhadle, crabs cooked in Pathare Prabhu sambar masala and lots of garlic; Gode Mutton, a mutton curry made with sambar masala; and Karandiche Lonache, shrimps in homemade pickle masala, says Sunetra.Before every pop-up, the Vijaykars fly in fresh food from Mumbai, where their events are more regular and attract the crowds. Srikant reasons it might have something to do with the palate, since Pathare Prabhu cuisine boasts more flavours than spice. A marketing professional, he is currently translating Gruhini-Mitra, one of the earliest known Indian cookbooks in which are chronicled old Pathare Prabhu dishes.At her CR Park home, Sneha Saikia serves dollops of Bhut Jolokia chutney, steamed squash, black-sesame baby potatoes and Manxo (mutton) curry, with rice on the side, on a fresh banana leaf and Kansa plate. Her Table for 6 acquaints north Indians with the delectable food of the northeast.Five years ago, Saikia noticed disparaging remarks online about food from the region. When I joined food groups on social media, I used to see foul comments about the cuisine. A lot of people still think we eat insects, that our food is visually unattractive to north Indians. I thought, let me invite people over and show them what we cook, says Saikia, who also makes Bodo and Khasi food.She recalls an incident where a college girl booked the table for the birthday of a friend, who was Assamese. The birthday boy was so happy, he was almost in tears; he described it as the best gift ever. People from almost all ethnicities have come and enjoyed this food, Saikia adds.Then theres Anchal Bhatia, who runs Tastesutra, a quaint cooking studio in Lajpat Nagar. She also holds pop-ups, including one she called Hidden Culinary Gems, in which guests were served regional preparations that have become rare, among them Bel Sherbet (with nolen gur and amaranth seeds), Kathal ke Kabab, Chicken Ghee Roast (with ragi appam), and Hyderabadi Baghaar-e-Baingan. Bhatias labour of love is India on a Thali.Yet, its not just in homes that the phenomenon of the pop-up is playing out. Hotels and restaurants, too, have embraced the concept, as have spaces like clubs in high-end condominiums. Its likely that chefs in hotels might not be conversant with a certain cuisine, so hotels can host pop-ups by a chef who would specialise in a certain regional cuisine, informs Jalali.The economics behind pop-ups is pretty straightforward, for what drives the home chefs is not profit but a passion to create a memorable experience around food. They spend on the ingredients, while the guests pay for the experience. Alternately, the organiser of a pop-up at a restaurant or hotel gets paid by the establishment in question.Further, if its happening in town, you would get to know about it through word of mouth, and your circle of fellow foodies. Or, of course, through the ubiquitous social media.At the end of the day, nothing beats the informality of strangers coming together to break bread at a table. Or, more traditionally, sitting on the floor, among carpets and bolsters and around a dastarkhwan, bonding over a daawat. It allows people the opportunity to sit down to a meal with a Muslim family, and it gives us the chance to host them, conveys Jalali, of a very personal experience.Besides, where else can you learn about ingredients like bitter brinjal, Burmese coriander or single clove garlic? These are difficult to procure in Delhi, so Saikia began growing them here (or, asking anyone visiting from Assam to bring some along). In our Assamese platter, you will find all the flavours  Khar is alkaline, for spice we have Bhut Jolokia chutney, for a little tangy flavour we have Masor Tenga (tomato fish curry), and steamed vegetables to balance the hotness, she explains.In winters, at one of the pop-ups, I introduced silkworms and red ant eggs that my cousin had sent me from Assam. Everybody was apprehensive at first but when they tried, they loved it. Indeed, food can make misapprehensions disappear and bring communities closer.So, the age-old Indian tradition of hospitality is alive. Meanwhile, at Saikias pop-ups, every scrumptious meal ends with a steaming brew of comfort. We have retained the British tea culture for community interaction in the afternoon, she says."

We are facing two extreme calamities, said Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa in his Independence Day speech. If floods devastated more than two dozen districts this year, drought has been tormenting the state for 14 years since 2001.Yediyurappa took oath as CM while the state was barely recovering from drought. However, the change in political landscape also brought in floods.Even before the government and bureaucracy could fully implement the relief measures in 156 taluks that were declared drought-hit in December last year, floods and incessant rains wreaked havoc in the state.Now, when the Centre, after a prolonged delay of almost two months, has released flood aid, the state is looking at a possibility of declaring about 30 more taluks as drought-hit.While the state government, utilising its funds as well as the central aid of Rs 1,029.39 crore released in August, has focused on the supply of drinking water, job generation under MGNREGA, supply of fodder and checking migration of rural masses, continued deficit rain has pushed more taluks into the drought-hit list. In a recent review meeting conducted by the revenue department, taluks in Bengaluru, Ramanagara, Kolar, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Chamarajanagar, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura and Gadag were identified as drought affected.If there is one district that has faced drought for the longest period, it is Kolar. Farmers in the district have tried everything from changing crops to depending on dairy farming for revenue but the extensive dependence on rainwater has left the district high and dry year after year. This wasnt the case a couple of decades ago when lakes and groundwater were the lifelines of Kolar.I own 12 acres and grow mango, potato and tomato in seven acres. But I have not grown anything in the remaining five acres because of water shortage, said Shivarame Gowda, a farmer from Kiruvara in Srinivasapur taluk.The tale of Narayana Gowda, another farmer, is different. He first chose to sow drought-resistant ragi  athree-month-crop following rain in June and July in Kolar and Chikballapur, but rains failed and so did the crop. He then shifted to a two-month crop of horse gram, with little hope of success.Every time a taluk is declared drought-hit, the DCs are authorised to undertake a joint survey to assess the extent of crop loss, as per the modalities prescribed by the government in the Manual for Drought Management 2016. Drought relief measures are then undertaken. But projects like the KC Valley give hope to Kolar farmers. Treated water from Bengaluru to fill up lakes in Kolar has shown an increase in groundwater level. Also, 31 tanks have already been filled up under the project in Narasapura and Malur. A project to construct 806 check dams across the district, of which 312 have been completed, show the way forward."

2019-10-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/ecuador-arrests-shopkeepers-man-dies-as-protests-rage-6057134/,"Ecuador arrests shopkeepers, man dies as protests rage","Ecuadorean authorities began arresting shopkeepers for raising food prices as indigenous groups clashed with security forces on Sunday in the fourth day of protests against President Lenin Morenos austerity measures. One man died in central Azuay province when roadblocks blocked an ambulance from reaching him after he was hit by a car, authorities said. Local media identified him as a protester, but that could not be confirmed.AdvertisingEcuadoreans complain consumer prices have risen sharply as a knock-on effect of Morenos abolition of fuel subsidies, which has also triggered the nations worst unrest in more than a decade. Everyones raising prices with the excuse of the gasoline price rise, disgruntled pensioner Camilo Salazar, 65, said at a food market in the coastal city of Guayaquil, where prices have risen by up to a third in just a few days.The government said 20 people were detained over the weekend for over-charging for products including corn, onions, carrots and potatoes, which are all subject to price controls. There is no justification for raising the prices, Interior Minister Maria Romo said in a statement.Ecuadors dollarized economy had inflation of just 0.27 percent in 2018. After a two-day strike by transport unions, indigenous groups have taken the lead in demonstrations against Morenos economic measures. They barricaded roads in various places again on Sunday with burning tires, branches and rocks.AdvertisingSome protesters threw stones at security forces, who responded with tear gas. The CONAIE umbrella indigenous group published a video showing spear-wielding inhabitants blocking a road and shouting Down with the government! The 66-year-old Moreno won the 2017 election and has set the oil-producing nation on a centrist track after years of socialist rule under predecessor Rafael Correa.STATE OF EMERGENCYMoreno has declared a two-month state of emergency. Though he enjoys the support of businessmen and the military, Morenos popularity has sunk to under 30%  compared with 70% after his election  and Ecuador has a volatile history.Indigenous-led protests toppled three presidents in the decade before Correa took power in 2007. Witnesses said that in Lasso, south of the capital Quito, indigenous groups captured and took away several soldiers after violent confrontations. Struggling with a large foreign debt and fiscal deficit, Quito this year reached a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund that requires belt-tightening economic reforms.As well as ending fuel subsidies, the government is reducing the state workforce and planning some privatizations. Moreno says the fuel subsidies, in place for four decades, had distorted the economy and cost $60 billion. Though transport unions stopped their action after being allowed to raise fares, other sectors have called a national strike for Wednesday.Moreno, who uses a wheelchair after a 1998 shooting during a robbery that left him paraplegic, has refused to overturn the fuel measure but said the government will increase benefits for the poor to compensate its impact.Ecuador hopes to save about $1.5 billion a year from ending fuel subsidies. Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27 billion annually.Correa, who lives in Belgium, calls Moreno, his one-time protg and vice-president, a traitor."

Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) reported about 27 cases of stubble burning on Monday, taking the total count to 258 this year, which equals the number of cases reported last year during the same period.PRSC officials said while eight incidents each were reported in Amritsar and Tarn Taran on Monday, three cases in Gurdaspur, and two cases each were reported in Mansa and Patiala. One case each was reported from other state districts, said senior scientist PRSC, Anil Sood.The PRSC remote sensing centre had started monitoring cases of stubble burning from September 23.Over 600 incidents of farm fire were witnessed from the beginning of the season till October 7, in 2017, while in 2018 as well as 2019, in the same period, 258 farm fire cases were reported.On a single day, 90 of farm fires were reported on October 7, 2017, while 119 cases were reported on October 7 in 2018. This year, only 27 cases were reported on Monday, October 7.Out of the 258 cases, the maximum farm fires were reported from the Majha area.Experts of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) said many farmers were setting their fields on fire to prepare the field for sowing potato.Government agencies were expecting farm fires to continue as usual after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh was heckled when he urged farmers to shun stubble burning and opt for happy seeder during Kisan Mela at PAU on September 21.Chief agricultural officer Ludhiana Baldev Singh said that besides registration of a criminal case, national green tribunal (NGT) has also taken a stringent view of the matter.As per the new provision, a fine from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000 would be imposed on defaulters, depending on the area set on fire. Last year 55 farmers were penalised in Ludhaina district for stubble burning.First Published: Oct 07, 2019 23:44 IST"
2019-10-08,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/trump-finally-faces-the-impeachment-challenge-but-plans-to-brazen-it-out/story-FL67RE7BRxlxRGqI9PrZNK.html,"Trump finally faces the impeachment challenge, but plans to brazen it out","analysisUpdated: Oct 08, 2019 19:09 ISTThis one has truly come in from the outfield. While impeachment has been whispered around the corridors of Washington DC since the beginning of the Donald Trump Presidency, it has never been a serious political reality chiefly because till the November 2018 mid-term elections, both the House and Senate of the United States Congress were in Republican hands. Most Republicans, whatever some of them may feel in private, have thought it politically expeditious to back Trump.Even when the House math changed in favour of the Democrats in 2018, the impeachment idea did not gather strength though one controversy after another  obstruction of justice with regards to possible Russian collusion in the 2016 elections, campaign finance violations and so on  radiated from the White House. The somewhat wishy-washy conclusions from the Mueller report on the Russian collusion issue also did not add much wind to the sails. The canny Democrat leader and House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has been reluctant to push impeachment, possibly because a weak, fizzled-out impeachment process may have only ended up strengthening Trumps re-election prospects. She had in mind too that several moderate Democrats, elected from Trump districts, would then find it harder to be re-elected in 2020 and thus jeopardise the Democratic majority and Pelosis speakership. Thus, despite provocations, the impeachment notion has been tossed around like a hot potato that one may want, but finds too uncomfortable to hold.All that changed in the last two weeks. Washington was rocked by revelations in a whistleblower complaint about a Trump phone call to President Zelensky of Ukraine on July 25, in which Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump officials had earlier put a hold on $390 million of Congress-cleared military assistance for Ukraine. The Democrats alleged that Trump had abused the Presidential office in appealing to a foreign county to get dirt on a political rival and influence the 2020 elections, using military aid as leverage.This complaint, backed up as credible by the intelligence watchdog, has proved to be a tipping point and a consensus quickly coalesced around the impeachment idea. Seven first-time Democratic Congress members, not thinking in narrow careerist terms, wrote a joint op-ed in The New York Times asking Congress to proceed with impeachment if the allegations against Trump are true. Pelosi, sensing the mood of her Party, announced a formal impeachment inquiry for betrayal of oath of office, betrayal of national security and betrayal of the integrity of American elections. Pelosi probably had little choice  if such allegations about the phone call, backed by evidence, went unchallenged, the credibility of the Democrats would be under question and the bar for the behaviour of any future president would be abysmally low.Since then, the story has moved incredibly fast, and instead of hushed whispers, we now have not one, but two whistleblower complaints, a reconstructed transcript, text messages, subpoenas issued to the White House for documents, and six House committees working on the issues.So far, President Trump is being characteristically brazen. Describing the Ukraine call as perfect, he has denied any quid pro quo. He has called the impeachment inquiry the greatest witchhunt in the history of our country, and tweet-stormed the Do Nothing Democrats as well as the process in aggressive, colourful language. With an eye on his base, he has adopted the narrative that his actions are an attack on corruption and have nothing to do with the 2020 elections. During a press gaggle on the south lawns of the White House, he called on China, currently adversary number one, to investigate Biden; even hard-boiled observers of Trumpian Washington are left gaping.The enquiry is clearly gathering steam. The House Judiciary Committee will have to decide if the evidence is sufficient to frame articles of impeachment. These would require only a simple majority to pass in the House, and the Democrats have that. This would be followed by a Senate trial where a two-thirds majority would be needed to remove the President from office. This seems unlikely at present, and can only come about if the Republican support for Trump crumbles. So far, but for Mitt Romney and some lone voices, others appear unwilling to buck Trumps base.If the President were to be impeached in the House, but not removed from office by the Senate, he would be in the same position as two earlier presidents: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Richard Nixon, who would have been removed from office by the Senate, preferred to resign. No matter which path the developments take, President Trump will continue to battle it out vigorously, running down the process and the Democrats, and presenting himself to his supporters as the embattled crusader. But what seems missing is a well-thought-out defence plan.Navtej Sarna is former ambassador of India to the United StatesThe views expressed are personalFirst Published: Oct 08, 2019 19:05 IST"
2019-10-10,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/tipple-at-the-turf/article29648715.ece,Tipple at the turf,"I remember the time when the party would get over late at night, and just before heading home, people would pick up hot baida rotis from a special counter we would put up, says Somnath Bhattacharya, COO of deGustibus Hospitality. The bar Bhattacharya fondly speaks about is Tote Bar at Tote on the Turf, which shut down last October, and is now back as Tote Talli.Reinventing spaceFor 10 years, the bar had been one of citys the most buzzing nightspots, attracting swish 30-somethings. And it was a true bar, as they didnt even have a separate food menu, only serving small bites from Neel (their Indian restaurant below). And when Tote on the Turf would serve as the venue for the offsite shows of Lakme Fashion Week (before they changed the venue to grander locales such as The Royal Opera House a few years ago), the bar, would also serve as the perfect spot for post-show rendezvous. The empty floor that earlier turned into a dance floor is now occupied by tables, and Bhattacharya tells us that they will host performances in the future. We have seen a whole new generation come here over a decade. With a new crowd coming in, we felt the need to reinvent the menu and reach a newer audience, says Bhattacharya.With Tote Talli, deGustibus also wants to focus on food, and the brief for their chefs was to go crazy and design something fun, and well priced. The focus being the bar, small plates and finger foods dominate the menu. And there is a section dedicated to chakna which are served in the form of bento boxes. Whether its papad, peanuts or chaklis, they have a bento box (195 each) dedicated to different versions of each of these common snacks. The usual suspects such as poutines (you can choose from sweet and regular potato) and nachos come with the basic cheese and guacamole topping options, in addition to some Mumbai style versions such as kheema (275) and nachos with Akuri Scrambled Eggs (225).Small eatsBhattacharya says that they were conscious of including different Indian cuisines to reinvent bar food, which can be seen with options such as Chettinad or Bhut Jolokia Chicken Wings served with thecha sour cream (295), or the Chilliya Mutton sliders (350) inspired by the late-night stalls at Reay Road, which are often frequented by their staff who work out of their office in the vicinity. As an ode to the earlier avatar, they still offer Baida Roti in paneer (350), chicken (375) and mutton (395) variants. More Mughlai food finds its way to the menu in the form of different kebabs (250 onwards).If cheese is all you wish to eat, call for any of their burrata offerings (375) which come with a variety of flavour pairings such as tomato concasse, chilli oil, chutneys and a brulee burrata too. We have included more small plates in affordable prices so when you come in a group, you can freely order and choose from various options rather than just one main dish, says Bhattacharya. The desi inspirations make way to the cocktail menu too with cocktails such as Mucchad (335) a vodka and paan drink; and Golmaal (335), a refreshing concoction of vodka, orange juice, tamarind, cilantro and chillies. Just in case you arent into small plates, you can call for Tote Bowls that offer tried-and-tested options such as Burnt Garlic Triple Schezwan Rice (325) or Thow Suey (325), which is Khow Suey made the Thai way.Tote Talli Tote on the Turf, Mahalaxmi Racecourse, Mahalakshmi; 91369 33274; 6 p.m. onwards"
2019-10-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-taste-of-health/article29658704.ece,A taste of health,"First time restaurateur Mohit Bulchandani wants to bust the myth that healthy food cant be delicious. The meat-eater who turned vegan last year, recently launched Seeds of Life (SOL), a caf offering healthier options of everything from pasta, pizza to desserts. The 27-year-old felt that the city lagged behind when it came to healthy, vegan or gluten-free options. Also, most [of the restaurants offering healthy options] are priced on the higher side and eating healthy is a lifestyle which you need to sustain, so we consciously worked on keeping the prices low, he tells us. What we love the most about SOL though is their absolute refusal to use refined sugar, refined flour or any processed products. Everything, including the bread, is made fresh every day.The interiors, designed by Sumessh Menon and Associates, make for a refreshing set-up with textured white walls, and chairs and pretty botanical print upholstery. The menu offers something for everyone, there are wraps, burgers, pizzas, pasta, risotto, smoothie bowls (which Bulchandani tells us are a crowd favourite), sandwiches and breakfast options too. And nothing is deep-fried at SOL. Or you could just order a cup of organic coffee, with a vegan and gluten-free chocolate tart (275), decadent enough to make you ditch the usual variants.Around the worldBulchandani explains that he wanted to incorporate different cuisines in the menu as well, and not just have modern plates made with healthy ingredients. For example, the entres includes the Mexican or Lebanese Bowl (525 each), which makes for a complete meal with portions of rice, veggies and dips like hummus and guacamole.Vegans and gluten-intolerants are spoilt for choice with a range of pastas like the Carrot Arrabiata and Aglio Olio Zoodles (325 each). A single SOL wrap, with their generous portions, will fill up a huge appetite.The herbed mock meat option called Phantom (325) is a popular option. We try Turn Up The Beet(275) a vegan wrap filled with sauted veggies, pickled beetroot, baked falafel, and sweet potato fries with hummus and harissa.As for SOLs smoothies, theres the Go Bananas with Maca (200), a thick and deliciously smooth drink made with banana, dates, cinnamon, and maca blended with almond milk. Our favourite pick from their menu is the Green Goddess pizza (450). SOL offers a base option of wholewheat or rajgira for its pizzas, and we try the latter option.The result is a thin crisp base with loads of flavour from rajgira that works surprisingly well for a pizza base. Topped with basil pesto, avocado, asparagus, zucchini, capsicum and arugula, this dish is enough to feed two. And just in case you are craving something sweet, try the SOIL vegan ice cream like the Avocado Pistachio (275).With simple yet flavour-packed innovative and healthy dishes, SOL is ideal for vegans or the calorie conscious.Seeds of Life, Vora House, Bandra West; time: 1 p.m. to 11 p.m.; phone: 9653336089"

Some even said she will be states chief minister in 2022 polls.Besides giving a call to partymen to fight the BJP, the leaders said the party needed to fight and finish the SP and the BSP that had occupied the Congresss space in Uttar Pradesh.Lallu used the occasion to project himself as a fighter narrating the story of his journey from family of a poor farmer to students union elections and then reaching the top post of the state Congress. There was a time when I was a booth level worker. In all 32 cases have been registered against me and I have been to jail 18 times. I am ready to go to jail 1800 times to fight for honour of partymen and cause of people. Cases registered against you are reward in politics if you fight for the people, said Lallu.When I was studying, the lenders used to come to my house and abuse my father. I used to wear torn trousers. I have sold salt, fertilizer and cinema tickets. Police lathis have broken all the bones in my body and I stand on legs that have rods fitted, he said.We will become voice of the people. We have challenges of raising issues concerning law and order situation, farmers, potato and sugarcane growers and problems of people drought affected districts and Bundelkhand region.. There is no power, no such government that cannot be voted out, said Lallu, who was all praises for Rahul Gandhi.He said the BJP had targeted the Gandhi scion for raising issues like land acquisition act and fighting for farmers annoying lobby of leading industrialists.As many senior leaders, including some former union ministers, were conspicuous by their absence, the party leaders made it a point to explain that outgoing UPCC president Raj Babbar was abroad and he had spoken to Lallu on phone to convey good wishes.Babbars letter to Lallu was also circulated to media persons to ensure that there were no misgivings.Senior leaders Nirmal Khatri, PL Punia and Pramod Tiwari too spoke about how the partys decision of aligning with the SP and BSP had damaged the party over the years.The Congress has not gained power in state since 1989 and has aligned both with the BSP and the SP in the past. AICC secretary Zubair Khan went to the extent of saying that under Priyankas leadership the party had a strong feedback mechanism and she would know about leaders who work for Congress in day and visit the SP and BSP leaders at night.First Published: Oct 11, 2019 23:15 IST"
2019-10-13,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/why-is-tsrtc-merger-with-government-not-happening/article29675217.ece,Why is TSRTC merger with government not happening,"Political hot potatoThe oft repeated words by ministers while reacting to the ongoing strike by the crew of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation these days is that the demand raised by the trade unions of RTC seeking merger of the corporation with the government was not in the election manifesto of the ruling TRS.The words assumed significance in the background of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao repeatedly harping in the glory of the government extending several welfare programmes for people that were not included in the manifesto.Interestingly, the government had released over a year ago a list of 76 programmes that were being implemented without finding place in the manifesto. They included the flagship programmes of government like Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima. By same standards, how can the demand for merger of corporation in the government become a taboo?Political affiliations exposedInstead of uniting the workers unions, the RTC strike has exposed the wide gap between the unions representing the crew and the staff of government departments. The joint action committee of RTC unions which is spearheading the agitation has not taken well the meeting of leaders of the joint action committee of gazetted and non-gazetted officers with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. The RTC staff view the meeting as an attempt to mortgage their self-respect.In this background, a meeting of two sides was arranged at the office of Telangana Non-Gazetted Officers Union at Nampally on Sunday. But, the RTC unions refused to attend at the last hour. The leaders of gazetted and non-gazetted officers unions waited at the office for two hours and later called off the scheduled meeting. The buzz was that the RTC unions gave no reason for not showing up.Bar on media at SecretariatThe shifting of secretariat to nearby Burgula Ramakrishna Rao Bhavan has become a cause of concern not just for the employees who are complaining about lack of facilities, but also for the media corps. This is not without a reason. There is strict no to entry of media on the premises, a development with rare precedents.Chief Secretary S.K. Joshi, however, claims it is the decision of the government and he has little relief to offer to the reporters resulting in their staging a silent protest in front of the BRKR Bhavan. The restrictions may, no doubt, be part of the governments prerogatives, but the Chief Secretary being the head of the State executive should be in the know of the things.He should have explained the media little more convincingly rather than straightaway dismissing journalists who called on him.Setting a fine precedent!When T. Harish Rao was made a member of the K. Chandrasekhar Rao Cabinet for the second time during the second week of September, he told his supporters and others who come to greet him not to bring bouquets and shawls but come with handloom towels and notebooks so that they are useful to the needy. Responding to the call, all those who went to greet him took handloom towels and notebooks and presented to him. The ministers office explained that the Minister had suggested those who come to greet him to bring handloom towels to help both the weavers who make them and poor students, to whom they would be distributed, who stay in hostels. Similarly, the notebooks to would be distributed among children studying in government schools. The response was tremendous, the ministers office said stating that the handlooms towels and notebooks presented to him would be distributed among the needy soon.(N. Rahul, M. Rajeev and B.

2019-10-13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/stall-owners-cash-in-on-pre-election-chai-pe-kharcha/articleshow/71562996.cms,Maharashtra elections: Stall owners cash in on pre-election chai pe kharcha,"Manohar Bhonsles stall near Dadars Shiv Sena Bhavan boasts VIP fansMUMBAI: A classic piece of Mumbai pantomime played out this Friday when MNS candidate Avinash Jadhav emerged from his bustling party office in Thane at a searing 2.30 pm. Even as he was talking on the phone, Jadhav crinkled his eyes in the direction of shopkeeper Rajesh Rahate and then compressed the air with his index finger and thumb. Sure enough, within seconds, a tiny conical white tea cup--brimming with sweet, buffalo-milk-based, ""non-acidic"" Pandharpur-style chai--landed in the MLA's free hand.""He (Jadhav) drops in at least five to six times a day,"" said a suddenly-reverential Rahate, whose month-old tea shop adjacent to the MNS office has not only been making close to Rs 7,000 instead of the standard daily average of Rs 6,000 the last few days but also has already won a VIP ambassador in Jadhav, who often recommends the Rs-10-per-glass homegrown beverage to others.As pairs of dull footwear multiply outside party offices in the run-up to the Vidhan Sabha elections chai is flowing as generously as charchas across the city. For chaiwallas and stall owners in the radius of outposts, this election fizz is making up for the festive lull between Navratri and Diwali.Among those celebrating is a tea stall owner inside Manohar Bhonsle's 37-year-old vada pao centre near Dadar's Shiv Sena Bhavan which famously binds estranged cousins and political rivals Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray in their gastronomical love of the working class snack. ""Every time there's a meeting, our business booms,"" said Lalji Patel, who runs the tea stall that dispatches around 70 cups of the Rs 10-worth hot milky beverage a day. ""Just yesterday,"" he added, ""I made 50 per cent more than what I make on a regular day.""While PM Narendra Modi's chaiwalla-to-prime-minister narrative has infused chai with political stardust of late, the beverage has long been the preferred fuel of the swarms of men in Modi jackets and all-whites looking to sustain themselves through endless meetings. Last year, in fact, an RTI reply alluded to this when it showed that the money spent on tea in CM Devedra Fadnavis' office had jumped by Rs 2 crore within a year, leading the Congress to allege a 'chai scam'.Many major party offices now boast their own coffee machines, pantries and contractual chai suppliers which means the neighbourhood chaiwalla is not being patronised as much by the pre-election all-white armies. ""Why would people prefer to have chai here when they get their tea inside for free?"" asked Mahesh, a no-nonsense chaiwalla opposite the NCP office in Ballard Pier.Then, there's the other problem peculiar to the Vidhan Sabha elections. ""Candidates are outside the city on rallies and the meetings are mostly done with. So, not many party workers come for chai or snacks,"" said a clerk at the Janta Dal political party office at Nariman Point which has offered the front portion of its premises to a 20-year-old tea and snacks stall. ""In fact, if you come on a Sunday, when our office is shut, this place is dead silent,"" the official added.The proximity to political hotspots pays in other ways though. When the BMC and the cops play villains, regularly fining chaiwallas or whisking away their equipment, party workers come to the rescue. ""The pheriwallas have to pay a hefty fine. Still they return to the spot, buy new equipment and go on. Where will they go? So we help them, "" says an official at a party office in Nariman Point, who recently made a case for a fruit seller hailing from Kolhapur at the Marine Drive police station.Typically, the men running the stalls outside party offices tend to be party workers. Some are even known to have the aura of secret keepers while others can brag about having entered the hearts of VIPs through the stomach. Sixty-two-year-old Manohar Bhonsle--whose vada pav stall in Dadar was born out of street food politics in 1982, a time when the Shiv Sena was trying to instil pride in the Marathi manoos through this home-grown burger--recalled that his seed capital had come from Raj Thackeray who had spotted his potato patties sizzling in a kadai perched precariously on a tiny table by the roadside. He called for me and handed me Rs 15,000 so that I could set up a proper shop, recalled Bhonsle, who attributes the popularity of his vadapaos to the ""magic"" in the hands of his wife who wakes up at 6 to pound the fiery, gavti-dhania-infused mix that lends the ""military batatas"" their fire.These days, while Uddhav Thackeray makes a customary pitstop at his kiosk for tea and bhajji on the way to a nearby temple, Raj Thackeray prefers to get his usual portion of vada pav packed for himself and his mother, and moong bhajji for his sister. Bhonsle's backdrop though is less a poster and more a billboard, that shows various stages of shaking hands and handing over flowers to Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. It was Manohar Bhonsle's VIP namesake and his biggest vada pao fan, Manohar Joshi, who introduced the stall owner to Bal Thackeray on his birthday at the Sena Bhavan many years ago. ""I was tongue-tied, recalled Bhonsle.If not for some unforeseen formatting that his laptop recently underwent, Neeraj Joshi, one of the many men in yellow running errands such as offering chai and sweets in the bustling BJP party office at Nariman Point, too would have shown you similar photos with everyone from Devendra Fadnavis to Yogi Adityanath. With those wiped out, all Joshi--who used to prepare chai for BJP politicians before he became an errand boy and who learnt the art from his grandfather--has now are memories. ""I even saw Amit Shah when he was the BJP president in 2014,"" said Joshi, who recalled fetching Shah a glass of milk with less sugar.Some chaiwallas, though, are estranged political neighbours. ""The leaders are fine but the men working under them never pay us. They have drowned my money many times,"" said Madan, a chaiwalla in Thane who has stopped serving the party office near him, does not have a local voting card and caters only to scrupulous office-goers instead. Dadar's Patel, on the other hand, senses that his political clients are not as close-fisted as they used to be. ""There's less dadagiri now,"" he said. ""Maybe because the PM is one of us."""

These days, hypertension has become quite common, and it must be noted that this disease often shows no distinctive symptoms. Hypertension, if left untreated or unmanaged, can increase the risk of heart diseases and stroke, says dietician Nmami Agarwal, founder & CEO, Nmami Life.AdvertisingShe adds that an appropriate dietary approach can be significant in managing high blood pressure with or without medications. The key foods that help in lowering blood pressure, as suggested by her, include:ALSO READ: World Hypertension Day 2019: Ayurvedic tips to manage hypertension1. Banana: Bananas are an excellent source of dietary potassium, a mineral that helps in regulating blood pressure levels. As per a scientific study, eating two bananas a day can help reduce blood pressure by 10 per cent.Advertising2. Green Leafy Vegetables: Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, lettuce, or mustard greens are a rich source of nitrates. Just one to two servings of nitrate-rich vegetables can reduce hypertension for up to 24 hours.3. Beetroot: Beetroot contains certain antioxidants that help in managing high blood pressure levels. The vegetable gets its red hue from anthocyanin, that emits blood pressure regulating action. Drinking one glass of beetroot juice is an effective remedy to combat high blood pressure levels. Beets contain another compound called nitric oxide which is also really effective to manage blood pressure.4. Oat Bran: Oat bran makes a very healthy choice for breakfast. It is loaded with the goodness of soluble fibre known as beta-glucan that can help in lowering blood pressure levels and also improving digestive health. Oats are also rich in potassium which is a significant mineral for blood pressure control.5. Sweet Potato: Sweet potatoes are definitely one of the best super foods to control high blood pressure. It is naturally rich in blood-pressure friendly fibre and is an excellent source of two essential minerals  magnesium and potassium. These minerals help to regulate blood pressure levels to a great extent.6. Flaxseeds: A lot of scientific studies have supported the fact that consumption of flaxseeds regularly can bring a significant improvement in high blood pressure levels. Eating flaxseeds regularly for six months can lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg and 7 mmHg, respectively.7. Walnuts: Walnuts are the only tree nut which are significantly higher in plant-based ALA (Alpha Linoleic Acid), which is the plant-based form of Omega-3 Fatty Acid. Regular consumption of walnuts has shown to improve blood flow. These are also loaded with healthy fats, magnesium, and fibre.8. Garlic: Garlic is rich in an essential sulphur compound known as allicin that has significant blood pressure-lowering benefits. About 600-900 mg of garlic powder can lead to about 9-12 per cent reduction in blood pressure levels.Another key point to remember is to cut back on salt consumption to the least, says Agarwal."

She has gone for a make over. Avika is just 22 but one feels shes been around for ages because shes been acting since the age of eight.. It has been almost three years since we saw her last in Ekkadiki Pothavu Chinnavada. Busy in Mumbai with television projects like Laado, Fear Factor, Khatra Khatra Khatra, Avika had also wrapped up a Hindi movie as a Banarasi girl dealing with a social issue. She has also featured in music video. Avika shares, It is basically a Punjabi song. Released recently, the Indo pop track is called Doggy and is about a guy trying to propose to a girl and a doghelping the romance. Singer Ishaan Khan is being launched with this song.About the long gap in Telugu films, she states that she didnt actually intend to take a break. She impressed with her performance in Uyyala Jampala and other films. She says, I am experiencing the kind of nervousness and excitement that I faced for my first film now. Whatever project touches my heart, I will do. It doesnt matter if it is a film, a television serial or a web series; I want to do all languages. As an actor it is important to go all out and try it. I wanted to be a part of Laado and it was impactful. A daily soap consumes 30 days and I was welcomed with open arms.Avika wasnt too happy with many Telugu projects she was offered before Raju Gari Gadhi 3. While she waited, she got a call from Ohmkar, she had a meeting with him and okayed the film almost instantly. She recalls, My dates were blocked in Mumbai and I heard Tamannah was the first choice for this role, then one day I was called for a narration and things moved briskly. I had no reason to say no. I got scared with every scene and I think audience will feel the same. I have never tried this genre so far and in this film you will see me screaming and yelling. I was so scared initially, I thought I would have sleepless nights. At home I always go under the blanket to see horror films but now I like this idea of scaring people. It is so much fun now.Avika lost a lot of weight  almost 15 to 16 kilograms and yet says she she still needs to lose more. Couple of years back she says she didnt feel confident enough to be on screen and went off the radar. She worked out, tried dancing and the results are gradually showing now. She shares, People called it a weight-loss journey but I say it is being fitter and confident. I am big foodie and I can't quit it easily especially my favourite potatoes. So I took a lot of time, controlled the portions I ate and exercised. The entire thing lasted a year or a year and a half.The actor relocated to Hyderabad a year ago as the projects she is now getting require her to stay here for a longer period. About upgrading her skills, she says she loves challenges. People have seen me since I was eight. The same kind of acting doesnt work. I havent learnt acting in a school and what I know is what I picked up on the way. Raju Gari Gadhi 3 is not my comfort zone, yet I did my best.Avika believes the future is in web series, and any day shed love to be home and watch them on her couch. So far she hasnt got any offer as such but as of now her focus is on the outcome of Raju Gari Gadhi 3 which she hopes will give a new dimension to her career."
2019-10-15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/vijayawada-takes-a-liking-for-arabian-cuisine/articleshow/71586763.cms,Vijayawada takes a liking for Arabian cuisine,"Arabian Mandi restaurantVIJAYAWADA: Two years ago, when the first Arabic restaurant opened its doors to welcome patrons, not many gave the eatery much chance of surviving in a place dominated by meat-and-potatoes, with some alcoholic beverages on the side. Two years later, the number of Arabic restaurants in the city has gone up to 10.Two of the eateries are on one street near the 4-star DV Manor hotel, while the first eatery to open on the street has moved to a larger area to meet the rush of customers. Competition is fierce between the eateries offering Arabian cuisine in the city, says M Nizamuddin, owner of Alfa Mandi, which moved from serving traditional biryani to its mandi variant.Arabic restaurants in the city mostly serve mandi biryani , which is the offering to the world at large from the poor and war-devastated country of Yemen in the Arabian peninsula. Each restaurant offers a regular portion of the mandi, made of basmati rice, topping it with a deep-fried chicken leg or a large piece of lamb.Our patrons largely prefer the chicken mandi. We sell about 200 plates of mandi biryani for lunch and another 200 platters at dinner time. The biryani is uniformly priced at all the Arabian restaurants to stop the cannibalisation of custom, the owner of Arabian Knights, another mandi restaurant , said.Asked how the folks in Vijayawada  who are known to stick to their eating habits with single-minded seriousness  developed a taste for Yemeni cuisine, given that many residents would find it difficult to point Yemen on a map, Nizamuddin said he found it difficult to attract customers in the first few months of opening the restaurant. But business has been growing steadily. Apart from Yemeni mandi, we also offer variants like Turkish mandi. The difference is in the spices we use to marinade the chicken and mutton in the biryani, he added. At first, the customers came in thinking they would be dining on the traditional chicken biryani that is served in the city. It took them a while to appreciate the taste of the mandi.The mandi restaurants dont push customers towards the lamb mandi. It is too much of a risk for us to go with the lamb mandi because some mischievous customer may start off a rumour that mandi eateries are serving beef on the quiet. We dont want our restaurants to collapse over such unfounded rumours, the owner of Arabian Kitchen restaurant said."

2019-10-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/discover-bengal-inspired-food-at-puducherrys-coromandel-cafe/article29699681.ece,When paturi gets a makeover,"In the French quarter of Puducherry, a British chef is using local produce to create Bengal-inspired food.I wouldnt call it Bengali, says Chef Jay Adams, with a nervous laugh. I would get into trouble... But it is an exciting project, using those flavours with locally grown ingredients. It is something different for Pondy, and is drawing a fresh audience to the caf.It all began when home cook and food consultant, Kolkata-based Iti Misra, collaborated with the team to create a menu for Durga Puja, in early October.At Coromandel Cafe, amidst the cheery buzz, weekend-trippers in shorts and suntans are scarfing down Itis spicy fish rolls dipped in kasundi, along with Jays signature pink tagliatelle.Iti, who has a graceful energy that fits in comfortably with the restaurants elegant setting, discusses the challenges of creating a Bengali pop-up in a European caf ambience, over large butterflied prawn fritters served with a tangy pomelo and cucumber salad. Instead of an elaborate course-by-course menu, Iti says they decided to create a short, versatile set of dishes that work for lunch, dinner and cocktail evenings.The result: reinterpretations of languorous Bengali meals, each thoughtfully curated, often with modern tweaks. I picked dishes that were typically Bengali, but also could be interpreted for this more Westernised space, says Iti. So she avoided fish with bones and highly spiced curries, for example, focussing instead on highlighting the intricacies of traditional flavours and juxtaposing them with local produce, to create a modern menu with an authentic Bengali heart.The spinach luchis, for example, came with a rich cholar dal, spicy baby potatoes, fried eggplant and a tamarind glaze. More traditional dishes included a prawn malai curry served with saffron pulao. And kosha mangsho with flaky parathas.Of course, there was Kolkatas favourite fish paturi, wrapped in a banana leaf, and served with crisp okra. And to snack on, banana flower rissoles with a powerfully fragrant smoked eggplant pure infused with mustard oil.Now that the pop-up is over, Jay and her team are reworking some of these dishes to fit them into the regular menu. It helps that Jay is a fan of the cuisine. I worked with Bengali chefs in the Andamans and immediately loved their food. Even something as simple as aubergines in mustard oil... I had never seen mustard oil before. It is such a unique flavour, she says, adding that kasundi is another favourite.Homage to pinkItis kosha mangsho stays on the menu, unaltered. The okra is now a Japanese-style crispy fried bhindi with beet pickled onions. There is a light cornflour batter to emphasise crispness, and a cheeky thread of pink running through the menu.The colour, a homage to the pink bungalow that Coromandel Cafe is housed in, is Jays signature and it resurfaces in the hot pink puris, bright with beetroot and served with spiced cauliflower. Itis sweet lime salad is now plated up like a garden, with green papaya, goat cheese and a hibiscus-lavender dressing topped with spicy lotus seeds.There are fish rolls filled with creamy, lemony mousse. And poppy seed aloo chops with sweet-and-sour beet pure, tinted with red wine.In the kitchen, the restaurants Bengali cooks were both delighted and surprised to see dishes from home being celebrated in their Pondy-style caf, known more for its banana French toast, steaks and fettuccine. They were really happy and proud, and I loved seeing that, says Jay. They definitely took charge with this menu, and I got to take a slight back seat, which was nice. While continental food is a bit alien, this is from their roots.Though the Bengali chefs did cook intuitively, because they knew just how these dishes should taste, Iti says that they still required coaching. Remember, these are the dishes that their mothers and aunts cook, she says, adding, Though they work in professional kitchens, they do not spend a lot of time in their own kitchens at home.Perhaps that will change. The enthusiastic response underlines the fact that Indian diners have a powerful, visceral response to food that is familiar, no matter which State it comes from. Good news for Indias many colourful, inventive micro cuisines.Coromandel Cafe is at La Maison Rose, 8 Romain Rolland Street, White Town, Puducherry. Items from the new menu start rolling out from this weekend. Call 0413 2221100 for details."
2019-10-17,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/lost-recipes-and-sustainability-at-jaipurs-gourmet-getaway/article29726748.ece,Lost recipes and sustainability at Jaipur’s Gourmet Getaway,"They were chefs, entrepreneurs, bakers and bartenders. They had travelled from Auroville and Goa, Dehradun and Delhi, Jaipur and Tuscany. They learnt some and taught some, through wine tastings and whisky tastings, masterclasses and workshops, book launches and sit-down lunches. But one evening, they all gathered to hear the giants of their industry talk about their work and its relationship with the planet.On Day Three of the five-day Gourmet Getaway in Jaipur, a smattering of food makers from around the country took a break from dinners and masterclasses to sit back, listen and question as chef and president of the Indian Federation of Culinary Associations Manjit Singh Gill, chef and World Chefs Without Borders ambassador Sudhir Sibal, food entrepreneur Rishi Agarwal, and ITC Rajputana executive chef Parul Kapoor hashed out the challenges of food wastage, sustainability, and quality maintenance.We waste nothing At the sunny, glass-topped Caf White Sage in Jaipur, Delhi-based chef Vanshika Bhatia struck a different chord than most, at her session on Day Two, talking about peels, scraps and leftovers before a crowd that hitherto had been exposed to gourmet coffees and Tuscan wines.Bhatia, who has already garnered a reputation for herself through her zero-waste kitchen in the national capital, put the focus on how every part of a plant, from rinds to leaves to stem, can be used in a kitchen.A number of things she did took her audience by surprise. Some of them were intriguing creations, like pickled leaves and condensed buttermilk. Others were habits and practices, like going through the contents of the dustbin to give diners an idea of wastage.The conversation, moderated by Ashish Chopra and dominated by Gill, was unsurprisingly focussed on the need to eat local and seasonal. While the onus for designing such menus was placed on chefs  and FnB managers have the responsibility of being in touch with food producers, like farmers and fishermen, said Sibal  Gill placed the onus of food wastage squarely on diners themselves.How can we waste food? the chef demanded, both on the dais and in an exclusive chat with MetroPlus later, Why would a five-star restaurant, or a roadside stall, want to throw away what makes their business? Kitchens treat each single potato as currency, as a five-rupee note. The math, from star properties to street food, is very systematic, he stresses  Food cost is budgeted; it is calculated every day. It is the nuts and bolts of the business.In the same vein, he explains, buying local and seasonal also makes economic sense to any food business. It is simply more cheap. But when guests demand watermelon juice in winters and cauliflower dishes in summers, when they want caterers to serve scores of dishes in unlimited portions for the sake of grandeur at weddings, or pile up plates with more than what they can eat at buffets, there is little that any kitchen can do to avoid wastage.The point of seasonality brought the conversation around to biocompatibility  how compatible the components of our food are with our systems and with living tissue. This was a point stressed by Agarwal, whose Cuttack-based Ayusla Caf focusses on Vedic food philosophies. There are essentially two priorities when it comes to food: nutrition and biocompatibility. Taste comes later, he stated. Biocompatibility depends not only on absence of chemicals in food, but also on the time of the year. As Gill explained, After the first monsoon showers, melons should be done away with. That is when the worms start creeping in, when you start needing fertilisers.Chef Parul Kapoor highlighted ways in which restaurants can still make use of leftover food  such as treat them to turn into manure  but the general observation was that methods like these end up costing much more than a simple, conscious avoidance of wastage. The onus, in conclusion, is on us and how we eat.Served in dessert jars The 10-month-old, plastic-free Akh Bar on the roof of Jaipurs Sarovar Premiere is all blue, gold, black and white. Sleek in the industrial style, it gives off that cosy, easy evening drink vibe even at 5.30 pm, when sunlight still filters in. At the 75 foot-long bar counter (touted to be the longest in Rajasthan) stands mixologist Virendra Singh.Singhs job for the evening is to teach attendees  including chefs, guests, and enthusiasts who have bought passes to attend the session  the basics of mixology and demonstrate a few of his signature drinks. On the counter are lined a number of ingredients, from the usual suspects like oranges and lime to a bright green homemade cucumber syrup, coriander powder, an empty beer can, and brightly coloured little clay pots and jars that resemble the ones found at the myriad local street stalls.The used and washed beer can is what he used to serve his signature Summer Breeze, a cocktail made of not just gin and tonic water, but also homemade cucumber syrup, fragrant basil syrup, and a number of ingredients that we will refrain from revealing.The other curious containers are for his other drinks, which include a good mix of quality alcohol, natural bitters and the kind of powders one would expect to see in kitchen cabinets instead of bar counters. Each of his drinks, however, hits the spot. Jaipur sees a mixed crowd, from foreigners who really know their alcohol to new drinkers who are looking to experiment. My job is to teach them all, he smiles.Nizams favourites in JaipurFor Fairmont Jaipurs chefs Sahil Sharma and Prasad Metrani, exploration trips are par for the course. The Fairmont team from all across India gets together every year to survey three parts of the country. We visit our team members hometowns, talk to their friends, look for family recipes... The idea is to look for foods that have been lost or forgotten by the mainstream.This tied in perfectly with Gourmet Getaway 2019s theme of lost recipes. So, diners  in Fairmonts sweeping, pink stone dining hall surrounded by arches and topped with giant brass lamps  were served the results of last years survey as the final offerings of the festival.One of the appetisers was tootak, that the team discovered last year in Hyderabad, during their attempt to understand the distinctions between Awadhi and Hyderabadi cuisine. The baked dish comprised semolina and khoya dough balls, pepper, cheese, saffron and rose water.Another Hyderabadi dish the team served was a delicate, ever-evolving Nargil shorba. Shorbas are generally broths made of coconut, chilli and coriander, explained Metrani. In this case, however, the shorba was poured over a bowl that already contained coconut foam (yes, just foam), a parmesan crisp and tempered pea shoots, all of which melted into the spoonfuls of shorba at their different paces, thus ensuring that the dish changed taste minute by minute.(The writer was in Jaipur at the invitation of Gourmet Getaway.)"
2019-10-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farmer-unions-demand-disclosure-of-deal-details-warn-it-will-ruin-local-producers-6075233/,"Farmer unions demand disclosure of deal details, warn it will ‘ruin’ local producers","THE ALL India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha (AIKMS) and Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta Dakaunda have expressed deep concern over the Centres move to permit massive imports of cheap agricultural and industrial products from ASEAN countries and China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea through the upcoming signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Participation (RCEP) free trade deal.AdvertisingAIKMS has demanded that the Centre immediately publicise all details of the 21 out of 25 clauses already agreed upon in the RCEP, and the four clauses that are still under consideration, and spell out the Indian stand on the same. It also demanded that all RCEP discussions be stalled and that the country withdraw from the final signing on November 4 until details have been disclosed and views considered by due process.AIKMS has urged all democratic and patriotic forces to rise in protest against this betrayal of nationalist interest by the Modi government.President of BKU Dakaunda Buta Singh Burajgill said that the RSS-BJP government has kept all details of the deal hidden from the Parliament, the state government and the people, even though agriculture is a state subject.AdvertisingAIKMS General Secretary Dr Ashish Mital said that it is a secret plan to allow free entry of cheap products from foreign countries into Indian markets and ruin local producers. It will affect Indian agricultural produce, small and medium industries, small traders, services like health, education and transport and also allow financial investments which will suit MNCs. It will also create a legal network to enforce restrictions on Indian producers on production of MNC patented products, allowing them to sue local producers, as was done by Pepsi to potato farmers in Gujarat, he added.The groups said that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has already announced reduction of taxes by half, from 30% to 15% for new investments from abroad. The PM has been trotting the globe offering cheap land, water, forest and mineral resources, cheap and unregulated labour to foreign investors, they added.Earlier, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN countries, Japan and South Korea, have already caused a deep loss to India and India has trade deficit with 11 of these 15 countries. It is $105 billion and is increasing. Trade deficit with South Korea is $12 billion, with Japan $7.9 billion and with China it is $53.4 billion. While the dairy sector, which provides income to crores of families is likely to suffer the most, seeds, spices, plantations, pulses, food grain, poultry, fertilisers and insecticides, chemicals, electronics, iron and steel, services, machinery, all shall be affected, the groups representatives said.The RCEP is a trade deal currently under negotiation to create an integrated market, making it easier for products and services of each of these countries to be available across this region."
2019-10-17,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/supremes-upper-crust-serves-a-combination-of-cuisines-from-continental-to-traditional-indian/article29725145.ece,Kochi gets a new multi-cuisine address,"When Kollam-based Supreme Food Company set up its first bakery in its home town in 1984, the best-sellers were bread and naadan snacks such as unniappam, achappam and others.Today, almost 30 years since, 12 bakeries and five restaurants later, their offerings extend well beyond these. Supreme opened its first outlet and restaurant, Upper Crust, in Kochi, earlier this year. The multi-cuisine restaurant offers continental, Mediterranean, Italian, Chinese and Indian food.The traverse from Kollam to Kochi took time, but Afsal Musaliar, managing director, says when they did finally come they wanted to do it properly.We wanted to showcase some of the best cuisines, combined with the concept of fine-dining, he says. Putting together the menu took more than three months and the chefs were trained by specialists. For Arabic food, for example, we brought a Syrian chef who worked with our chefs for a few months. The tasting, Afsal jokes, resulted in a few kilos gained.The restaurant, on the floor above Supreme Bakers, can seat close to 110. Large glass windows have dual advantagesa view of the NH Bypass and ample natural light. The result is a bright restaurant at daytime, and a good view at night.As we await our meal, Afsal tells us how, way back in the 1950s, his grandfather opened what was possibly the first mall in the heart of Kollama couple of theatres (Grand and Prince) and a few shops. In fact, he says, The beginnings of our involvement with food lay there, in the movie halls, where we maintained a canteen for cinema goers.The first dish to arrive is creamy payamutton soup. Made from leg of lamb, paya is considered healthy and wholesome. Different parts of the country have their own versions of paya, which literally means trotters. The soup, flavoured with coriander, is comfort food, with mutton bits that add heft and bite. Salads follow  fresh and crunchy fatoush with fried squares of pita, and a classic Caesar.Afsal says that most of the meats, especially lamb chops, beef and salmon are imported as the meat available locally doesnt suit their requirements. The beef medallion, which is steak served with a potato mash and grilled carrots, potatoes, and broccoli, is the signature dish. The meat is tender, and works well with mash, that lives up to its namecreamy mash. If beef is not your thing, try the then grilled salmon.The hand-tossed Pollo Alla Diavola pizza has a thin crust loaded with cheese, vegetables and chicken. Cannelloni, chicken-stuffed lasagna, and spaghetti Bolognese are a nod to Italian cuisine.What is multi-cuisine in Kerala without the ubiquitous Arabic? We try the opulent lamb ouzi: a portion is enough for a big family  the grilled lamb sits on a bed of flavoured rice. As much as a treat for the palate, it is one for the eyes as well. Stating that it is popular on weekends, Afsal says, on weekends we have specials such as whole grilled fish and chicken.All grilling is done on stones, charcoal is a strict no-no, says executive chef Shamon. The seafood platter too is massive, ideal for a family of four or five, offering obster, calamari, prawns and king fish.The dessert menu, given that there is an in-house patisserie, is lavish.Runs in the familyThe idea of Supreme Bakery was Najuma Musaliars, Afsals mother. She took the initiative and set the ball rolling. The family runs educational institutions, notable among them is Thangal Kunju Musaliar (TKM) College of Engineering in Kollam. The operations in Thiruvananthapuram are looked after by Afsals sister. The whole family is involved in the business. Although initially the menu had bread and traditional snacks, today it makes 10-15 varieties of the former and 60 varieties of the latter; 30 varietals of cookies, French pastries, patties, and Indian sweets. The Kochi store has a gourmet ingredient section. All the snacks are made in-house, nothing is outsourced. That way we have control over the quality. Halwas are very popular, made with either coconut oil or ghee, this is made the traditional way in urulis, on wood-fired stoves, stirred by hand. That is why we are able to maintain the confections taste. The company makes around 20 types. Nutrifud is another arm of the company."

The micro-biological analysis will also be done,"" Agarwal said.In the guidance note released for food business operations, the FSSAI has suggested ways to ensure shelf-life of sweets, check the quality by looking at the texture and flavour, besides providing consumer tips to test adulterants.On shelf-life of sweets, the regulator has said 'kalakand and its variants' should be kept at room temperature and consumed on the same day, while 'ladoo and khoya sweets' can be consumed within 4 days and 'sweets with ghee and dry fruits' to be consumed within 7 days of the manufacturing.The FSSAI has provided simple methods for consumers to check adulterant blotting paper used in 'rabri' and coal tar dyes in ghee, cottage cheese and milk powder, while mashed potatoes and other starches used in ghee."
2019-10-18,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/all-about-sustainability-foraging-and-a-bottle-of-gin/article29737758.ece,"All about sustainability, foraging and a bottle of gin","The gin-aissance refuses to die down  from being considered a ladies drink to becoming the hottest spirit in the bar world in the past few years, theres no doubt that gin is in. India has emerged as the fifth largest gin consumer in the world so its no surprise that the market is moving beyond the mass brands and introducing consumers to artisanal, often small-batch gins from around the world.One of the newer entrants is The Botanist, a super-premium, artisanal dry gin distilled on the wild Hebridean island of Islay in Scotland. The gin owes its layered complexity to the 22 hand-foraged botanicals that go into it, from typical Scottish ones like gorse and heather to meadowsweet, chamomile, and three different types of mint. The gin is trickle-distilled in the worlds last surviving Lomond spirit still, modified to slow down the distillation process, explained Caitlin Hill, award-winning mixologist and South Africas Gin Queen who is the brand ambassador for Rmy Cointreau (which owns The Botanist brand). Hill was in India recently to judge The Botanist Wild 22 competition, which was held in Goa in August, this year. Twenty-two selected bartenders from across India participated in an immersive three-day experience, which saw them foraging for wild botanicals to create a signature gin cocktail.Into the wildForaging for ingredients was made trendy by Noma in Copenhagen and soon became quite the rage, especially in the world of New Nordic restaurants. It was only a matter of time before it made an appearance on the cocktail scene. As a bartender or a bar-owner you look for ways in which you can set yourself apart and foraging is a great way of doing exactly that. Theres a lot of effort required for successful foraging, much more than just going to buy botanicals from a store or calling a supplier, said Hill. Judging the competition was Matt Whiley, an acclaimed bartender who owns several bars, including Scout London (No. 28 on the Worlds 50 Best Bars 2018 list) and Scout Sydney. Whiley has won multiple awards and was most recently awarded the European Bartender of the Year at the Mixology Bar Awards 2019. Both Hill and Whiley are enthusiastic proponents of foraging, with Whileys London & Sydney bars both focusing on sustainability and using foraged ingredients in their menu of inventive craft cocktails. Foraging is about celebrating what we have in our backyard, we overlook that all the time, said Whiley.The bartenders got a crash course in foraging on day one at Cazulo Feni Distillery in Cansaulim in South Goa. Surrounded by beautiful garrafes (handmade large-bellied glass bottles traditionally used for stocking feni) in the worlds first feni cellar, Cazulos second-generation distiller Hansel Vaz spoke about Goas rich wild produce. Goa was a major port for centuries, and the Portuguese who were keen agriculturists brought with them all sorts of plants, fruits and flowers. Some of them like potatoes, tomatoes, guava, pineapple, etc. reached the rest of India but there are many botanicals that are known only here like different cherries, local limes, etc., he said. Vazs distillery is surrounded by a wild farmland and we followed him on a trail as he pointed out pepper, bay leaves, nutmeg, betel, turmeric, allspice, cashew, breadfruit, and several other plants. The idea is to open up your eyes and train your senses to figure out how you can use these botanicals, whether its the fruits, flowers, or leaves, shared Vaz.Wilder stillOn day two, we accompanied the bartenders to another, larger and decidedly wilder farm also in South Goa. Here, father-and-son duo Laban and Kevin de Souza split the bartenders into two groups and guided them into the wild. The foraged bounty ranged from citron, passion fruit, star fruit, kokum, and hog plums (locally known as ambade) to rare findings like soursop and noni fruit (both of which purportedly cure several ailments, from cancer to diabetes). Apart from the fruits, spices like pepper, allspice, fennel, and cinnamon, and leaves like betel, ginger, lemongrass, etc. found their way into the bartenders kitty. We also encountered a toddy tapper who effortlessly shimmied up a palm tree and brought down freshly tapped toddy for us to taste. Hill was especially fascinated with it; If I had to design a cocktail, I would probably carbonate the toddy, add a citrus element, and of course some Botanist gin, she said.Cocktail hourOn day three, the bartenders assembled at Firefly, Goas hottest new party spot, to battle it out for the title of The Botanist Wild One. The bar was decked out with bottles of The Botanist Gin and the judges milled about (apart from Hill amd Whiley, the competition was judged by celebrity chef Vicky Ratnani, and Goa-based artisanal bread-maker Sujit Sumitran). The dance floor was set up with tables where the bartenders were hard at work with their prep  blending, sous-viding, shaking, stirring, and tasting  as they perfected their drink. Every table was brimming with foraged ingredients  fruits, leaves, roots, et al. Im using allspice leaves infused in choriz fat, star fruit and Goan limes to make my cocktail, B-Town, said Rahul Raghav, Bar Manager at The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro.At another table, Bengaluru-based mixologist Karthik Kumar who is the Director of Beverages at Big Brewsky Brewing Company was tenderising octopus with pepper leaves. I want to bring the connect between the land and the sea with the foraged leaves and this octopus. Im calling my drink Wild & Sea, he explained. Working on adjoining tables, JW Marriott Mumbai Sahars bar and beverage manager Sarita Sharma and Goa-based mixologist and bar consultant Evgenya Prazdnik were both using passion fruit to produce two rather distinct drinks.The competition began with the contestants unleashing their creativity not just with the drinks but also by presenting bar snacks with foraged ingredients (like the breadfruit chips with hog plum dip served by Sharma) and even making coasters with pressed leaves & flowers. Im interested in the bartenders techniques and Im really looking forward to what stories they have to tell, said Hill. For Whiley, it was all about the taste; More than anything else, the cocktail has to taste great; everything else that goes around it is good but if it doesnt taste great youre going to be let down, he said.The judges declared Evgenya Prazdnik as the winner for her cocktail Jungle Calling, which blended the earthy notes of The Botanist Gin with the tart flavours of passion fruit, star fruit, and local limes, all foraged from the farm the previous day. The chilli oil garnish at the end brought a nice balance and an attractive finish to the cocktail. Prazdnik will now head to Islay in March 2020 for the international competition.The Botanist is available at leading restaurants in in the city like The Bombay Canteen, Toast & Tonic, Americano, Qualia, etc. and retails at  6150 (700-ml bottle, ex-Mumbai)."

Such dairy products are more susceptible to adulteration during festival season particularly due to mismatch in demand and supply, the regulator said.We have started a surveillance exercise on milk products during the festival season in Delhi-NCR. 44 locations have been identified and samples are being collected and sent to our national lab at Ghaziabad, Agarwal told reporters while releasing the milk survey.AdvertisingThe samples will be tested until November 3 and the results will be announced in the first week of next month.The purpose of this exercise is to know adulteration in milk products and what kind of contaminants are present. Micro-biological analysis will also be done, Agarwal said.In the guidance note released for food business operations, the FSSAI has suggested ways to ensure shelf-life of sweets, check quality by looking at the texture and flavour, besides providing consumer tips to test adulterants.On shelf-life of sweets, the regulator has said kalakand and its variants should be kept at room temperature and consumed on the same day, while ladoo and khoya sweets can be consumed within 4 days and sweets with ghee and dry fruits to be consumed within 7 days of the manufacturing.The FSSAI has provided simple methods for consumers to check adulterant blotting paper used in rabri and coal tar dyes in ghee, cottage cheese and milk powder, while mashed potatoes and other starches used in ghee."

Here's why,"more-lifestyleUpdated: Oct 19, 2019 14:34 ISTConsuming potato puree instead of commercial carbohydrate gel gives the same result to athletes for sustaining blood glucose levels during long workout sessions, claims a study.Research has shown that ingesting concentrated carbohydrate gels during prolonged exercise promotes carbohydrate availability during exercise and improves exercise performance, said University of Illinois kinesiology and community health professor Nicholas Burd, who led the research.Our studys aim was to expand and diversify race-fuelling options for athletes and offset flavour fatigue. Potatoes are a promising alternative for athletes because they represent a cost-effective, nutrient-dense and whole-food source of carbohydrates, continued Burd.Furthermore, they serve as a savoury race fuel option when compared (with) the high sweetness of (carbohydrate) gels, added Burd in the study published in the journal of Applied Physiology.The scientists recruited 12 participants who were healthy and devoted to their sport, averaging 165 miles (267 kilometres) per week on their bicycles. All had been training for years. To qualify for the trials, the cyclists had to reach a specific threshold for aerobic fitness and complete a 120-minute cycling challenge followed by a time trial.Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions during the experiments: They would consume either water alone, a commercially available carbohydrate gel or an equivalent amount of carbohydrates obtained from potatoes.The researchers standardised what the 12 cyclists ate for 24 hours before repeating the 120-minute cycling challenge and time trial, which was designed to mirror typical race conditions.Throughout the exercise, the team measured participants blood glucose, core body temperature, exercise intensity, gastric emptying, and gastrointestinal symptoms.The researchers also measured concentrations of lactate, a metabolic marker of intense exercise, in participants blood.We found no differences between the performance of cyclists who got their carbohydrates by ingesting potatoes or gels at recommended amounts of about 60 grams per hour during the experiments, Burd said.Both groups saw a significant boost in performance that those consuming only water did not achieve, added Burd.Plasma glucose concentrations went up by a similar amount in those consuming potatoes and gels. Their heart rates increased by a similar amount over the water-only cyclists and they were speedier on the time trial.Those consuming potatoes experienced significantly more gastrointestinal bloating, pain and flatulence than the other groups, however. This may be a result of the larger volume of potatoes needed to match the glucose provided by the gels, Burd said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Also, the garlic prices have caused the housewives' expenses to double.According to official data, the inflation rate of vegetable soared to 15 per cent in September and vegetable prices at retail shops doubled.Despite the government's attempts to control onion and tomato prices, in big cities, onion is available at more than Rs 50 per kg while tomato is touching the Rs 60-80 per kg level. Garlic prices are Rs 250-300 per kg, while those of green vegetables are also getting costly. Amid this, the staple potato is also started increasing in price.""I am paying more than Rs 1,000 these days for a quantity of vegetables that I was getting in Rs 500 two months back. It has changed my kitchen budget,"" said Sarika, a housewife and resident of Mandawali in east Delhi.She said prices of green vegetables like cauliflower and pointed gourd have gone up along with onion, tomato and garlic.According to the list of prices available at the website of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, onion price in the retail market in Delhi was Rs 52 per kg on Friday, while on September 18, it was at Rs 52 per kg. However, during this month, the prices of onion jumped up to Rs 60 per kg, the data showed.As per this pricelist, tomato retail price on Friday was Rs 56 per kg while on September 18, it was Rs 36 per kg. Hence, the tomato is still Rs 20 costly as compared to last month while in the last few days, it jumped up to Rs 60 per kg.In a statement, the Ministry on Friday said that the Mother Dairy has assured not to sell tomato at more than Rs 55 per kg at its Safal outlets.According to the officials, the price list of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, the wholesale price of onion at Azadpur market on Friday was Rs 17.50-35 per kg while the supply was 703.5 tonnes. Also, the wholesale price of tomato was Rs 12-40 per kg and supply was 349.7 tonnes.Potato's wholesale price in Azadpur market was Rs 6-24 per kg while its supply was 1,478.1 tonnes.""In the main supplier states of onion and tomato, water level has come down in the field, hence, an increase in the supply is expected,"" said an official of the APMC.The retail inflation data released this week said that the inflation rate of vegetables was soared to 15.40 per cent in September against the corresponding period last year while the inflation rate of food goods increased 5.11 per cent."

Borrowing heavily from the cooking styles of China, Tibet and, of course, India, it manages to hold its own, thanks to its earthy taste.Chef Anil Bangwal of YetiThe Himalayan Kitchen in Connaught Place in Delhi, says, Nepali cuisine is not about finesse or subtle flavours. The food traces its roots to the villages where people believe in using fresh ingredients and tempering the food with chillies.While it does share similarities with Indian cuisinelike the ingredients we usethere are a lot more differences. Indian cuisine depends on ground spices and khada garam masala, while Nepali food is flavoured with everything fresh.Set against the backdrop of the Himalayas, Nepal boasts an array of ethnicities. This diversity is reflected in the countrys cuisine. Also, the fact that the country only opened up its borders in the 1950s, adds to the focus on locally grown produce.Mustard oil is the chosen medium of cooking and curd is the most common accompaniment, which finds its way into drinks (lassi) as well as desserts (sikarni). Other common ingredients that people of this countryespecially the Newar communityuse, are lentils, potato, tomato, coriander, chilli, peppers, and garlic. In fact, daal-bhaat-tarkari is a perhaps the most common meal in Nepal, as chapatis do not find favour here.Considered a healthier counterpart to its rich Indian cousinfresh herbs, watery soup-like gravies, and chopped taste enhancers such as coriander, garlic and chillies, rather than ground pastesNepali cuisine relies on the simple methods to achieve outstanding flavours.Momos or their sweetened versionyomarisare another staple here and can be found with various fillings. Raw noodles or wai wai are a popular snack and can be spiced as per taste. Perhaps two extremes and at the same time very important items in a daily meal in Nepal arepotato and buffalo meat.One can be expected to have quite a bit of either or both during a typical week-long stay in this Himalayan country.Though not yet hugely popular in Delhiwhere foodies tend to go for their trademark butter chicken or biryani and kebabsNepali food is slowly gaining ground. Yeti co-partner Goumtesh Singh is doing his bestand successfully tooto win over patrons. He says, The response is overwhelming. Since the palate is so close to the food that we eat at home, the dining experience is more enjoyable.While momos and daal-bhaat may be common in the Indian kitchen too, other Nepali must-haves offer an adventurous journey for the palate. For those with a sweet tooth, try the sel roti, Nepals version of the doughnut, though not as sweet.Also, this tiny country loves its greens, from fresh spinach to fermented leafy greens known as gundruk, which is common accompaniment with meals, on the lines of the Indian aam ka achaar. Your Nepali food journey would be incomplete without the dhidoa cross between porridge and halwa. A savoury dish made of maize and buckwheat, it is often eaten as a main course. So if you thought there was no novelty in trying Nepali food because it was as good as Indian, maybe its time you headed to that charming eatery serving Nepali cuisine in your city."

She is also blissfully unaware that one Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee is now the toast of the town.But years before the Swedish academy conferred the award on Banerjee, she and other residents of Mollapara village in South 24 Parganas had been awed by the noble deeds of a baro babu who had taught them the importance of saving and inspired many to quit odd jobs and turn entrepreneurs.It was in 2012 that not one but two Nobel laureates visited Mollapara in Baruipur block. Abhijit Banerjee and French national Esther Duflo had easily mingled with the villagers, never making them feel as though they were any different. The duo were yet to tie the knot. They visited the village thrice on a CSR programme of Bandhan, then a microfinance institution, that offered poor villagers a means of livelihood.He came across as a simple person. He and a bideshini entered the hut, sat on the floor, had tea with muri-chanachur and spoke to us in Bengali. The difference between him and us was apparent not in his behaviour but in the things he said. He opened new vistas by making us realise the need for banking and ways to convert small capital into bigger assets. It is because of what he said that I gave up the job of a daily labourer and started my own business of stitching garments. Whatever I am today, I owe it to him and the others who had accompanied him, said Rehana, a mother of three.Back then, Rehana was neck-deep in debt. Saddled with a mentally challenged husband, she was struggling to make ends meet and had even stopped sending her kids to school. But Banerjee and Duflo directed her and the others towards a better way of life. The NGO  Bandhan Konnagar  provided her with a stitching machine that gave her the impetus to start a garments business. She now employs six women from the village and sells her garments at markets in Metiabruz and Garden Reach in Kolkata.Banerjee and Duflo had partnered Bandhan to apply Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) in villages of Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan. Between March and August 2012, Banerjee travelled to multiple villages in South 24 Parganas, championing the model and explaining its benefits to villagers.I remember him (Banerjee) vividly. I was attending a meeting when he asked me why I looked upset. I told him that my daughter was suffering from an unknown fever for several days. He asked me if we use mosquito nets at home. When I told him we didnt have money to buy one, he immediately gave money to one of his colleagues who bought a net and gave it to me. I cant forget his generosity, said Nasmina Mistry, 36, a resident of the same village, who sells milk and also runs a garments business.The model Banerjee and Bandhan were then working on focused on identifying the poorest of poor in select villages, helping them start their own businesses, teaching them tricks of the trade, inspiring them to become entrepreneurs and drilling into them the need to save to increase their assets.Abhijit Banerjee was so simple in his approach that he could interact with the villagers and explain the concept better than us. Esther madam, too, was extremely polite and took keen interest in the work. Ill never forget her because she had tea with potato chips, not biscuits, said Arunava Chakraborty, breaking into a smile.Another village that Banerjee visited twice was Fuldubi. Here, 42-year-old Noorbanu Bibi, instantly recollets the twin visits. I dont remember the name of the tall handsome man with a charming smile but he made me understand how I could make a huge difference by saving even Rs 5 a day. Today, I have saved enough to buy jewellery for my daughters wedding and still have Rs 20,000 in my bank account, said Noorbanu, who now sells imitation jewellery and readymade garments.Targetting the Hardcore Poor (THP) was one of our flagship programmes and the role Abhijit Banerjee played in shaping this model is irrefutable. Even now we continue to support such underprivileged women in Bengal and help them with assets, business training and teach them the importance of saving, said Arijit Dutta, executive director, Bandhan-Konnagar.The NGO, which helped over 90,000 poor villagers stand on their feet across 12 states, has since wrapped up their programme in the South 24 Parganas villages where Banerjee and Duflo carried out their RCTs, but a visit by TOI seven years later found the beneficiaries leading a life less tough and more economically sound."

2019-10-20,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-iglas-sections-of-jats-back-bsp-candidate/article29747781.ece,"In Iglas, sections of Jats back BSP candidate","In a first, Jats of the Iglas reserved constituency are joining hands with the Bahujan Samaj Party to take on the BJP in the upcoming bypoll on October 21. In the last week, two panchayats were organised in Tochhigarh and Dhantoli, the biggest villages of the constituency, where Jat leaders advocated support to BSP candidate Abhay Kumar Bunty, a Jatav. In the panchayats, Mr. Kumar garlanded the portrait of former Prime Minister Charan Singh and the Jat leaders put the traditional turban on his head.The move, locals say, is necessitated by the anger caused by the cancellation of papers of the Samajwadi Party-supported Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Suman Diwakar.Yogis ralliesFeeling the heat, the BJP is taking no chances with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath holding two rallies in the constituency. Three State Cabinet Ministers were also pressed into service in what earlier appeared just a bypoll for the ruling party.On Friday, Mr. Adityanath invoked the names of Charan Singh and Raja Mahendra Pratap along with PM Narendra Modi to garner votes for BJP candidate Raj Kumar Sahyogi, also a Jatav.RLD leader Jatin Chaudhary, who organised the panchayats, told The Hindu that Iglas was traditionally a party bastion. He alleged the BJP poll managers were responsible for the last-minute disqualification of the RLD candidate. They created pressure on the administration. By supporting the BSP, we want to send a strong message to the BJP and the party leadership, he said, expecting the support of 60%-70% of the 1.25 lakh-odd Jat voters in a constituency of 3,75,813 voters.The BSP candidate criticised the anti-farmer policies of the U.P. government, particularly the rise in electricity charges and menace of stray cattle. They have turned the farmer into a watchman, said Mr. Kumar, adding the potato farmers in the area were not getting the right price and being forced to throw away their produce, but the CM instead spoke about the expansion of a sugarcane mill in Mawana (Meerut) during a rally.Mr. Chaudhary lamented the harvesting of Hindu sentiments of farmers by the BJP. He said most farmers used to sell male calves to slaughterhouses since most of them use tractors these days. It seems the Opposition is not fighting against Mr. Sahyogi but is in a fight with the views the Prime Minister has injected into many of us. The dilution of Article 370 has no relevance to the bypoll but still, the BJP is selling it to farmers, he said.Ramveer Singh, pradhan of Karmawali village, admitted there was a time when most local socio-political fights in the region were between the RLD and the BSP workers or, simply put, between Jats and Jatavs. But with the BSP being out of power for almost a decade, the partys support base has whittled, he said.Changing social equationWhen the constituency was delimited, the Jat leadership lost its significance. So the Jat decided to put his lathi (stick) into a corner and decided to pick up the spade and gave a pen to his child. This changed the social equation to an extent, analysed Ram Kumar Singh, a senior advocate.The Jat supporters of the BJP talk of corruption-free recruitment of constables in police, a major source of employment in the region. During the rule of previous governments, anybody who was not a Yadav or a Jatav had to pay a bribe, said Prempal Sikatra, a farmer from Tehra village.A seasoned RSS worker who runs a family shoe shop in Aligarh, Mr. Sahyogi, BJP insiders say, lacks the charisma that electoral politics requires. Thats why the leadership is not taking any chances, said a senior leader.With chants of Banke Bihari and Jai Shri Ram echoing in the air, Mr. Sahyogi said Mr. Modi and Mr. Adityanath were trying to bring Ram Rajya back with schemes that have led to social inclusion of the marginalised sections.At Paharipur village, Aarti, a Dalit girl pursuing her graduation, responded with sab sahi hai (all is well) to most questions about the social fabric and government schemes. We havent received the promised 2,000 under the PM Kisan scheme but I keep going to the officials. We cannot afford to get the cylinder we got under the Ujjwala scheme refilled every month, so we use it sparingly. We cant depend on any government. We have to make our own destiny, she said."
2019-10-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/potato-carbohydrate-gels-energy-gels-study-endurance-training-running-cycling-6079897/,Feel tired while exercising? Eating this food will help keep energy levels high,"New research suggests that consuming potato puree in between exercising works just as well as a commercial carbohydrate gel in sustaining blood glucose levels and boosting performance in trained athletes.AdvertisingNotably, carbohydrate gels or energy gels promote recovery and are commonly used in endurance events such as running, cycling, and triathlons.ALSO READ | Exercise can help you think better: StudyThe research has shown that ingesting concentrated carbohydrate gels during prolonged exercise promotes carbohydrate availability during exercise and improves exercise performance, said studys lead author Nicholas Burd, professor at the University of Illinois in the US.Our study aim was to expand and diversify race-fuelling options for athletes and offset flavour fatigue, Burd said.AdvertisingPotatoes are a promising alternative for athletes because they represent a cost-effective, nutrient-dense and whole-food source of carbohydrates, the researchers reported in the Journal of Applied Physiology.Furthermore, they serve as a savoury race fuel option when compared with the high sweetness of carbohydrate gels.The researchers recruited 12 participants who were healthy and devoted to their sport, averaging 165 miles per week on their bicycles.To qualify for the trials, the cyclists had to reach a specific threshold for aerobic fitness and complete the 120-minute cycling challenge followed by a time trial.Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions during the experiments: they would consume either water alone, a commercially available carbohydrate gel or an equivalent amount of carbohydrates obtained from potatoes.The researchers standardised what the 12 cyclists ate for 24 hours before repeating the 120-minute cycling challenge and time trial, which was designed to mirror typical race conditions.Throughout the exercise, the team measured participants blood glucose, core body temperature, exercise intensity, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal symptoms.ALSO READ | Looking to burn maximum calories? Try these workoutsThe researchers also measured concentrations of lactate, a metabolic marker of intense exercise, in participants blood.We found no differences between the performance of cyclists who got their carbohydrates by ingesting potatoes or gels at recommended amounts of about 60 grams per hour during the experiments.Both groups saw a significant boost in performance that those consuming only water did not achieve, Burd added.AdvertisingAccording to the study, plasma glucose concentrations went up by a similar amount in those consuming potatoes and gels."
2019-10-22,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/for-trump-the-dealmaker-troop-pullouts-without-much-in-return-6081408/,"For Trump the dealmaker, troop pullouts without much in return","Written by Peter BakerAdvertisingThe Taliban have wanted the United States to pull troops out of Afghanistan, Turkey has wanted the Americans out of northern Syria, and North Korea has wanted them to at least stop military exercises with South Korea.President Donald Trump has now to some extent at least obliged all three  but without getting much of anything in return. The self-styled dealmaker has given up the leverage of the United States military presence in multiple places around the world without negotiating concessions from those cheering for U.S. forces to leave.For a president who has repeatedly promised to end the endless wars, the decisions reflect a broader conviction that bringing troops home  or at least moving them out of hot spots  is more important than haggling for advantage. In his view, decades of overseas military adventurism has only cost the country enormous blood and treasure, and waiting for deals would prolong a national disaster.AdvertisingBut veteran diplomats, foreign policy experts and key lawmakers fear that Trump is squandering U.S. power and influence in the world with little to show for it. By pulling troops out unilaterally, they argue, Trump has emboldened Americas enemies and distressed its allies. Friends like Israel, they note, worry about U.S. staying power. Foes like North Korea and the Taliban learn that they can achieve their goals without having to pay a price.Its hard for me to divine any real strategic logic to the presidents moves, said John P. Hannah, a senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. The only real connective tissue I see is the almost preternatural isolationist impulse that he invariably seems to revert to when left to his own devices internationally  even to the point that it overrides his supposed deal-making instincts.Reuben E. Brigety II, a former Navy officer and ambassador to the African Union under President Barack Obama who now serves as dean of the Elliott School for International Affairs at George Washington University, said just as worrisome as the decisions themselves was the seemingly capricious way they were made.Trump, he said, often seems more interested in pleasing autocrats like Kim Jong Un of North Korea and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey than in organizing any kind of coherent policymaking process to consider the pros and cons.When he canceled the South Korea military exercises, the only person he consulted was Kim Jong Un, Brigety said. The decision to abandon the Kurds came after a brief phone call with Erdogan. So they werent taken because he had personally reflected on the strategic disposition of American forces around the world. They were taken after he took the counsel of strongmen over that of his own advisers.All the complaints from the career national security establishment, however, carry little weight with Trump, who dismisses his critics as the same ones who got the country into a catastrophic war in Iraq. While that may not be true in all cases, Trump makes the case that 18 years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, it is time to pull out even without extracting trade-offs in return.When I watch these pundits that always are trying to take a shot, I say  they say, What are we getting out of it?  Trump told reporters Monday as he hosted a Cabinet meeting. You know what were getting out of it? Were bringing our soldiers back home. Thats a big thing. And its going to probably work. But if it doesnt work, youre going to have people fighting like theyve been fighting for 300 years. Its very simple. Its really very simple.The United States has about 200,000 troops stationed around the world, roughly half of them in relatively less dangerous posts in Europe or Asia where U.S. forces have maintained a presence since the end of World War II. Tens of thousands of others are deployed in the Middle East, although only a fraction of them are in the active war zones of Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.It took only a few dozen Special Forces operators near the border in northern Syria to deter Turkey from assaulting Americas Kurdish allies there, but soon after Trump talked with Erdogan on Oct. 6, the president announced on a Sunday night that they would be pulled back. Turkey then launched a ferocious attack on the Kurds, and by the time a convoy of U.S. troops moved away over the weekend, they were shown in a widely circulated video being pelted by angry Kurds throwing potatoes to express their sense of betrayal.Trump did not ask Erdogan for anything in exchange. Instead, the diplomacy came only after the Turkish incursion began when he sent Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara to broker a cease-fire to give the Kurds time to evacuate a new safe zone to be controlled by Turkey along the Syrian border. Erdogan essentially got what he wanted.In Afghanistan, Trumps special envoy spent months negotiating a peace agreement with the Taliban militia that would provide guarantees that the country would not be used as a base for terrorist attacks against the United States if it reduced its troop presence to around 8,600. The talks fell apart, but Trump is drawing down U.S. forces anyway, pulling out 2,000 troops in the past year, leaving 12,000 to 13,000. Plans are to keep shrinking the force to around 8,600 anyway.In Asia, Trump voluntarily canceled traditional large-scale joint military exercises with South Korea at the behest of Kim even though the two have yet to reach any kind of concrete agreement in which North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons. The decision frustrated not only allies like South Korea and Japan but senior U.S. diplomats and military officers, who privately questioned why North Korea should be given one of its key demands without having to surrender anything itself.Trump is a win-lose negotiator, said Wendy R. Sherman, a former undersecretary of state under Obama who helped broker the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned last year. Thats what he did as a real estate developer. He doesnt see the larger landscape, the interconnections, the larger costs, the loss of greater benefits.When he has sat down at the negotiating table, Trumps record on the world stage has been mixed or incomplete. He has sealed an accord to update NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, revised a free-trade agreement with South Korea and reached a limited trade pact with Japan.But in addition to the collapse of the Afghan talks, he has gotten nowhere in nuclear negotiations with North Korea, made no progress in a long, drawn-out Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, has yet to even reach the table with Iran despite his stated desire and remains locked in a high-stakes, big-dollar negotiation with China over tariffs.For Trump, though, the desire to end the endless wars, as he puts it, may override his instinct for deal-making. He talks repeatedly about the misery of families whose loved ones have been killed in the Middle East or elsewhere, and he seems to put decisions about deployments in a different category than trade deals or other negotiations. Getting them out of harms way is an end to itself.AdvertisingWere going to bring our soldiers back home, Trump said Monday. So far, there hasnt been one drop of blood shed during this whole period by an American soldier. Nobody was killed. Nobody cut their finger. Theres been nothing. And theyre leaving rather, I think, not expeditiously  rather intelligently."

This is the only reason that the Turkish cuisine is fast making its name on the worldwide culinary platform.An important aspect of Turkish cuisine is whether a dish has meat in it or not. When a dish is cooked without any meat then its called zeytin yal which means cooked with olive oil, and are mostly served cold.The highlights of Turkish vegetarian and vegan cuisine are dolma and sarma, in which just about everything can be stuffed. The cuisine tends to be olive oil-based, giving an extra light flavour to so many delicious fresh veggies.Here are five delicious Turkish vegan dishes that you should surely savour Mucver just means fritters in general, and these are zucchini fritters with feta cheese, onion, and dill. The zucchini is either shredded or finely chopped and then fried in olive oil, typically with a touch of red pepper flakes sprinkled on top to give it just the slightest hint of a kick to it. It can be made with or without egg and depends on your taste.

Different recipes call for rice, onions, currants, and pine nuts, and its often eaten around a piece of lettuce, cabbage, or vine leaves. Veggies can be thrown in as well, like peppers, zucchini, tomatoes or eggplants. But traditionally, its just a load of herbs and spices with possibly some tomato and pepper paste for a real burst of flavour with every bite.Its a bulgur-based salad made with tomato paste, finely diced tomatoes, parsley, and garlic, and looks very similar to Tabbouleh salad. Dry onions or spring onions are both fairly common, and so are cucumbers chopped as finely as the tomatoes. Lemon and olive oil are usually used as dressings, though many regions use pomegranate syrup (nar eksisi). Its served often for celebratory occasions and always with a cup of Turkish tea as well.Vine leaves are usually stuffed using rice, onions, currants and pine nuts along with veggies. As rolling out the stuffed vine leaves can be difficult, its often a rite of passage for children or a bonding experience as all the family gets together and stuffs their food together before devouring the delicious food.These are amongst the most common dishes and an excellent source of protein for vegans looking around for something new to try!(With inputs from ANI)"

Read MoreBAGHDAD: US troops leaving Syria and heading to neighboring Iraq do not have permission to stay in the country, Iraq's military said Tuesday as American forces continued to pull out of northern Syria after Turkey's invasion of the border region.The statement appears to contradict US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who has said that under the current plan, all US troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq and the military would continue to conduct operations against the Islamic State group to prevent its resurgence in the region.On Tuesday, Esper said he plans to talk to Iraqi leaders to work out details about the US plan to send American troops withdrawing from Syria to Iraq, adding that the US has no plans to have those troops stay in Iraq ""interminably.""Speaking to reporters at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, Esper said he'll have a discussion with the Iraqi defense minister on Wednesday. He said the aim is to pull US soldiers out and ""eventually get them home.""President Donald Trump ordered the bulk of US troops in Syria to withdraw after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear in a phone call that his forces were about to invade Syria to push back Syrian Kurdish fighters whom Turkey considers terrorists.The pullout largely abandons the Syrian Kurdish allies who have fought the Islamic State group alongside US troops for several years. Between 200 and 300 US troops will remain at the southern Syrian outpost of Al-Tanf.Angered at feeling betrayed, some residents in areas populated predominantly by Kurds in both Syria and Iraq have pelted the withdrawing troops. On Monday, a US convoy that was driving down an avenue in the Kurdish-dominated city of Qamishly was pelted with potatoes.""Like rats, America is running away,"" one man shouted in Arabic at the vehicles.Near the Iraqi city of Irbil, a small group of young men threw stones at a convoy of US armored vehicles, shouting obscenities as it drove down a main highway, according to a video circulating online.In a statement, the Iraqi Kurdish regional government said the positive role played by US-led coalition forces in northern Iraq, protecting and assisting its residents, should not be confused with an ""unpopular political decision"" that has been taken  a reference to Trump's sudden move to withdraw troops from Syria.The number of American forces in Iraq has remained small due to political sensitivities in the country, after years of what some Iraqis consider US occupation during the war that began in 2003. It is a potentially explosive issue.The US currently has more than 5,000 American forces in Iraq, under an agreement between the two countries. The US pulled its troops out of Iraq in 2011 when combat operations there ended, but they went back in after IS began to take over large swaths of the country in 2014.After the Iraqi government announced victory against IS in 2017, calls for an American troop withdrawal increased amid concers about America's long-term intentions, particularly after it withdraws its troops from Syria.Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by arguing he would keep US troops in Iraq and use it as a base to strike Islamic State group targets inside Syria as needed. In February, he infuriated Iraqi leaders when he said US troops should stay in Iraq to monitor neighboring Iran.Earlier this week, Esper did not rule out the idea that US forces would conduct counterterrorism missions from Iraq into Syria. But he said those details will be worked out over time.His comments were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they leave Syria and what the counter-IS fight could look like. Esper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift the estimated 1,000 troops leaving Syria into western Iraq.The statement by the Iraqi military , however, said that all American troops that withdrew from Syria have permission to enter northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and then from there to be relocated out of Iraq.""These forces do not have any approval to remain in Iraq,"" it said. The statement did not specify a time limit for how long the troops can stay there.Meanwhile, US troops continued to pull out of northern Syria. Reports of sporadic clashes have continued between Turkish-backed fighters and the US-allied Syria Kurdish forces despite a five-day cease-fire agreement hammered out on Thursday between US and Turkish leaders. The cease-fire expires Tuesday night.Esper has said the troops going into Iraq will have two missions.""One is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,"" he said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. ""Things could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that's the game plan right now."""

He also reiterated his statement that the countrys rich and affluent is like rotten potatoes because they do not give charity and come forward to help improve its education system.A governor is used to be a weak entity. He does not have the right to hold a press conference or talk his heart out I keep worrying for three days if someone in Delhi got angry with me after my lecture, Malik said, addressing the 7th convocation of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University in Katra town of Reasi district.Hitting out at leaders of Hurriyat and mainstream parties in J&K, religious preachers and clerics, Malik said that they have used their influence to get the children of ordinary Kashmiris killed while none of them lost their own to terrorism.Alleging that affluent and powerful sections have crushed the dreams of the youths in Kashmir and destroyed their lives, he appealed to the people to understand the truth and join the Centres efforts to usher peace and progress in the state.Their children are studying abroad and are well settled.

2019-10-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/trump-finds-no-simple-fix-in-syria-other-world-hotspots-6083750/,"Trump finds no simple fix in Syria, other world hotspots","President Donald Trumps plan to reverse Americas involvement in endless wars has run up against a difficult truth: When it comes to national security, rarely can a simple solution solve a complex problem.AdvertisingAfter abruptly announcing last week that he would bring our soldiers home from Syria, Trump recalibrated, and his administration said it would instead redeploy more than 700 to western Iraq to help counter the Islamic State group. And now his latest plan faces another wrinkle: The Iraqi military said Tuesday those U.S. troops dont have permission to stay in Iraq.Meanwhile, Turkey and Russia announced Tuesday that they would jointly patrol most of the northeastern Syrian border with Turkey, underscoring the effects of the U.S. creating a power vacuum the Russians have been quick to fill.In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, typically a strong Trump supporter, introduced legislation prodding the president to halt the withdrawal. But he counseled against economic sanctions on Turkey, lest the U.S. further drive a NATO ally into the arms of the Russians.AdvertisingThis self-inflicted Syria evacuation was not well thought out, said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Linking the practical to the strategic has become harder and harder for this administration, because there is no thinking from the top that connects these decisions down at the working level.Its the latest example of Trumps from-the-gut approach to national security policy encountering roadblocks. Trumps charm offensive with Kim Jong Un has failed to prod North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. His withdrawal from the Obama administration-brokered Iran nuclear agreement prompted Iran to breach limits on its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium. And the presidents decision to negotiate with the Taliban to set the groundwork for withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan has failed to stem the violence there.As for Syria, Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear in a phone call that his forces were about to invade to push back Syrian Kurdish fighters whom Turkey considers terrorists.Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday he planned to talk to Iraqi leaders to work out details, adding that the U.S. has no plans to have the troops stay in Iraq interminably. Esper is to speak with the Iraqi defense minister on Wednesday and said he would underscore that the aim is to pull U.S. soldiers out and eventually get them home.Hogan Gidley, the White House principal deputy press secretary, said Tuesday that Trump remains committed to bringing the troops back to the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence echoed that assessment in speaking to conservatives at a dinner Tuesday in Washington, saying the U.S. will always be grateful to its Kurdish allies, but now that the military has achieved its objective, the president is keeping his word to the American people about bringing troops home.Trump initially announced his intention late last year to begin withdrawing troops from Syria, a decision that prompted the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat IS.At the time, there were about 2,000 American troops deployed to Syria. The U.S. pullout announced last week largely abandoned Syrian Kurdish allies who have fought the Islamic State group alongside U.S. troops for several years. Between 200 and 300 U.S. troops are to remain at the southern Syrian outpost of Al-Tanf.McGurk this week accused Trump of approaching the decision without taking a long view of the reality on the ground. This is the problem of not having a national security process  a process where, before a president says things, he would have some deliberation, McGurk said Monday at an event hosted by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank in Washington.As U.S. military convoys withdrawing from Syria for Iraq on Monday were pelted with potatoes and stones by angry Kurdish civilians, Trump played down U.S. responsibilities to the Kurds. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives, Trump said. He added that the U.S. would keep the small contingency force in Syria to protect the oil, but there was otherwise no reason to remain. Trump added that maybe well have one of our big oil companies go into Syria.McGurk said Trumps suggestion that an American company would exploit the oil raises very serious legal implications. The former diplomat added that the pullout of all but a contingency force has negated the Trump administrations influence in the area. That influence has evaporated from the moment Trump said leave in December, to cutting the force in half and now by cutting the force by whatever it is, McGurk said. This is not deliberate policy, these are spasms.Iraqs sensitivity over accepting more American troops on the ground is hardly surprising, said Knights, the Washington Institute analyst.Calls for an American troop withdrawal intensified in 2017 after the Iraqi government declared victory against IS. Trump himself has claimed credit for defeating the so-called caliphate.Earlier this year, however, Trump angered both Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by arguing he would keep U.S. troops in Iraq and use it as a base to strike Islamic State group targets inside Syria as needed. In February, Trump sparked more outrage when he said U.S. troops should stay in Iraq to monitor neighboring Iran.AdvertisingThe push by the Trump administration to put more U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq comes as Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdis government braces for more protests in Baghdad and elsewhere over corruption, high unemployment and subpar public services. The last thing that the Iraqi government needs right now is to turn attention to the presence of American troops, Knights said."

Now this is not the first time Ive been to Rajasthan; in fact Ive hit that trail several times before. Ive been to Rajasthan in the bitter cold of a Jaisalmer winter and in the oppressive heat of a Jodhpur summer. To the serenity of the lakes in Udaipur and to the unyielding fervour of Ajmer Sharif.And most often I have feasted on fine food and great meals. How can I forget Dargah Bazaar and the streets of Ajmer, the sounds, smells and flavours of the food outside the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the langar with freshly made biryani and sweet rice. The qorma and nihari with warm roti. Kachodi with kadhi, jalebi and warm milk, and Ajmers ever-so-famous Sohan Halwa.Ive also sampled the rare and illustrious Karan cuisine in Udaipur. The preserve of the Bedla clan of Mewar, recipes go back two centuries. The Smoked Baingan Bharta, Chaas, Pulaos and Kheema. Even smoked arhar dal cooked in milk and their iconic Banjara Mans, cooked nomad style with just salt and a few spices. But thats it.Otherwise its all just Laal Maas, Ker Sangri, Gatte ki Sabzi and Dal Baati Churma. Whether you are in Jodhpur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer or Jaipur, thats all you will be served under the baldachin of Rajasthani cuisine. Any hotel you go to, any chef you meet, and its once again Laal Maas, Ker Sangri, Gatte ki Sabzi and Dal Baati Churma.Till I walked up to a community table last week at the Fairmont Jaipur and met chef Prasad Metrani. I was in the Pink City to attend the third season of the Gourmet Getaway food festival, organised by the intrepid, flamboyant and stately restaurateur Dushyant Singh. There was array of foods from all over India. Bhatte di Murg and Punjabi Egg Curry Dhaba Style from Amritsar. Rogan Josh and slightly sour curd-marinated Mutton Shyaam from the kitchens of the Kashmiri Pundits.There was a spread from the surprising Kumaoni cuisine and bits of Bengali, Italian and Thai which, along with wines and cocktails, made for a rather fulfilling evening. As part of the festival, chef Metrani cooked up a lunch the next day at the Fairmont.Also on the menu was Silbatte ke Kachche Gosht ke Kabab with Tashtari. Stoneground on a traditional silbatta and smoked and flavored with clove and cardamom, the kababs are coarser than a Galawati and softer than a Shammi. Tashtari is a saffron-flavoured bread cooked in a clay oven. The two go beautifully together.It was a feast of lost dishes. Well researched and studied, a banquet was laid out in their restaurant aptly called Zarine (Persian for Golden). Amid tall pillars and arches, water bodies glistening in the background, we sat at a long table resplendent with brassware. A long silken scroll announced the dishes.The first course: Nargil Shorba. Nargil means coconut and the base of this soup is coconut milk. Its a recipe that they say originated among the tribal people of Gandhara, an ancient region beyond the Hindu Kush. Native to the Middle-East and Central Asia, this shorba made its way to India in the Mughal era. Its a mild simple soup, now flavoured with coriander, green chillies and spices, and can also be cooked with meat. Chef had added vegetable gnocchi and parmesan crisps to it.Served along with this was Tootak, which are balls of semolina and khoya stuffed with a spicy paneer mixture, brushed with saffron-rosewater and baked. Its a Deccani recipe from the kitchens of the Nizams as well as a signature dish of the local Hindu Kayastha community especially served to welcome guests.Next came Kamal Badal, an exotic snack of thinly sliced sundried eggplant, crisply fried lotus stem and spinach with tomato chutney. Created by the Mughals to feed hungry soldiers during their many campaigns. They needed a snack that was nutritious, could be preserved and could also be carried along. This snack could be kept for days and would not change taste, hence was called Kamal Badal.Then came the meat. Silbatte ke Kachche Gosht ke Kabab with Tashtari. Stoneground on a traditional silbatta and smoked and flavored with clove and cardamom, the kababs are coarser than a Galawati and softer than a Shammi. Tashtari is a saffron-flavoured plate-shaped bread cooked in a clay oven. The kababs were silken, gently spiced with a slight bite on the tongue, and beautifully complemented by the Tashtari.And there were more kababs. Katambari Kebab, a lost recipe from the royal kitchens of Maharaja Ala Singh, the first ruler of the princely state of Patiala. This kabab was allegedly invented when chicken breast was cooked in a cylindrical instrument called a phukna. This chicken breast was stuffed with cottage cheese in a sesame seed marinade and finished in a tandoor.For mains there was Raan. Gil-e-Hikamat, Pathiyonki Raan  mutton leg cooked in a clay pot with mutton kheema in a saffron sauce. For those who preferred chicken there was Kibti, from the kitchens of the Maharaja of Patiala. Slow-cooked chick meat with saffron potato fondant, heirloom tomatoes and fenugreek.These dishes were served with hot, steaming Doodh Shabnam Pulao, a lost recipe from Uttarakhand where Basmati is cooked with almond milk, saffron, walnut and morels.The glorious finish was Nazakat ka Meetha, a medley of rare desserts. Puffed rice with a lehsun ki kheer. Pudding made with raw garlic and milk. Jauj ka Halwa made of wheat, milk, sugar and flour. And chikki, the kind made of puffed rice and jaggery during Baisakhi and Lohri in Punjab.This was a meal fit for a royal, and while it wasnt exactly Rajashthani food, it was the best food Id eaten in Rajasthan. And whats more, thankfully all through the meal nobody mentioned Laal Maas, Ker Sangri, Gatte ki Sabzi and Dal Baati Churma.First Published: Oct 25, 2019 20:04 IST"
2019-10-25,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/each-dish-at-this-khan-market-cafe-is-superb/article29798009.ece,Each dish at this Khan Market cafe is “superb”,"Once in a while you have a meal that leaves you with a silly smile on your face. I had one such experience the other day. A dear friend and her daughter (our much loved niece  henceforth referred to as OMLN) said they wanted to take us out for lunch. They suggested a few places where they like the food, but I wanted to try out a new restaurant. There was one in Khan Market which had some interesting east European dishes on the menu. So we decided to meet there.We went, we saw, we left. The place was dark, the servers were new and knew little about what was on the menu, and the chef seemed equally at sea. So we quietly left without ordering and went looking for a restaurant called Foxtrot.As it happened, on my way to the restaurant which shall not be named (though, to be fair, OMLN said shed had a very nice meal of Dal Makhni and veggie stuff there some weeks ago), I bumped into chef Agnibh Mudi, who had delighted us with his superb creations at The Perch, another Khan Market restaurant, several months ago. He was now at Foxtrot, he told us. So, after emerging from the dark eatery, we quickly made a beeline for Foxtrot, which was just a few buildings away.Foxtrot is a newish restaurant, situated in the middle lane (if you turn into the lane from the bookstore Bahrisons, turn left and it will be on your left). We went up a flight and found  to our delight  the restaurant was well lit, with natural light filtering in through the windows, too. Chef Agnibh (and the other cheerful employees) helped us navigate the menu. OMLN wanted pasta, but nothing too heavy (so Pasta Linguine with Cherry Tomato and Basil for her), the friend wanted something different (Smashed Galouti Biryani for her), my wife wanted something porky and sharp (so Crumbled Sausage Flat Bread with Peri Peri Sauce with Jalapeno and Olive for her) and I was ready to cross some health barriers (Tenderloin Steak with Pommes Dauphine for me).For starters, we asked for a salad: warm goat cheese with walnuts and honey mustard dressing, and lots of rocket leaves. And the chef sent to the table a plate of their signature kulchas  some stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese, some with beetroot, and served with a curd dip, crumbled roasted papad, tomato chutney and so on.A meal for four should cost between 2,700-3000, including service charge.This doesnt happen very often, but each dish was superb. The salad was outstanding, with caramelised walnuts and fresh rocket leaves, small grapes and cherry tomatoes, all tossed in a light dressing. The kulchas were delicious, too  soft, yet crispy, with just the right kind of stuffing and dips. Our entrees were all perfect. OMLN enjoyed the pasta, which she said had a nice texture, and a light touch. I had some of the crumbled sausage flatbread, and loved it. It was like a very nice, thin pizza, but wonderfully crunchy and full of all of the good stuff. The friend enjoyed her biryani: the galouti came well merged with the fragrant riceI loved the tenderloin (buffalo meat), cooked just so, with the sauce on the side, a mashed and crispy potato chunk and lots of flavourful green veggies: asparagus, broccoli, snow peas. The meat was tender, and I actually liked it even without the sauce. The chef told us that the ingredients all come from specialized places, the greens and micro-greens from a farm on the outskirts, the ribs from Bengaluru.Our meal was, in a word, outstanding. We were happy that fate (bumping into the chef, finding the other place inadequate) did its bit for us. The silly smile is still on my face.The writer is a seasoned food critic"
2019-10-26,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/oct/26/from-the-bylanes-of-purani-dilli-2052980.html,From the bylanes of Purani Dilli,"Sudeshna Dutta ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Rich flavours, thick lassi and mouth-watering dessert  this is what our afternoon at Punjab Grill, Orion Mall, Rajajinagar, looked like. In a quest to explore the bylanes of old Delhi through culinary treat, the Tales of Purani Dilli menu served justice to the whole experience.My dining companion and I chose the all-time-favourite mango lassi to start the meal. Topped with tutti frutti dices and basil seeds, the thick dairy shake was soothing enough in the hot weather. While we were enjoying this, the chef sent Dahi Bhalla to our table. An influence of North India and Pakistan, the bhalla is prepared with moong dal, urad dal to make the batter, and later mixed with curd, making it taste much like dahi vada, only a little more filling.The Tawa Aloo Chaat is a proper street food, only with a more refined touch. Popping these diced potatoes mixed with spices was fun. We put an end to the street food section with non vegetarian items like Fried Chicken with Tikhi Hari Chutney and Sigri Roasted Chicken tossed in butter. The fried chicken was more of a modern adaptation of the tangri kabab that is famous in Delhi, but it tasted good, nonetheless. The roasted chicken is a must-try as the butter makes it even more succulent to devour the whole piece. Soft and juicy, the dish had just the right amount of spice that hit our palate. Dahi wale gol gappes are available too, so if you are in the mood for some chatpata roadside snacks, look no further and dig in!The next item  Chole Bhature  gave us the feels of sitting at a roadside Punjabi dhaba. But the music was a letdown, as we expected some Qawwali, Sufi or old Bollywood songs as that would have gone hand-in-hand with the theme of the menu.We ordered for Chicken Korma and Paya Curry, which were flavourful, to say the least. The rich gravy of the chicken leg gave out an aroma of roasted cashews and cardamom, with the soft meat definitely making a mark. The paya curry tasted nice, but the meat could have been softer.Influenced by Persian, Turkish and Afghan food, the dishes have an old-world charm but the food also has a whiff of modernisation, so people from all over the globe can enjoy it.We came to the end of our meal with Rabdi Kulfi Falooda, which I enjoyed to my hearts content, and also recommend. There has also been a heavy use of tutti frutti and basil seeds, making it interesting for guests to savour them.The food festival is on till Oct 28. Cost for two: `1,500 (approx)"
2019-10-26,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dealing-with-demanding-jjp-a-tough-task-for-khattar/story-ZwZlVoH3vpp2kawRz70CcN.html,Dealing with demanding JJP a tough task for Khattar,"chandigarhUpdated: Oct 26, 2019 22:36 ISTA litany of celebrations has already unfolded in the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJPs) Haryana unit with Manohar Lal Khattar-led government starting its second innings on Sunday.While there is a sense of disquiet among foot soldiers of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) for embracing the BJP, political observers are debating whether Khattar can surmount the innumerable challenges his government will face in the second innings, including dealing with the ambitious coalition partner, the JJP.In the run up to October 21 assembly elections, the JJP banked on the support of Jats who were angry with the BJP.It was the result of Jat community voters open support to the JJP and the Congress that halted the BJPs march towards crossing the halfway mark in the 90-member Vidhan Sabha.In 2014, the BJP had come to power for the first time winning 47 seats. This time, it won 40 seats, while the JJP got 10 MLAs.Most of the JJP legislators scripted the defeat of BJPs top guns. Former finance minister Capt Abhimanyu and state BJP chief Subhash Barala suffered humiliating defeats at the hands of JJP candidates.The immediate challenge before the JJP is how to blunt the Congress attack which has described JJPs truck with the BJP as an unholy alliance and brewing anger among its core support base  the Jats.As per reports, Jats in the hinterland are surprised with Dushyants decision who on Saturday said his party also contested election against the Congress.Haryana Congress is in the hands of a leader who ruled the state for 10 years and sold 63,000 acre land, Dushyant said in a veiled attack on Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Supporting the Congress would have meant going against the wishes of jannayak Chaudhary Devi Lal, who had left the Congress before 1977, he added.However, Jats in the villages are unconvinced.Their common grouse is that they backed the Congress and the JJP for their winnability quotient. Now, they say, the JJP joining hands with the BJP is tantamount to stabbing Jats in the back.Analysts say the first challenge before the straightforward Khattar will be to tackle delicately the emboldened JJP.The financial state of Haryana is not in pink of health, its agricultural and industrial growth is sluggish and the aspirations of the youth are soaring.Analysts say as the BJP has support of seven Independents, chances of the JJP indulging in arm twisting its senior coalition partner are bleak.The BJP has independents to silence the JJP and the JJP to tackle the ambitious independents, a political analyst said.It is the combination of using the JJP to checkmate independents and vice versa that prompted the BJP to drop like a hot potato the decision to seek support of controversial MLA Gopal Kanda, who was hoping to be a kingmaker.JJPs poll symbol is the key. And Dushyant, who outfoxed the experienced INLD supremo and his grandfather OP Chautala, knows the tricks of using the key tactfully.First Published: Oct 26, 2019 22:36 IST"

2019-10-28,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/when-plastic-waste-turns-into-fuel/articleshow/71785867.cms,Ahmedabad: When plastic waste turns into fuel,"Representative imageAHMEDABAD: The 2018 figures of the citys solid waste generation put the estimate of plastic waste at 10% of 3,700 tonnes of daily waste minus 370 tonnes, coming to 11,100 tonnes monthly or 1.35 lakh tonnes annually!Due to lack of segregation, the waste cannot be processed and thus the polythene bags discarded by citizens just increase the height of Mount Pirana, one millimetre at a time, said experts.But what if the waste can be processed to make fuel? It could be a win-win situation for the city. With this concept, a team of five students from CIPET-IPT (Central Institute of Plastic Engineering & Technology-Institute of Plastic Technology) at Ahmedabad have got primary success in plastic plasma pyrolysis technique where plastic waste is burnt at a very high temperature using plasma.With initial success, the project Development of Oil, Gas, & Activated Carbon from Waste Plastics by Using Pyrolysis for Domestics Application has received funding from the state governments student startup & innovation policy (SSIP) for development of prototype.Mukund Pandey, faculty member at CIPET and mentor for the project, said that the project was initiated in 2016-17 which was taken forward by the third year students of plastic engineering as part of their academic initiative. The student team includes Nisarg Patel, Nirmal Thakkar, Devam Hirpara, Lav Sharma and Nikhil Panchal.World-over, process of plastic waste is a major issue and pyrolysis (burning plastic at a very high temperature) is one of the ways for reverse-processing. We have two major objectives from the project - mixing the plastic fuel with the conventional fuel such as diesel to get a viable mix for the commercial use, and replace kerosene with the plastic fuel for domestic use. Tests to ascertain calorific value for the plastic fuel we extracted is on, said Pandey.The team members said that not all plastic need pyrolysis. With right segregation, several of the plastics can be recycled conventionally. Nisarg Patel, one of the team members of the project, said that today majority of the packaging - as simple as the bag of potato chips - are using composite material.We are experimenting to find the optimum temperature and conditions for processing these materials. Except PVC, almost all plastics can be processed through pyrolysis. With the help of our director Dr Pradeep Upadhyaya, we revived the pyrolysis chamber at CIPET for our experiment. We are hopeful that the project can help reduce our plastic waste burden, said Patel."

It is, in fact, a favourite fallback position of governments when they want to show that they are doing something about tackling population, poverty and lack of resources.The latest is the Assam government, which has decided to implement a policy passed two years ago to prevent anyone with more than two children from getting a government job starting 2021. Since we are in the midst of celebrating the Mahatma, it is significant that he did not support such control; rather, he supported the idea of abstinence, letting people make the choice for themselves.The fact that we are still talking of control suggests that the family planning programme, which India began in 1951, has not been implemented as well as it should have been. For a long time, after the uniquely cruel manner in which Sanjay Gandhi imposed population-control measures on hapless people during the Emergency with disastrous political consequences, the issue became a political hot potato. You would have thought that politicians would shy away from any attempt to control populations, to enter an arena so private and sensitive. But the fears triggered by the coercive policies during the Emergency did not last. And we were back to the control concept, something which persists till today.There is also a clear communal subtext to the issue, with many suggesting that thenorm is necessary since Muslims procreate at a much faster rate than Hindus and will, hence, overrun the country in the near future. This is of course off the mark. But for this or other reasons, various states have instituted restrictive measures ostensibly to keep the numbers down, despite the fact that we have a holistic and human rights-based National Population Policy.Assam is not alone in imposing such quotas. Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh do not allow a person with more than two children from contesting local elections. Maharashtra has this provision for the panchayat and municipal elections. The state also has a rule denying public distribution system benefits to women with more than two children.Rajasthan disqualifies those with more than two children from contesting panchayat polls as does Gujarat, which extends this to municipalities and corporations. Bihar and Uttarakhand too bar those with more than two children from contesting the municipal polls.But there is another model, which has delivered. Kerala has none of the restrictions, and yet fertility levels have fallen below replacement levels. Education, healthcare and choice of contraception have done the trick. As a well-known social scientist once told me, take care of people and the population will take care of itself.Instead of all controls, India should be proud that despite all odds, fertility rates are going down. Only 12 states and Union territories have fertility rates higher than replacement levels.We are very fond of comparing the dramatic results achieved by China with its stringent and often frightening implementation of the one-child norm. Indias national policy has been based on choice, access to medical care and reduction in maternal and infant mortality.The problem is that we have not been able to implement the recommendations in the policy. These include the cafeteria approach to contraception choice of reversible and irreversible contraception made available to couples or individuals. It is a different matter that public health centres, which should be dispensing these, along with providing the right kind of medical attention, are not doing so for lack of funds.Along the way, as various governments have blundered from prescribing controls in the form of sterilisation, almost always for women, after two children, many myths have been busted.One such myth is that the poor want to have more children so they have more earning power. This is wrong, it is simply that they do not know enough about reversible contraceptive methods or have no access to these.The focus of the whole population debate has been on women from sterilisation to reproductive health workers. It is rare that men, who are almost always the decision-makers when it comes to family size, are involved in the debate on the merits of smaller, healthier families.Many problems still remain, one being the preference for the male child, which means many women are forced to have several girls before the desired son arrives. Yet, despite all of this, fertility rates are declining. It is not for the state to provide either incentives or disincentives to regulate numbers.No one should be punished for having the number of children they chose to have, instead they should be given the information needed to make an informed choice.This debate is old hat in developed countries. It is a pity that worries about the population are still met with unacceptable solutions, in contravention of the governments humane national population policy.Population is not just about numbers. It is about people and their rights to have a family of the size they chose to.First Published: Oct 29, 2019 17:30 IST"

The BJP already had signed letters of support from eight Independents, but accepted only seven as the controversial Gopal Kanda became a hot potato. But Independents are generally attention-seeking and troublesome, so the BJP bought political stability by inducting the year-old Jat party that did astonishing well to win 10 seats in the Assembly. The price it had to pay was to cede the deputy CMs post to JJP chief Dushyant Chautala, plus a few ministerial berths.While Dushyant later recalled his familys association with its partner since the Jan Sangh era, the big question is whether BJP Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has the ability to address the ambitions of such a demanding ally.Getting Dushyant on board would bring the dominant Jat communitywhich nurses a grudge against the BJPon the power table and assuage their feelings, though a section of the community is already upset over the deal. Since the BJP does not have a strong Jat leadership and Khattar is not a Jat, the party would want to see it as a win-win pact. But Dushyant is not expected to play second fiddle and would refuse to be a rubber stamp for Delhi in trying to expand his political reach. Since he hails from a family that has ruled Haryana for ages, he will surely try to restore its past glory.As the Congress already has a strong Jat leadership in Hoodawho did a miracle of sorts by mixing chalk with cheese as he prepared an unnatural Jat-Dalit cocktail to do wellDushyant can be expected to fight for prominence as the numero uno Jat leader in the state. He could also look to grow beyond his caste appeal, in which case he would try to eat into the BJPs space. At 31, he has youth on his side with some parliamentary experience. Getting his relatives out of jail would be a bonus. In sum, its advantage Dushyant. Whether the BJP benefits or repents at leisure remains to be seen."

He was sentenced to death. The Centre recently allegedly commuted his death sentence, triggering a fresh controversy. That was Rajoana Kalans past.AdvertisingThe village near Raikot in Ludhiana now is busy shaping a future, which if replicated across Punjab and in other states, may prove to be the biggest tool in fight against burning of crop residue and the resultant air pollution.Heres how: Not a single farmer in the village, with about 1500 acres of agriculture land, set paddy stubble on fire in 2018. This year too, the farmers are resolute that they would not burn crop residue to clear their fields.The change, however, didnt happen overnight. It all started in 2005 when a farmer Jagdeep Singh decided he would not set his fields on fire to clear them of crop residue.I incorporated the stubble in my fields by using a rotavator (an equipment that uses a set of blades which, spin and break, churn and aerate the soil prior to sowing). The results werent visible immediately. But within three years, the move started paying me dividends. The consumption of fertiliser in my fields reduced dramatically. I did not need to use too much pesticides and the grain was of good quality, Jagdeep Singh told the Indian Express.AdvertisingJagdeep decided not to sit back with the results. I wanted to tell all my fellow farmers. And from there it became a campaign. Last year we did not have a single farmer setting his fields on fire in the village. We have arrived. We have to take the message to the entire state that we can do without farm fires, he added. Jagdeep was recently called by CM Amarinder Singh for a meeting in Chandigarh. The CM hailed him for his contribution in fight against stubble burning.The village now owns a set of machines used for stubble management. We paid Rs 10 lakh last year to get the machines with 80 per cent subsidy. We have a village level farmers club. The machines are used in each field to incorporate the stubble and sow the next crop. We charge the farmers a token amount. The money is used for the maintenance of the machines, he added.Satnam Singh, the biggest farmer in the village owns 125 acres. He has harvested his paddy crop and is now sowing potato in the fields where the stubble is still visible. We are sowing potato under the mulched paddy stubble. Just come back to see my produce. You will be amazed, he said.Another farmer, Rajwinder Singh, recalls how till just three years back, the village used to remain engulfed in a blanket of smoke in the post-harvesting season. We could not breathe. It was then that all the villagers decided that we would not burn our stubble. And last year we achieved it. This would be the second year when we won;t be setting our farms on fire, he said.The farmers of this village had formed a group to claim 80 per cent subsidy on machinery such as happy seeders. The state government offers 50 per cent subsidy to individual farmers and 80 per cent to a group of at least 10 farmers. We have an MB plough, rotavator, two happy seeders and a mulcher. Our village cooperative society too has a happy seeder. This helps us incorporate the stubble on all 1,470 acres, said Parminder Singh, another farmer."

While the Minister was satisfied with the way students of Class IV responded to his questions, he was surprised that students of Class IX could not name the Governor of Odisha.Later, he ate rice and soya bean potato curry that were served as mid-day meal to the children and was upset with the substandard quality of food that is being cooked at a centralised kitchen.The centralised kitchen, installed at Rondapalli under Jeypore block, is being run by a private agency and supplies food to primary and upper primary schools located in Jeypore, Koraput and Sunabeda municipal areas and Kotpad NAC.The Minister asked District Education Officer (DEO) Pramod Kumar Panda to issue a notice to the agency but the officer informed that notices have been served to the agency thrice in the past over the quality of food but to no avail. Dash said a decision on the supply of mid-day meal from the centralised kitchen will be taken once he reached Bhubaneswar. He instructed the school headmistress to advise students to wash their hands before eating meals.In Koraput, he reviewed the functioning of schools in Rayagada, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and Koraput along with officials of the district administration and School and Mass Education department officials.Speaking to mediapersons, he said teachers will be kept away from monitoring preparation of mid-day meals and the job will be given to women SHGs. Teachers shall only focus on educating the children and nothing else, he said.The Minister emphasised on infrastructure development of Odisha Adarsha Vidyalaya and provision of cycles and scholarships to students.He also directed the block education officers and cluster coordinators to make surprise visits to schools and directed teachers to hold parents-teachers meetings in schools at least four times in a month.The Minister informed that while vacant teacher positions in Koraput district are being filled up, contractual teachers, who have completed six years of service, will be regularised on November 6."

Their religion Zoroastrianism is arguably the worlds first monotheistic faith, and is one of the oldest religions still in existence. Parsis migrated to the Indian subcontinent from Persia (now Iran), after the Muslim conquest of Persia between the 8th and 10th century AD.Reportedly, the Chenoys were the first lot of Parsis who came to Secunderabad around 1803. When the Hyderabad Contingency was transferred from the old Cantonment of Jalna to Bolaram in 1800, the Chenoy family came along with them and were the recognised army shroffs or bankers of the said contingent. Many in the Chenoy family earned different titles such as Khan Bahadur, Khan Saheb and Nawab, says CA Jehangir Bisney, trustee of Parsi Zoroastrian Anjuman of Secunderabad and Hyderabad (PZASH).AssociationsParsis are known for their philanthropy and charity activities. Located at MG Road, Secunderabad, PZASH is the largest Parsi Trust of the twin cities. Apart from providing subsidised housing to the community members, PZASH has various other schemes such as education encouragement, poverty amelioration, child incentive, etc. It also provides medical equipment for emergency use, adds Jehangir.The other prominent institutions are Zoroastrian Club, BRJC Parsi High School at Park Lane, Secunderabad, Zoroastrian Stree Mandal and Parsi Dharamshala near Paradise, Secunderabad. There are various other private trusts that provide housing and other aid to the deserving families.There are nearly 1,000 Parsis in the twin cities. A substantial number of them reside in the three colonies within the precincts of the three Fire Temples. Two Fire Temples are in Secunderabad and one is in Hyderabad. Most of the Parsis are members of PZASH. The fee is a nominal `1 per month. Capt Kayarmin Pestonji of Chermas and Manek Daruvala of T.I.M.E. are some of the prominent Parsi businesspersons in the city. The Anjuman will be celebrating the centenary celebrations of its Fire Temple in July 2020, informs Jehangir.FestivalsThe Parsi community celebrates its new year on the first day of its calendar. On March 21 every year, the community observes Navroze, a traditional Persian / Iranian festival celebrating the onset of spring. A few days after the Parsi New Year, the community celebrates the birthday of its Prophet Zarathustra called Khordad Saal. The prophet Zoroaster (Zarathustra in ancient Persian) is regarded as the founder of Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster taught followers to worship a single god called Ahura Mazda.CuisineParsis love eggs, potatoes and meat. Almost all the vegetable dishes made from okra, tomatoes or potatoes will have eggs on top. Meat dishes will have potatoes in the form of salli (matchstick-fried potatoes). Dishes like the dhansak have lentils which are adopted from typical Indian preparations and given a meaty twist. Fish dishes use local seafood like prawns and pomfret, and the use of banana leaf (patra ni macchi) in their preparation shows the skillful adoption of local ingredients and making it their own. Lagan Nu Custard is a dessert which is the Parsi version of the French Creme Brulee and has derived its name from being served at weddings.Marriage ceremoniesCommunity weddings take place every year and more frequently in the cooler months of November, December and January. Most of the community weddings take place at the picturesque Parsi Dharamsala complex located at Paradise, Secunderabad. The complex has a large hall/pavilion. The weddings always take place after sunset and are performed by the community priests.1,000Parsis in the twin citiesA few businessesChermasT.I.M.E.

2019-10-31,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onion-tomato-area-may-be-increased-to-stabilise-prices/story-aoB3XtOMnahkL2ZuGXztbP.html,"Onion, tomato area may be increased to stabilise prices","indiaUpdated: Oct 31, 2019 05:51 ISTThe government is weighing policy options to increase the area and production of onions and tomatoes in northern states to tide over supply disruptions from southern and central states, especially during the monsoon months, that cause prices of the vegetables to spike.The consumer affairs ministry has proposed to the horticulture commissioner under the agriculture ministry that increasing production of onions and tomatoes in states such as Haryana, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh be included in the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, according toan official with knowledge of the matter.This is a centrally sponsored scheme in which the Union government funds up to 60% of total costs, with state governments contributing the rest. In the case of hill states, such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the Centres share of funding is higher at 90%.Onion prices more than doubled in many cities since August. They have since settled at around Rs 50-55 a kg in retail markets. During times of normal supply, retail prices usually range between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg.Heavy rains during August-September in Maharashtra, the biggest onion producing state, as well in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, disrupted onion shipments to northern India as well as other parts of country. Unseasonal rains could have damaged nearly 30% of the onion crop in Maharashtra, said Shirish Jamdade, an official in the states horticulture department.The main summer onion crop  sown during May-June and harvested in October-November  accounts for just 15% of the countrys annual output. Yet, this crop is critical because it replenishes markets at a time when they generally run out stocks from previous harvests.Traders who rely on stocked onions they set aside for such seasonal shortages then up prices, leading to inflationary spells.According to data from the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation, rain-led disruptions caused onion arrivals at wholesale markets in September to slump to 3.5 million quintals until September 25, from about 6 million quintals in the previous year.Higher production in northern states can ease supply shocks in eastern states such as Bihar, West Bengal and the north-east, an official with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.During the price spiral last month, metros such as Mumbai and Delhi were the worst hit, and retail onion and tomato prices soared to Rs 75-80/kg.Sowing of the countrys main summer onion crop was delayed by over a month in Maharashtra due to a sluggish start to this years monsoon in June, which pushed back harvests in what is a lean season, another reason for the price spike.On September 13, the Union government curbed exports by raising the minimum export price (MEP) of onion to $850 a tonne (about Rs 62,000). Imposition of MEP makes an Indian-origin commodity expensive for foreign buyers, thereby discouraging shipments abroad.As prices failed to cool, the government then imposed a ban on export of onions on September 29 to augment domestic supply and cool prices.The horticulture mission, under which onion output is sought to be raised in northern states, will aim at productivity increases through improved varieties, quality seeds and planting materials, the official cited above said. The mission also aims to promote subsidised greenhouse cultivation and horticulture mechanisation.If implemented properly, the proposal for higher production within northern states can fulfil demand during the lean phase. But the scheme may need to offer some form of subsidy and be also backed by higher procurement of onions, said Alok Kumar, a former horticulture scientist at the Indian Council of Agriculture Research. The government usually buys onions from farmers to build a buffer stock; this stood at 44,205 tonnes in June 2019.Price spikes in onions increases overall food inflation, potentially upsetting the Reserve Banks inflation target. Higher inflation can cut economic growth and affect businesses by making borrowing expensive.Onions are the second most consumed vegetable in the country after potatoes. An average Indian household spends 13% of its total vegetable bill on onions alone, according to HTs calculations from the 2011-12 (latest available figures) Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) conducted by the National Sample Survey Office. CES is the most authoritative source of consumption data in India. To be sure, spending on vegetables was just 10% and 9% of total food spending in rural and urban India in 2011-12. Cereals, milk, and milk products had the biggest share in food consumption in India.Onions have an overall weightage of 1.7% in the food inflation basket. According to a calculation of Kotak Institutional Equities Ltd, assuming a 50% rise in onion prices on an annual basis, wholesale food inflation would swing up by 80 basis points. That translates to a rise of 30 basis points in retail food inflation. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.First Published: Oct 31, 2019 00:23 IST"

Or punching holes with their fingers into golden crisp pooris and seeing steam curl up from within, before wolfing them down with potato masala. The restaurant chain is synonymous with the city, so much so that it is among the first things that crop up at the mention of Coimbatore. Annapoorna is celebrating 50 years and got in touch with us to make a film on it, says photographer Amar Ramesh, who runs Studio A and is the executive producer of the film Annapoorna, the Pride of Coimbatore.The documentary film, directed by Maverick Prem, creative head at Studio A, and filmed by Vinoth RJ, Vivi Raaj, Aravind Naresh, and Gokul Nath N, is 15 minutes long and is being screened by the Thinnai Talkies initiative.We spent three months on the film, recalls Prem, who has his roots in Kovilpatti. His wife is from Coimbatore and he knows how people there value Annapoorna. Annapoornas food is a reflection of Coimbatores soft nature, he says.Summing up the iconic restaurants history, spirit, customer base, and people behind it within a short documentary was quite a task, according to Prem.We had to show something intangible through the visual medium. There was so much to show, so much to tell, adds the 32-year-old. More than the actual shoot, that took place over three sessions of four to five days each, Prem says that it was the pre-production work, during which the team spent time in the restaurant to soak in its mood, that consumed a lot of time.Besides witnessing mammoth quantities of idlis appearing amidst clouds of steam, Prem got to see first-hand the planning that goes into cooking dizzying quantities of food. Annapoorna has been operating with a centralised kitchen from as early as the 1980s, he says. Back then, people would hardly have thought that something like that was possible. But the restaurant came up with the idea to maintain the same taste in all their 19 branches in Coimbatore. Prem and team have documented the numerous tins that leave the kitchen bearing hot sambar by the litre. Cooking starts at 3 am and food is dispatched from the centralised kitchen at 5.15 am, like clockwork, he explains.The film will also talk about the firsts of Annapoorna, Such as how they introduced the small, slightly deep plates to eat sambar idli in and two spoons to eat it with.Of course, they got to eat a lot of food in the process. We were hungry all the time, laughs Prem.Annapoorna, the Pride of Coimbatore will be screened on November 5 at 6.30 pm, at Studio A, PS Sivasamy Road, Mylapore. Tickets are priced at 400 each.

It might be the food trend of 2020,"It looks like India will trend like a turmeric latte, in 2020. Granted, that is high praise mainly for an avocado toast-eating, moringa-quaffing demographic. However, it is undeniably interesting that the first official set of food predictions for next year  released by Amazon Whole Foods  has many ideas that are already integral to desi kitchens.Flour powerThis will be a year of alternative flours, which Whole Foods says are entering the market, making baking more inclusive and adventurous. The report states that 2020 will bring more interesting fruit and vegetable flours into home pantries... They predict that packaged goods will start using tigernut flour (a root vegetable that grows in Northern Africa) in snack foods, and pastries will be made with seed flour blends.While India just has to look towards its villages to relearn how to make bajra rotis, ragi dosas and amaranth parathas. There has also been an interest in alternative flours here, as people look for healthier options to replace a wheat and rice-dominant diet. Green jackfruit flour has been gaining ground, used to make everything from porridge to samosas. Also look out for green banana flour, which surfaced last year in cafs. As for seed flour pastry: kaju katli anyone?Out-of-the-Box, Into-the-Fridge SnackingIn 2020, forecasters expect to see refrigerators stocked with the kind of wholesome, fresh snacks typically prepared and portioned in advance at home: hard-boiled eggs with savoury toppings, pickled vegetables, drinkable soups...With consumers asking more questions about what ingredients go into their food, manufacturers are vying with each other to create clean snacks.Think of every tiffin box your grandmother and mother have ever packed. Indians cornered the market on freshly made, Out-of-the-Box, Into-the-Fridge snacks decades ago, which is not unusual. After all, before the flood of heavily processed packaged food, children everywhere had no option but to eat a banana when they were hungry between meals.However, Indian households are not that different today  even in a food culture swamped by nachos. Not convinced? Try telling your parents you are planning to buy hard-boiled eggs with savoury toppings from the supermarket. And brace for an onslaught of dabbas filled with paneer burji, sesame laddoos or still warm mooli parathas.Rethinking the kids menuBy 2026, 80% of millennials will have children. This is the generation growing up on sushi lunches, prosciutto-punctuated European holidays and tempeh burgers. Brace yourself. These mini-gourmands will be correcting your pronunciation and pesto with equal lan soon.Also on the list Regenerative Agriculture: Farmers, academics, Government agencies and retailers are joining hands, looking at land and animal management practices to improve soil health, encourage biodiversity and address climate change.Foods from West Africa: Brands are looking to West Africa for superfoods like moringa and tamarind, as well as cereals such as sorghum, fonio, teff and millet.Plant-Based, Beyond Soy: In 2020, the trendiest brands are slowing down on soy, replacing it instead with innovative blends (like grains and mung beans) to mimic the creamy textures of yoghurts and other dairy products.Everything Butters and Spreads: Expect to see watermelon seed butter, chickpea butter and creamy vegan spreads touted as paleo- and keto-friendly.Zero-Proof Drinks: Unique non-alcoholic options are popping up everywhere. Recreate classic cocktail flavours using distilling methods typically reserved for alcohol. Alt-gin for gin and tonics and botanical-infused faux spirits for a faux martini, for example.According to the report, restaurants are taking sophisticated young palates into consideration, creating menus that include more food that is fermented, spiced or rich in umami flavours.The Indian angle? Traditionally, we never really believed in childrens menus anyway. Children were always encouraged to eat what their parents ate, thus developing a taste for a wide range of flavours and textures, whether it is a bitter gourd fry, fermented kanji or healthy stir fries made with local varieties of spinach. It helps that we have a food culture that is so diverse, you never really run out of meal options, especially if you swap recipes with friends and relatives around the country.Not-So-Simple SugarsFirst there was sugar. Then came a rush of substitutes. Then, they were replaced by stevia, honey and maple syrup.Next year, expect syrupy reductions from fruit sources like monk fruit, pomegranate, coconut and dates, says the report, adding they will contribute concentrated, unique flavours into recipes for desserts, meat glazes and marinades. They also expect to see syrups made from starches like sorghum and sweet potato.Meanwhile, back home, jaggery still reigns supreme. Most often used for traditional desserts like payasams, chikkis and halwas, it is increasingly replacing white sugar in even more westernised recipes, like granola, cakes and cookies.Check out your local market and organic stores to shop a wide variety, in different forms from bricks to syrups. In winter, source Kolkatas delicious nolen gur, made from the date palm. Another option: Locally made, high-quality coconut sugar.Meat-plant blendsWhats new? Homemade, fridge-stored food; nut butters; fruit-based flours are some trends predicted by Amazon Whole FoodsButchers and meat brands will get on board the plant-based craze, according to the Whole Foods report. But they are not going vegetarian. The report quotes James Beard Foundations Blended Burger Project, a movement to make burgers healthier, more environment friendly and economical by blending in fresh mushrooms.The Indian kitchen has always been frugal with meat, finding practical ways to make it go further  motivated more by economics than health, to be honest. Which is why fish and meat cutlets are made with potato, and heavily flavoured with onions, chillies and garam masala.There are also many dishes that cleverly combine nutritious vegetables with meat to create more balanced meals, like the Bengali prawn and pumpkin curry, or Naga galho, a soupy blend of rice, seasonal greens and smoked pork."

Not that they are into any fad diet, rather, the four of them have learnt the art of self-sustenance through subsistence agriculture.While a 20-cent plot of land in Vilavoorkkal near Malayinkeezhu on the outskirts of the city cradles their own paddy fields, a well-maintained kitchen garden on the terrace of their Kowdiar residence provides them with enough for day-to-day needs.

Planting of saplings is done using the transplanting method and a portion of the plot serves as a nursery where seedlings are raised.Not dampened by the rains, the family recently celebrated another harvest, this time procuring about 400 kg of the Jyothy rice variety. All our rice requirements are met throughout the year from our own fields. Any surplus is usually given off to kith and kin, explains Uma Maheshwaran.Rajasree M R at the terrace kitchen garden | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor the last two crop seasons, he cultivated the long and red Jyothy variety, having previously harvested the high-yielding, short-duration Prathyasha variety and the medium-duration Aishwarya as well. As the paddy crop duration is generally a little over three months, Uma Maheshwaran cultivates pulses on the plot during summer, when he manages to get a yield of close to 10 kg a year. He says one or two local labourers are employed for threshing, while the professor himself chips in.On the terrace of his single-story house, one can find a range of vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, bitter gourd, cluster beans, ladies finger and so on apart from red amaranth and a few varieties of chilli in eco-friendly grow bags.Keeping it cool Uma Maheshwaran says he uses basic farm implements. During the cool season during the November-January period, he grows vegetables such as cabbage and cauliflowers. No matter how much care you give, pests and diseases are unavoidable since we do not use pesticides. Sometimes, I spray organic pesticides like neem-garlic oil if required, he says.Perhaps, three essential items that we cannot grow on our terrace are onions, potatoes and garlic as they flourish more in cool climates, says his wife, Rajasree MR, Joint Director of Plant Protection, Krishi Directorate. She says every Sunday morning, the couple makes it a point to visit their Vilavoorkkal plot for weeding and examination of crop health.Anand U, a banker, says he developed a passion for farming right from a young age, learning from his green-thumbed parents. For me, farming feels like a refreshing break from an otherwise hectic and monotonous schedule. It also helps you be in close communion with Nature, adds Anand, now posted in Thrissur.Anand U near his farmland | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor Aparna Raju, farming came a new experience when she became part of the family after tying the knot with Anand but says she took to it like a duck to water. Now, in her father-in-laws absence, she makes it a point to water and prune the plants on the terrace. What I have learnt from my experience is that farming is not a hard row to hoe. In fact, anybody can do it, she says.The family is also focusing on apiculture, for the twin benefits of promoting cross-pollution for their terrace farming as well as to harvest honey for own use. A vermicompost pit set up in their backyard helps in recycling kitchen and farm waste and use the same as organic fertiliser for the plants.They want to promote sustainable subsistence agriculture not just to set an example against the growing menace of food adulteration in a mass consumption-driven culture but to highlight the trails and tribulations small-scale farmers go through.For now, its about making hay while the sun shines!"

They couldnt have imagined then that their little Jehan would one day be on the other side of the screen. The 20-year-old is a rare Indian motor-racing champ, and in 2017 became the first Indian to take pole position in the FIA Formula 3 European Championship.Heres how he keeps his body and mind race-ready.Growing up, I was a big boy. But Force 1, which propelled me from Indian and Asian circuits to European ones, transformed me as the tracks, competition, everything was of a different level.In London, my base, I cook myself something simple  pasta, chicken, fish, grilled veggies and mashed potatoes. When Im here, my UK and Indian trainers coordinate my diet. I eat a lot more Parsi food  I like my pulao and dhanshak. My body can take it.People underestimate how much athletes should eat  you need 4000 calories and lots of carbs for energy because on race days, just driving, you can lose up to 2.5 kg.That said, I avoid extra oil, fizzy drinks and fast food. Fortunately, I have no sweet tooth and dont like alcohol. Cheat meals, once a month, are usually a greasy burger.Optimal weight is key. Extra kilos can cost you lap-time  you dont want that in a sport where every millisecond counts. Likewise, if youre very light, ballast has to be added to stabilise the car. But thats preferred more as you can distribute its weight, as per your needs. The best is steady bodyweight, so Ive maintained 70kg for the past four years.Neck-muscle strength is crucial for me, because of the G forces we endure. Other than that my regime depends on where I am. In London, I exercise twice a day, five times a week. In Mumbai, I follow a two-day workout and one-day rest routine. Workouts are a mix of cardio (running or cycling), strength-training, crossfit and six-minute circuit repetitions till Im fatigued.In my free time too, I love sports. In Mumbai, I pick a different one each day  swimming, cricket, table-tennis, football.Doing anything at a competitive level, stress is inescapable. I remind myself that youve got to believe in yourself more than anyone else does. Never take frustrations to the track. Once the helmets on, I snap out of everything and tell myself Im better than everyone. You cant win without a winning attitude.Before a race, I spend just about 30 minutes with the engineer, not two to three hours as many other do  I believe in being prepared to adapt. If things dont go as planned, I leave them on the track and move on.First Published: Nov 01, 2019 17:52 IST"
2019-11-01,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2019/nov/01/tn-moving-towards-capitalist-farming-2055453.html,TN moving towards capitalist farming?,"The Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2019, that has come into effect is seen as a major step towards making agriculture an entrepreneurial enterprise. The legislation, the first by a state, facilitates a foolproof mechanism to ensure farmers and those who own livestock get a fair deal.Till now, farmers growing sugarcane and herbs and those who reared poultry have been getting into contractual agreements with private firms, but they had no safety cover. This Act is aimed at insulating marginal farmers and livestock owners from weather and market fluctuations, by ensuring a pre-determined pricing arrangement with farm-based industries. The corporate approach to farming is also intended to add quality to the produce.But a section of experts argue that the contractual system helps farmers owning large tracts of land. In India, fragmentation has led to most farmers owning smaller tracts, making them vulnerable to market pressures. There is also the possibility of contractual firms exploiting marginal farmers with lower pre-fixed pricing. The Act provides for a regulatory body that will have the powers of a civil court in specified areas. But the ambit of its power is not clear. It must ensure private enterprises do not exploit the farmers vulnerability.Farmers, too, may take advantage of contracting firms lack of understanding of agricultural techniques. They may also be tempted to leak the technical know-how provided by the contracting firm. The recent incident of a multinational company suing potato farmers in Gujarat for allegedly growing a variety of the tuber for which the firm claimed Plant Variety Protection (PVP) rights is a case in point.This legislation may be seen as the government slowly distancing itself from addressing market dynamics in the agricultural sector by linking farmers directly with private players. Though agriculture can be made into a capitalist enterprise in which more people may want to invest in, the government should also be the fall-back cushion for farmers in this buyer-seller ecosystem."
2019-11-02,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lost-found-odisha-fishermen-amrit-kujur-myanmar-indonesia-6100121/,Lost & Found,"How do I describe what it is to spend nights in the middle of the ocean, on a boat with only a torch light The darkness and silence can drive you mad.AdvertisingDays after Amrit Kujur washed ashore on the Odisha coast, haggard and hungry, the 46-year-old sits on a chair at the medicine ward of Puris District Headquarters Hospital, narrating his incredible story of survival: of the 58 days he spent lost at sea, 28 of those without food or water, on a battered dinghy as the waves tossed it around from the Andaman Islands to Myanmar to Odisha.Around him, patients and their relatives occupy every bed and every square foot on the floor, anxiously waiting for the doctor on duty. Now and then, they look at him and whisper among themselves. Occasionally, someone walks up for a selfie and Kujur obliges, running his hand through his freshly cut hair and looking straight into the camera. This is a different Kujur from the one who had reached the Odisha coast on October 25 and whose photographs, bearded and with matted hair, had gone viral. Now freshly shaven and in a bright orange T-shirt that has a picture of Lord Shiva, he sits back once again to tell his story.I am a delivery man for a Tamil seth (trader) who sells food and water to crew of small ships passing by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, says Kujur in Hindi. I live on Shaheed Dweep (formerly Neill Island) and make around Rs 20,000 a month doing 20-25 trips a month between the island and Port Blair.AdvertisingKujur covered the 37-km, three-hour distance on Kavya Darshini, the dinghy owned by the trader, around 20 feet long, three feet wide, and somewhat deep, to keep the goods secure. It was equipped with a motor at the rear and oars for paddling but, Kujur says, he always knew the tiny boat was not good enough for the seas.Betiyon ke liye (For my daughters), he says on why he stuck to his risky occupation. Of his three daughters, Nitu Nilima, 22, and Manisha, 20, are in college, while Salma, 17, is in high school. The money I make is much more than what I would have got working in the fields of some rich farmer.Shahed Dweeps vegetable farm economy is just about enough to support its roughly 6,000 residents, says Kujur. Most people work as labourers on large farms, anywhere between seven and 10 hectares. On an island, land is like gold. So a poor man like me has to earn a living on water, says Kujur.***On August 28, Kujur and Bindhyaranjan Biswas, 36, another of the traders employees, set off on their boat with a consignment of rice, dal, potatoes and chicken feed. The maal (goods), worth a little over Rs 4 lakh, was to be delivered from Port Blair to Shaheed Dweep.Thats when a storm struck. It hit us from nowhere, he says.As the storm tossed their boat around, the two men had to take a quick call for survival. Kujur says they threw out the goods on board to ensure the boat was light and stayed above the waves. The seths goods are insured; our lives are not, he says.The storm ended in less than an hour, Kujur recalls. But the boat was battered, the sail cloth torn, the anchor lost. As the two men staggered onto the deck, thankful to be alive, their relief soon gave way to the realisation that they were in strange waters.You know when land is far away  the waves are calmer, the sea feels deeper, you dont see birds, says Kujur. We had run out of fuel. Our panic grew as we searched the boat for something to eat, anything We had with us around two dozen biscuit packets, tetra packs of juice and two torches.The greatest loss was our sense of direction, he continues. I have never ventured too far into the sea and so I do not know how to navigate reading the stars and the sun. Never very religious, turning to God seemed like the only thing left to do for Kujur, who belongs to the islands Roman Catholic community.He and Biswas spent nearly four weeks drifting, Kujur adds, their dinghy going where the waves pushed it. We would wake up every day to the sight of water all around us. The sun was unbearably hot, but we rigged a small roof on the deck and that gave us some protection.Time hung heavy. The sea seemed dead. As the days passed, Kujur and Biswas, two men forced into a journey without a destination, swung from desperation to resignation. Biswas spoke little anyway, and now there was nothing to say. We did not see a single sea creature  dolphin or whale  in the water. We would sit on the deck in the evenings, staring at the horizon as the sun went down.Nights, says Kujur, were particularly unnerving, but memories of his family and the life he had left behind served as a useful distraction against fear and despair. The sound of the waves seemed eerie at night. But some nights, the skies displayed the most amazing formation of stars. I would think about Lilli (his wife) and the children. Lying on the boat, I would think about my marriage, the birth of our children, our little house, my siblings, my childhood and every good and bad experience, Kujur says.I once burst out laughing when I remembered a funny story. Biswas switched on the torch. I could see the light beam shaking as his hands trembled in fear. Within days on the sea, we had developed a fear of human sounds even a laugh seemed unnatural.Kujur says he tried to keep his mind occupied with small problems. I planned to catch fish using biscuits as bait. But Biswas thought it was not a good idea to lose the little food we had with us. We rationed our food to one biscuit packet and two juice packs every day.Some nights, Kujur says, he lay on the deck trying to study the stars, trying to remember what fishermen said about stars and directions. I could not remember anything useful. But then I started noticing that the sun was setting behind us. That meant we were headed east. I prayed we were heading for Burma (Myanmar), Thailand or Malaysia, he says.Kujur interrupts his narration to greet another set of locals at the hospital  some ask him questions in pidgin Hindi. He smiles and answers all questions with, Kismat saath de gayi (Luck favoured me).We did sight a few ships, he continues, settling back into his chair. But they were too far to be hailed. On clear nights, we could see lights flashing at the front and the rear of big ships, but our torchlights never reached them, he says.***Roughly three weeks after the storm on August 28, one early morning, Biswas shook Kujur awake. As Kujur sat up with a start, he saw something incredible. Three fishing trawlers had surrounded their boat. The men aboard appeared Burmese, says Kujur, adding that he gestured to convey he was lost and hungry.They saw me point to my mouth and understood. One of the fishing trawlers hitched our boat to theirs and took us to a (Myanmarese) navy ship, he said.The (Navy) men were kind but aloof. They went through our documents, says Kujur, pulling out his identity card, wrapped in a plastic bag. The card, headlined Republic of India, carries a unique number and an old photograph of a young Kujur, along with his personal details  name, his address in Mayabunder in the Andamans and his age: 29 yrs as on 01/01/2002.Kujur remembers the wave of relief that swept over him as he got on board the Navy ship. After weeks on a rocking, battered dinghy, that was the first time he had stepped on something stable.Kujur and Biswas stayed two days and nights on the ship. They placed a call to the seth to inform him about the storm, the goods that had been lost and that they were alive. Kujur says the seth was not pleased to hear about his losses, but agreed to inform their families and the Andaman Police.On the third day, we were put back on our boat with a compass and advised to keep moving southwards. We were told that we would reach the Andamans in four days and nights, Kujur claims, adding that they were given 17 packets of Maggi and four loaves of bread, along with water and 260 litres of fuel.Kujur says they were hesitant to go back on the sea, but the food and the human contact had raised their spirits. In hindsight, we should not have tempted the sea so soon. We should have asked for better provisions. We were so grateful to be rescued that we forgot the need to remain vigilant, says Kujur.A day later, another storm bore down upon them. A storm at sea is scary. The lightning flashes threaten to hit you any moment. The thunder is ten times louder than on land, Kujur says.Biswas and I were scared out of our wits. We had tempted fate by returning to the water and were being punished, Kujur says, recalling the high waves that crashed into their boat, sweeping away their supplies, fuel, and food. After about an hour, the storm subsided, leaving the two exactly as they were before. Lost.Almost hysterical with grief, Kujur says he and his friend resigned themselves to whatever came next. Without fuel for the boat, and with no food and water this time round, the suffering was intense, says Kujur. The men knew drinking sea water dehydrates the body, but they did it anyway when thirst got the better of them. I would dip a towel into the waves and wring the cloth over our mouths for a few drops each time. Our thirst increased, but what could we have done?Biswas, says Kujur, drank more than they had decided. The sea water was harming him, but he did not heed any advice. His body could not stand the hunger and thirst. He wasted away before my eyes, lying listless for hours on the boat.Ten days before Kujur sighted land, Biswas passed away quietly one night. I realised he was gone when his body did not move for hours. I carried his body to the edge of the boat and tipped him into the water, claims Kujur, adding that he was too drained to feel any emotion at the time.The 10 days after his friends death, before he touched land, are a blur, says Kujur. Adding that he was too weak to even think, he says he couldnt tell day from night as he lay on his back, the waves bobbing the little boat around.Early one morning, the dinghy grazed against a rock. Despite being completely drained, Kujur says he instantly knew the boat had touched land.I waited for an hour or two for the sun to come up. Then I got down from my boat and my knees sank into the sand. I could not walk and lay in the water till my feet could support me better, he says.Kujur says he will never forget the first three things he saw that indicated he was near a human settlement. I saw a coconut that had been chopped off at one end for someone to drink its juice. Then I saw cow dung on the ground. Walking further, I came across a well. I cried realising I was among human beings once more.***While Kujurs is a story of human grit in the face of unimaginable odds, with parallels being drawn to Yann Martels Life of Pi and Gabriel Garcia Marquezs account of a real-life event in The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor, it has raised its share of questions and scepticism.The Sunday Express, while attempting to corroborate Kujurs account, found two missing persons reports published in Andamans local papers, The Daily Telegram and the Andaman Chronicle.Denis Giles, editor of the Andaman Chronicle, said his paper carried the report on September 6 featuring Amrit Kujur and Bindhyaranjan Biswas. The report was published in the paper after the local police forwarded it to us, Giles said.Describing Kujur and Biswas, the report stated, The above persons went missing since 28/08/19 night on the way from Joda Kilan (Sippighat) to Saheed Dweep along with an Engine Dinghy namely Kavya Darshini.Speaking with The Sunday Express on phone, Kujurs wife Lilli said, Yes, we have three daughters and he has had to take risks to put food on the table. But I dont want him to go back to the seas again.The Director General of Police, Andaman and Nicobar Administration, Deependra Pathak, admits he is cautious about Kujurs story, but adds that he will wait to hear from Kujur. On whether a boat could have left the Andaman Islands undetected, he said, On the particular day (August 28), the weather was a bit stormy, so he could have (gone missing without being seen).He also confirms that the local administration got a call from Myanmar on Kujur and Biswas being found in their waters, following which a letter was sent to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), requesting for their deportation from Myanmar. I guess the (Myanmar) authorities released them before the letter reached the MEA, said the DGP.However, Pathak concedes it will be difficult to verify every detail of Kujurs story, especially the circumstances in which Biswas died. Let us hope he can give us a logical explanation, he says.Dr Santanu Kumar Jena, who attended to Kujur in Puri, said that while it was clear that the man had lost weight, he displayed no symptoms consistent with complete starvation for 28 days or of survival on sea water. His liver and kidney function tests were normal. He had undergone weight loss, but not as severe as one might expect after prolonged starvation. It seems he definitely had little to eat, but perhaps did not starve completely, said Jena, hinting that Kujur may have allowed for exaggerations in his account.Kujurs discharge papers from the hospital indicate he was diagnosed with colitis with possible acid peptic disease, which, doctors say, could be due to infection, hunger and rapid weight loss.Jena also said Kujur did not seem to be disoriented or traumatised after such a psychologically taxing experience. He spoke normally, made eye contact, smiled, said Jena, adding that different people, however, react differently to adverse situations.At the urban shelter home in Puri, where Kujur stayed for five days, his handlers too said he didnt display any visible signs of trauma. He was brought to us within 24 hours of reaching land, says Soumya, who stayed by Kujurs side throughout his stay in Puri. From the hour of his arrival, he spoke normally.The other question looming around Kujurs story is whether it is possible for a dinghy to float all the way from the Andamans to Myanmar.Dr Sourav Sil, Assistant Professor at IIT Bhubaneswar who researches physical oceanography and ocean circulation modeling, says it is not impossible. The water stretch between Port Blair (on the eastern side of the Andaman Islands) and the southern tips of Myanmar is relatively calm. It is possible for a non-motorised boat to float from Port Blair to Mynamar waters due to eddies, says Sil.The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains eddies in simple terms: The ocean is a huge body of water that is constantly in motion. General patterns of ocean flow are called currents. Sometimes, these currents can pinch off sections and create circular currents of water called an eddy.But what happens if a non-motorised boat attempts to float from Myanmar towards the Andaman Islands? Sils hypothesis is that the boat will float westwards till it reaches the east coast in India, a supposition that is broadly consistent with Kujurs account of the second part of his journey, from Myanmar to Odisha.The flow in the Bay of Bengal differs season to season. We can detect circulation patterns from the Andamans to the (east) Indian coast. There is a process called Rossby Wave, which propagates westwards throughout the year, Sil explains.***On October 25, Kujur reached Khirisahi village in Puris coastal Krushnaprasad block, around 1,200 km from Port Blair, where he was swept away into the deep sea.He spent the next five days in Puri, at a shelter home run by the NGO Odisha Patita Uddhan Samiti, with the district administration footing the bill for his food, clothes and medicines.On October 30, Kujur left for home, accompanied by an official of the Puri administration  a road trip to Bhubaneswar, followed by a flight to Kolkata and then Port Blair.AdvertisingAt the Puri district hospital, Kujur had predicted his life would never be the same. I know I will be asked to tell this story all my life. People may believe or dismiss my story, but they will still want to hear it."
2019-11-02,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/if-its-deep-fried-its-bengali/article29863705.ece,"If it’s deep-fried, it’s Bengali","The main industry / in Kolkata  real estate / and telebhaja: Amit Chaudhuri, from TelebhajaMy friend from Berlin was delighted to discover pumpkin flowers in the markets of Kolkata.You eat pumpkin flowers too? she asked. How do you prepare them?Oh we dip them in batter and deep-fry them, I replied cheerily. She seemed rather crestfallen. She had been thinking she was about to discover the Bengali equivalent of Italian zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese. Just dunking them in besan and tossing them in a kadhai of hot bubbling oil seemed less inspiring.I could see her point. Once you dip something in heavy batter and deep fry it, it didnt much matter anymore whether it was yellow pumpkin blossoms or white bokphool flowers or any other flower to start with.The fact is Bengalis like to deep-fry everything  pumpkin slices, eggplants, greens, even the crunchy seeds of overripe parwals. Everything is fair game  vegetables, flowers, tiger prawns, fish roe, chicken lollipops. I am surprised our fairy tales arent filled with wicked witches who try to deep-fry little children.Pakoras and dumplingsDeep-fried is an adjective in English. In Bengali it acquires the solidity of a noun, telebhaja. Which literally means Things Fried in Oil. It could be begunis, batter-fried eggplant slices; or peyajis, little pakoras made of fine-chopped onion and green chillis; or it could be aloo chops, first cousins to aloo bondas but with thinner besan coatings. Winter lunches mean little florets of batter-fried cauliflower, while deep-fried crispy tiny mourala fish are perfect for any season. In recent years dal-vada wallah carts have sprung up in street corners all over Kolkata, frying up mounds of spicy little lentil dumplings that are served piping hot in newspaper packets, the oil stain spreading deliciously over the newsprint as if tracing a map of illicit pleasures.The Bengali romance with the deep-fried is not new. Pragyasundari Devis seminal cookbook of Bengali recipes from 1902 has over 100 recipes under Bhajibhuji aka Fried-This-And-That. She fries things I did not even know existed  gaandaal leaves, delo and punko saag  as well as things I would have thought defied frying  like pineapples, green papaya and jackfruit. Do not skimp on the oil, she warns. It will become limp instead of crunchy. Fry in batches. Dont overcrowd. Haste makes soggy.She assures us that something fried, whether batter-fried or shallow-fried, can accompany almost everything on a Bengali plate.With rice and khichdi you can try fried vegetables or fuluris, puffy besan dumplings. With pulaos, she recommends koftas and chops, the Bengali answer to croquettes. With puffed luchis (themselves deep-fried), you can have fried eggplant or fried parwal.Fried potatoes pair excellently with mutton or duck roast. And all this does not include the procession of deep-fried treats that accompany the afternoon cup of cha.The devilled eggTea-time snacks or jolkhabar is a Bengali orgy of deep-fried excess, starting with the humble singhara and the simple kalonji-speckled kucho nimki munchies to the vegetable chop, that curious ball of grated beetroot with raisins and peanuts. From here we quickly climb the food chain to diamond fish fries, mutton breast cutlet, fowl cutlets, fish fingers, and the lethal butter-fried Fish Orly. Many of these have colonial roots, though now thoroughly Bengalicised. A devilled egg in the rest of the world is a cold snack made with a boiled egg, its yolk mashed with mustard and mayo. An Egg Devil in Kolkata is a boiled egg wrapped with minced meat, dunked in breadcrumbs and deep-fried.I remember going to a Calcutta Classic Food Festival that celebrated some of Kolkatas most legendary snack shops. Chitto-das Suruchee, Niranjan Agar, Apanjan, Allen Cafe, Mitra Caf, started in 1910-11 not by a Mr. Mitra but by a Mr. Sushil Roy who wanted to create a hangout for friends or mitra. Each eatery has its own iconic dish, deep-fried of course. Allen Kitchen has its gloriously batter-fried Sp. Prawn Cutlet Big (Pure Ghee), though its Fish Fry sticks to refined oil. They say Bengali superstar Uttam Kumar frequented Mitra Cafe for its Chicken Kabiraji  the Bengali version of the British cover egg cutlet  where the chicken fillet is covered with a coating of deep-fried egg batter that makes a lacy egg doily oozing oil. It is not meant for the faint of heart.Iconic brain chopMitra Cafes real speciality, though, is its iconic brain chop. Imagine a deep-fried tennis ball with gooey goat brain inside. For those less daring, theres Chitto-das classic Diamond Fish Fry or Fish Roll, minced fish surrounded by a layer of Kolkata bhetki, then deep-fried.The only vegetables in sight at that food festival were raw onions and slivers of cucumber pretending to be a salad. I did not touch them. After all, you can get E. coli from cut raw vegetables.Perhaps thats the scientific reason behind this love for all things deep-fried. It might clog the arteries but at least no pesky germ can survive that wok of boiling oil.Yet, it is still the humble telebhaja, minus the attraction of a Kolkata bhetki or chicken breast, which remains the true marker of Bengali-ness. The hole-in-the-wall telebhaja shops rarely have names, or if they do, they are names like Potlas Shop or Naren-das Shop, but their clientele is devoted. And some have a hallowed history.Netajis snacksOn a road once named after Lord Cornwallis, theres a telebhaja shop that specialises in the usual favourites along with more exotic offerings like mango chop, soya bean chop and coconut chop. But thats not why its famous. Lakshmi Narayan Shaw & Sons was opened in 1918 by one Khedu Shaw. Back in the day it apparently supplied young Subhas Chandra Bose with all things deep-fried, especially during the secret meetings he held with other freedom fighters. In 1942, Shaw babu started to secretly distribute free snacks on Netajis birthday, a grease-stained act of subversion in our freedom struggle that we remain tragically uninformed about. Somehow, it makes our heroes more human, knowing that on a rainy monsoon evening, between meetings plotting how to throw off the yoke of colonialism, they paused for some aloor chop.But our favourite telebhaja shop was more humble. Nalin-dada was the cook who accompanied my mother as a new bride into the jungles of Madhya Pradesh where my civil engineer father was building a bridge. When they returned to Kolkata, Nalin-dada set up a telebhaja stall outside our house where he fried eggplants and onion pakoras every evening while his children and I played hide-and-seek.I can still picture his little display case lit by the flame of a kerosene lamp, with fresh-fried begunis and peyajis piled in a basket.My great-grandmother was a huge fan of his telebhaja. Actually, she was a fan of all things deep-fried, her appetite undiminished till the very end. Once in her 90s she fell down and bust her head. As the family scurried around trying to staunch the blood, she called out plaintively to the old maid, Jamuna, remember to soak the dal. I want to have dal bada tomorrow. My mother scolded her for her insatiable appetite for fried food but now, whenever we eat dal vada at lunch, she remembers her wistfully.In these parts, even our nostalgia is deep-fried.Moong BeguniAs found in Amish o Niramish, Vol. 1, the cookbook by Pragyasundari Devi.Getty Images/ iStockIngredients60g whole moong dal2 tbsp rice flour15g white sesame seeds75g eggplant1/2 tsp salt3 tbsp gheeMethod1. Soak the moong dal in water. After one hour remove the peels and wash the dal several times and grind to a paste. Rinse the sesame seeds.2. Cut the eggplant into round slices and rub salt on them. You should have 13-14 slices of eggplants.3. Beat the dal paste vigorously. Put a drop into some water, if it floats you do not need to beat it any more. Now add the rice flour, sesame seeds and salt. Smear the eggplant slices with the mixture.4. Heat the ghee. After a few minutes add the eggplant 3-4 at a time and fry till they are crunchy and brown. Each should take about three minutes.The author of Dont Let Him Know, like many Bengalis, likes to let everyone know about his opinions."
2019-11-02,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/nov/02/being-socially-adept-2055776.html,Being socially adept,"By Express News ServiceBENGALURU : Good morning, Bangalore!Who would think that a trip to the energetic and eclectic city of arc lights and fast cars would turn out to be a lotus eaters paradise type holiday for me? Ensconced in a chilled out space with a bevy of family and friends, eating out, partying and intimate evenings with a cup of cold coffee and Netflix, Im in a happy place. But, all good things must come to an end, and Im preparing to get back to my life in Bangalore next week with a wee bit of trepidation.Penaz Masani with Zubin SongadwalaIt is quite ironical because when friends and family from Mumbai visit me in Bangalore, they are always blown away by the weather and the green cover. Yes! Even a diehard big city slicker is bamboozled by our chaotic traffic, but in general Bangalore scores brownie points that make me beam with pride. Yet, when I come back to Mumbai, my old home town, I am always marvelling at the effort made to improve the infrastructure of this burgeoning city and the adaptiveness and industriousness of its people.Even the local veggie vendor who comes to the door (everything comes to the door, including a fine bottle of wine or a single malt), will coax me to buy new potatoes (navva batata) and fresh leek, and helpfully offer me a leek and potato soup recipe to boot! The local bread and egg vendor will exhort the virtues of gluten phree bread.I love that! And my fellow Bangoloreans, I have tasted the best version of masala dosas in amchi Mumbai! Mutton, chicken and egg dosas joggle for place with the three cheese or butter dosas. And all the traditionalists who are turning your noses up while reading this if you dont change, innovate and adapt, you become fossilised.I met the wonder boy restaurateur and a friend, Riyaaz Amlani, for a quick breakfast at his eclectic restaurant, Carter Road Social. Breakfast is big in Mumbai, and people tend to frequent small cafes or their favourite Iranian chai points for a bite before work, and on weekends after a game of soccer or cricket. Riyaaz has cleverly filled that spot where people of all ages can hang out and grab a bite in the mornings or through the day, with great cocktails or beer in the evenings. He runs a string of restaurants that serves every demographic profile or psychographic profile (as he likes to call it). I asked him what the secret sauce of success was, and he smiled and said, I wish I knew. If you know please tell me.A young and dynamic entrepreneur, the affable Riyaaz believes in giving his customers the mind space and a choice of how, where and when they would like to dine. Owner of the successful string of Socials and Smoke House Delis in Bangalore, I asked him if he was planning on opening out the other brands he has under his belt in Bangalore. Well, he doesnt, for the moment, folks, but we should feel chuffed to hear that he considers namma ooru a chilled-out place, with friendly and accepting people who love their drink!Dear friend Zubin Songadwala, who has taken over as the Area Manager - West of ITC Hotels, invited us to a supper theatre at their ITC Grand Central.It was great meeting the glitzy Mumbaikars who were amused by the squeals of delight emitted by me as I saw Zubin and his lovely wife Monisha. The hors doeuvres and sushi were to die for, and after discreet murmur into the ear of a waiting staff member by Zubin, a plate laden with my favourite sushi magically appeared in spite of the melee! Its always great to know the boss! An impeccable evening and Im looking forward to more before my return.Next week, same place, same time Adios."
2019-11-03,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/what-is-tamil-nadus-contract-farming-law/article29865332.ece,What is Tamil Nadu’s contract farming law?,"The story so far: Tamil Nadu has become the first State to enact a law on contract farming, based on the lines of a model legislation put out by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare in May 2018. Called the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act of 2019, the law got the assent of President Ram Nath Kovind last month. The State Assembly adopted the contract farming bill in February.What does contract farming mean?The law defines it as a written agreement between a farmer and a buyer for producing an agricultural produce/product or rearing livestock. It covers a whole range of activities in the entire agri-value chain  from pre-production to production to post-production. No genetically modified crops are permitted. Price, quantity and the delivery schedule are fixed during negotiations between the two parties.The law, which covers over 110 items of agricultural produce, requires every purchaser to register himself or herself with a designated officer. Likewise, every agreement has to be recorded with the officer concerned. There are two types of contracts  one for production support (such as inputs supply) and purchase and another, only for buying.The Act, while permitting farmers to lease out their agricultural land or premises to buyers, however prohibits the latter from raising any permanent structure or creating any kind of leasehold rights or any kind of charge of whatever nature on lands of farmers.A few days ago, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami made it clear that there would be no compulsion for either of the parties  farmers or purchasers  to sign contracts under the law. It would be purely voluntary, he clarified. Rules, being framed, will lend more clarity.How have laws of the land dealt with the concept?The Central government, as early as in 2003, formulated a model law on the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, which provided for direct sale of farm produce to contract farming sponsors. Three years later, the Maharashtra government amended the Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 1963, to introduce norms on contract farming agreements. In 2013, Punjab enacted a separate law which, apparently due to political reasons, has not yet been put into effect.Why did Tamil Nadu frame a separate law?The absence of an exclusive legal framework on agreements for contract farming had been a matter of concern for authorities in the State who were frequently being called upon to intervene and resolve issues between farmers and purchasers/firms including matters relating to delay in payment. Also, there is nothing categorical in the States Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1987, on the subject.Besides, the authorities were of the view that under the given legal provisions, they had a very little role to play in sorting out disputes over formal contract farming agreements. Small and marginal farmers may not prefer to go for litigation for reasons of affordability.Even though the State has seen, over the last 25 years, such pacts being signed between farmers and purchasers or firms including those between cocoa farmers of the Coimbatore district and a confectionery major and tapioca farmers and Sagoserve, it cannot, in the words of former Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University C. Ramasamy, boast of very many great success stories. As transactions between the farming community and private traders or firms have been generally informal, the State government, by enacting the law, is hoping to formalise it.In March 2018, Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister, O. Panneerselvam, in his Budget speech, announced that the State government would enact a law on contract farming to sustain agricultural production and promote agro-processing industries.Safeguarding the interests of farmers, especially small and marginal ones, in times of violent price fluctuations, and ensuring better prices for them are among the key reasons behind the law.How will disputes be addressed?In case parties to the dispute are not able to thrash out their differences through negotiations or mediation, they can approach a dispute settlement committee, comprising the sub-collector as chairman and three members, one each representing farmers or farmer producer organisations, agro-industry and domain experts.The committee shall resolve the dispute in 30 days and its decisions carry the force of decrees of a civil court.Those aggrieved over the panels orders can approach the respective district collector, who shall dispose of the appeal in 30 days. The authorities have been empowered to recover a decretal amount as arrears of land revenue. The collectors orders can be challenged before the State Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Authority.Is there any safeguard in the Act for farmers against the possibility of facing legal cases due to alleged violation of intellectual property rights?Yes. According to Section 22 (2) (1) of the Act, farmers are permitted to sell a portion of agricultural produce to others, after meeting commitments under the contract for production support and purchase. This clause, according to officials of Tamil Nadu government, will help farmers in instances similar to what was experienced by potato farmers of Gujarat early this year when PepsiCo had filed a case (which has been withdrawn)."

While the retail price of onion has shot up again after a brief phase of stability, other vegetables are not far behind.While the former is being sold at Rs 55-65/kg against the wholesale price of Rs 4,000-4,500/quintal, standard retail price of other vegetables are on an average Rs 80/kg. Vegetables like brinjal and tomato are priced at Rs 50/kg while other vegetables including bitter gourd, raw banana, beans, ladys fingers, cabbage, cauliflower and ridge gourd are priced above Rs 70-80 per kg.The surge in onion prices is attributed to higher prices at source market, Nasik district of Maharashtra being the major supplier.Sources at Kuberpuri said according to the wholesale market for onion and potato at Aiginia on the city outskirts, retail price should be maximum Rs 50/kg. It is job of retail traders to display both wholesale and retail prices at their counters. The traders are benefiting to lack of supervision by field staff of the Food Supplies department, they said.The onion prices soared in the last couple of days due to low import from Nasik and Andhra Pradesh. With improved supply, prices of the commodity will cool down in the next 4-5 days, said general secretary of Kuberapuri Merchant Association Shakti Shankar Mishra.The wholesale market of the city on Sunday received around 250 tonnes of onion against its daily requirement of 200 tonnes. If onion supply to the State remains stable, its price is bound to fall, he said.Onion prices have remained high in the State since September following massive rains in Maharashtra as onion-producing districts - Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar-reported extensive crop damage. Kharif onions from Maharashtra usually arrive after Diwali, Mishra added."

The monthly budget of an average Malayali is likely to be affected soon owing to a steep increase in the prices of some essential vegetables. The items that saw a hike in prices include two of the basic ingredients in every Malayalis platter  onion and garlic.The prices of onion and garlic have gone up mainly because of the shortage in supply. Most of the central and northern states and neighbouring Karnataka received heavy rain in October, affecting the production. This has led to a demand-supply mismatch. Kerala, too, has been witnessing heavy rain for the past few weeks. As vegetables are highly perishable, traders cannot take the risk of keeping additional stocks, said Nazeer M M, a trader at Kakkanad.The traders said the prices will remain high until new stocks arrive.The prices of onion, shallot (small onion), garlic, potato and tomato have increased steeply. The price of just one kilogram of garlic has increased by Rs 90 from the last month, to cross Rs 200 mark this month. Likewise, the price of small onion has increased by Rs 35 from last moth. Fortunately, the prices of many other vegetables remain stable.According to traders, more local produce are expected to hit the market in two weeks. Under the Palakkad zone, vegetables will be procured from Vadakarappathi, Perumatty, Elevancherry, Kollengode and Kizhakkencherry.Prices have mainly gone up for the items brought from other states. According to traders, the October rain that lashed states like Maharashtra  one of the major suppliers of onion to Kerala  had led to the price hike, said Uma P, Palakkad district manager, Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Kerala (VFPCK).The prices will become stable if more local produce are brought to the retail market. After the recent floods, our domestic vegetable production has gathered momentum. We expect that cowpea, bitter gourd, snake gourd and tomato grown in various areas in Palakkad will reach the market in the coming weeks, Uma said."

Prices surged ever higher over the last few days, with onions currently being sold at Rs 80-Rs 90 per kg in retail outlets in the state capital of Bhopal.The prices are peaking in other cities as well.Excessive rains this year destroyed the onion crop in both MP and Maharashtra, which is another prominent supplier of the commodity, leading to a short supply that pushed up prices, said Rajendra Saini, a wholeseller at the local Karond Mandi.Saini said onions were selling at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale market on Thursday, adding the situation would be the same unless supplies improve drastically in the near future.Saini said the same is the case with other vegetables. Garlic prices have shot up almost five times, selling at Rs 150 a kg in the city. While the price of tomatoes has increased from Rs 25 per kg to Rs 40-Rs 50 per kg over the last few days, potatoes are now selling at Rs 20 per kg as compared to Rs 7 per kg earlier.Salim Khan, a vegetable vendor from Bittan Market, said most of the vegetables were selling at Rs 10 to Rs 25 last year.Onion prices are slightly lower in Indore, which is based in the onion-growing region of Malwa and Nimar. Since farmers with inferior quality of tainted onions, fearing rotting, are unable to send their produce long distances, they dump the crops in Indore mandi, said another Indore-based whole-seller Ajay Agarwal.To prevent rotting, suppliers are buying old stocks of onions and mixing them with the new inferior stock in order to enable the consignments to reach long distances without rotting, he added. Agrawal said onions are selling at Rs 45-Rs 48 per kg in wholesale markets and Rs 60-Rs 70 in retail markets.If the weather and supplies improve, only then will the prices of onions and other vegetables cool down, said Agarwal, blaming the dwindling supplies on heavy rainfall. MP has witnessed 148% of the normal rate of rainfall this year, with the agricultural-rich Malwa-Nimar regions primarily bearing the brunt of the rain fury.Most traders believe the prices will reduce once the supplies improve and fresh stocks hit the market, which could take within a fortnight to a month.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-11-12,https://www.news18.com/news/india/eat-lancet-an-ideal-diet-meant-to-improve-human-health-isnt-affordable-for-1-58-billion-people-2383247.html,"EAT-Lancet, an Ideal Diet Meant to Improve Human Health, Isn’t Affordable for 1.58 Billion People","New Delhi: The international food security discourse vis a vis the goal towards universal public health has a new deadlock  affordability. The EAT-Lancet universal diet, meant to improve human and planetary health, has been found to be unaffordable for close to 1.58 billion people across sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, according to a new study.The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University in their study Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis, have for the first time calculated the cost of foods needed for healthy and sustainable diet across the globe.William Masters, senior author of the study and economist at Tufts, pointed that EAT-Lancets pioneering benchmark diet deliberately did not take its cost into account.Earlier in January, the EAT-Lancet Commission of Food, Planet and Health had published a report recommending a universal diet for a radical transformation of the global food systems to achieve planetary health for 10 billion people by 2050.The diet provided a calorie consumption of 2,503 kcal per day with small servings for animal sources foods and large servings for fruits and vegetables, as is in high-income countries. Based on their nutritional content and environmental affect, the EAT-Lancet report specified which food groups may be substituted for each other, as per region specific availability and consumption practices.Researchers at IFPRI and Tufts University found that the recommended diet was 64 per cent costlier than the lowest-cost combination of foods that would provide a balance mix of 20 essential nutrients. The diet is richer in animal-source foods and fruits and vegetables than is required for nutrient adequacy.In addition, the quantities recommended for consumption are much higher than presently consumed in low-income countries. The global median of the proposed diet will cost 2.84 USD per day, said Kalle Hirvonen, lead author and development economist at IFPRI in Ethiopia.In low-income countries, that amounts to 89.1 per cent of a households daily per capital income, which is more than people can usually spend on food, she added. In high-income countries, the same diet costs only 6.1 per cent of per-capita income.Cost of UnaffordabilityCountries in the developing world do not earn as much as half the cost of the recommended diet. For instance, in the South of Sahara - the most unaffordable region  nearly 57 per cent of people earn lesser than the local cost of the EAT-Lancet diet. Similarly, in South Asia, 38.4 per cent of the population earns lesser than 2.84 USD, while Middle East and North Africa are 19.4 per cent, the study found.Affordability of the universal diet only increases in East, Pacific, Latin America where only less than 15 per cent of the populations may be unable to afford it. In relative terms, the diet is most suited for the per capita income of Europe, Central Asia and North America.Although 1.58 billion is a lot of people, it is actually a conservative lower limit on the total number who cannot afford the diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission. The cost of food preparation and of non-food necessities ensure that an even larger number of people cannot afford that kind of healthy diet, Masters said in a release.A large part of the cost of this diet lies in its goal to double the consumption of healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, and a greater than 50 per cent reduction in global food consumption of less healthy foods such as added sugars and red meat. That, the consumption of potatoes (293 per cent) and red meat (288 per cent) is way beyond the recommended health boundary globally, is a cause for concern in the report.The cut down on the consumption of red meat (638 per cent), potatoes (171 per cent), chicken (234 per cent) and eggs (268 per cent) is especially focused in North America. However, reducing the diet gap globally via proposed boundaries within which the global food production must stay within must not be proposed without considering the income and affordability of each country, authors of the study have argued.Local AffordabilityAccording to the studys global analysis, fruits and vegetables (31.2 per cent) make up the largest part of the 2.84 USD cost, followed by legumes and nuts (18.7 per cent) and meat, eggs and fish (15.2 per cent). The share of fruits and vegetables decreased from 35 per cent to 26.7 per cent for high-income countries to low-income countries respectively, but are relatively higher for lower income given their per capita income.However, the diets largest share in lower income countries came from animal sources food groups (dairy, meat, eggs and fish) at 32.8 per cent. The same was lowest for upper-middle-income countries at 26.2 per cent.Even if many poor consumers were to aspire to consume healthier and more environmentally sustainable foods, income and price constraints frequently render this diet unaffordable. Increased earnings and safety-net transfers, as well as systemic changes to lower food prices, are needed to bring healthy and sustainable diets within reach of the worlds poor, said Hirvonen.Researchers at Tufts and IFPRI drew on retail prices for standardised items obtained through the International Comparison Program. They used prices for 744 food items in 159 countries and then identified the lowest-cost combination of items in each country. To compare food cost with per capita income, the study drew on data from the World Banks PovcalNet system.Although the study recognises the positive impact of the EAT-Lancet diet, it asks for a renewed approach to it. It suggests looking at combination of higher income and lower prices, tastes and habits, and nutritional knowledge while making changes to dietary preferences.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-11-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/wedding-day-bridal-make-up-easy-skincare-tips-natural-glow-6114094/,Get that perfect glow on your wedding day with these easy skincare tips,"While most brides have prepared a checklist of things to do before the D-day, many may not be aware that incorrect skincare procedures may lead to last-minute breakouts or skin allergies. Therefore, it becomes significant to pay attention to ones skincare routine, especially closer to the wedding date.AdvertisingHere is a skincare routine that brides should incorporate in their routine, at least two months before the wedding day.1. Set a skincare regime according to your skin type: cleansing, toning, moisturising, use of sunscreen, exfoliation and a night regime.2. Regular hydration sets the tone for achieving the perfect glow. Dry or flaky skin could lead to cakey make-up. So, before the winters hit and literally suck the life out of your skin, begin moisturising your skin regularly. Cleansing and toning are important to get that perfect glow. Wash your face with a herbal face wash and follow it up with some toning with rose water and moisturising. Follow the mantra of cleanse, tone and moisturise once everyday, and you will soon see the difference.Advertising3. Eat a healthy balanced diet with loads of antioxidants. Start drinking green tea, preferably every day. Not only can this help with weight loss  alongside a good diet and exercise regime, of course  but many people swear by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to help brighten the skin and reduce acne.4. Hydrate well; drink at least 3-3.5 litres of water everyday. Water helps to get rid off toxins from the body.5. At least six-eight hours of uninterrupted sleep is a must. One can keep cut slices of cucumber or potato to fight the dark circles.6. If you are dieting, remember to take a good multi-vitamin supplement as well. If you arent consuming the right amount of nutrients as per your bodily needs, it will show on your hair, skin and nails. Omega oils are also great for your skin and body.7. Always remember to remove make-up before going to bed.8. Theres going to be a lot of focus on your hands on your big day. So massage sweet almond oil into your hands and nails on a daily basis, and by your big day your nails will be stronger and your hands will be super soft. If your hands tend to be flaky, you can also make yourself a DIY hand scrub by mixing together a little olive oil and sugar. Use it to gently exfoliate, following up by moisturising with sweet almond oil.9. Bridal make-up starts with good skin  no foundation will look perfect without a smooth, exfoliated base. Once youve got your skincare regime perfected, try a matte primer to keep your foundation on for longer and to keep oil at bay.10. Finally, dont forget your lips. Wear a good quality lip balm and re-apply regularly throughout the day. Do this for at least a week before your wedding and your lips will be beautifully soft and smooth.What to avoid:1. Brides must definitely avoid salon facials, new skin care products or chemical peels for the first time. All treatments need to be guided by a dermatologist.With inputs from dermatologist and aesthetic physician Dr Pallavi Sule."
2019-11-12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-silver-lining-to-the-kc-valley-project/article29956197.ece,A silver lining to the KC Valley project,"Sixty-five-year-old Chowdappa is taking out his bicycle to head home for lunch in Chowdadenahalli, Kolar. With the south-west monsoon continuing well beyond its usual season, it was an opportunity for farmers like him to make the most of the extended monsoon.He owns a one-acre farm where he grows ragi. We grow just enough to feed our family and not for sale. We can cultivate ragi only if there is rain. We did not get much rain this year too, but the last few days have been better. There is water in the kere (lake), which has helped this time, he said, adding that when he cannot do take up farming, he works as a daily-wage labourer.Another monsoon has passed, and according to the IMDs official figures for June to September, Kolar district, which had been declared drought hit seven times since 2011, had a 20% deficiency in rain this year too.Finally, something changed this year; borewells are slowly springing back to life, and lakes are filling up, pumping up water tables despite the failure of the monsoon. And people are giving credit to the controversial KC Valley project, which pumps treated water from Bengalurus sewage to tanks in Kolar district.In Bellur, 70-year-old Neerganta Ramaiah is resting under a tree with other men from the village. There was no water in the kere for nearly 20 years. If it rains, its our good fortune. I have five acres, and apart from ragi, maize and avare (lub lub), I even cultivated eucalyptus on one acre because I thought something is better than nothing. Due to the project, the borewell has started working again. We know it is dirty water, but we believe the earth has its way of treating it, he said.Another farmer Namgyappa vehemently argues: It is dirty water. There are no takers for it.M. Srinivas, whose farm is close to the Lakshmisagar lake, said the water was unfit for direct consumption. But we were in a dire position. This project has indirectly helped rejuvenate farms and fodder for cattle, he said, though saying it was too early to call the project a success.Project to fill 126 tanksC. Mruthyunjaya Swamy, secretary, Minor Irrigation Department, told The Hindu that the project, which aims to fill 126 tanks in the district, has filled 40 so far. We have pumped 2.5 tmcft overall and the aim is to pump 5.5 tmcft in one year. The daily discharge of 310 MLD of treated water from the BWSSB is being pumped into the project, with the Lakshmisagar lake being the first discharge point. The Srinivasa Agrahara lake is the last point. Around 20 km have been covered and we have another 25 km to go, he said.On Monday, the State government told the High Court of Karnataka that the Indian Institute of Science has been requested to study the environmental and public health impact of the KC Valley project.The water was never intended for direct use. The main aim was to help increase the groundwater level, and the treated water, once it enters the earth, is purified and helps push up groundwater. We have put up multiple checks in place and pumping is stopped immediately if there is any variation, said Mr. Swamy.Situation upstreamBut the scene is less optimistic upstream. Mahesh Kumar, 29, is tending to his marigold plants on a hot afternoon. His family also cultivates tomato, potato, brinjal, ridgegourd, and bottlegourd. Much of this is sold in Bengaluru city. Their profit margins are thin.For one kg beans, we are paid 10 to 15 in the market, 25 very rarely. Weekly once, we travel to the city in a tempo, for which we need to pay 100 for every 35 kg of produce. The borewells we drilled are 960 ft and 1,200 ft deep. The project has not helped those who are upstream. Due to the deficiency in rain, we leave one or two acres uncultivated, he said.Mr. Swamy said the project will cover the areas upstream in the second phase. By 2021, we hope to fill all tanks of Kolar, he said."

The previous low was in June 2016 when the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation was a negative 0.1 per cent.In September this year, the WPI-based inflation was at 0.33 per cent, while it stood at 5.54 per cent in October 2018.The rate of price rise for food articles was 9.80 per cent during the month, while for non-food articles it stood at 2.35 per cent, showed the latest data released by the commerce and industry ministry.The wholesale inflation in potato remained in the negative zone at 19.60 per cent (from -22.50 per cent in September).However, for vegetables, the inflation jumped to 38.91 per cent in October from 19.43 per cent a month ago, while that for pulses, it remained elevated at 16.57 per cent as compared with 17.94 per cent.For fruits, it eased to 2.72 per cent during the month as against 6.67 per cent in September. While, wholesale inflation in manufactured products was (-)0.84 per cent in October 2019.""The sequential dip in the WPI inflation in October 2019 was led by core items, fuel and power, minerals, and crude petroleum and natural gas, whereas inflation for primary food and non-food articles, and manufactured food products recorded an uptick,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist at ICRA.Among other articles, in the WPI basket, the inflation for the fuel and light category declined further to -8.27 per centRahul Gupta, currency research head, Emkay Global Financial Services, said, ""The data in wholesale prices signals that there is still lack of demand in segments such as manufacturing, metals, and chemical products. While only a surge in vegetable prices led to a rise in WPI from the market forecast. The continued weakness in WPI along with slowing growth will induce the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to cut repo rate again in December.""The retail inflation for the month hit a 16-month high of 4.62 per cent due to soaring prices of food articles, including fruit and vegetables, according to data released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation on Wednesday.The RBI takes into account the retail inflation data to decide on its bi-monthly monetary policy announcement, which is due early next month."
2019-11-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-lisbon-connection/article29985612.ece,The Lisbon connection,"Chef Andr Magalhes is full of tales. He weaves history and anecdotes into delightful stories about food. By the side, he also creates delicious meals. Born in Angola, Magalhes has a colourful history. He has dabbled in the movie industry, did a short stint as a sailor, a tourist guide and set decorator. Today, he teaches food science, is a journalist, and the chef of the celebrated Taberna da Rua das Flores in Lisbon.Beyond the clichsHe is in India to curate a menu, Finding Lisbon in Goa, at O Pedro that seeks inspiration from his travels to Goa and harks back to its Portuguese origins. Magalhes is all set take over the O Pedro kitchen for two days, while select dishes will be on the menu until the end of the month.The challenge was to create a menu that illustrates the diversities and complexities of Portuguese and Indian food. We didnt want to stay too conventional but go beyond the clichs, he says. The food thus, has Portuguese techniques with local ingredients though Magalhes has brought with him salted cod, cheese and chourico.My food journey starts with Petiscos, which are small snacks or nibbles eaten at the beginning of every meal. These are not like tapas. Petitcos have their own identity. We eat small bites before the meal, usually bread and butter, he says. My Petiscos platter has Cultured Butter ( 90) made with dry yeast, Herb marinated Buffalo Milk Cheese (160) and Warm Cured Olives (190) and sourdough bread (we eat only sourdough at home). In small plates, first up is Cheese Toast (550), with sheeps milk cheese, apricot chutney and smoked almonds.Instead of rennet, we use thistle flowers in the preparation. The resultant cheese is so runny, it is wrapped in a cotton cloth to give it shape, he says. Next is Asparagus Tempura (650) served with Parmesan truffle cream. This dish is an ode to how food travels the world. Portuguese missionaries took this cooking technique to Japan but its origins are possibly Jewish. Battered and fried green beans called peixinhos do horta (little fish of the garden) was commonly eaten during Lent as a replacement for meat, he says. His version for the feast replaces green beans with asparagus, in a light batter, topped with grated cheese.A sizeable portion of Magalhes menu is dedicated to greens. Theres Sweet Potato Croquettes (450) with scallion and string cheese, and Pumpkin Empanada (595)  a pie with garlic, spinach, onion served surrounded by a creamy red pepper sauce. I reserve my attention to the meat in front of me. Grilled Chicken Skewers (550) comes with chips and Peri Peri Sauce.The Peri Peri is the protagonist of this story. In Mozambique and Angola, this chilli was typically paired with a protein like wild chicken. Any barbecued chicken had to be marinated for hours to soften the tough muscles. The secret of a good grilled chicken depended on the length of the marinating process, he says, adding that it is very popular dish in Portugal especially on Sunday nights. A Seafood Cataplana (1100) impresses with its flavourful broth, stacked with chunky bits of red snapper, lobster and calamari. The dish gets its name from the copper utensil in which it is prepared  it can be sealed thus allowing the fish to cook in its own juices, he says.My pick is the Bolinhos de Bacalhau (650). Bacalhau is salted or dried cod. Magalhes prepared his cakes by soaking the salted cod in water for three days, shredding it and mashing it with potato, parsley, onion, salt and pepper. Soup spoons give it shape. This dish requires a lot of work to ensure it is fluffy and aerated. You judge bacalhau by the amount of fish is in it as compared to potato. I use a 60-40 ratio, he says.Culinary additionsAnother favourite is Chorizo Flamb (850), homemade Portuguese Sausage that is cured, dried and smoked. Goans took the sausages and not only improved it but made it more user-friendly, quips Magalhes as he snips the meat into slices.Goa is the only example of charcuterie making in the southern hemisphere. In warm climates, chacuterie is bound to spoil, which is why they add spices and vinegar to the preparation. Magalhes love for Goa is evident. His current visit happened after 15 years. He has a few Goan-inspired dishes on his menu at Taberna da Rua das Flores, like sarapatel and para but prefers to leave the rest to the excellent Goan restaurants in Lisbon. An apt cocktail for a feast thats reminiscent of Goa and Portugal is the Porto in Bombay (675), deep red and slightly sweet with the aroma of rosemary and a vibrant homemade port.Sweet collaborationsMy meal has been consistently good so, dessert is no surprise. The real surprise is learning that the Serica (495) is a dish that travelled from Goa to Portugal.This baked custard was originally made with gram flour and jaggery and cooked in an earthen dish. Magalhes uses wheat flour and sugar, and fresh strawberries. The Flan Cake (450) is like a boozy Christmas pudding layered with dried fruits, fresh oranges and port wine.It was originally made with smoked pork lard to increase the savoury flavour. This version is like a rich crme caramel. Its the perfect ending to a stellar meal and a nod to the season ahead.Chef Andr Magalhes Takeover at O Pedro, BKC on November 16 and 17 (November 18 to 30, specials menu)."

A close friend, my former college roommate, was getting married and I had been invited as his best man at the wedding. When he wasnt required to be in the capital, Buenos Aires, to attend to his business, he preferred to stay at his country home, a traditional estancia or cattle ranch located an hour outside of the city. It was where the wedding was to take place.Argentina is a fascinating country with stunningly diverse geography, ranging from lush tropical rainforests, windswept steppes and long coastal stretches to towering Andean peaks and Arctic glaciers. The culture has been influenced by successive waves of immigration from Europe, mainly Spain, Italy, Ireland, Britain, Germany and France. It is the most distinctly European of Latin American countries. Argentines are proud of their roots in the old country and tend to think of themselves as a cut above other Latinos.The wedding was a colourful affair with lots of music, dancing and drunken revelry. I was grateful for the opportunity to practice my Spanish and rusty Tango skills. We were served several courses of traditional Argentine cuisine, an eclectic blend of Native American and Mediterranean influences. The Argentinian propensity for red meat and rich, calorie-laden food belies the immaculate physical condition of the people. The country produces arguably some of the best looking women (and men) in the world.The event went smoothly with only one notable mishap. My friend had the bright idea of having his picture taken on horseback while uncorking a bottle of champagne. The horse, stunned at the sound of the popping cork and the camera flash, neighed loudly and bolted through the hedges into the garden where the festivities were happening. The guests guffawed at the spectacle, cheering for the horse in typical Argentine fashion, and welcomed the intrusion as part of the festivities.ALSO READ: Questions people ask me about wineThe other incident of note was meeting my friends paternal uncle, a veteran winemaker with a large estate in Mendoza, the premier wine-growing region in the country. The uncle, as it turned out, was looking for an apprentice to train and eventually run the place while he was away on extended trips abroad.A week later, we were in a Ford pick-up, driving to Mendoza province in the western part of the country. We drove non-stop from Buenos Aires for nearly 12 hours, stopping only for meals. Aconcagua, the highest mountain outside of Asia at nearly 7000 meters is situated in Mendoza and the snow-capped peaks of the Andes mountain range make a spectacular backdrop to the vineyards stretching out at the foothills.The cultivation of grapes for the exclusive purpose of winemaking came to the Americas in the 15th century during the Spanish conquest. Today, Argentina is the fifth largest producer of wine in the world. Due to the high altitudes and low humidity of the main wine-producing areas, Argentine cultivators are not faced with insect, fungi and mould issues that grape farmers usually have to deal with, and pesticides are used rarely, if at all.The region does not receive much rainfall. Instead, the vines are irrigated by runoffs from melting Andean glaciers. Some prominent varietals cultivated in Argentina are Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo and Chardonnay, all of which originated in Europe, with the sole exception of the indigenous Torrontes grape, used for producing a fruity, aromatic white wine.A personal favourite is a proprietary blend of malbec, cabernet sauvignon, and syrah, cultivated at high altitude (5000 feet above sea level) Salta vineyards in the northwest. It pairs wonderfully with bife de chorizo (sirloin steak) accompanied by Andean potatoes and chimichurri sauce.Growing season usually lasts from October to the beginning of harvest in February. Harvest season can go on till April depending on the type of grape and region. The three main wine-producing regions in Mendoza are Maipu Valley, Lujan de Cuyo, and Uco Valley. My home for the next several months was located in the remote Uco Valley region, one of Mendozas most fertile regions, blessed with perfect conditions for growing the famed Malbec, a full-bodied, smoky red wine.ALSO READ: The 7 commandments of experiencing fine wineAs an experienced winemaker will tell you, the difference between a great wine and a good one is terroir, the regional characteristics that define its taste: climate, soil, sun, altitude, the slant of hillside and distance from a body of water. The jagged Andes is the most significant element in Mendozas terroir. The cool air and altitude of the mountains slow down the ripening process, balancing out the bright, sunny days. Big temperature differences between night and day enhance acid levels, resulting in a full, ripe and fruity wine.Originally from the Loire and Cahors region in France, the humble Malbec, once known as a poorer cousin of the Cabernet Sauvignon, has been reinvigorated as Argentinas most popular alcoholic beverage. Today 75 percent of all Malbecs in the world are grown here.I stayed in Mendoza from the end of September till a few months after harvest season the next year, learning the ropes from Luciano and his sizeable crew of itinerant workers. In return for my services, I was to get a share of the produce. It was enough to see me through the rest of the year, most of which was spent hiking the Andes and fly-fishing for brown trout in Patagonia. The arrangement was repeated for two consecutive seasons during which I developed an affectionate bond with the land and its people.The skills learnt in Mendoza would come handy many moons later when I set up my winery years later with some friends. One of my partners was the Argentine who had invited me to his wedding. His marriage had not lasted beyond the first year.

Delhi Chief Minsiter Arvind Kejriwal.Claiming that the bill for regularisation of unauthorised colonies in the capital does not figure in the list of proposed legislations to be introduced in the Winter Session of Parliament, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal hit out at the Centre and said the AAP will launch a mass movement on the continued uncertainty over the issue.We have always said their (Centre) intent is suspect, the CM said, recounting that the Delhi government Cabinet had passed the proposal to regularise the colonies and sent it to the Union government in November 2015.AAP, in a statement, also attacked BJP over its falsehoods on the matter. The issue has been a political hot potato in Delhi politics, more so after the Centre approved regularisation of 1,728 unauthorised colonies last month.Kejriwal also questioned the Centres insistence over the last four years that boundaries of the colonies cannot be delineated based on satellite images alone, and that a Total Station Mapping survey method be adopted.Incidentally, they have now accepted the use of satellite maps Just before the Assembly polls, they announced the regularisation process. Not listing it in the governments agenda for the Winter Session only exposes their true intention, he said.Urging people not to believe anyone till they get registration papers of their properties, Kejriwal said, There will be a mass movement for this now.

2019-11-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jalandhar-deadly-late-blight-disease-attacks-potato-crop-in-doaba-6124917/,Jalandhar: Deadly ‘late blight’ disease attacks potato crop in Doaba,"Less sunny days and temperature between 10 to 25 degrees always brings the threat of late blight attack. (Representational/Express photo: Amit Mehra) Less sunny days and temperature between 10 to 25 degrees always brings the threat of late blight attack. (Representational/Express photo: Amit Mehra)Cloudy weather coupled with moderate rain showers in the past some days has invited deadly late blight that now threatens the potato crop. Experts recommended immediate measures to save the crop as late blight travels fast if once it breaks out. This disease, which is a type of fungus, affects all parts of the plant.Less sunny days and temperature between 10 to 25 degrees always brings the threat of late blight attack. An Advisory regarding this has also been issued by the ICAR-Central Potato Research Station, Jalandhar. Dr Raj Kumar, head of the potato station, said that they have predicted more attacks using an App, which predicts blight attacks after weather data is fed into it.He said that late blight starts appearing at some places as it starts attacking the plant from the leaves touching the ground and fungicide spray must be done in such manner that it must cover the lower leaves too.The advisory says that the fungicide can be repeated after 10 days, however depending on the disease intensity, the interval can be increased or decreased. It is also advised not to repeat the same and same fungicide over and over again, said Dr Raj Kumar, adding that it always attacks the crop at the period of tuber formation or little before.The advisory to the farmers also says that potato crop in which fungicide has not been applied yet and late blight has not appeared, must be sprayed with Mancozeb 75 WP or Chlorothalonil 75 WP.It should be mixed in a ratio of 250 gm in 1000 litre water per hectare, said experts at the research station, adding that in case the late blight has already appeared then 3 kg Cymoxanil 8 per cent and Mancozev 64 per cent or Febamidone 10 per cent and Mancozeb 60% or Dimethomorph 9 per cent and Mancozeb 60 per cent must be mixed in 1000 litre water to spray in a one hectare area.In Punjab, tuber formation has already started and if this disease attacks the crop, the farmers are likely to suffer heavily, he added. Potato is a major crop of this region having area of 90,000 to 95,000 hectares with a total production of 22 to 25 metric tons. Almost 25 per cent area of potato is sown in Jalandhar district only and the seed of the potato crop is also grown in Jalandhar and surroundings which is being supplied to all over the country from here.

(REUTERS) Cristiano Ronaldo takes a free-kick against Luxembourg. (REUTERS)Cristiano Ronaldo slammed Luxembourgs pitch as a potato field and also said he had not been fully fit in recent matches after the European champions won 2-0 on Sunday to qualify for Euro 2020.Ronaldo scored his 99th Portugal goal late in the game, having notched a hat-trick in a 6-0 win over Lithuania three days earlier, but it was far from a vintage performance on a pitch full of divots at the Josy Barthel stadium.Its difficult to play on these pitches  it was a potato field, I dont know how teams of our level are supposed to play on these pitches, he told reporters. It wasnt a good spectacle but we did our job Im looking forward to my fifth European Championship.The 34-year-old had joined up with the Portugal squad amid speculation over his fitness and attitude following his angry reaction to being substituted during Juventus 1-0 win over AC Milan the previous Sunday.Juve coach Maurizio Sarri then said that Ronaldo had been struggling with a knee problem for some time.In the last three weeks, I have been playing with limitations, Ronaldo told a group of reporters outside Portugals dressing-room door on Sunday. But there was no controversy  you (the media) created that. I tried to help Juventus. Nobody likes to be substituted but I understood because I wasnt in such good shape, he added.Ronaldo said he was also not 100 percent in the two Portugal matches.I sacrificed myself for the team, he said. We could have missed out (on Euro 2020). Thankfully, I havent been injured much in my career but it can happen.Its a pain that prevents me from being 100 percent, but I always try to play. They created a big controversy where it didnt need to exist. Ill be back to 100 percent soon.Portugal finished second in Group B with 17 points, three ahead of Serbia who drew 2-2 with Ukraine.Ronaldo would become only the second player to score 100 goals by reaching that milestone.The 100th goal will come naturally, he said. Records are there to be beaten and I am going to beat them. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Read MoreMANGALURU: Shree Vidya Vardhaka Higher Secondary School, Meeyapadavu in Manjeshwar , near Mangaluru , is on a mission to ensure that students eat right food.During breaks, students prefer to eat chips, burgers, pizzas, samosas and other junk food along with packaged juices or aerated drinks.The school organised a food festival and the students were introduced to the cuisines of Karnataka and Kerala, as well as the dishes made out of green leafy vegetables, and were told about the importance of a fibre-rich diet.Ramesh KN, principal, in-charge, said that the idea of this food festival was to promote healthy eating among children. Around 66 traditional home-cooked dishes, popular in Kerala and Karnataka, were served. This was a platform for the students to present their culinary skills and understand the importance of having a healthy diet. Items on display included chattipathiri (layered pastry), rice pradhaman, veg pulav, pal payasam, koochappam, muringayila (drumstick leaves) curry, carrot halwa, veg salad, potato cutlet, rasmalai, rava laddu, holige, appam, carrot laddu, veg cutlet, unnakai (spindle shaped sweet dessert made of plantain), chapati, neyyapam, banana koomb curry and other dishes. Several dishes prepared from leafy vegetables were also served. The vegetables served were made from spinach, drumstick leaves, green gram leaves, banana stem, lettuce, long bean leaves, cowpea leaves and banana flowers.Prema K Bhat, school manager, highlighted the importance of organic farming and the need to develop the same at homes and schools. Ramesh KN spoke to the students on the importance of dietary fibre to improve our digestive health. Dr Ganesh Kumar introduced the concept of a balanced diet, and the significance of food rich in fibre. He asked students to include cereals, oats, barley, berries, pears, melon, oranges, broccoli, carrot, and sweet corn in their diet.The school will take up more such campaigns to promote healthy eating in the coming days."
2019-11-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/small-scale-farmers-advised-to-take-up-natural-farming/article30011854.ece,Small scale farmers advised to take up natural farming,"With proper guidance, small scale farmers can also practice natural farming and make abundant profits, a message conveyed to farmers during a one-day training programme on turmeric cultivation held at Ganeshan Natural Agro Farm at Keelvani at Anthiyur here on Sunday.Organised by the Isha Agro Movement (IAM) in association with Tata Trust, leading farmers who have been practising natural farming and conducting training programmes for other farmers took part in the programme. The practical workshop held directly on the farmland also enhances the experience of the participants and enables them with a deeper insight, said the organisers.Ganesan, a farmer, said that he have been practising natural farming with various crops such as turmeric, banana and sugarcane for a decade and cultivating turmeric in three acres and inter-cropping with crops such as sweet potato, corn, chilly, brinjal and spinach had earned him good profits. Practising natural farming has also reaped the benefit of an increased yield to 30 quintal per acre, he said.Another farmer Senthil said that inter-cropping with tree cultivation also provides both environmental and economic benefit apart from ensuring enhanced quality and quantity. He said that though the market price of turmeric is  7,000 per quintal, he was able to sell it for higher price due to its quality. Tree inter-cropping also results in an extensive reduction of the quantity of water needed for the crops and also supports in maintaining the soil quality, he said.Farmers were taken to a turmeric farms at two different places for a field visit to gain on-ground exposure following which a question and answer session was held."
2019-11-20,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/nov/20/veggie-prices-go-north-2064070.html,Veggie prices go north,"Gautham S ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: The shortage of vegetable supply from other states and lack of local produce are causing a steep increase in prices of vegetables. The rates of shallot (small onion), onion and garlic have shot up with garlic registering the highest increase. According to Udayakumar, a vendor at Ernakulam local market, the price of garlic now stands at Rs 220 per kilo.While shallot was priced at `80 per kg in October, it touched Rs 90 on Tuesday. Onions are being sold for Rs 75-80 per kg since October while drumsticks, priced at Rs 80 in October, rose to Rs 240 in November. Two months back, one kg of drumstick was priced at just Rs 40. The production has come down drastically in other states, which reflects on the prices, adds Udayakumar.Coriander leaves, priced at Rs 60 per kg in October, now costs Rs 150.Cheaper veggiesThe price of carrot has gone up to Rs 70 from Rs 60 in October. Ooty carrots are being sold at this rate. There is a cheaper variety which is being sold at Rs 30-40 a kg. The market also has small-size onions priced around Rs 70, he says. However, the sale isnt affected. Since shallot, onion and garlic are unavoidable, people will buy it despite the price. The quantity, of course, has come down. Earlier, if people bought 3 kg, it has come down to 1 kg, says Aji, another vendor at Ernakulam local market.More takers for Chinese potato One vegetable that has seen a slump in prices is Chinese potato. The price has fallen to Rs 40-50 per kg from Rs 80 in October. The fall in price has favoured the sale. Chinese potatoes will remain cheap till March, after which the prices will go back to Rs 80, says Udayakumar.Crisis for vendorsAccording to Valsa Antony, a vendor at Kaloor market, the increase in prices doesnt favour vendors much. After transportation charges, we get just `5 or `6 as profit. We havent benefitted from the price hike, he says. Though the price hike is common during this period, this year it is particularly high.The vegetable market is down this year. Also, markets like Kaloor are not getting enough customers with the arrival of hypermarkets, says Sathar O A, another vendor.According to residents, the government should bring more produce to the market, in the wake of the hike. Unless local production improves, the prices hike will keep fluctuating, says Udayakumar. According to Shameed N H, general secretary, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association, the flood in Maharashtra has affected the production of shallot, onion and garlic.The onions stored by the farmers are being sold in the market now, thats why the price has gone up. According to reports, the price of onion in New Delhi has reached around Rs 100. Maharashtra and New Delhi, which produces onion and garlic extensively, hasnt been able to bring the price down. Since we lack local production, we cannot control the prices. Vendors can sell local produce at lower rates if the government helps them with subsidies, he adds.LoadsAccording to the vendors, the Ernakulam local market used to get around 50 loads daily from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. But since the production has gone down, the number of loads has reduced to 20-25."

They have all been trained by KSN Raju, a freelance trainer who has been in the fitness industry for the past 15 years.Raju, who has won the title of Mr Telangana several times, added another feather to his cap by bagging silver in the 11th Mr World Competition conducted by World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Federation (WBPF) held at Jeju Island in South Korea from November 5 to 11.He also won bronze at the 53rd Mr Asia Competition held by Asian Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Federation (ABPF) in Indonesia in October this year.When asked about his diet and exercise regimen, Raju gives a detailed picture of how he trains for an event. On a day, he takes 200-300 gm of protein split into six meals. Apart from this, he also takes in fixed quantities of carbohydrates, fats, and vegetables for fibre.On days he is preparing for an event, he wakes up at 5 am and has a protein shake and glutamine powder at 6 am. After two hours, he eats 12 egg whites, one egg yolk, 100 gm of oats and honey, along with 12-15 almonds.Then he goes to gym and trains for two hours, during which he mainly does strengthening exercises. He eats lunch at 1:30 pm which consists of boiled chicken (250 gm), brown rice and mixed vegetables. After taking some rest, Raju then has 12 egg whites and sweet potato at 4 pm.This is followed by another rigorous two hours at the gym during which he focuses on his abs and cardio exercises.Dinner generally features fish (250 gm) and mixed vegetables. Just before going to bed at 10:30 am, the body builder drinks another protein shake.At 50, Raju is touching new milestones without facing any health issues. When asked if he has some wisdom to share with budding bodybuilders, Raju says: ""Practice makes everyone perfect. Youngsters should not resort to steroids as short-cuts to beef up their bodies. They should consult an expert first before they chart out a regimen.""This Hyderabadis dream is to win gold for India in the next international tournament, but he laments that the lack of financial assistance is a big hurdle towards achieving that. For my diet and supplements alone, I have to spend Rs 40,000 - Rs 50,000 per month. I have been shelling out everything from my own pocket with occasional help from my clients, but that is not enough. I request the government to support me."
2019-11-21,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/muscle-builders-and-trainers-weigh-in-on-the-bodybuilding-scene-in-kerala-capital/article30036637.ece,Muscle-builders and trainers weigh in on the bodybuilding scene in Kerala capital,"Sharath Kumar SG first hit the gym to get back to fitness following an accident when he sustained a broken arm during his school days. Today, pumping iron is a passion for the 34-year-old, so much so that the bodybuilder is a three-time Mr South Asia winner under the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness. I have been into bodybuilding for 15 years, says Sharath as he diligently preps for an upcoming national-level cup.Its not just about the six-pack or the big biceps or the broad boulders, the art of bodybuilding is more than a mere show-off, say musclemen and trainers. While many are into fitness regimes to stay in good shape, trainers say only a small percentage of gym-hitters actively venture into the Herculean routine of bodybuilding.Septuagenarian Ramachandran Nair, a member of the committee that runs the 90-plus Veera Keralam Gymkhana at Vanchiyoor, one of the oldest in the city, says that less than one/fifth of the 100-odd members are into bodybuilding today, mostly college students. We still use some of the traditional gym equipment like the karla kattai (wooden club bell) that is useful in developing forearms apart from modern equipment.Vinod K, trainer and owner of Powerhouse Gym at Maruthankuzhi, says: As a competition, bodybuilding is a costly affair. It delivers a different outcome from the more popular and less intensive fitness routines. It needs promotion and investment to get the desired result, which is to win cups in shows and contests, Many are, nevertheless, hitting the gym to bulk up out of passion than for competitive reasons, he adds.However, its appeal and the type of practitioners have changed over the years, says Venugopal Unnikrishnan, trainer at Belaire Health Club, Kowdiar, who has been into the business of bodybuilding for over 40 years now.I started my gym 36 years ago. Back then, bodybuilding was deemed more a poor mans sport. Now, only those who can afford to bear the expenses, mainly a protein-rich diet and supplements, are coming forward. The flip side is that theres not much in terms of prize money. However, sportsmen are appreciating bodybuilding today as a supplementary exercise, says 60-year-old Venugopal. He adds that the past 10 years or so has also seen greater acceptance for weight training among women.Power woman For hijab-wearing bodybuilder and power-lifter Majiziya Bhanu from Vadakara, Kozhikode, theres no weight that person cant lift given the right training and mindset. She broke many a stereotype while power-lifting her way to competing in the female segment of Mr Kerala Competition in Kochi last year and winning the Asian Powerlifting Championship in 2017. I had to battle many challenges  social, physical and mental  especially since I hail from an orthodox family. The irony is that we need the support of others to reach somewhere in life, but we start receiving it only when we reach there. I think for this reason, so many talented girls, irrespective of which community they are from, fall behind, says the 25-year-old, also a dental surgeon. Majiziya has been busy prepping for the World Powerlifting Championship to be held in Russia next month.From students in their late teens to the elderly, resistance training has many takers in the city. Venugopal says age is not a criteria when it comes to beefing up in the testosterone-driven game. Just look at Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone. These guys still walk around with sculpted bodies, he says with a laugh.Sharan Kumar Rajendran, who represented India and won the gold medal in the 2013 Asian Kettlebell Championship, however, feels that the sport of bodybuilding is reaching its fag-end as the focus is shifting towards general fitness. Another bane is the prevalent use of steroids, which is deleterious to the body in the long run, says Sharan, who runs Mad Shark Gym at Nalanchira. He says vitamin supplements are welcome but shouldnt be the be-all and end-all of nutrition in ones attempt get shredded.But the fact is that 20 aspiring bodybuilders currently train under Akhilash Padmakumar who runs t Fit Made at Poomkulam off Thiruvallam. You may not be able to make yourself grow taller after an age but one can certainly put on some muscle with a proper workout, diet and schedule. To develop muscle power, it takes immense willpower, says the former Mr Trivandrum. He stresses the importance of diet in bodybuilding, attributing it to being 70% of the deal, adding that cardio exercises should also be incorporated into the workout routine.Akhilash says a bodybuilders expensive diet includes several egg whites  sometimes as many as 30  a day and 1 kg of chicken apart from a range of fruits and vegetables. Protein is imperative to build muscle, and fruits and vegetables, preferably raw, covers the requirement for essential vitamins and minerals, while keeping carbs to the minimum. Vegetarian protein sources such as cereals and pulses are also good, he points out. Akhilash says during the cutting phase, when bodybuilders intensify their workout pattern to lose fat in preparation for a competition, a sugar-free, fat-free oil-free diet is ideal. Some of bodybuilders at his gym also moonlight as bouncers.Over the contestable point of carbs in a bodybuilders diet, trainer Prem Mohan at Power Gym, Kesavadasapuram, however, says its essential. Its indirectly useful for muscle-building as carbs provide the energy for intense workouts. Sometimes, its good to have a small portion of rice or sweet potato before workout. However, carbs can be avoided during the cutting period, he explains. Venugopal says supplements may be necessary in bulking up, but has to be used only according to requirements for optimal nutrition.Being a doctor, 28-year-old bodybuilder Kishore VV has a different perceptive about his hobby. I feel the doctor in me helps the bodybuilder and the bodybuilder in me helps the doctor, he says with a laugh. Since I also understand how a human body works from a medical point of view, it helps me reduce injuries that one may sustain during intense workouts as you push the envelope, says Kishore, a Mr Kerala gold medallist and a Mr South India silver medal winner.So, what are you weighting for?"

I am also trying very hard to stick to my truism that praise comes from me quite miserly. I am trying not to overstate the elation and rapture I felt, as I left the restaurant after eating that meal.So before I turn into a gushing fanboy, let me talk about Akerkar himself. Somewhere in the 90s, south Mumbais beau monde started prattling about how theatre actress Jinx Akerkars son had returned from abroad armed with an engineering degree and wanted to give it all up, to do some catering.I knew the Padamsees and the da Cunhas and Jinx had dabbled with The Theatre Group, so I heard the news too. Even at that time I thought to myself, that fellow must have gumption. The next nugget the grapevine brought in was that the Akerkar boy had started a catering service from home called The Moveable Feast, which did French-European food for home parties. This was a time when catering for parties from home meant you either slaved in the kitchen along with your cooks and maids, or hired a chef for the day or ordered in from an Indian or Chinese restaurant.Just as The Movable Feast was making the citys movers drool came Just Desserts. Along with AD Singh, Rahul appropriated Parisian Bakery and Caf, an Irani eatery in Fort, for the evenings. The caf downed shutters at 6 pm, and thats when Rahul and AD brought it alive with desserts and coffee. It was insane. Bombay thronged to this place; there was music, coffee, pastries, not only in the caf but flowing out onto the pavements and on top of bonnets of cars.Just Desserts then moved over the weekends to The Ripon Club, but permissions and landlord woes shut it all down.I lived at Breach Candy then. A faux hard rock caf had opened near China Garden, and Open House, under the Kemps Corner flyover, was quite the rage for burgers and stuff. One fine day, Open House shut and Under the Over opened. It was 1992 and we had never seen a caf like that in our little lives. Rahuls personality was written all over the smart, stylish, bright, simple restaurant. Twenty-seven years later I still remember the menu. Stuffed potato skins, cheesy nachos and chicken Dijonnaise (a creamy mustard sauce with bacon bits). And the piece de rsistance, the Hungry Mans Barbecue. Half a chicken roasted and smothered in a smoky, sweet and tangy sauce. And brownies and Baileys cheesecake for dessert.Here Id like to emphasise that Id never heard of brownies or cheesecake before that, and neither had most people. By that time I had met Rahul, but by chance. I was art directing an ad campaign that was being photographed by the then young shutterbug Atul Kasbekar. Rahul (with hair), featured prominently in the photograph, all double-breasted with a hand-tied bow. Id then meet him as he bustled around in and out of the kitchen of Under the Over.I have very fond memories of that place; two stand out for me. The first a very spirited lunch with writer, author and friend Nisha da Cunha who accompanied me thinking shed have to settle for a salad, since she was vegetarian, but was pleasantly surprised. And the second, a heart-to-heart with Cyrus Broacha who had quit his first proper job that morning so that he could head to New York to study acting. Unfortunately Under the Over shut down, and my lament will always be that very little remains documented about a restaurant that changed the way we ate in Bombay.Then came Indigo. The first standalone fine-dine restaurant in the city. Rahul took over this little cottage in a bylane of Colaba and shook all five-star hotels out of their complacency. Indigo elevated the dining experience to the highest level, with design, cuisine and a focus on modern and classic-modern food. The clubby bar counter with dining areas, its terrace with a deep, brown cigar lounge. The lobster bisque with hints of fennel, Camembert souffl truffle fondue, beef carpaccio with capers, the risottos made to perfection, pork belly slow-cooked with bacon jam. This was gastronomy at its best. I had many a good meal and dozens of great boozy evenings stumbling down the wooden staircase and onto the pebbled exit, looking up at the lonely dome of the Taj at night.Then another first, Indigo Deli, which opened where Nanking once stood. Top-notch design, lots of wine, the best charcuterie and fromagerie, great sandwiches, pizzas, mains, dessert and breads. And then Neel at Tote on the Turf, the finest Awadhi food. I could go on and on, but I need to get to Qualia before I run out of ink and space.Staged with high ceilings, chainmail curtains, jars of pickled viands; you enter to the soothing crackle and pop of a wood fire that heralds warmth and energy and embraces you. Qualia is a spectacular space. Its posh, yet approachable. The staff is friendly and warm, yet proper. In his words, Rahul brings his international and Konkani tastebuds together in a chorus of strong flavours and vibrant textures.I started with the oxtail tortelletti. Little packages of pasta stuffed with tender meat in a reduced and flavourful bold meat stock with roasted onions a la a French onion soup. It was fresh and resolute. Next the steak tartare. Smarting and pickled, perfectly denatured meat served along with cured egg, pickled mushrooms, capers, chives and a slice of homemade sourdough.Coimbatore pork chops in a cider cumin glaze with white beans, poignant candied tomatoes and crunchy sage leaves. And pizza for my finale. Half with steak and eggs and the other with clams and mussels. The steak and poached egg, with mushrooms, tomatoes, aged cheddar and mozzarella, and the mollusk with black garlic, confit potato, Emmental and arugula. Not about to leave without dessert I finished with the Textures of Bitter Chocolate soil, ganache, wafers and wonderful things.Ill put it this way: there are gimmicks and mimics and then there is Rahul."

Though a week day the restaurant was fully packed and busy with a large group throwing a farewell party, couples out for dinner and more. For weekends, Nitin Bhardwaj, Executive Chef, Kampai, who has been cooking Japanese cuisine for the last 17 years, says that the number usually doubles.Known for its authentic Asian cuisine, luxe ambience and a well-stocked bar, we settled down to enjoy the gastronomical journey which started with a glass of Sangria Red. It was every bit festive, fruity and fun, and accompanied with a platter that included a cup of warm mushroom soup (Shiitake No Sumashi Shiru) and sea salt edamame. The soup is perfect for the onset of winter season with its tempting flavours of burnt garlic, mushroom, garlic and butter.Next, we tried Brie Cheese Tempura. Crunchy on the outside with a cheesy inside, the Smoked Brie cheese was plated with miso berry glaze. This is seasonal as during summers we used jamuns in place of berry. In winters we also use a lot of root vegetables including, black and orange radish and even golden carrot in salads and stir fries, informed Chef Bhardwaj. If youre a fan of cheese, nothing can go wrong here.Of course,there has to be sushi. Chef special Aburi Salmon roll has torched salmon with Philadephia cheese slowly melts in your mouth leaving an aftertaste of the cheese. The Caterpillar roll was exquisite which was the perfect combination of avocado, asparagus and cucumber with mayo. It is a mix of flavours, the roll was mild, sweet and chewy.For main course, we tried Tori Katsu Curry with Panko fried chicken accompanied by Japanese style curry served with steamed rice. The chicken pieces were fried with light spices mixed well with the thick curry and steamed rice. For the vegetarians, theres fired potato instead. On the side, we had Buta Shogayaki (Shoga means ginger and yaki means grill or fry), thin sliced, bite-sized pork pieces marinated in ginger-flavored sauce.For dessert, we had Green Tea Opera Cake that has layers of green-tea sponge and matcha buttercream. It wasnt too sweet was a perfect ending to the evening.Timings: 12:00pm-11:30pmPrice for two: `3,500At: Worldmark 1, G-02, Aerocity"

With this, Chitharesh became the first Indian and Malayali to win the championship organised by World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Federation (WBPF). He participated in the 90-kg category which enabled him to compete with the champions of other categories (55-110 kg).This is very special to me. I started preparing for the championship from January. In June, there was a selection trial for the Indian bodybuilding team in Hyderabad. I was selected to the Asian Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship (ABBF) held in Thailand from September 27 October 3. I won the overall championship there which qualified me for the world championship, says Chitharesh. He is also the first Malayali and second Indian to win the ABBF.Prepping upHe says the preparations for the championship were tough, but he really enjoyed it. I used to work out twice a day from January. As the championship neared, the workout became thrice a day, he adds. He trained under M P Sagar from Idukki, who is also his colleague. Chitharesh also followed a diet which required 300 g of protein and 200-250g of carbohydrates. I had around 40 eggs daily, one kg of chicken breast, fish and protein powder. Brown rice, oats and sweet potato were the sources of carbohydrates. The diet also consisted of dry fruits and salads cooked in coconut oil.Key to successChitharesh was interested in bodybuilding from schooldays. He was also a hockey player and played at the school, college and university levels. After getting Bachelor of Physical Education (BPE) from Lakshmibai National College of Physical Education (LNCPE), Thiruvananthapuram, he joined Rejuvenation Fitness Group, New Delhi, as a fitness trainer in 2007.I took weight training seriously after shifting to New Delhi, he says. From 2014, he was a regular face in bodybuilding championships and won many medals. I used to contest in championships under International Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation (IBFF). However, the federation was not recognisedin India and I couldnt get a government job. In 2018, I started competing in championships under Indian Body Builders Federation (IBBF), which is recognised by the Central government and sports council. I hope this achievement will land me a government job and I can settle back in Kerala.He believes a secure job will help him get sponsorships in future. We will have support from the department. Also, representing and winning the championship for a department will help in getting selected to the Indian team.Chitharesh spent around`1.40 lakh and `1.35 lakh to participate in the Asian and world championships. The total cost, including the diet, is even more, he adds."

A few dozen young men and women wait and watch as batches of dosas take shape. Not the round dosas we are used to but oval ones, topped with oodles of shredded cheese, butter, paneer and tomato. Between the dosa and the topping is sandwiched a layer of runny upma. The process of creating this fusion dosa at Ram Ki Bandi is dramatic  the cheese bubbles and turns red as it is sprinkled generously with chilli garlic powder or chat masala. For the young people wearing the lanyards of IT companies and grumbling about bosses, this dosa, sliced into two and topped with a dollop of peanut chutney, is what they eat before they call it a day.Hyderabad, known for its biryani, haleem, kebabs, sheer korma, sheermal and shorba, has suddenly seen an explosion in its range of food, making it quite a gourmands destination. Little wonder then that the city now has been included in the Creative Cities Network by Unesco in the gastronomy category. And all that eating is helping the economy too: a study by an auditing firm discovered that about 12% of Hyderabads working population is directly or indirectly employed in the food sector.Dosa with toppings | Photo Credit: Getty ImagesThe average Hyderabadi is quite the foodie: the city consumes some 700 tonnes of chicken and 291 tonnes of meat every day, according to a dossier prepared by city officials. On festivals, chicken consumption goes up to 2,000 tonnes, says Musharraf Ali Faruqui, zonal commissioner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, who was part of the team that drafted the case for Hyderabads inclusion in the Unescos Creative Cities Network. The team mapped eateries ranging from pushcarts under expressways to tea shops that pop up for a few hours a day to omelette kiosks near bus and train stations. We found roughly 1.5 lakh establishments, plus countless tea stalls. Some of them stick around for just a few hours before moving on, he says. The team also discovered that 10,000 women in self-help groups are employed in the food sector in Hyderabad.On the menuDiners are spoilt for choice. From experimental dishes that come from small new-age eateries to the established players dishing out success formulas, the range is huge.Arrayed on both sides of the Musi River, the choices for breakfast at The Grand, Nayaab, Shadab, Shah Ghouse and more are staggering. The meat dishes include bhaji gurda (kidney curry), kaleji (liver curry), jabaan (tongue), paya (broth with trotters), and keema (mince), while vegetarians make do with bagara (seasoned rice), kuska (plain biryani), and khichdi. Shorba is a rich broth with a floating layer of lard, seasoned with coriander and served with sheermal, naan or roti. At Nayaab, it is newspaper executives and early morning visitors to Charminar who stop by for tea and breakfast.By 8 a.m., the traffic picks up and business at Ram Ki Bandi winds down. We close by 9 a.m., says Ram, a first-generation food entrepreneur. A few hundred metres away, groups of students, daily wage workers and office goers throng the road near Hanuman Tekdi. People were getting bored of the routine idli-dosa-upma, so I created cut dosa  I made the dosa crisper, added a topping of upma, and cut it into two. Others got the idea from us, says B. Komariah, the owner of the eatery. Starting with a roadside stall in 1982, he now employs 45 people. I was 24 and jobless when a Tamil rickshaw puller named Kumar suggested I start a tiffin centre. We borrowed 1,200 and ferried the grinding machine here in his rickshaw. He taught us about the batter and other cooking secrets, says Komariah, as people jostle to buy the tokens for a plate.Piping hot mirch bajji | Photo Credit: Nagara GopalBetween 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., the streets near schools and colleges, banks and small businesses become hubs for fast food. My favourite breakfast is keema roti. But now most restaurants in the old city serve puri-bhaji. It is cheaper and also filling; people can no longer afford meat for breakfast, says Hyder Razvi, who lives near the Darul Shifa, the oldest part of Hyderabad. A traditional snack like lukmi, which earlier had a filling of mince mutton, is now stuffed with either mashed potato or beef.Of kulfi paansSunil opened Shree Lakshmi Tiffins in Boggalkunta near Abids in central Hyderabad four months ago. The shop shares space with one of the citys fanciest pan shops, which has evolved into a juice parlour and a chaat and pani puri hangout. Mayur Pan House opened in 1998 and boasts on its menu kulfi paan, Meenakshi laddoo paan, and chocolate paan, among other choices. By evening, the area in front of the shop is transformed into a street cafe where families drop by to dig into Jain pav bhaji, samosa ragda, avocado juice, garlic bread, or that eternal street food favourite, pani puri.By afternoon, biryani preparations for dinner have begun. At the Shah Ghouse Cafe in west Hyderabad, biryani looks like a work of art in the making. Hyderabadi biryani is kacche gosht ki biryani, where raw meat is cooked with rice creating many layers of flavours, says Muhammad Rabbani, the owner of Shah Ghouse. On large kadais, chef Chand Bhai uses his eyes and hands as measuring tools, throwing in sea salt, chilli powder, spices, and curd on the meat, then leaving it to marinate. He then layers the marinated meat with half-cooked rice before setting it to cook on dum. Three layers of long-grained rice cooked for different lengths of time appear to be the secret for the perfectly cooked biryani. One kadai of biryani can feed 40 people.Vermicelli being prepared | Photo Credit: G RAMAKRISHNAFood should always be eaten in the place where it is cooked. You can order food online but it arrives cold. A takeaway doesnt give you the atmosphere of a restaurant, says Rabbani. He goes to sleep at 4 a.m., when everyone else wakes up to food.But it is not just elaborate food that is Hyderabads culinary calling card today. A small family-run confectionery near Salar Jung Museum makes a little sweetmeat called badam ki jaali (almond coin). Shaped like a Nizam-era coin, the mellow sweet is an heirloom delicacy.Nouvelle cuisineAt the other end of the spectrum are the new-age patisseries with owner-chefs trained in Paris or London. Hossein Barazandeh studied baking in Paris and opened a desserts place in Banjara Hills called Feranoz. Beginning with a small bakery, Sahil Taneja went on to Concu, a high-end patisserie, also in Banjara Hills. He imports the choicest strawberries and the best gold leaf for dessert toppings. Recently, he opened another restaurant in Jubilee Hills called Farine. His neighbours are Churrolto (Spanish cafe), Guilt Trip (dessert house), Maguro (Pan-Asian diner) and a drive-in restaurant called Cuba. Gourmet city? For sure.The gastronomy reaches a crescendo during Ramzan. A 1 km radius around Charminar transforms into a food street where the action begins at 5 p.m. and goes on till dawn. It is a night bazaar where mutton shikhampur, a pan-fried minced kebab stuffed with raw onions and coriander, competes with patthar ka gosht, chunks of delicately flavoured meat grilled over heated stone. The dish of choice is, of course, the sublime Hyderabad haleem  a thick, dark spicy stew of meat, lentils, crushed wheat, vegetables and ghee. Lots of ghee. The dish, understandably, has a GI tag.Except Punjab and Kashmir, you will find workers from all States working here. Their number goes up during Ramzan when we employ 800 men, says Ameer, who manages a popular city restaurant. One of the bigger haleem makers, Pista House, has even created a network to door-deliver haleem every day at Iftar across multiple cities.Importantly, the Unesco Creative Cities Networks gourmet tag is as much about food as it is about pulling people out of poverty and meeting the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. As the food business booms, it has created lakhs of jobs in Hyderabad  for bouncers, bakers, baristas, chefs, delivery executives, cooks, scullions, maitres dhotel, and even rat catchers. At a cloud kitchen in Nanakramguda, one of the specialised jobs is that of a rat catcher. He sets traps each evening and disposes of the rodents each morning.It takes many hands to place Hyderabad so firmly at the high table of world cuisine."

The Bengal government is distributing Chandramukhi potato seeds to farmers in Hooghly and Burdwan.These seeds have been made in the West Bengal State Seed Corporations seed farms at Siliguri and West Midnapores Anandapur.The aim is to encourage potato farmers across the state to sow the Chadramukhi seeds made in Bengal, instead of bringing them from Punjabs Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar.Pradip Majumdar, agricultural advisor to the chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said, A large number of potato farmers in Singur, Dankuni, Dhaniakhali, Tarakeswar and Arambagh expressed interests in buying Chandramukhi seeds from us. They said the demand for Chandramukhi potatoes has increased in Kolkata and its adjoining markets. But they rued that the seeds have to be brought from Punjab. So, we urged the farmers to sow the seeds made in Bengal. We have started distribution of these seeds on an experimental basis this year for Rs 1,000 per 50kg packet.According to farmers, a 50kg packet of Chandramukhi seeds from Punjab costs between Rs 2,600 and Rs 2,800. The middlemen who bring the seeds to the state sell them for higher prices.Sukumar Das of Dhaniakhalis Maheswarpur was among the farmers who bought the potato seeds from the state government.Till the last year I sowed the seeds brought from Punjab. I could produce low-grade potato that was like the Jyoti variety. I did not get good returns. This time, I got the seeds from the government for a cheaper price."

This adds to the difficulties of consumers who affected by sky-high onion prices.The bulk of potatoes comes from the Nilgiris district or Karnataka. Both these places witnessed heavy rainfall in the last few months and supply has reduced drastically.

Manikam, a trader, said, This is one of our busiest seasons and managing with less supply would be extremely difficult. We are currently selling in the price range of Rs 40 to Rs 60 a kg. We can expect the price to touch the Rs 100 mark if the trend continues.Tiruchy remains unaffected by this trend as it gets a steady supply of potatoes from many places including Agra, Ooty and Mettupalayam.Since the supply was said to be unaffected from other places there was no substantial fluctuation.On Sunday potatoes in Tiruchy was sold at Rs 30 a kilogram, the same as last week."

PepsiCo registered FL-2027 variety in 2016 and introduced it in Gujarat for cultivation. The company uses it for production of wafers.On September 23 this year, PepsiCo had asserted in a letter to Authority under the PPVFR Act that as the ""holder of certificate of registration for FL-2027"", it has the ""rightsunder the Act to pursue necessary actions against individuals and companies alike who infringes its rights"".Kapil Shah of the Beej Adhikar Manch said various organisations fighting for farmers' rights have asked farmers to sow the seeds without any fear. He called Tuesday's symbolic sowing a ""satyagraha"".""Farmers have nothing to fear when they make their choice of what seed to sow and they can even sell the seed produced from any variety as long as it is not branded seed,""said Vitthalbhai Patel of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh.PepsiCo had earlier sued some potato farmers in the state for allegedly sowing this variety, demanding damages ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore over alleged infringement of rights.But in May, it withdrew the cases. Farmers' rights activists then wrote to the PPF&FR Authority, demanding revocation of the company's certificateof registration for FL-2027.The company's spokesperson was not available for comments on Tuesday's event. Around 20 per cent of potatoes grown in Gujarat are of FL-2027 variety.

2019-11-26,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2019/nov/26/here-are-a-list-of-allergy-causing-foods-and-some-healthy-substitutes--2067299.html,Here are a list of allergy-causing foods and some healthy substitutes,"Rajkumari Sharma Tankha ByExpress News ServiceHe was choking, coughing, vomiting, and had rashes all over his body. Despite medical attention being administered to him, he appeared to be in a lot of pain.His father, an Army officer, informed the doctors on duty that his 20-something son was allergic to fish, but had consumed it by mistake at a party.This incident at the emergency ward of R&R Hospital in Delhi Cantonment was shared by one of the senior doctors, who adds they keep getting such cases at regular intervals.An allergy is caused by an abnormal response triggered by the immune system to any foreign substance that might not be harmful for the body but can cause problems. Pollens of certain flowers, dust and pets are common allergens.But few know about food allergens, and serious ones at that.We have increasingly been getting cases of food intolerance and allergies. But the problem is the immunology here is really complex. The good thing is a lot of cutting edge research is going on, says Dr Shanti Swaroop Dhar, Principal Consultant, gastroenterology at Max Multi-Speciality centre, Panchsheel Park.Dr Dhar explains that while intolerance gives milder symptoms, sometimes it can cause serious health issues in the long term.Like celiac (severe wheat intolerance) can cause stunted growth in children, anemia, ulcers in the intestine and even lymphoma while mild ones like lactose intolerance can cause bloated stomach, flatulence and nausea.Two ways in which allergies can be detected are skin prick test and preparing a comprehensive allergy profile, he says, adding that since no exclusive standardised tests are available it is best that you avoid any food that gives you even minor discomfort.Listed here are five most common food items that cause allergies:Cows MilkThis one is mostly found among children when they are exposed to protein in the milk even before turning six months old. About 1/5th of kids who are allergic to cows milk, remain so even when they grow up. Symptoms include rashes, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps and bloating.Substitutes: Rice/ soy/ almond/ coconut milk.EggsWhile some are allergic to raw eggs, others can get it even from consuming cooked eggs. Around 70 per cent children with an egg allergy, claim studies, are also allergic to biscuits and cakes that have eggs as an ingredient. Symptoms include skin reactions like rashes, itches, vomiting, respiratory illness and digestive stress.Substitutes: Yogurt or plant alternatives if using these for baking. For protein intake, one can opt for meat, pulses or milk.FishMostly triggered by fish proteins and caused mainly in adults, fish allergens do not get destroyed even on cooking. Some people are allergic to cooked fish, not raw.Symptoms include digestive issues like vomiting, diarrhea, swelling of nose, mouth and throat.Susbtitutes: Protein intake from dairy, meat, poultry, black beans and pulses.WheatAn allergy due to wheat can be caused due to any one of the over hundred proteins present in wheat. At times, it can result in death.If you suffer from wheat allergy, avoid it altogether. Symptoms include indigestion, nausea, headache, burping, stomach ache, muscle pains and ulcers.Substitutes: Amaranth, rice, maize and millets.CornAn allergy from corn takes place when the immune system of a person becomes over-sensitive due to foods containing corn-based ingredients or exposure to corn pollen.Baking powder, cellulose, citric acid, malt, semolina, caramel, vanilla extract and dextrose contain corn which can be consumed unknowingly. Symptoms include stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea, sneezing, runny nose and asthma.Substitutes: Rice bran oil, soybean oil, grapeseed oil, arrowroot starch, tapioca starch and potato starch."
2019-11-26,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/cibhi-selven-of-regeno-ventures-talks-about-the-alternatives-to-plastic-bags/article30086877.ece,Bags of sense: Regeno Ventures’ products offer an alternative to plastics,"Did you know that there is a water-soluble, non-toxic, biodegradable alternative to plastic? Not cloth or paper but tapioca starch. Cibhi SelVen, co-founder and MD of Coimbatore-based Regeno Ventures, which manufactures these bags, says its possible with corn, wheat and potato starch as well but they are not water soluble. Regenos rather bare office at Chinniyampalayam is livened up by a colourful display of pink, red, orange, blue, yellow and green bags with logos of companies like LKS Gold House, Grasp, Sri Venkateswara Supermarket, Ramraj Cottons, Hot Chips among others.Cibhi SelVen decided that he wanted to work on something sustainable when he returned to India | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementEdible wrap Cibhi shows me a film from seaweed that can be used to wrap burgers. You can eat the wrapping also. Flavours can be added, he smiles. Its been tested in labs but is not yet in production. Itll take a few more years before it hits the market.Cibhi admits that the bags are pricier than plastic, around 70-80% more, he says, but cheaper than paper and cloth. So, though he gets many enquiries, they do not always convert into orders. India is a very cost-conscious and price-sensitive market, says Cibhi ruefully. They dont care about brands or looks; only about the money. For the cost to reduce, Cibhi says there has to be an increase in orders and increasing efficiency and scaling up of production. Orders are coming in but not enough for us to expand as much as we want. Also where a plastic bag manufacturer can produce 10 kg, he can do only 7-8 kg with the same amount of raw material. Our material needs a bit more attention. The sealing also takes more time. The sample bags he displays feel thinner but that doesnt affect its strength, he assures. We can adjust the thickness based on the use. So its one kind for food takeaways and another for supermarkets.Cibhi, who worked in the US as an accounts manager in an auto parts manufacturing company, returned to India in 2017. I wanted to do something sustainable and, given the plastics problem , this seemed like a good venture. It took a year to lay the groundwork  to source raw material, ensure production capacity, check government regulations and get the bags tested by the Central Pollution Control Board  and to make sure that people would actually buy it, he grins.The processed tapioca starch looks like little pellets or granules | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementCibhi shows off the little pellets of tapioca starch sitting on his desk. These are converted into a translucent sheet  a huge roll is displayed  which is cut to the required size. Cibhi currently imports all his raw materials  the starch, the colours and printing inks  from countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan. Despite shipping costs and import duties, its more cost effective, he says, adding that hes working out a shift to local sources shortly. This is industrial-grade starch and is modified. That methodology is not widely available in India. Also the colours and inks have to be certified as non-toxic. I dont get that here. He has a limited range of nine to 10 water-based organic pigments for those who want coloured bags.While his products are shipped across India, Cibhi is trying to get companies to sponsor these bags for those who cannot afford them; like pushcart vendors, flower sellers and the like. We can print the sponsoring companys advertisement on the bags and distribute them. The plan is ready but he hasnt yet found takers.Cibhi believes our dependence on plastics will reduce only if we replace that in primary packaging | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThe bags are Water soluble and biodegradable: Depends on where they are being disposed, says Cibhi. In a place with microbial activity, it will decompose faster. It will dissolve instantly in hot water and takes some time in regular water. It wont dissolve in rain but will soften slightly. When burnt, it will become ash and not emit toxic fumes.Non-toxic: If consumed accidentally by animals, it is not hazardous to health. I wont say they are edible, he smiles, but it wont harm them.Strong: Its as strong as a plastic bag of the same size but the weight it can carry varies slightly. If a plastic bag carries 5kg, this will take 4.5 to 4.75kg.Cibhi feels the shift from plastics will happen only when other materials are used for primary packaging. Only single-use plastics are banned, he points out. We are still using other kinds. For food containers, Cibhi says 100% plastic-free non-toxic replacements are available and shows a small box for sauces, pickles and mayo. These need to be segregated at source; they are not water soluble and biodegradable only in a composting facility. So it will add to the litter, though it wont last as long as plastic. The solution is available but we need other amenities to implement this. Like composting services. We have one government-run facility in Chennai for the whole of Tamil Nadu. And who is going to collect and transport these to the composting centre?Which brings us to the issue of waste segregation. These products cannot be mixed with plastic, emphasises Cibhi. The composting facilities are not visible. Do we even have them? We need more such centres and more awareness. We need to know where our waste is going.Finally I ask Cibhi how long he thinks it will take for people to ditch plastic. Eight to 10 years, he says, but his tone is more a question than an answer."

The piping hot resultant is garnished with onions and chilli powder before being served to customers, who watch this preparation with bated breath. This spicy, mouth-watering snack, with a crunchy top layer, is the USP of G Suryanarayana Snacks Centre, whose authentic Andhra savouries are a hit in T Nagar. I have not been cooking much these days, but I make sure that I visit the shop every day and personally monitor the preparations, says G Suryanarayana (67), who runs the business along with his son Sivaji.A crispy affairSuryanarayana migrated to Chennai from Andhra Pradesh in the early 1970s, at the recommendation of matinee idol NT Rama Raos close confidante, Arjun Rao. Having successfully run a canteen in Andhra Club, situated in T Nagar, Suryanarayana had a brief encounter with the movie industry, wherein he was asked to supply lunch and snacks for the outdoor unit. For instance, if a Telugu movie was to be shot in the then Madras, then it was almost certain that he would bag the contract to take care of the food, Film offers came very rarely. But when it did, I hadnt missed a chance to impress celebrities. From biryani to pakoda, Ive done it all, he says, adding that he has cooked for Sivaji Ganesan (in Vishwaroopam), Rajinikanth (Baashaa) and Kamal Haasan (Indian).G Suryanarayanan snacks shop in Pondy Bazaar | Photo Credit: R_RAVINDRANSuryanarayana Snacks Centre, which was initially started as a sweet shop, has undergone several changes over the past 35 years. But what has remained constant is the menu, which has an assortment of Andhra appetisers  from gatti pakoda, masala pakoda, molaga bajji to potato bajji  not more than 30. Potato bajjis, Sivaji says, sell like hot cakes when the shop comes alive at 4 pm, on any given day. What attracts customers is how these bajjis are presented  stuffed with onions and sprinkled with a liberal dose of kara podi and lemon syrup. Another popular snack is fried chilli bajji, where already fried molaga bajjis are once again dipped in the oil and deep fried. It is quite crispy compared to the regular ones. Some of them prefer this because it is like eating chilli chips, adds Sivaji. It is right to say that the shop has become a go-to destination for anyone craving for a quick evening snack that goes well with their tea/coffee.Potato bajjis are a hit among customers | Photo Credit: R_RAVINDRANSuryanarayana Snacks Centre, in fact, has earned a loyal customer base, thanks to its home-grown green chutney and kara podi, prepared by grinding red chilli, jeera, garlic and coriander. Has there been an instance where the potency of the spice left a cascading effect on customers? No comes the response from Sivaji. They throng the shop primarily for our kara podi, he laughs, adding, People like the flavour of Andhra, but there arent enough places in Chennai that give you that taste. You could say ours is one.This fortnightly column explores the different street foods of Chennai"

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock) While there can be many reasons for having brittle hair and nails, biotin deficiency is one of them. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)A healthy body and mind requires a wholesome diet  one that is rich in essential nutrients like proteins, vitamins, fats, iron, carbohydrates, among others. If the diet lacks even one essential item, the health consequences can be extreme and unpleasant. Vitamins are extremely important for many reasons, and a deficiency will make the body throw some warning signs. So, look out for these tell-tale signs that show you can do with more vitamin-rich foods.Brittle nails and hairWhile there can be many reasons for having brittle hair and nails, biotin deficiency is one of them. Also known as vitamin B7, biotin helps the body convert food into energy. When there is a deficiency, which is rare, the nails become brittle and the hair starts to split and thin. Other signs may include fatigue, pain in the muscles, cramps, etc. Check with your doctor regarding this, who may ask you to consume biotin-rich foods such as egg yolks, fish, nuts, spinach, broccoli, sweet potatoes, bananas, to name a few.Bleeding gumsA classic sign of a diet that lacks vitamin C. While the bleeding may happen because of improper brushing techniques as well, it is a vitamin C deficiency that is largely to be blamed. This particular vitamin helps with immunity and the healing of wounds. It also acts an an antioxidant and helps prevent cell damage. But, remember that the body does not produce vitamin C on its own; it is dependent on the diet. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables every day.Mouth ulcersUlcer of the mouth and cracks at the corners of the lips are indicative of vitamin deficiency, particularly that of vitamin B. Additionally, they are also caused because of iron deficiency. Consume green leafy vegetables, meat, fish, nuts, seeds, whole grains, etc.Poor night visionLow intakes of vitamin A is linked to poor night vision. A condition called night blindness happens when the diet does not include a lot of vitamin A. This condition reduces peoples ability to see in the dark. If left untreated, this can lead to total blindness as well. If you suspect your vitamin A intake is low, have fish, eggs, dairy products, dark leafy veggies, etc.It is ideal to check with your medical professional besides making some dietary changes.

Around 20 per cent of potatoes grown in Gujarat are of FL-2027 variety.Farmers prefer it as gives higher returns, activists said. The potato crop is sown mainly in November and December."

The crop, known locally as kattu koorka, has the shape and size of a taro root, but does not belong to the colocasia genus.There is much demand for the egg-shaped tuber in the mint family. It is usually sold for 30 to 40 a kilo. Saby Varghese, former Divisional Forest Officer, Marayur, who was instrumental in opening Chilla, said that kattu koorka cannot be described purely as an endemic species. The special climatic and soil conditions could be yielding the special tuber variety.K.V. Binoji, co-ordinator, Chilla, said the crop had fetched a price of up to 80 a kg. Over 13,000 kg of kattu koorka arrived at the market on last Thursday. Murugan, a farmer at Kammalankudy settlement, said that it took five to seven months for the plants to give yield in his settlement. However, the duration might differ. The crop, which has a unique smell and taste, is highly sought after in Rajakkad, Adimaly, and Kochi.Main areasKattu koorka is mainly produced in the tribal settlements of Periyakudy, Koottukalkudy, Kavakkudy, Nellippety, Vengappara, Kammalankudy, Karpoorakudy, Oonjampara, Eechampetty, Iruttalakudy, Puthukkudy, and Thayannankudy.A Forest Department initiative has been preserving many endemic varieties of vegetables such as spinach, found exclusively in the tribal settlements of the Marayur Forest Division and the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. Under a similar programme, the department has been encouraging tribals farmers to grow kattu koorka, leading to its popularity."

In one of them, a man and five women were sitting. I could identify the man as my son-in-law. I forwarded that picture to Bexen's mother and she, too, has confirmed it. My granddaughter can also be seen in the photo sitting on the lap of a woman wearing a blue veil. Most probably that is my daughter, Bindhu said.In July 2016, 20 people who reportedly went missing from Kerala were suspected to have joined IS. Most of them hailed from Kasargode district.The missing included six couples and two children  two of the women were pregnant. The group reportedly included two doctors, three or four engineers, and an MBA graduate. Rashid Abdulla, who is also missing since that time, is suspected to be the leader of this group and had spearheaded the recruitment drive.Among the missing were brothers Bexen and Bestin and their wives Nimisha and Merin. The brothers were born in Christian families before converting to Islam. Nimisha, born a Hindu, became Fathima after conversion.Merin, also born into a Christian family, became Mariam after embracing Islam. Nimisha was a dental student in Kasargode when she converted and married Bexen. Before leaving in 2016, they allegedly told their families they were going to Sri Lanka.So far, there has been no official confirmation from the central agencies or the Ministry of External Affairs on the number of Indian IS affiliates who have surrendered in Afghanistan.However, Bindhu was ecstatic as the photograph and unconfirmed news seemed like a ray of hope after three years of struggle to find her daughter. Bindhu said she was not concerned about the impending cases or the long way ahead as long as her daughter and family come back home.I am not worried about the case or anything else because if they come out of Afghanistan, nothing is impossible. Let the case go on (for as long as it can), my daughter did not manipulate, convert or kill anyone. Let it take time. Once she is in India, I would be very happy. Let us not look at the negative elements in this positive moment, she said.Bindhu also expressed excitement about meeting her granddaughter whom she is yet to see in person. Soon after I saw the picture, I started thinking of preparing dosa and potato curry, my daughter's favourite dish, and taking it to Delhi when she comes back, she said.When asked about the struggle of the last three years, Bindhu said the key was to stay positive that her daughter would return one day.I was sure about this. There were no doubts. Many relatives, friends and neighbours stopped talking to me, but I did not lose heart. I have no complaints against anyone. I was sure my daughter will return and now I finally got a positive news,"" she said.Over the past three years, Bindhu has sought help from the state and central governments and even the administration in Kabul while looking for her daughter. She said the Centre has been particularly helpful.Bindhu recalled the time when she sunk into depression and was unable to sleep for about two months.That is when I decided to take care of myself and concentrate on my goals. My key was to stay positive and I started exercising, along with doing my work as a makeup artist. I have a piece of advice for all those who are going through a low phase in life. Don't listen to neighbours, relatives or friends. Only listen to yourself, she added.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

It is interesting to understand other cultures, and I found the idea of Thanksgiving fascinating. I began celebrating it with my friends and family, and we usually go for dinner on that day, Joseph shared.For college student Tanisha Kannan, who is relatively new to the concept of Thanksgiving, the best part about the day is bonding with family. I just love the feeling of so many family members coming over and sharing a hearty meal together. It is something that happens rarely since all of us live in different parts of the globe, says Tanisha who has been celebrating the occasion for the last two years.The preparations are elaborate and this year the Kannan family has planned an extravagant Thanksgiving feast complete with roasted turkey alongside soup, potatoes, sprouts and corn. Kannans father Ravi Kannan, emphasises that the turkey is the highlight of the day. A lot of effort goes into its making which includes regulating the temperature at which the turkey is cooked and carefully making the gravy. Its fun when close family members come together to make it together, he says.For 19-year-old Maria Jessica, too, Thanksgiving is more of a family get together which she believes in celebrating in her own way rather than sticking to western traditions. Its mostly a family gathering and we dont follow much of the western traditions but at the same time we make sure not to leave out the essence of the occasion. Of course, we go along with the central theme of cooking turkey, says Jessica whose family has celebrated Thanksgiving for the last four years.From the oldest member of the family to the youngest, each of us recall the good deeds of each other in the year gone by, and have a small gratitude session, she says."

Maybe the CCTV cameras placed in the market will give us a clue, said the vendor, who found five sacks containing nearly 50-52 kg of this veggie missing from his shop.Curiously enough, the sacks containing the precious commodity were kept camouflaged under waste paper and rubbish so as not to attract unnecessary attention. And yet, the thief knew exactly where to search. The burglar had removed all the papers and other material covering the sacks and took away the booty, said Prajapati while talking to TOI.I had bought onions at Rs 60-70 per kg on Thursday. I always keep nearly 200kg of all three items  onion, potato and garlic  for daily retail sale, said the shopkeeper who explained that each sack will also yield in 2-3 kg of waste.

2019-11-28,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/onion-prices-hit-record-high/article30100440.ece,Onion prices hit record high,"In the kitchen, onions and tears go hand in hand, but the potent effect of the staple ingredient is now making buyers weep even while shopping. In what could well be a record for the State, a kilo of onion on Wednesday crossed 100 in wholesale markets.Traders and officials in the Horticulture Department claimed that this was the first time onion prices had crossed the psychological barrier of 100 in Karnataka. It is being sold for 115-135 a kg in retail markets, while the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price on Wednesday was 118.The price hike indicates that the Union governments programme to stabilise the rising cost of kitchen staples  tomatoes, onions, and potatoes  announced in the 2018-19 budget, has evidently failed to take off, said a senior procurement official for a leading retail chain.Farmers and traders blame the heavy rains in August and September across Karnataka and Maharashtra. This has led to large-scale crop damage creating an acute shortage of supply. Even the onions currently being sold are wet, of very low quality, and decompose very fast, said Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association.A respite in the near future seems unlikely as the next harvest is only expected by the end of January 2020. This gives no respite to consumers for another two months and may drive the retail prices further north to even cross the 150 barrier if the government doesnt intervene, traders said. The only way to bring some stability in the prices is to import onions from Egypt on a mass scale, said B.N. Parasad, managing director, HOPCOMS.Lax responseThe Union government-owned MMTC Ltd. is said to be looking at importing one lakh tonnes of onions from Egypt and has already placed an order for the first consignment of 6,090 tonnes at a cost of 60/kg. It is expected to land on Indian shores by the first week of December. However, Karnataka is yet to place an order for onions from this consignment.When contacted, Shashikala Jolle, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, said she was busy with the byelection campaign in Gokak, Belagavi, but would review the situation soon.Shamla Iqbal, Commissioner, Food and Civil Supplies Department, said the department was reviewing production strategy with the Horticulture Department and will take a call.

Almost everyone gets into the act, the Supreme Court of India and top echelons of the Government not excluded, while children are forced to breathe polluted air. Airwaves are filled with immediate band-aid type solutions and television experts finally come around to just one issue  stubble burning by farmers in Punjab. Therefore, the solution also gets simplified; prosecute those who burn stubble (the stick) give them happy seeders by the thousands (the carrot). All is well till the next Deepavali.An oversimplificationIf the problem was that simple, it would have been solved long ago. The intention is not to justify stubble burning, but to point out that it is not the only culprit (though it is an important one) and other factors need to be attended to as well. The simplification of the narrative to stubble burning and the argument that all that smoke that comes out of Punjabs paddy fields lands in the National Capital Region (NCR), particularly in the capital city of Delhi, may not stand scientific scrutiny considering the fact that wind speeds, dispersal rates and settling down of particles are governed by laws of science.Recently, there was a reference in a television programme about satellite observations on stubble burning from 2002-17. Reportedly, there has been an increase of 3% in aerosol loading attributable to crop residue burning during October and November every year. However, no data was presented on the impact of burning of biomass in urban Delhi, coal fired ovens (tandoors) and coal-based industries, coal-based power plants in the outskirts of Delhi, the exponential increase in sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, in the NCR and so forth.As for stubble burning, we need to stop this practice for sure. But how do we do it? Farmers do it out of economic compulsion. The city centric argument is that Punjab now produces 25% more rice than what it did 15 years ago, which is good for the country, but bad for Delhi. Others argue that the Punjab Preservation of Sub-soil Water Act 2009 is the main culprit. There are many who believe that a generous distribution of direct seeders (or Happy Seeders as they are called) should make the difference.Three ways outEssentially, we come to three options: Reduce paddy area/production, allow farmers to plant/transplant paddy before June and distribute happy seeders. This will, according to many, address the problem of air pollution in Delhi during October and November.Let us start with reduction in production of paddy. Punjab was never a traditional rice cultivator. It took up rice cultivation in response to the national policy of food self-sufficiency. They achieved the highest productivity in the country and contributed maximum among all States to the central pool of rice procurement. In the process, the area went up from 2.6 million hectares in 2001 to 3 million hectares in 2017; production went up from 9 million tonnes to 12.5 million tonnes. Punjab dug deeper to get groundwater and caused long-term damage to itself.Attempts at diversification did not take off because of the difference in net farm returns and market risks. A rice farmer earns about 57,000 per hectare whereas maize in a maize-wheat combination would set them back by about 15,000-17,000. The farmer will not bear this burden. An estimate by agricultural economist Ashok Gulati suggests 12,000 per hectare (keeping power saving in mind) as an acceptable compensation. If the idea is to reduce area of common paddy by half a million hectares, resulting in a reduction of output of 2 million tonnes, the Central government has to step in and support this change for the next five years. This half-a-million hectare should be in water-stressed blocks and can be encouraged to shift to maize or any other crop. Another one lakh hectare can shift to basmati production.Falling water levelsComing to the more controversial argument about the Punjab Preservation of Sub-soil Water Act 2009, there exist strong arguments to prevent over exploitation of groundwater especially if farmers cultivate rice in April/May. Though strong evidence is necessary to establish improvement in groundwater levels, there is some evidence to show that the rate of deterioration has slowed down.If farmers are allowed to go back to the pre-2009 regime, what will happen to the groundwater in Punjab is anyones guess. The elephant in the room, however, is free power to tube wells. Can this amount of about 6,000 crore be shifted to a direct benefit transfer as has been suggested by policy experts? Is there a political will? Are the large farmers the real opposition here? This shift could be a game changer. A bigger game changer will be a shift to cash transfer in lieu of grains in the public distribution system by the Centre.The happy seeder is the most talked about solution. Direct seeders do help but have limitations. First, the seeder has to operate within about 4-5 days of the harvest. The effectiveness depends on the moisture (not too moist, not too dry) present in the soil at the time of seeding . This requires a good understanding of soil conditions. The agronomic practices need to change particularly with regard to application of fertilizer and irrigation. These machines may be used only during the 15-day window in a whole year. They will remain idle for the remaining 350 days. My reckoning is that Punjab will need about 20,000 of these machines if basmati areas (about 6 lakh ha) and rice-potato areas are excluded from the calculation.The problem is complex and needs a solution. But the solution should take into consideration the economic condition of farmers, the scientific options available and the willingness of the Central government to change policy and fund a major part of the expenditure. Blaming the farmers alone will not do; citizens need to put in their bit too. We owe it to the children.T.

For, who else will steal onions in the wedding season, but someone who knows what is selling hot at present?Selling at Rs 100 a kg in retail, onions have been burning more than just eyes of late. Hence, when theres a theft of 250kg onions, it kicks in more curiosity than lament for the loss. Or so it has been for Sanju Prajapati, a vegetable vendor near Patel Park next to Zoroastrian Bank in Palanpur Patiya, whose shop was burgled for the priceless commodity in the early morning hours of Thursday.Prajapati is more curious to find out whod dunnit, than he is about pressing theft charges.I am very much interested to know who stole the onions. Maybe the CCTV cameras placed in the market will give us a clue, said the vendor, who found five sacks containing nearly 50-52 kg of this veggie missing from his shop.Curiously enough, the sacks containing the precious commodity were kept camouflaged under waste paper and rubbish so as not to attract unnecessary attention. And yet, the thief knew exactly where to search. The burglar had removed all the papers and other material covering the sacks and took away the booty, said Prajapati while talking to TOI.I had bought onions at Rs 60-70 per kg on Thursday. I always keep nearly 200kg of all three items  onion, potato and garlic  for daily retail sale, said the shopkeeper who explained that each sack will also yield in 2-3 kg of waste. He therefore hikes rates by 25-30 per cent per kilo to pay up labour charges on each sack, he added.Prajapati further said that he consulting his market colleagues if he should register a police complaint or not.Since the past 15 days, onions  an ubiquitous item in every kitchen  is being sold at a premium in retail market, thanks to hoarding and short supply in the wholesale market."

Now, we plan to organize more such drives to help poor people, the president of the local community said.When asked about what led him to come up with this scheme, the head's response was simple: ""Food connects people by heart and no one can understand this better than a Bengali.We noticed that poor people are not being entertained by vegetable vendors when they are ask for one or two pieces of onions, which is all that they can afford to barely make ends meet. Thats why we have decided to organise the 'onion fair' and distribute the vegetable for free.This is not the first time that Mitra club has initiated something like this.

A gist: papa blanca (white potato), papa amarilla (yellow potato), papa negra (black potato), papa prpura (purple potato that turns blue when cooked), papa rosada (pink potato with a white inside) the list, never-ending.You wont stumble upon these at the Peruvian Gastronomy Festival, a 10-course degustation menu on traditional staples by The Peru Embassy.Its all Indian aloo. The trivia, however, will explain why mounds of papas occupy your table in every imaginable preparation  boiled, baby-sized and mashed. Even as French fries.Your first papa dish is Yuca with Green Sauce, fat boiled and fried sticks of cassava (from the tuber brood) with avocado and parsley sauce; redolent of French fries with green chutney, nothing fancy.But Potatoes with Huancaina Cream is the mood-setter. Instead of dunking cold sliced potatoes in the sauce, how its traditionally done, we were served boiled baby potatoes (skin intact) with the cream as dip.The yellow, rich, creamy, almost cheesy textured Huancaina with a subtle hint of chill is the star. But the ultimate potato lovers haven is the Causa, a mashed potato mini cake sandwiching shredded chicken and boiled avocado bits.

2019-11-29,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/indias-food-basket-must-be-enlarged/article30109818.ece,India’s food basket must be enlarged,"India is ranked 102 in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) out of 117 qualified countries. Hunger is defined by caloric deprivation; protein hunger; hidden hunger by deficiency of micronutrients. Nearly 47 million or four out of 10 children in India do not meet their potential because of chronic undernutrition or stunting. This leads to diminished learning capacity, increased chronic diseases, low birth-weight infants from malnourished parents. The global nutrition report pegs 614 million women and more than half the women in India aged 15-49 as being anaemic.Nutrition gardenRecently, the Ministry of Human Resources Development brought out school nutrition garden guidelines encouraging eco-club students to identify fruits and vegetables best suited to topography, soil and climate. These gardens can give students lifelong social, numerical and presentation skills, care for living organisms and team work, besides being used in the noon-meal scheme. Students also learn to cultivate fruits and vegetables in their homes and this could address micronutrient deficiencies.Agrobiodiversity  relating to diversity of crops and varieties  is crucial in food security, nutrition, health and essential in agricultural landscapes. Out of 2,50,000 globally identified plant species, about 7,000 have historically been used in human diets. Today, only 30 crops form the basis of the worlds agriculture and just three species of maize, rice and wheat supply more than half the worlds daily calories.Genetic diversity of crops, livestock and their wild relatives, are fundamental to improve crop varieties and livestock breeds. We would not have thousands of crop varieties and animal breeds without the rich genetic pool. India is a centre of origin of rice, brinjal, citrus, banana, cucumber species.Across the world, 37 sites are designated as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), of which three are Indian  Kashmir (saffron), Koraput (traditional agriculture) and Kuttanad (below sea-level farming). In India, over 811 cultivated plants and 902 of their wild relatives have been documented. Our promising genetic resources include rice from Tamil Nadu (Konamani), Assam (Agni bora) and Kerala (Pokkali), Bhalia Wheat and mushroom (Guchhi) from Himachal Pradesh and rich farm animal native breeds  cattle (42), buffaloes (15), goat (34), sheep (43) and chicken (19). Agrobiodiversity helps nutrition-sensitive farming and bio-fortified foods. For instance, moringa (drumstick) has micro nutrients and sweet potato is rich in Vitamin A. There are varieties of pearl millet and sorghum rich in iron and zinc.Development goalsThe UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 advocates for Zero Hunger and the Aichi Biodiversity Target focuses on countries conserving genetic diversity of plants, farm livestock and wild relatives. It emphasises that countries develop strategies and action plans to halt biodiversity loss and reduce direct pressure on biodiversity.The Centre for Biodiversity Policy and Law (CEBPOL), a policy advocacy unit of the National Biodiversity Authority, came out with recommendations to increase Indias agrobiodiversity in 2019. These include a comprehensive policy on ecological agriculture to enhance native pest and pollinator population providing ecosystem services for the agricultural landscape. It suggested promotion of the bio-village concept of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) for ecologically sensitive farming; conserving crop wild relatives of cereals, millets, oilseeds, fibres, forages, fruits and nuts, vegetables, spices etc. for crop genetic diversity healthier food; providing incentives for farmers cultivating native landrace varieties and those conserving indigenous breeds of livestock and poultry varieties.The recommendations also include encouraging community seed banks in each agro-climatic zone so that regional biotic properties are saved and used by new generation farmers; preparing an agrobiodiversity index, documenting traditional practices through Peoples Biodiversity Registers, identifying Biodiversity Heritage Sites under provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and strengthening Biodiversity Management Committees to conserve agrobiodiversity and traditional knowledge. Developing a national level invasive alien species policy is required to identify pathways, mapping, monitoring, managing, controlling and eradicating the invasive species and prioritising problematic species based on risk assessment studies.Loss of crop genetic resources is mainly a result of adopting new crop varieties without conserving traditional varieties. Similarly, there are concerns on high output breeds for production of meat, milk and egg. The consumption pattern and culinary diversity must be enlarged to increase Indias food basket. To conserve indigenous crop, livestock and poultry breeds, it is recommended to mainstream biodiversity into agricultural policies, schemes, programmes and projects to achieve Indias food and nutrition security and minimise genetic erosion.C.

(The New York Times: Erin Schaff) President Donald Trump serves food to troops during a Thanksgiving visit to Bagram Air Field in Kabul, Afghanistan on Thursday, Nov. 28, 2019. (The New York Times: Erin Schaff)Written by Michael CrowleyPresident Donald Trump paid an unannounced Thanksgiving visit to US troops in Afghanistan on Thursday and declared that he had reopened peace negotiations with the Taliban less than three months after scuttling talks in hopes of ending 18 years of war.The Taliban wants to make a deal, and were meeting with them, Trump said during a meeting with Afghanistans president, Ashraf Ghani, at the main base for US forces north of Kabul.Were going to stay until such time as we have a deal, or we have total victory, and they want to make a deal very badly, Trump added even as he reaffirmed his desire to reduce the US military presence to 8,600 troops, down from about 12,000 to 13,000.Trumps sudden announcement on peace talks came at a critical moment in the United States long, drawn-out military venture in Afghanistan, a time when the country is mired in turmoil over disputed election results and Americans at home are increasingly tired of an operation that began shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks.The scope and prospects of any renewed negotiations remained unclear, and White House officials gave few details beyond Trumps sudden revelation. On the flight to Afghanistan, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, had insisted that the secret trip was truly about Thanksgiving and supporting the troops and nothing about the peace process with the Taliban.The Taliban made no official comment immediately after the late-night visit and Ghani said little afterward about any peace talks.But while the Afghan government has long demanded that the Taliban agree to a cease-fire, no evidence has emerged that the group was willing to grant one. Instead, it has said it would discuss the possibility in negotiations with Afghanistans political leaders over the future of the country once the Americans agree to leave.The president carried out the traditional role of feeding turkey and mashed potatoes to troops in fatigues, then dined, mingled and posed for photographs before delivering remarks celebrating the US military before about 1,500 troops in an aircraft hangar.But his visit also had an important political dimension. Trump, who angrily called off talks with the Taliban in September just as the sides appeared close to an accord, is searching for foreign policy achievements he can celebrate on the campaign trail over the next year.

If they try to reduce use of the kitchen staple, their products will lose their tang and customers will stop buying. If they attempt to raise prices of the items, the consequences could be similar. And not like rates of yeast, potato, carrot and capsicum offer any respite, rue bakers.""We use onions in multiple products. Egg/vegetable puffs, sandwiches, bread toast and mixture get their taste from onions. I have not increased prices of these products in my bakery. All I have done is reduced the quantity of onion we use in them,"" said Bala Subramanian Bhat, who has been running a bakery in Kamakshipalya for 33 years now. ""I can't even reduce wages of my workers as the cost of living is going up. I have incurred a loss in the past six months,"" Bhat added.Unwilling to compromise on quality, most bakers may be left with no choice but to charge more for the items they sell, if the price spiral does not abate.""As an old establishment we have faith that onion prices will come down. In the unlikely scenario of that not happening, we wouldn't have a choice but to increase the prices of our products. For instance, a sandwich at our store costs Rs 35. We will increase it by Rs 3,"" said VF David, owner of Fatima Bakery, Castle Street junction, Richmond Road.For now, bakers are looking at various avenues to compensate for the price spiral. And their first target is manpower.""Not just onions, prices of carrots and beans too are on the higher side. I have laid off three managers from my store,"" said David.""Onion crops were ravaged in the recent rain and that is why prices have hit the roof. We don't expect the rates to drop for another month and a half. Until new crops arrive, prices aren't going to reduce,"" a Hopcoms official said.Some bakers have, meanwhile, decided to weather the crisis. Vijay Shankar, owner of Variar bakery, told TOI: ""Such unpredicted situations are a part of every business. The difference we have felt is not very big, but we are spending close to Rs 30,000 extra every week on onions alone.""""When we start a business, we have to deal with the ups and downs that come with it,"" Vijay Shankar added."

Trump said he planned to reduce the number to 8,600 without giving further details.Theres nowhere Id rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here with the toughest, strongest, best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth, the president, who was making his first trip to the war-torn country, told the troops.Ive just come from serving Thanksgiving dinner to some of you... and we had a good time.Trump joked that he had just started eating when he was called away, and didnt even get to taste his turkey.I shouldve started with that, instead of the mashed potatoes, he said.But I hope everyone enjoyed the fantastic meal, it certainly did look good and hopefully everyone can get some well-deserved rest this holiday.Americas longest warThe United States earlier this year reached a deal with Taliban insurgents to pull US troops from Afghanistan and wind down Americas longest war in return for security guarantees.But Trump made a shock move in September, describing the year-long talks as dead and withdrawing an invitation to the insurgents to meet near Washington due to the killing of a US soldier.The Taliban refuses to negotiate formally with the Afghan government, though diplomatic efforts have continued to foster dialogue and an eventual peace deal.Trump said Thursday the war in Afghanistan will not be decided on the battlefield and that ultimately there will need to be a political solution decided by people in the region.The US president has often vowed to pull out of the USs endless wars, and he is keen to withdraw many troops from Afghanistan ahead of the November 2020 election when he faces a tough battle to win a second term.Afghanistan remains roiled by violence, and US presidents are still only able to make fleeting, unannounced visits to Bagram -- the biggest US base in the country -- due to the security threat.Ghani, who was only given a few hours notice about the visit, thanked Trump for pushing for the type of peace that will ensure the gains of the past year and ensure your security and our security.The Taliban last week handed over two hostages -- an American and an Australian -- after three years in captivity in exchange for three high-ranking insurgent prisoners, a move seen as a boost to peace talks.Friction with US military leadersBack in Washington, Trumps relations with the US military leadership have recently soured over his repeated interference in high-profile discipline cases.Trump reversed the demotion of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher who was accused of war crimes but only found guilty of a lesser offense.Gallaghers cause had been championed by Fox News and Trumps conservative base.The case drew sharp criticism from the top brass concerned that the president was undermining military judicial process.Trump this month also dismissed a murder conviction against a soldier who ordered his men to fire on three unarmed Afghans in 2012.And he granted clemency to another soldier charged with murder over the death of an alleged Taliban bomb-maker in 2010.Before taking the secret 13-hour flight to Afghanistan, Trump had been expected to spend Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and to make video calls to US troops deployed abroad.The White House scheduled tweets that were sent from the presidents account during the flight when he did not have access to the internet."

Not only this, the schools MDM in charge was suspended and action was also recommended against the assistant basic shiksha adkhari (ABSA) of Chopan.Talking to reporters on Friday, Sonbhadra district magistrate S Rajalingam said, The matter was investigated immediately after the spread of the news. When I visited the school, I found that shiksha mitra Jitendra Kumar with malafide intention instructed the staff to serve the available one litre milk well before the scheduled time among the children by mixing water.He (Jitendra) did so with bad intention, as the school MDM in charge Shlaish Kumar Chaurasia, who had gone to procure more milk, had already instructed him to distribute the milk only after his return, the DM added.However, Jitendra not only served the water mixed milk but also called some mediapersons to shoot it and upload it on social media, claimed the DM, adding, An FIR was lodged against Jitendra at Chopan police station under section 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant) of IPC and he was terminated from service.The MDM in charge was suspended for laxity in arranging milk in time. Also, a report against ABSA of Chopan block, Mukesh Kumar, has been forwarded to the government for laxity in monitoring the MDM operations, he added.Earlier, a primary school at Siyur village in Mirzapur district had come into limelight in August after a video of roti-namak (bread and salt) being served to the students went viral on social media. The cook of the school, Rukmini Devi, had alleged that insufficient ingredients  2.5kg potatoes, 250gm oil and some spices  were provided to prepare meal for 45-50 students for a week. Similarly, only two litres of milk was given to serve the students with an instruction to mix water in to compensate the shortfall.The Mirzapur district administration, however, had held a local scribe who broke the story and the village heads representative guilty of criminal conspiracy to malign the image of the government."

Prepared with care by Chef Vikas Seth and his team, the dishes at Sriracha are a treat to the eyes and the palate, each presented with a little twist that sets it apart. For instance, the Som Tam or green papaya salad stands out with the chefs addition of grapefruit, Malta oranges and his own special house sauce. Plus, it is hand-pounded and tossed at your table.Every dish is accompanied by a different sauce that enhances its flavour. Whether it is a spicy lemon dip for the tamarind and lemongrass chicken or a plum and pineapple salsa for the turmeric and chilli king prawns, the taste lingers long after the dish is gone.Especially succulent is the char siu pork belly served with a traditional Chinese sauce usually made by combining honey, five-spice powder, red fermented bean curd, dark soy sauce, hoisin sauce and other ingredients.Do not pass up the Pandan leaf-wrapped cottage cheese. With its chilli coriander soy sauce, this starter surpasses most non-vegetarian dishes and gives the humble paneer a place in the sun.Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is the varied options available for vegetarians, whether in the starters or main course. For instance, sweet potatoes dusted with togarashi (Japanese spice mixture) or charred broccoli with chilli sauce are not commonplace on menu cards. Ditto for the roasted pumpkin and water chestnut dim sums or the crispy all-green uramaki which is an asparagus, avocado and cucumber sushi option.Sushi lovers should try the OMG sushi roll  a hearty mouthful of seafood goodness. Nori (Japanese for edible seaweed) holds vinegar rice, tuna, crab and salmon together. The sushi is flambeed at the table, adding a special touch to the presentation that is a hallmark of the dishes at Sriracha.What could be the biggest draw at Sriracha is the circular Cambodian-style barbeque table. Meats, vegetables and soup surround the centre of the grill; noodles and jasmine rice are served alongside.Whatever be your choices at Sriracha, make sure you leave room for dessert. The banana cake is served with salted date caramel and an in-house coconut ice cream that sits lightly on the tongue. Garnished with almond crisps and swirls of tender coconut, it is perfect for two if you are the sharing kind. The same cant be said for the Sumatra dark chocolate mousse served atop coconut cream and embellished with crushed peanut tuile  there is an overwhelming temptation to be selfish.For those whove indulged a bit too much and have only a wee bit of space for something sweet, the sesame honey mini cones are just the thing."

We have reduced paddy straw burning by around 40-45 percent, so far.""It was purely through enforcement. We have not made any changes policy-wise. We studied the behavioural pattern of farmers in certain villages who would burn stubble time and again. This time, we specifically concentrated on those villages,"" he said.He said only 10 per cent of around 7,000 villages in Haryana are burning stubble.Haryana produces around 7 million tonnes of paddy straw every year.Almost the whole of paddy straw, except that of Basmati rice, is burnt to make the field ready for sowing of wheat or potato.Experts say farmers resort to burning the crop residue because other solutions are not economically viable.Stubble burning is considered a major reason behind the annual smog episodes in Delhi-NCR.This year, the contribution of farm fires to pollution in the region peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, triggering a public health emergency.The Haryana Pollution Control Board member secretary said the air pollution issue won't resolve without a political will and proper implementation of anti-pollution measures.""Departments such as transport and agriculture should also have a proper policy,"" he said.Narayanan also said that there's nothing ""green"" about green crackers and that ""fireworks should be banned completely (on Diwali). There's no other way out.""With Delhi's air quality plummeting to dangerous levels around Diwali every year, the Supreme Court had in 2018 banned polluting firecrackers and ordered that only green firecrackers, which is said to cause 30 per cent less pollution, can be manufactured and sold and enforced a two-hour limit for setting them off.However, a large number of revelers brazenly flouted the Supreme Court-enforced two-hour limit for bursting crackers this year too.Green pyrotechnics also failed to draw good responses both from sellers and buyers, primarily due to lack of variety, limited stock, and high prices."
2019-11-29,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/sep/22/opening-the-gateaus-2036101.html,Opening the Gateaus,"Nandita Iyer ByExpress News ServiceThe street food culture in Mauritius is reflective of its history and the cultural mosaic of a diverse people who form the country today. The earliest known history of what we now know as Mauritius starts from 900 AD when it was spotted by Arab sailors travelling for trade. In the 15th century, the Portuguese colonised the island, followed by the Dutch, French and the British. In the 1800s, post the abolition of slavery, indentured labourers from India were sent to Mauritius to work in the sugarcane plantations.The migrant labourers from India, Malaysia, China and Africa, many of whom stayed back in the country, have added to the diverse local food scene. You might be staying at a luxury resort and partaking gourmet cuisines, but Mauritius is incomplete without its streets, beaches and markets and the varied delicacies these places have to offer. Heres a list of 10 Mauritian street foods that you must try.Dholl PooriThis is the most iconic and must-eat food in Mauritius. While it is called poori, it is not a deep-fried flatbread like its Indian counterpart. Ground and crumbled dal is stuffed in a refined flour paratha, served with a slather of chutneys, bean curries, rougailles and pickles. It is sold all around the island, either out of glass boxes mounted on scooters or in market stalls and with a fairly consistent taste. A pair of dholl pooris topped with all the accompaniments and rolled up in paper is a perfect snack to munch on and explore the street food scene in Mauritius.Gateau PimentChilli cakes in Mauritian Creole, this is a spin-off on the South Indian dal vada made using chana dal, with a blend of spices and chillies. They are also known as gateau dholl. Mauritians are not afraid to use a proper punch from chillies in their dishes and gateau piment is just one example of that. These are served stuffed inside a buttered warm baguette or a pain maison.BadiaSimilar to the Indian pakoda/bhajia, badias are made from chickpea flour with the addition of finely chopped vegetables and spices and served with chutneys on the side. Eggplant is a popular choice for these vegetable fritters (bringele frire). These, along with gateau piment, are some of the most loved snacks that the locals call gadjak, which are served with drinks.PineappleDo not miss feasting on the Victoria pineapple in Mauritius. Smaller in size with an intensely sweet juicy flesh, the street vendors cut it in the form of a large lollipop with a dusting of salt and chilli powder so you can eat it on the go without getting your hands messy.Gateau (gato) MerveilleNot unlike our chaats, gateau merveille is sold in stalls in and around Port Louis and Mahebourg waterfront. Deep-fried, crisp flour pooris topped with green chutney and tamarind chutney are a popular local snack.Gateau PatatesSweet potato cakes in Mauritian Creole, these can be bought from vendors at the entrance of Port Louis Market. Mashed sweet potato is mixed with flour to make a dough, which is filled with desiccated coconut, raisins and sugar. These are deep fried until golden brown. Sweet potato cakes are a special during Diwali, which is celebrated in a big way in Mauritius.Du Pain FrireThis translates to fried bread. Stale bread is dipped in a gram flour and refined flour batter and deep fried until crisp and golden brown. A good way to turn stale bread into an inviting snack or appetiser, these are sold by many street vendors around the island.Chinese street foodsMauritian street food also has a strong Chinese (Hakka) influence. Mine fret (fried noodles), bol renverse and boulettes are some of the well-loved Chinese dishes served on the streets of the island. Boulettes are dumplings filled with chicken, vegetables or seafood. Bol renverse is a convenient single portion of a chicken and veggie stir-fry served with rice and a fried egg on top. The dishes are best found in Port Louis, China Town or at vendors on beaches such as Mont Choisy and Flic en Flac.NapolitansWhile technically not a street food, this cross between a cake and a cookie is a local favourite. Two shortbread cookies are sandwiched with jam and covered with a pink icing. Some eateries stock it up in their glass display boxes.Gateau MoutailleNot many countries, other than India, serves up jalebis in their cuisine, but Mauritius does, under this fancy sounding name. These syrupy sweet and crispy treats find an important place in the street food fare, and what better way to end a street food tasting."

Dreary-looking Soviet-era apartment blocks dominate the landscape. Gnarly, winter-ready trees poke lethargically up at the sky.KHOR VIRAP MONASTERY: ANOTHER SECRET TREASURE Perched atop a small hill in Armenias Ararat plain, close to the Turkish-Armenian border, is the Khor Virap monastery, literally deep dungeon in Armenian.It derives its name from a dungeon accessed by climbing through a narrow hole in the now-chapels stone floor, down a steep iron ladder (it is not for the faint-hearted or even mildly claustrophobic).It was in this dungeon that the saint Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned for 14 years by the pagan King Tiridates III.In 301 CE, the story goes, the king was cured of dementia by Gregory, who claimed to have been aided by divine forces. He was finally set free, Armenia was declared a Christian country (the worlds first), and Gregory became the first head of the Armenian Apostolic Church.But then, theyre not the reason most people make the 20-minute drive here from Armenias capital city of Yerevan. The reason any tourists come here is to see a labyrinth nicknamed Armenias Taj Mahal, officially, Levons Divine Underground Museum.Hidden beneath an ordinary-looking home, at the end of a meandering alley, is a series of underground chambers, all carved out by one man  Levon Arkelyan. It started when his wife Tosya asked for a potato storage cellar for winter. Levon started digging in 1985, and didnt stop till his death in 2008. Today, the caves, stairways, grottoes and secret rooms he created are one of Armenias biggest tourist attractions.Over 23 years  using only rudimentary tools like a chisel and hammer  Levon (who was a builder by training), created a 3,000-sq-ft space, 21 metres deep.Working alone, sometimes for 20 hours a day, he managed to dig through the tough basalt layer and reach the softer, easy-to-carve tuff, recognised by its delicate pink hue.Levon was a builder by training. Using only rudimentary tools like a chisel and hammer , he created a 3,000-sq-ft space, 21 metres deep, and also carved out decorative pillars in the walls.It was from the tuff that Levons creations started to take shape. These included the main stepped pathway leading down to six small chambers and ribbed-roofed vestibules, all elaborately decorated with Doric columns, traditional Armenian carved crosses called khachkars and stunning bas-reliefs.The original plan was for an underground maze of 74 rooms. Levon said he saw the plans in his dreams, and believed he was being guided by the divine.Since his sudden death at age 67, Tosya has run the facility as a pay-as-you-please private museum where she and her daughters take turns to act as guides.The caves are now part of government brochures too. And everywhere you look in Arinj, signs point to this unique attraction.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter"
2019-11-30,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cess-poorly-utilised-for-welfare-schemes-in-odisha-cag-report/article30119577.ece,Cess poorly utilised for welfare schemes in Odisha: CAG report,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India has detected poor utilisation of cess collected for the welfare of construction workers in Odisha.The State finances audit report of CAG tabled in the State Assembly on Thursday says the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996, and the BOCW (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996, were enacted to improve the working conditions of workers and to provide financial aid to them.The laws were aimed at augmenting resources for workers through levy and collection of cess on the cost of construction.Though the collection of labour cess increased by 71.23 crore from 168.90 crore in 2013-14 to 240.13 crore in 2017-18, the percentage of utilisation of fund ranged from 1.33 in 2013-14 to 27.77 in 2017-18. Due to poor utilisation of the funds, the objective of collection of labour cess was not being achieved, the CAG report points out.Similarly, the CAG has also picked holes in the States potato mission. In order to make the State self-sufficient in potatoes by the year 2017-18, the government had launched State Potato Mission during 2015-16 for its production, storage and distribution in the State.It was implemented to provide incentive to the farmers for undertaking large scale cultivation of potatoes in cluster, give incentive for production of seed potatoes in the farmers field and to provide support for setting up of adequate number of cold storages in the State.The CAG, however, said the percentage of utilisation of funds against budget provision ranged from zero to 4.33 during 2016-17 and 2017-18.Targets not metAgainst target of establishing 55 cold storages, the department could establish only 23 resulting in a shortfall of 58.18% during the last three years. Due to inadequate utilisation of funds and non-achievement of physical target set under the State Potato Mission, the intended benefits could not be achieved, the apex audit agency says."

But when it comes to pork, alls fair in love, war  and food. In Delhi, pork is usually served in Chinese eateries, and in some high-end restaurants. But its not easy to find regional dishes such as Goas Sorpotel or the Coorgi Pandhi Curry.One of the first to offer a variety of pork dishes was a restaurant in Connaught Place called Mosaic, which shut many years ago, and later took some of its dishes to the YWCA Kitchen on Parliament Street. But thats been closed for a while, too.To cut a long story short, it was my fondness for pork that propelled me towards a restaurant called Mustard Seed. As it happened, a friend had sent a message saying that the restaurant at Assam Bhavan (called Baankaahi) had moved to the Uphaar Cinema Market. I was looking for that on the internet when I suddenly came across an eatery called Mustard Seed in the same market. To my surprise, it turned out to be the very same. The people who ran Baankaahi had now opened this. Whats more, they were the very people who were behind Mosaic and the YWCA Kitchen. To top it, a group of old friends of mine had all gathered there one afternoon for lunch  and said they'd had a great meal. So, that very evening, I found myself at Mustard Seed (011-40072565 and 9999459462).The menu has various kinds of dishes from across the country and elsewhere and quite a few pork preparations. The starters include East Indias much loved Mochar Chop (prepared with banana flower florets, 325), Thai Fish Cake (400 for full, 250 for half) and Pork Khorika (a variation of Pork Satay, 400 for full and 250 for half).Among the entrees are Kosha Mangsho (475/300), Alkas Mutton Curry (a Bhagalpur speciality, 475/300), Pork Dos Noing (Khasi pork with black sesame gravy, 400/250), Puducherry Chicken Curry (475/300), Dahi Fish (350/200), Seafood Sizzler (prawns, squids, fish, corn, salad, garlic mashed potatoes, 600) and Pork Sorpotel (500). The tea plantation specials include Shepherds Pie (475), Chicken Potpie (425), Fish and Chips (500), Vegetable Cutlets (350) and Vegetable Potpie (240).We were in a hurry and did not want an elaborate meal. So we asked for an Assamese non-vegetarian thali (450), a dish called Paas Torkari (a mix of five vegetables, 325), Fried Pork (345/250 for half) and Cocktail Mutton Chops (400/250).The pork came first, and was superb. It consisted of thin slices (with fat on the side, I was happy to note) fried with onions and bell peppers and what the menu described as a special sauce. I loved its piquant taste, complemented by the sweet touch of the onions and peppers. The mutton chops consisted of minced meat that had been crumbed and fried to perfection.The thali was as grand as it looked: rice at the centre, with a fried brinjal (beguni), a bowl of Mung Dal, Posto-Aloo (poppy seeds with potatoes), Tenga Fish (an Assamese preparation), khar (a digestive), Aloo Pitkia (mashed potatoes) and Gur Ka Kheer. The Paas Torkari was a delicious mix of carrots, beans, spinach, capsicum and potatoes, cooked lightly with just a sprinkling of spices.I love Aloo Pitikaand this had been nicely sharpened with mustard oil and green chillies. The dal  roasted and then cooked with peaswas superb. I didnt have the fish, but was told it was nice and tangy. And the kheer was finger licking good.Mindful of a friends comment that I seldom have a word of criticism, I thought hard about what I didnt like. I realised what it was. In front of me was a wall TV, and on it was an anchor who gives me nightmares. Thats one way of curbing ones appetite!But it was truly a great meal. And I felt as if I had found an old friend.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

She was in the city for a discussion on farming and her zero-waste lifestyle at Go Native, HSR.She loves trees, so much so that she didnt hesitate to lash out at municipality workers for insensitively handling the living beings. She says a tree needs everything from love and companionship to a healthy environment, just like a human needs to survive. It is a miracle to see a tree survive on the roads of India. The roads are cemented till the roots of the tree, without leaving any breathing space. It hurts to see a badly pruned tree. Municipality workers cut them without knowing the proper techniques to do it. They dont even have proper tools used to prune the trees, says 60-year-old Kumar.Coming from the suburbs of Los Angeles, Kumar calls herself the black sheep of the family. When people were moving ahead with modernisation and urbanisation, she followed a path where she can do things in the traditional way. That is what led her to grow her own food. But how does zero-waste farming work, is it even possible? Yes it is, according to Kumar. I do a lot of mulching in my garden. Mostly, it is using any material like dry leaves, wood dust etc to spread it over the surface of the soil as a covering to retain moisture in the soil, says Manju, who has around 87 trees in her garden. She mostly uses greywater (bathroom water) and black water (kitchen water) for irrigation. She also practises rainwater harvesting.With no formal training, Kumar has been farming for the past 45 years. Now she maintains her garden with 87 fruit trees and a farm where she grows vegetables. Her aim in a year is to plant at least 10 trees, and to preach the same, she uses social media as her tool. I love the way social media works. It has helped me connect with so many like-minded people. People easily reach out to me for queries. Together, its easier to make an impact than being a single warrior, she says.Easy steps to takeStart with herb gardens.Easily grown plants like potatoes,tomatoes, chilli, etc.Change your detergents to plant-based one so that you can reuse the water.Your kitchen waste are the best kind of carbon.Get a compost pit to compost it at home."

We are of course referring to South Korean cuisine, as the majority of the population in North Korea is woefully undernourished and largely bereft of the array of dishes available to their Southern brethren.The last couple of years have seen a surfeit of Korean eateries pop up all over the Capital (driven by the growing number of South Korean expats); some misses among the hits. With that in mind, we decided to head straight to the source, and dropped by Dalgrak, more commonly known as the Caf at the Korean Cultural Center in Lajpat Nagar.The cheerful, cafeteria-like dcor is bolstered by a friendly staff, ever ready to offer suggestions and tweak the dishes from the reasonably priced menu.We stuck to the classics and ordered the Vegetarian Gimbap (Korean Sushi rolls), Spicy Pork Stir-fry Deopbap (grilled pork with rice), and Jap Chae (Korean glass noodles). One Korean mainstay not available at the caf is the Samgyeopsal, so beloved around the world for the ritualistic style in which it is prepared and consumed.Comprising thin slices of fatty pork belly (the best kind of belly) served raw, alongside a grid iron, and all manner of accoutrements like kimchi, sauces, pastes, and spiced vegetables, diners have the pleasure of grilling the meat at their own tables with their favourite accompaniments and usually finishing them by wrapping the belly in lettuce leaves before pigging on them. Alas then that this dish isnt available on the menu, but we live in hope that one day it shall.Wishful thinking aside, the meal we got was quite palatable. The gimbap came decorously served on a simple platter, with a bowl of soy sauce. Diminutive in size, the rolls more than made up in flavour, the rotundas of rice wrapped in seaweed studded with gem-like bits of seasonal vegetables, fresh and crisp to the crunch. Dipped in soy, the umami gave a delicious undertone to the simplicity of the rice and vegetables.Speaking of all things umami, the stir fry smacked of it, tender renderings of marinated and grilled meat contrasting with the bite of vegetables enmeshed among the pork slices. The accompanying steamed rice soaked up the juices and prevented the dish from getting too heavy on the palate.On the other side of the flavour spectrum was the Jap Chae. Once a favourite in the Korean royal court, the noodles, made traditionally with potato starch, have become a staple of Korean cuisine in our more republican times, and its easy to see why. Without being overly-complex, there are still a lot of things going on with the flavours of the dish, the tang of the spices belied by the mild sweetness of the noodles themselves. Slurping doesnt get much more fun.It would also be remiss of us not to mention the kimchi. The caf does it just right, perfectly blending the requisite sourness with the spiciness.While we didnt have space for dessert, we did try the Sweet Potato Latte, which should definitely be on your check-list when you visit. Dont say we didnt warn you."

From asparagus pastry, asparagus risotto to asparagus pizzathis vegetable, which was earlier completely unfamiliar to the Indian palate, is here to stay in our menus.With new dietary trends and unique distinctive and cultural diversity, asparagus is now used in various Indian cuisines. Places like Ooty, Himachal Pradesh, Northeastern regions are producing local asparagus aiding in its increasing availability. Dishes like Asparagus Poriyal, Chorchori and mix vegetables form a large part of healthy cooking and incorporate the vegetable. The blend of Indian spices garam masala and mustard add to the taste of the dishes and is moreover a substitute to beans in many of the dishes, says Sanjeev Ranjan, Executive Chef, Kathmandu Marriott Hotel.PHOTO BY SHEILA JOY ON UNSPLASHOften mistaken as a type of beans, asparagus can be identified as having stout stems with much-branched feathery heads. Interestingly, its Hindi moniker shatavari roughly translates to having hundred roots and in Ayurveda texts it has been used for centuries for balancing pitta and vata. It gives a boost to immune system, elevates energy levels and strength. Regardless of its medicinal value, asparagus is largely considered a western vegetable.Most popularly, it is served as a side with grilled steak. On how Indian cuisine has adopted the veggie, Shivneet Pohoja, Executive Chef, ITC Grand Bharat, Gurugram, says, It is a unique ingredient when it comes to Indian cuisine. While it has been in use for centuries in our food for medicinal purposes, asparagus as most of the world knows it today, certainly does not find place in heirloom Indian recipes. This does not mean that new recipes cannot be written.More farmers are growing asparagus indigenously across certain climatically suitable parts of India. Chefs are more adventurous than before, willing to try non-traditional ingredients in their native cooking styles. All of these factors have made asparagus a global ingredient. The day is not far where it would be as common as the humble bhindi.Mostly served as sauted or lightly fried, asparaguss bitter and sweet taste has a cooling effect on the digestive system, and its unctuous nature makes it a great support for anyone looking for a nourishing effect to their meal. As a general rule, care must be taken not to cook asparagus over high heat or for too long, says Chef Pohoja. Chef Ranjan agrees: Asparagus should not be overcooked. It should be fresh and tossed with spices till it remains crisp . Ingredients such as fresh coconut, Indian mustard, ginger garlic, garam masala should be cooked first and then asparagus should be added. Basically, cook the Indian masala first and then simmering or tossing the fresh chopped or cut asparagus into the dish will give a better taste.But what are the best ways to make asparagus palatable? Chef Vinod Saini, The Leela Palace, New Delhi, has a few tips. It can be consumed in the form of puree or paste, as an accompaniment or dip. Crispy asparagus for garnishing adds a pleasing hint of flavour. It can be used as a small salad to present as a side dish. Sauted asparagus with Indian herbs as a garnish of any light-flavoured dishes are also delectable, he says.Despite having a bean-like shape, the fleshiness of asparagus adds to its versatility. Asparagus samosa (asparagus instead of green peas), Asparagus pakora (batter fried Indian spiced strips), Asparagus and Barley Shorba (healthy soup), Asparagus and Olive Kulchas with cheese, are some of the best variations of that I have tried with the vegetable. I have also included Asparagus Poriyal in a Lufthansa Airlines first-class menu that I cooked and it had been appreciated by the passengers, says Chef Saini on how the vegetable can be used as a solid substitute in many dishes.Chorchori RecipeIngredients Potatoes (diced): 200gm Asparagus: 1/2 inch pieces 6-8 Mustard oil: 3 tbsp Panchphoran: 1 1/2 tsp Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Green chillies (slit): 3 Sugar: 1/2 tsp Salt to tasteMethod Heat three tablespoons of mustard oil in a pan till it just reaches smoking point Add panchphoron and when it starts crackling, add red chili powder, stir briefly and add the prepared vegetables. Stir and add turmeric powder, slit green chilies, sugar and salt to taste. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally or till potato pieces are cooked Stir-fry and in the end add asparagus. Cook till chorchori is dry.Credit: Chef Sanjeev Ranjan, Executive Chef, Kathmandu Marriott Hotel."

(Express photo: Partha Paul) Subsidised onions being sold at Rs 59 per kg in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo: Partha Paul)Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday visited a market in South Kolkatas Bhawanipore area to get first-hand knowledge of the soaring vegetable prices, especially onions. The Chief Minister went to Jadubabu Market in Bhawanipore near her residence in the morning before going to state secretariat, Nabanno, and spoke to the onion vendors. What are the prices you are selling potatoes and onions for? From where are you getting supplies of the vegetables such as potatoes and onions, Banerjee asked the shopkeepers, also enquiring about the price at which they were further selling the vegetables to the buyers.The sellers explained her how they are forced to buy onion for more than Rs 120 per kilogram from wholesale market.Didi we buy onion for Rs 120 per kilogram from wholesale market and sell it for Rs 140/kg. What can we do? Its (onion) not in India, a vegetable seller told the Chief Minister.She also asked them if they were getting the onions that the state government was selling through Sufal Bangla stores atRs 59 per kg. The state government is also selling onions at Rs 59 a kg through 935 fair price shops in the city, besides Sufal Bangla stores, with each family getting to buy a maximum of 1 kg on producing ration cards.After visiting the market, she wrote on her Facebook wall, along with sharing a small video: Onion prices have gone beyond the reach of the middle class. In market, one kilo onion is being sold at Rs 140-150. The same onion is available at Sufal Bangla stall for Rs 59 per kg. Our government has always worked for the betterment of the middle-class people. To check the prices of onions and other vegetables, I went to Bhawanipore Jadubabu Market.The CM blamed the central government for the crisis. Prices of onions are skyrocketing, but they (Centre) are least bothered about it. The issue of price rise is Centres concern. Why cant Centre take measures to control the price rise of the essentials, Banerjee questioned.There was an agreement with the central government, but the Centre did not provide onions and hence the crisis in the state, she alleged.She said that there are 101 Sufal Bangla stalls. The state government has not only subsidised the price of the onion, but is also bearing the cost of transportation, distribution and losses in transit, said a government official.

The firebrand writer aka P Lalita Kumari has rocked the literary world busting myths bringing alive historical female characters who are feminists in their own right. She was speaking at SheThePeople Women Writers Fest held on Saturday at The Park, Somajiguda.Prof T. Vijay Kumar was in conversation with her taking the audience on a fiery ride and riot of words. Talking about 50 years of her writing, Volga said, Also means 50 years of struggle from across all classes and areas which includes rural regions as well. Of women who cannot read or write. It also means 50 years of feminist writing in Telugu literature.Its a celebration of womens writing. Different people understand feminism differently. For me, feminism is understanding the inequality in the society. Within women there are inequalities including sexual preference. Feminism is analysing society through the lens of gender not just for women but men as well.Volga was a committed leftist writer. Prof Vijay asked her as to what made her leave leftist politics and enter feminist political writing? Volga quickly responded, I studied Marxism and learnt social and political aspects of society, writing for those who think like me. Though there were female writers, women werent considered intellectual by the thinking men. They were treated as subaltern and not leaders. This troubled me a lot. I began to question the democractic set-up within the organisation. Thats when I decided to leave.On her novel Swechha, her former colleagues were bitter ly critical. Vijay asked if it was a right decision to leave?The book was already in the market with one lakh copies while it faced much criticism from leftists. The 69-year-old author added, These were stories of common women with a lot of ideas. Shes married to a good man of her choice but she leaves him in the end. The women wanted to live as citizens. Take part in movements. The husbands wanted her to be a mother. A woman. Thats all there is for her in a marriage. In my tales there are women in live-in relationships. The good people got very angry decades ago. Its the readers who decide what they want to read not the progressive critics.Conversation is very important in her writing, especially among women. When women come closer its easier for them to discuss and connect. Among women, there is always feminist sisterhood. Brotherhood has an ideal. The conversation among women disturbs men, especially a conversation between Sita and Surpanakha who actually should have been enemies. In one of dance ballets, they dance together. Its a war between Aryans and Dravidians. Surpanakha is this beautiful Dravidian woman. Draupadi was also there. Doordarshan wanted to showcase it and they didnt accept the character of Surpanakha. They wanted to remove her from the story.She later wrote three more stories. Theres another one on Ram whos trapped in his own loneliness. Its later translated as The Liberation of Sita. Her recently-translated book is Yashodhara on Gautam Buddhas wife. How did she see Yashodhara as? The Sahitya Akademi awardee author replied, People can easily identify with Sita and Draupadi. Its all about power dynamics in understanding and operating the society. Maybe Yashodhara gave reason to Buddha for becoming a sanyasi. How is it possible that he decides to leave the palace and the wife doesnt wake up? She is not the victim. Maybe she was the strength behind Buddhas decision. Its time they are not seen just as poor victims.And the narratives by women writers and poetsFOOD FUNDAThe panel Food Trends 2020: From Kombucha to Keto was moderated by city-based food writer Shivani Mohan and saw gorgeous actor-author Tara Deshpande speaking on the same as she said, How many of us know the real Roghan Josh? A lot of restaurants fool the consumer by adding tomatoes for getting that typical red colour. In fact, Mawal flowers are used for the colour and not any other alternative colouring agent. After this Shivani shot the question, What are the five ingredients you would like to see in kitchen in 2020?And the other panelist Seetha Anand replied, Breakfast should consist of lots of food. Fill your fridge with fresh vegetables. Salad doesnt mean slices of cucumber and onions. You should look at it and your mouth should water. Shivani suggested that the whole family should come together for preparation of food to which Seetha replied, Get children to eat healthy and include them in the preparation. We eat for various reasons. Not just one reason. And then there was the eternal fusion question. Tara chuckled, Fusion can be confusion. Who would have thought of blueberry bagel? A Jew would be tearing his hair. Burgers trend started in the forties. Fusion food has been there from a long time. For example: Vada Pav. The bun is Portuguese. The potatoes are Portuguese.EVERYDAY STORIESThe session Womens writing: Chronicling the everyday was moderated by author-blogger Kiran Manral. Author Shilpa Suraj elaborated on romance writing saying, People mistake womens writing as fluff. Its not. Writing is the rut of life which is processed. Kiran asked authors if male romance writers are outselling female writers? Shilpa responded, The real work begins when your book is out. Men somehow write from a relatable perspective. Thats why they sell more. Kiran asked writer Sophia Lorena Benjamin as to how difficult it is to correlate what a woman goes through especially the protagonist? My book Claudia is on historical romance is set in Goa. When the Portuguese left Goa, they must have left behind a lot of relationships. I couldnt find much material on that, but wrote on it. Claudia falls in love and goes through it all. Younger audience relate well because the protagonist also finds solutions and does not just sulk.THE SONG OF POETSThe poetry session When Words Sing: Womens Journeys Through Verse saw six women poets from the city reading in English and Telugu. The poets not only read their verses but also talked about their journeys of writing. Poet Shikhandin shared about her different childhood of being a third unwanted child. But how she was also surrounded by animals and birds which seeped into her writing. Poet-teacher Jhelum Chattaraj talked about how her stay in Hyderabad has shaped up her writing as she read a poem on nail paint and eating fish, while poet Nabina Das explored socio-political aspects through her poem They Are Kissing. Telugu poet Shahjahana, whos gone through much in life especially when it came to men, spoke about it reading a lyrical poem. The audience enjoyed the poetic evening as an attendee Nivedita N said, This session just woke us up. We need more evenings like these."

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Its time to look for alternatives. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)However hard it may be, finding an alternative for onions, which have witnessed a sudden spike in prices, may not be as easy as it sounds. Given that in some parts of India, prices have risen beyond Rs 200 per kilogram, people are looking to find cheaper alternatives. If you too are fond of flavouring your dish with onions, but are unable to lay your hands on the bulb, here are some alternatives you can rely on.ChivesFresh chives, which are related to onions and garlic, can be used to flavour food as an alternative. They have long green stems and a mild, not-too-pungent flavour. Usually used as a garnish, chives can also be used as a main ingredient. They are an ideal substitute as they have a mild onion-y flavour, especially fresh ones.Since chives have a milder flavour, theyre perfect to add to soups, dips, mashed or baked potatoes, fish, seafood dishes and omelettes. Heat destroys their delicate flavour, so add chives to your dishes at the last minute. To maximise their taste, thinly slice, chop or snip before using.LeeksView this post on Instagram A post shared by Plot17a (@nodig_ben) on Nov 16, 2019 at 10:11am PSTComing from the same origin as onions, garlic and chives, leeks have a distinctive taste of its own, which can be described as mild, onion-like. In its raw state, the vegetable is crunchy and firm. The edible portions of the leek are the white base of the leaves (above the roots and stem base), the light green parts, and to a lesser extent the dark green parts of the leaves. Leeks are widely used to prepare salads and soups. You can also use leeks for baking, sauting or even braising.ShallotsShallots can be added to bring the onion flavour. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Shallots can be added to bring the onion flavour. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Unlike regular onions, which grow as single bulbs, shallots grow in clusters, more like garlic. They are a bit sweeter than regular onions, and their flavour is more subtle. Delicate enough to eat raw and easy to roast to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, shallots can be added to various dishes.Green onionsGo for sprig onions. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Go for sprig onions. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)When chopped together, leeks and green onions look pretty much the same from the exterior. But the texture definitely varies. While leeks are firm and crunchy when raw, green onions are a bit slimy. They get slimier after cooking too. Green onions are much smaller than leeks but have a similar shape.Dry onion flakesYou can substitute onion flakes for fresh ones.

Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food. The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food.On the stretch of National Highway 1 which passes through Murthal in Haryana are over two dozen dhabas  both big and small. These popular rest stops started out catering to truckers, providing hearty, if simple, meals of parathas and dals, as well as cots on which their customers could rest. Since the 1980s, however, many have grown into restaurants that cater increasingly to customers who come from nearby Sonepat and even Delhi, just to sample the dhabas famous tandoor parathas with white butter.At noon on a Tuesday, the parking lot of one of the more popular eateries, Pahalwan Dhaba, is already full. Inside, bowls of sirka pyaaz (onions in vinegar) are on each table, along with green chillies and pickles. Platters of parathas, dals and other dishes emerge from the kitchen in a steady stream.In a room behind the kitchen, surrounded by sacks of potatoes and seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and radish, two young men seated on chairs pull out onions from sacks piled in one corner and chop them into a large plastic container. These, we are told, will be used as tempering for some dishes, while many more will be boiled and then ground to a paste. The onions are chopped fresh, based on the dishes being ordered at the restaurant.Many years ago, when the price of onions had shot up dramatically, the dhaba had tried to cut back on the use of this staple in its kitchen. Nothing tasted the same, recalls Sudesh Sandhu who, along with her husband, owner Dayanand, runs the eatery. Since then we decided that should the price of onions skyrocket again, we will still use as many as we usually do. Our customers come here for the taste, and if it eats into our profit for now, its okay. We can make it up when the price drops, which it is sure to, she says.Onions are currently selling for about Rs 90 per kg. On an average, Sandhu informs, Pahalwan Dhaba uses about 250-300 kilos of onions every day: this includes the onions used to make aloo-pyaaz and pyaaz parathas as well as the ones that are sliced and served raw as part of the salad or are preserved in vinegar. The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food. And tomatoes and onions form the base of almost every curry that we serve here. If you reduce the proportion of onions in anything, the taste changes noticeably and thats not something were willing to risk.Pahalwan Dhaba, which has been around for more than three decades, does enough business annually to be able to absorb the cost of not letting onion prices affect customer experience. Sandhu says that smaller or newer eateries in the area havent been able to do the same, with many substituting onions with daikon radish in the salads. One of these is the three-year-old Shiva Dhaba. While owner Pradeep Arya isnt able to offer an estimate of the dhaba kitchens average per day onion usage, he says that in the past few weeks, the soaring prices have forced them to cut back by an estimated 30 to 35 per cent. Weve stopped serving free onions at the tables. Were now charging Rs 40 per serving. Of course, we understand that customers expect it to be served for free along with the pickles and chillies, but at this point, the cost is simply not something that we can bear, he says.

Table top potato is being sold for `600 to `750/50 kg bag.Farmers in Punjab are fetching a fairly good price for the early variety (table crop) of potato crop that hit the market recently. In fact, the price is three times the amount they have been fetching for over the last four years or so.They are getting Rs 600 to Rs 750 per 50 kg bag for the eatable potato crop that was being sold at Rs 150 to Rs 200 per 50 kg bag for the past four years.Selling below the rate of Rs 500 to 600 per 50 kg bag is not viable, claim farmers, as they spend on an average Rs 8 to 9 for growing per kg potato including eatable potato and for seed potato.Farmer Gurmail Singh of Dhadda Haripur Village in Nakodar has grown eatable potato on 50 acres of land. After a gap of four years, I have been selling my eatable potato at the rate of Rs 1200 to Rs 1500 per quintal while in the previous years the rate was Rs 300 to 400 per quintal and I had suffered huge losses, said he, adding that even he had sold seed potato at the rate of Rs 35 to 50 per 50 kg bag last year.I was under huge loan and now I feel that this will be eased if the rate continues to be like this in this season, he said.Harminder Singh , another farmer from Malsian in Jalandhar, said that he has been growing table potato on 10 acres after harvesting paddy and was facing huge losses for the past two years.This year rate is good but there is no consistency in potato rate which is ruining the farmers and government should make a policy to fix a minimum rate of it, he said, adding that here is a need to control middlemen who are making big money even while farmers get poor rates.We just want the reasonable rate of the crop and government does not even care for that, said another farmer Harjinder Singh, who grows only seed potato.During previous years, Punjab government had asked Markfed to intervene and purchase potato from the mandies to bail out farmers facing huge losses due to poor rate. But the purchased quantity was low compared to the huge production. Punjab produces around 2.5 million tonnes potato on around 95,000 hectares to one lakh hectares area mainly in the four districts  Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Nawanshar  of Doaba region and 1.6 million tonnes (66 per cent) crop is meant for the seed purpose only. Punjab is the major supplier of potato seed in India.Potato crop is sown in the month of October in Punjab and the table potato hits the market in early December while the main seed potato crop is harvested in February month which is then stored in cold stores to supply across the country.The yield of table crop is Punjab is 12-14 tonnes per acre while yield of seed potato is 8-10 tonnes per acre. The rate of seed potato is almost double that of table potato. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

He said the SP government did justice to farmers while the BJP government was only doing injustice to them.Yadav said besides sugarcane farmers, paddy and potato growers were also victims of BJP governments indifference."

After incidents of onion theft in Surat and Bhavnagar, a similar incident has come to light at the Khanderao Market.Alarm bells have been pressed at the Khanderao Market after some unidentified persons stole bags full of onions from the market on December 7. The traders realized about the theft next day and later approached the police.According to police, Alpesh Gandhi, a vegetable vendor submitted an application with Navapura police in this regard. Gandhi said that they had kept sacks full of onions in market. Some sacks of onions worth about Rs 7,000 were stolen by unidentified persons. We will file a FIR once we get complete information from Gandhi, said a police official.Many traders stock vegetables at the market in night as they start their retail shop early in mornings. Sacks filled with greens lie unattended at the market as they have never been stolen in the past. The prices of onions have crossed Rs 100 per kilogram over last few days and in some metros, the prices have touched Rs 140 per kilogram.Earlier this month, around 14 bags of onion containing 50kg each were allegedly stolen on December 6 from Bhavnagar marketing yard. However, the traders decided not to register a police complaint. Talking to TOI, president of traders association at Bhavnagar market yard, Narendrasinh Gohil said, We believe the bags have been misplaced by the labourers while loading them in the truck. The entire stock lies in the open in the market yard and labourers load the bags onto the trucks.On November 28, nearly 250kg of onion stocked in a vegetable vendors shop in Palanpur Patiya area of Surat city was stolen during early hours of Thursday.

According to James Barboza, there are several vegan cookbooks written for holiday cooking, each of which is loaded with recipes that are ideal for a Christmas feast.Anamary G T, the eldest member of the vegan community, points out that in place of turkey, they make Tofurky that offers a massive feast complete with stuffing, gravy.Where alcohol is concerned, the quintessential Christmas beverage is eggnog, which is obviously made with eggs. Despite being an oxymoron, vegan eggnog is widely available. You can buy Silk Nog made from soy or almonds at most natural food stores during the holiday season. We make a Holiday Nog with almond milk. Just add bourbon and a dusting of nutmeg to any of these products and youre in business, quips Samantha Cretter, a member of the vegan community.With both food and drink taken care of, vegans are ensuring that the gifts too dont include any animal products. And instead of wrapping paper, they are using cotton clothes and cane baskets. We celebrate zero-waste Christmas as we have been re-using all decorative items. We consciously choose to avoid plastic or paper dishes, cups, spoons, etc. All of us bring our own utensils during the feast, says Anamary.Veggie SantaYoung ones have created their own Santa Claus using vegetables, including cauliflower, red bellpepper, sweet potatoes, lemons, olives and greens. We made our own Santa this time. He looks a little angry though but Im sure hell get lot of goodies for us, says six-year-old Ananya Sharma, as she listens to a remixed version of Jingle Bells."

The supply line, which was unsteady over the last two-three weeks, has been getting into the groove. Twelve onion-laden trucks from Nashik reached Koley Markert on Thursday. Another 12 have reached the wholesale market in Posta.Apart from other states, freshly harvested onion has started arriving the city from Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum, said an agri-marketing department officer on Thursday. More than 100 tonnes of onion has been supplied to the city markets and the agri-marketing department will now keep a close watch on onion prices post this supply.Retail onion prices have already plunged below Rs 100/kg on city fringes. In the city proper, it will take a day or two more as retail traders have a stockpile of unsold onion they bought at a very high wholesale price. Much of the stock will be exhausted in a day and the price will plunge subsequently, explained a retail market expert.In wholesale markets, onion prices have dropped significantly. The smaller variety was sold for Rs 2,700-Rs 2,800 per 40kg bag and the bigger variety was priced at Rs 3,200-Rs 3,400 per bag. This is the first time in last two months that the wholesale price has dropped below Rs 3,000 per kg.The state governments sale of onion at subsidized rate has upset the retail market. Retailers have got discredited. We want the onion price to plunge to the normal level so that the retail market stabilizes, said Sujit Ghosh, a potato-onion retailer at Behala Old Market.The state government on Thursday sold 75 tonnes of onion through its 131 Sufal Bangla stores and 934 ration shops at Rs59/kg. We will continue to sell onion at this price till the price range stabilizes, said a senior agri-marketing department officer.The onion price will certainly dip below Rs 100/kg in a day or two. The new crop has hit city markets. This freshly harvested onion from Nashik cannot be hoarded as they are highly perishable. This onion is bound to pull the price down. But a section of retailers is refusing to go by this market dynamics and are sticking to the price of their old stock, said Kamal De, president of the West Bengal Vendors Association and member of the Market Tusk Force appointed by the state government.Meanwhile, the enforcement branch kept a close watch on retail markets across the city and carried out a few raids against hoarding."

For some reason, the tickets Id booked on Vayudoot (remember that dodgy airline?) for the handsome sum of Rs 250 got cancelled and I couldnt re-book them. All the other flights to Goa were full by then, and I had to get to Goa for a wedding, so I jumped on a bus that took off from Dadar in the evening. It was a terrible bus. The seats were musty and cramped and the windows were dirty and the curtains smelly. The rattling promised to rearrange my insides, and so I thought the only way I could survive this ride was to get smashed and fall asleep.We reached Mahad, on the Bombay-Goa road, at about 10 pm for a dinner and evacuation stop. I headed straight to the bar to find some booze. Dark rum was the only strong alcohol they had. And although I dont really drink rum, I bought a quarter because the rum was available only in quarts and not millilitres. By the time I had decided, paid and settled down with some rum and cola, the bus revved up as if to start and my fellow passengers started clambering back in.I looked at the bus, and then at the bottle. It didnt seem right to carry the bottle on board, so I just knocked the whole quarter down in one go and jumped on. I was knocked out. Nearly 12 hours later I woke up in Mapusa, Goa. I had missed the whole ride, including a couple of stops and the breakfast halt in Kudal. I was hot, hungover and hungry.Looking out of the window, I realised the bus terminated at Mapusa and would not go on to Panaji. Too disoriented to find out more, I went off to try and deal with my hunger. Destiny led me to Caf St Francis Xavier. Its one of the oldest eateries in Mapusa. Here I had my first tryst with real sorpotel, sausage and curry rice. The sorpotel was mature and fiery, the vindaloo sour and spicy and the sausage, an acquired taste that took me a minute to acquire, all eaten with hot poi (Goan bread) a side of beef patties, croquettes and potato-and-egg chops.My life thereafter became one merry ride of vindaloos, sorpotels and chorizo. Occasionally, caldine, cafreal and xacuti. Without even looking back to see whether this small state with a vast Hindu population had another cuisine.It was at the Mandovi Hotel in Panaji, some time later, that I discovered the vast world of Hindu Goan cuisine. With dishes like Hooman, a mild and sour mackerel curry made with grated coconut paste and spices; muddoshya (lady fish), slightly different from the Christian Goan fish curry because of the spice mix; khatkhate, a mixed-vegetable and lentil stew cooked by the states Goud Saraswat Brahmins, spiced with curry leaves, ginger, black pepper, chillies and turmeric. Its a must on days of fasting when the community eats just vegetarian food.Udid Methi is another kind of curry typical of the Saraswats of Goa and Karwar. Its unusual taste comes from a combination of black gram and dried fenugreek seeds that combust excitedly with mackerel. And finally, the kaju biyaam tondak, made with fresh raw cashew nuts, coconut and no onion or garlic; you can add to it almost anything  vegetables, lentils, pulses  because the raw cashew or bibya in this dish is used as a pulse.Unless youre visiting a Saraswat Goan home, though, the Hindu cuisine is hard to find. I just discovered a whole lot of it at Goa Portuguesa in Dadar. My early advertising and theatre days in the 80s and 90s were spent guzzling alcohol, feasting on prawn-stuffed papads and gorging on choriz pav while a merry crooner with a guitar serenaded us with old nostalgic songs and merry Konkani numbers at this fun-filled restaurant. Chef Deepa Awchats menu of Goan Hindu food for me went quite unnoticed amid the haze of vinegar, pork and bread. But then I was invited to a feast last week. A feast to celebrate 31 years of Goa Portuguesa. A feat not many restaurants in Mumbai can boast of.I decide to go, for old times sake, this time determined to concentrate on the food. And Im so glad I did. Of course there was the inevitable pork sorpotel, nearly pickled and the finest Id eaten in a long time; caldine prawn curry with ukade tandool (red Goan rice), artfully flavoured with kismur (dried shrimp roasted crisp, garnished with chopped onion, coriander and spices).But it was the Goan Hindu food that stood out. Tender coconut and cashew nut sukke (juliennes of the two sauteed with tomatoes and spring onion); rajma tondak (rajma and French beans seasoned with Goan spices and simmered in coconut milk); moongacho ghati (sprouted green gram with dry coconut and cashew nut, tempered and cooked in coconut milk); green pea xacuti (cooked in a dark coconut gravy); and tisreo sukke (clams sauted in onion and freshly ground spices, garnished with grated coconut).The meal ended with Amore being belted out in the background and a serving of serradura, a simple dessert which is a combination of sweetened whipped cream, powdered tea biscuits and a chilled bowl of trifle pudding. The evening transported me back to Goa, and did it without a single drop of alcohol. Now thats a feat."

That is the simple concept behind the yummy rolls, quesedillas and salads at PitaPit, the Canadian brand that has a December special menu now. As the name of the outlet in Road no 36 Jubilee Hills suggests, the fare is made using pita bread, which we are familiar with as part of Mediterranean cuisine. Hummus and pita bread, remember? Pita is a light and flat bread often made of both refined as well as whole wheat flour and is known to be low in calories, rich in protein, carbs and antioxidants. No wonder, the dieters and the workout champs love this.Besides easy to eat rolls, there are also options of veg and non veg soups, salads, rice bowl and beverages. We got to taste baked pita chips with dips for a starter followed by kathi paneer role which was tasty and felt light after eating. However, you better be dainty and know how to shove the roll into your mouth neatly or you will end up spilling it all over. You can also choose a spread you like - peri peri hummus, salsa, tzatziki (similar to the raita) etc In the non-veg fare the Harissa Chicken gets the thumbsup. Nothing is overly spicy and easy on your palate and your tummy. The Chipotle Potato had a nice Indian flavour with chunks of potato was filling and rich. Mix the rice bowls well for better flavours. The dessert pita with nutella and banana was easy to eat and yummy with chocolate. As part of their Christmas Bite offer, you can choose a flat pita and a beverage."

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Kadhi has various benefits for health. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)There are some dishes that everyone enjoys, and one of them is kadhi  the Indian yoghurt and gram flour curry that is served with rice or roti. Made differently in different regions across the country, kadhi is known for its distinct taste and aroma. But it is not just the taste, the gravy dish is also healthy considering it is loaded with vitamins and minerals which help improve body functions. Kadhi-chawal has always been a delicious combination, and tastes divine when served with a portion of fried potatoes.The dish is rich in protein, calcium and phosphorous. So if you are a kadhi lover, here is some good news for you.*Besan kadhi includes besan (chickpea flour) and chaach as the main ingredients. Besan has more good fat and protein than whole wheat flour. It is rich in complex carbohydrates, folate and has a low glycemic index. Chaach helps in losing weight, building your immunity, and is also good for the heart.*A cup of kadhi consumed regularly can be beneficial for your skin and hair, as gram flour boosts collagen formation and has anti-inflammatory properties. Be it acne, dark spots or any skin issue.*Kadhi is also a recommended diet for pregnant women as it is rich in folate, vitamin B6 and iron and ensures the growth of the baby which reduces the change of miscarriage.Consuming kadhi during pregnancy is considered to be beneficial for both the mother and child. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Consuming kadhi during pregnancy is considered to be beneficial for both the mother and child. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)*Diabetes can also cause heart problems, and the blood pressure to rise. Kadhi helps to keep blood pressure under control and also directly controls diabetes as it is low in glycemic index and therefore helps to keep the blood sugar low and controlled, and improve insulin use in the body.*Besan kadhi is loaded with good bacteria, which is healthy for the gut. It helps in maintaining gut flora and improves nutrient absorption. All this, in turn, helps in improving the digestion.*Kadhi is rich in magnesium, which relaxes your muscles and helps in maintaining heart health. The phosphorus helps in regulating the lipid mechanism.Turmeric and black pepper are known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties that can provide relief from severe cold. These ingredients also induce good sleep when a person is suffering from cold and cough. It is known to be a winter comfort food and can surely be had in winter, but have it warm and not out of the refrigerator. Many people say that because of its sour nature, it is best to not have it at night time.How to make itEvery house has its own unique way of making this dish. There is not much similarity between a Gujarati kadhi, Sindhi kadhi, Rajasthani kadhi, Bohri kadhi or a UP kadhi except that all are yoghurt-based (except sindhi kadhi which has a tamarind base) and it may or may not have pakodi (gram flour dumplings, and those too vary from one cuisine to another) and other veggies. Its consistency can also vary; Gujarati kadhi is thin and also sweetish. Sindhi kadhi has loads of vegetables in it and tamarind pulp is added for sourness. But whatever way you like it, kadhi always tastes good, is very simple to make and can be had any time of the year.Heres a quick recipe of Gujarati Kadhi by Ashima Goyal SirajPreparation Time: 10 mins| Cooking Time: 15 mins| Serves 2Ingredients2 cups  Skimmed milk yoghurt1 1/2tbsp  Gram flour (besan)1tbsp  Grated jaggery1 no  Chopped green chilli1/2tsp  Fenugreek seeds1/2tsp  Mustard seeds1/2tsp  Cumin seeds1tsp  Ginger paste8-10 no- Curry leaves1 no  Dried red chilli, broken into two3-4 no  Cloves1/2 inch  Cinnamon stickA pinch of asafoetidaSalt to taste1tbsp  Olive oilMethod*Whisk together yoghurt, gram flour and four cups of water to make a smooth paste.*Add the chopped green chillies and jaggery.

But as it was inferior in quality, customers still preferred Nashik onion, despite its higher price tag.However, due to the rains in North India last week, supply had been affected. Several trucks were stranded due to the hailstorms in Rajasthan, delaying arrival of fresh stocks in the city. This further caused the vegetables number to dwindle at the wholesale market in Sector 26.Officials said the wholesale price of the Alwar onion has touched 100 per kg here as well.President of the apni mandis in Chandigarh, Parlad Singh, said, Now that the weather has improved, normal supply will resume in a few days and prices will drop soon. However, the prices can continue to increase till then.BL Sharma, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, said the new crop of onions from Nashik will reach the city by the first week of January, and will significantly help bring down the onion rates.FEW TAKERS FOR AFGHANISTAN ONIONSingh said though the onion from Afghanistan was cheaper than the Alwar variety, it hadnt caught the customers fancy. Though their size, which can cross 250gm per onion bulb, captures the buyers attention, they are useless in domestic use, he added.On the other hand, the Turkish variant was smaller in size and considerably better in quality, and was thus being chosen by customers.POTATO PRICES ALSO HEAD NORTHEven though the monsoon rain had majorly affected the prices of only onions and tomatoes, the cost of potato, which was 10 per kg till November 30, has shot up by 200% to 30 per kg.Singh said, The monsoon rain had destroyed the fields of several farmers near Jalandhar, damaging the potato crop. The recent rains have also harmed the local crop. The only supply still in place is coming from Sirhind. The vegetable may become even more expensive if the local crop isnt ready soon."

Pointing at vested interests behind the violence, Kejriwal called for an investigation into the incident and stringent action against the guilty. People are unhappy, people are hitting the streets, is anyone provoking students across thirty-three universities? he questioned.For the first time since the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had opposed in the Parliament, the chief minister spoke extensively and unambiguously against the law.My suggestion to the central government is that this is a very dirty law, I dont know why it was enacted. The entire country is on fire, let them withdraw the law and call a meeting of all the chief ministers to thrash out ways to provide jobs, tackle price rise, fight economic slowdown, re-start factories that have shut down  let the focus be on that.Trying to steer away the debate from just the Hindu-Muslim, Kejriwal said if an all-India NRC (National Register of Citizens) exercise is held, it would be the poor who would stand to lose the most, as he pointed out was the case with another Modi government scheme: demonetisation.I heard a statement by Amit Shah yesterday in a channel  that those who will not have documents, whether that person is a Hindu or Muslim, will be thrown outin this country 70% of people do not have documents. The poor do not have documents. And the rich will get their documents made after paying a hefty price, he said.Combining the CAA and the NRC in one narrative, the Delhi CM said while the government wants to give documents to non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries and make them citizens, it wants to do the opposite to Indians  ask them to get documents verified or be thrown out of the country.Those who come from there (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan) will not have documents. So who will provide them with documents? The Government of India. In our country, when the NRC exercise happens, what will happen to those who do not have documents? Will they be thrown out of the country?Criticising BJPs argument in the citizenship debate, Kejriwal argued, In Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan there are nearly three crore non-Muslims. Even if half of them come to our country, who will give them jobs? Where will they be settled? How will housing be provided for them? Will you settle them in Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat, Assam or Tripura? Today, our children are not able to get jobs. Our aim should be to provide them jobs and we are worried about giving jobs to Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Afghanistanis.Highlighting the economic slowdown in the country, Kejriwal questioned the timing of the law. Today, the price of onions has reached Rs 200, the price of potatoes is steadily rising, price rise taking a huge toll, the economy is in a dire state, all factories are shutting down. Was the CAA the only issue? What was the need to set the country on fire? Our students are being rained with lathis, girls are being beaten up inside their hostels, students from thirty-three universities are on the roads.The chief minister, who commonly uses terms like aam aadmi (common people) and janata (public), on Wednesday used the term nagrik, signalling the importance of the citizenship for the people.Recalling his own days as a student in IIT between 1985 and 1989, the chief minister wondered if he could have been able to afford the education had it not been for the monthly fees of Rs 32 and scholarships. I want to tell all governments that education budgets should not be slashed, he said in support of the JNU protests against the fee hike.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-12-20,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/dec/20/christmas-alternatives-to-the-troublesome-turkey--2078575.html,Christmas alternatives to the troublesome turkey,"shantanu david ByExpress News ServiceWhile the turkey may enjoy a pre-eminent place as a Christmas meals centrepiece, the less masochistic host may tend to avoid it. Never mind that it requires anywhere between three-four days to defrost and thaw before its even ready to marinate and roast, the price of the bird is fairly prohibitive itself. And even as the ideas of a Christmas roast and poultry like turkey and ducks become more common in our culinary repertoire, this dish is definitely not for amateurs, or even for those with middling culinary skills.Indeed, professional chefs and caterers, knowing all the potential pitfalls that a Christmas party host might face, have plenty of alternatives to suggest as the evenings piece de rsistance. As their blogs and magazine spread flood with the ideas for Christmas repasts, we cull out some easier alternatives for you to decorate your table with.Shepherds Pie: This British festive staple actually has a long association with India. The layered lamb (read mutton in India) pie, comprising minced meat, and perhaps vegetables, cooked in gravy, and topped with a layer of mashed potatoes to hold it in, was considered, by Indian cooks, to be the perfect dish to make as a tiffin in the Colonial era. This dubiously charming aside, the hot and filling dish is fairly hassle-free to make and delicious to dig into for a festive meal.Roasted Chicken: Be it herb and garlic rubbed or lemon-scented or tandoori masala, few things match the universal appeal of a whole roasted chicken. Requiring little more than a visit to the butcher and about 10 minutes prep time in applying a marinade of your choice to the bird, you can leave it aside and indeed, pop it in your oven once your guests start arriving. Not only can you let it literally cook in its own steam, your house will smell delicious too.Roasted Whole Cauliflower: Given that not everyone is a lover of meats, there are plenty of Christmas meal options for vegetarians. Apart from a vegetable loaf, the storied whole roasted cauliflower could be an interesting main dish. Needing only a large, trimmed cauliflower head and your own taste for seasoning, this is a one pan wonder thatll cater to partygoers of all kinds."
2019-12-21,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2019/dec/21/fusion-food-rules-2078900.html,Fusion food rules,"By Express News ServiceHYDERABAD : You still have no solid plans for the upcoming long weekend, but want to travel? Enchante, the relaunched cafe in Film Nagar, offers solace in the form of its travel-themed interiors. The cafe which opened in January went on a hiatus to come back reloaded with new elements in its decor and a fusion food menu.We have done up the open space with carpet grass, wooden high stools, and colorful flyers that remind you of being on the deck of a ship, says Mahesh Tibrewal, one of the partners of the cafe. From a display wall with framed photos of cities we all want to visit, suitcases decked up on a wall as a decor element, aqua blue wooden furniture and a wall with clocks of different time zones, all transport into this cafe which goes with the tagline, a must for wanderlust.Soon, we will be adding the specialities of every global city in the world so that our guests can go on a world trip sitting right here, quips Mahesh. The cafe which is currently busy with its Christmas cakes and gift hampers has added fusion food to its menu. Mumbai masala risotto, potato popcorn and Motichoor Cold Cheesecake are the hot favourites, says Sanjay Tripathi, Vice President.The Mumbai Masala Risotti, hot, spicy and mushy with a sprinkling of herbs definitely falls under comfort food. Potato popcorn, like bhajias with a global touch, thanks to the cornflour layer, is something Hyderabadis would love along with their tea. The last one was like Lucknow meeting Rome. While the first layer was a burst of yellow and silver foil and strongly sweet, the next layer of cheese was smooth and melt-in-the-mouth.The cafe has a wide range of coffees, designer teas and special mojitos (Sizzling Lady and Morning Dew etc). Desserts, however, are what Enchante takes pride in. For the festive season, they have gift hampers with cookies, chocolates, dry fruits and breads."
2019-12-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/in-odisha-district-scientists-team-up-to-give-farmers-a-new-future-6178969/,"In Odisha district, scientists team up to give farmers a new future","Krishna Nayak grows lemon grass on 2 acres. Sampad Patnaik Krishna Nayak grows lemon grass on 2 acres. Sampad PatnaikIn one of Indias poorest districts, a team of scientists from premier central government institutes have joined hands to help farmers find new life  and hope.They are helping me improve farming, says Krishna Chandra Nayak, 35, standing amidst his seven acres in Saruguda village. And his calculations on a writing pad tell a story of economic revolution through scientific inputs in agriculture.Nayak is one of 5,000 farmers in Odishas Nabarangpur district, chosen and mentored under a project called Farm-Based S&T Interventions for Socioeconomic Development being jointly implemented by 12 central R&D institutes and an 18-member district-level committee of the state government.The project is being run under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) on a budget of over Rs 6.5 crore over two years. The farmers were chosen through rigorous field visits across the district to select those who could take the risk of switching from traditional crops to high-value crops  and were willing to accept new methods.In 2015, Nabarangpur was the focus of a year-long assigment by The Indian Express to track progress and poverty, following which the state government initiated a number of welfare and governance initiatives in the district.With top institutes involved in the farm project since August, Nayak is growing lemon grass, turmeric, palmarosa (a grass species) and tulsi. He has started a fish pond and a rose garden, while his fields are fenced by mango, sapota and litchi trees.This is a dry and hilly area, where the soil does not hold moisture. It makes more sense to grow these high-value crops than paddy, which is comparatively water- and labour-intensive, and yields lower profits, he says.The farming is being supervised by top scientists from the Lucknow-based Central Institute of Medicine and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), while the roses are being monitored by scientists from National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI).Today, Nayak is confident of a profit of Rs 20,000 from just one crop of lemon grass in two acres. The turmeric will yield a profit of Rs 25,000 per acre, he hopes. The diversification of production basket, he says, over seven acres will give him upwards of Rs 3 lakh in profit.He contrasts this with the zero income that much of the land used to yield because it was unsuitable for paddy. Most of the land was uncultivated and a small portion was used for paddy for mostly domestic consumption, he says.Former Nabarangpur MP Balabhadra Majhi, who proposed the project and brought the Centre and state together to work on it, is convinced that science and technology is of more value to the districts nearly two lakh farmers than loan waivers, money transfers, and subsidies.In the plateau area of Nabarangpur, people hardly eat root and green vegetables. There was no high intensity fishery, either. At 250 kg/ha, Nabarangpurs fertiliser consumption, especially in corn cultivation, was staggering against a state average of 50kg/ha. To earn a decent income from agriculture and consume quality produce, one has to understand and apply science and technology and practice alternative farming (high-value crops over paddy), says Majhi.The institutes involved are mentoring a diverse group of farmers. For instance, Bhubaneswars Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) is training in pisciculture and poultry rearing around 173 ST, 17 SC and 28 OBC families. CIMAP will mentor 60 women Self Help Groups in making incense sticks out of tulsi leaves.Farmers are also being helped to grow Citronella, which yields an essential oil that is used in insect and especially mosquito repellents, while palmarosa oil is an ingredient in soaps and cosmetics, says CIMAP senior scientist Prashant Rout.The state government will package and brand these (citronella and palmarosa) products and sell them directly to stores, as well as put up stalls in government fairs held across 30 districts of Odisha, says Uma Maheshwar, who heads the Nabarangpur district wing of Odisha Rural Marketing Society.Irfan Khan owns over seven hectares of water stretch (ponds) in which he is practising pisciculture under guidance of Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA). To get Rs 12,000 worth brood stock of fish I used to travel up to Sambalpur and spend another Rs 10,000 on fuel, food and lodgings. Even then, the quality (of fingerlings) was not great, says Irfan. Now CIFA has stocked my ponds with top notch breeds like Jayanti Rohi, improved catla.CIFAs Principal Scientist S S Mishra lands at Irfans property to inspect and advise. Nabarangpur is a low alkaline area so we must add limestone powder and maintain pH. The fish feed must be given correctly. The fish have to be protected against fish lice, skin fluke, says Mishra.In Papadahandi block, Dhansingh Batra, who owns only two acres, is elated to be advised by Dr K Lakshminarayana of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) on how to plant his sweet potato crop so that the vines dont retain moisture and rot.Earlier this year, I made a profit of Rs 15,000 on five quintals of sweet potato grown on only 0.2 acres of land, says Batra. I have kept another quintal for consumption by family and friends. I used to grow corn that gave me a profit of only Rs 20,000 from one acre. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar.Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Saturday accused the Centre of trying to divert attention of people from its failures by bringing in the new citizenship law that aims at snatching away the fundamental rights of people.The government has been regularly failing on all fronts and to divert the attention of people, the BJP leaders have brought in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Jakhar said.He said the BJP was unsuccessfully trying to change the basic feature of the Constitution, something that the citizens would never let it do.The CAA seeks to grant Indian citizenship to refugees belonging to Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities facing persecution on the basis of religion in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, and who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.Chairing a meeting with party workers at Barnala, Jakhar also attacked Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, accusing him of trying to save the party president post by staging protests against the state government. On Saturday, Badal held a protest at Patiala against the Congress-led government.Sukhbir Badal is trying to save his post as president of the SAD by staging protests against the state government. It was he, who had once claimed that the dharna or protests is the job of idles, Jakhar said.Jakhar also backed the stand of disgruntled SAD leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa who attacked SAD leadership and described Sukhbirs appointment of party chief as undemocratic.Only to save a post of minister in the Centre, the leaders of SAD are not issuing any statement against the wrong doings of BJP, said Jakhar pointing out that when the Modi-led government delayed GST compensation to Punjab, the SAD leaders remained silent. It is sad to know that even (former chief minister) Parkash Singh Badal too is mum on these issues, he added.After the meeting, state party senior vice president Kewal Singh Dhillon and other leaders from Barnala gave onions and potatoes to Jakhar for sending the kitchen staples to PM Modi as mark of protest against inflation.

2019-12-24,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/dec/24/turkey-onion-arrives-at-vegetable-shops-in-bhubaneswar-2080326.html,Turkey onion arrives at vegetable shops in Bhubaneswar,"By Express News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: The city residents will have the taste of Turkey onion for the first time with arrival of 17 tonne of the pungent vegetable from Nasik in Maharashtra.While the prices of onion are slowly cooling down in the retail markets due to arrival of fresh crops from source markets and imports of the edible bulb from Afghanistan, Egypt and Turkey, potato price has zoomed to Rs 30 a kg across the State.The spurt in the potato prices is attributed to the short supply from West Bengal, the major supplier of the tuber to Odisha.While potato stocks are getting exhausted, the demand for the vegetable has increased in West Bengal and neighbouring States of Jharkhand and North-Eastern States following disruption in supply due to agitation over amended Citizenship Act, said secretary of Kuberpuri Byabasai Sangha Shakti Shankar Mishra.He said the West Bengal potato traders are clearing their old stocks from godowns and cold storages before arrival of the new crops. Arrival of the fresh crops is expected from the second week of January. This is the end of the season and potato price will remain high till arrival of new crops to the market, Mishra added.However, the supply of potato from West Bengal is near normal with the city receiving over 200 tonne on a daily basis. The actual need of the city is around 250 tonne.The wholesale price of potato at Aiginia, the major mandi of the city, on Monday was Rs 2000 per quintal. However, traders in the retail market were selling at Rs 30 a kg.Though a margin of Rs 10 per kg is too high, retail traders argued that they will suffer loss as the damage of the vegetable in a packet is around 4-5 kg.The onion supply to the city on Monday was around 200 tonne, including 17 tonne from Turkey.The Turkey onion that landed in New Delhi has been despatched to Maharashtra, the major supplier of the vegetable, to many States including Odisha. The Centre had placed order to import 11,000 tonne of onion from Turkey in addition to 6,090 tonne from Egypt.However, prices of other vegetables in Unit-I daily market are moderate."

(Source: File Photo)Merry Christmas 2019: Christmas is celebrated by people across the world on December 25 every year. The day marks the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the second of the Holy Trinity of Christianity (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit).As the story goes, Jesus was born in a manger in Bethlehem to Mary and Joseph. There is no record that the birth actually took place on December 25, mainly because the Gregorian calendar didnt exist back then. However, it was in 336 that Emperor Constantine, known as the first Christian Roman emperor, declared December 25 as Christmas to celebrate Christ. A few years later, Pope Julius I declared that the day would mark the birth of Christ.In Pics | Merry Christmas 2019 Wishes ImagesOver the centuries, it has become one of the biggest festivals to be observed all over the world. Celebrations start from December 24 (Christmas Eve) and continue till December 26 (Boxing Day).The birth of Christ is an event of utmost importance to followers of Christianity as it is believed that God had sent his Son on earth as a sacrifice to redeem the people of the world from their sins. This sacrifice denotes the crucifixion of Christ. Many attend the midnight mass at churches followed by an elaborate Christmas feast on this day. Christmas carols and Santa Claus are an important part of the festivity too.During this time, pine trees are decorated with colourful bells, candles, candies, stars and gift stockings. Most of the Christmas decorations consist of four colours  red, green, golden and white, and they have their significance as well. While green denotes eternal life, red signifies the blood Christ shed, golden denotes royalty (he was known as the Son of David, the King of Israel) and white denotes peace.The Christmas feast is a delicious spread that the entire family enjoys together. The traditional Christmas meal comprises of delicacies such as roasted turkey, gingerbread, roasted chicken, mince-pie, Christmas cake, pudding, eggnog, mashed potatoes and mulled wine.

(Source: File Photo)The style of eating whole foods instead of processed or packaged foods comes from Japan and emphasises a mindful, seasonal approach to food. The macrobiotic diet was developed in the 1920s by a Japanese philosopher called George Ohsawa who believed that by eating a simple, healthy diet, one could live in harmony with nature. According to Cancer Research UK, Ohsawa also believed that a macrobiotic diet could cure cancer and other serious illnesses.As per a National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)s 2016 study, the analysis of a macrobiotic diet plan indicates the potential for disease prevention and suggest the need for studies of real-world consumption as well as designing, implementing and testing interventions based on the macrobiotic approach.Heres why you can count on the macrobiotic bowl*Its a perfect meal-in-a-bowl and completely nourishing depending on the toppings you choose.*You can easily see your food divided into carbs, proteins and healthy fats.ProteinHummus is a good source of protein.

The carriage van was carrying nearly 2500 kgs of onions, retailing at close to Rs 100/kg in the state. Needless to say, all of it was gone in a flash!The incident took place around 7am on Wednesday, when the carriage van carrying more than 50 packets of onions, each containing 50 kgs, overturned while on its way to Bokaro vegetable market from capital Ranchi. Police said the driver lost control while trying to avoid a speeding vehicle approaching from the opposite side near Kamlapur village, which led to its overturning.When the police reached the spot, they found the van, but there was no trace of onions valued at Rs 2.5 lakh.The police were later informed that villagers had rushed to the spot as soon as the news of an onion loaded vehicles overturning spread. They looted as many onions as they could.There were around 50 packets of onions loaded on the vehicle and they have been looted, said Kashmar Police Station in-charge Rajendra Kumar.The frenzy for the onions was so great that the villagers even forgot to rescue the injured driver stuck inside the vehicle, local shopkeepers in the area said.Police said the driver, Jethu Mahto, a resident of Ramgarh district, had received minor injuries and was admitted to a local hospital.We carried out a search operation to find out who looted the onions but they are yet to be nabbed, Kumar said.Ram Lakhan Prasad, a potato and onion wholesaler at Ranchis Pandra Krishi Bazar said, A kilogram of onion is being sold at Rs 70 to Rs 85 at the wholesale market on Wednesday. However, at retail markets, it is being sold at Rs 90 to Rs 110, depending upon the quality.The steep price of onions, a necessary cooking ingredient for most households, has adversely impacted the kitchen budget of the common people in Jharkhand.The high price of onions has increased our monthly budget by Rs 1,000. Our request from the newly elected government is to reduce the price of onions as it has become costlier than apple and petrol, said Smrita Dutta, a housewife from Ranchis Lalpur area."

The Union government has sent 11 teams to help the state administration tackle the menace.""We have formed 27 teams, comprising central and state government officials, to keep a watch on the movement of swarms and to spray pesticide. Till now we have sprayed pesticide over 1,815 hectares in Banaskantha,"" Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told reporters.The state government would conduct a survey and compensate the affected farmers, he assured. The state government is also exploring the possibility of using drones to spray pesticide, he said.Union Minister of State for Agriculture Purushottam Rupala said that the Central government will provide all possible help to Gujarat to tacklethe problem of locusts.""To tackle the menace, the centre has sent its team to Gujarat and the problem is expected to be solved in 6 to 7 days,"" Rupala told PTIFarmers have been directed to use various measures to keep off the swarms, including burning tyres, playing drums and clanging metal objects, installing table fans in the fields and even playing music loudly, an agriculture department official said.Locusts were first seen in Suigam, Danta, Deesa, Palanpur and Lakhni tehsils of Banaskantha last week. From there they moved to Satlasana tehsil in Mehsana district.""They entered Gujarat from the desert areas of Pakistan. This is the second time in a month that locusts have invaded the fields in north Gujarat,"" Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said earlier.Local farmers said they were witnessing the phenomenon after almost a decade. Punamchand Parmar, Additional Chief Secretary in the state Agriculture department, said the locusts have affected crops over 5,000 hectares in Banaskantha district.A few days ago a huge swarm, spread across 30 to 35 square kilometers, descended in Tharad tehsil and devoured mustard, castor, funnel and wheat crops, he said, adding that locusts are still present in neighboring areas of Jalore district in Rajasthan and in Tharparkar desert of Pakistan.""We have deployed 45 teams in Tharad where a large swarm descended two days ago,"" he told reporters in Gandhinagar.Of the 11 tehsils of Banaskantha where locusts were seen, Suigam, Danta, Tharad and Vav are the worst-hit.""Though we have been able to kill around 25 per cent of locusts so far, it will take another four days for the teams to completely eliminate them. Looking at the wind patterns, it seems the locust swarms in Jalore and Tharparkar may not enter Gujarat,"" Parmar added.Parbat Patel, local MP, said the attack was unprecedented. ""We have never seen such a large number of locusts. The swarms have caused large-scale destruction.Government is trying to ensure that they do not invade new areas,"" he said. Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Paresh Dhanani said the state government's measures to contain the attack were inadequate.The government should have used aircraft to spray pesticides, they said. However, agriculture minister R C Faldu said this method could be dangerous for animals which graze in open fields.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

The poser of BJP to BJD president came a day before the celebration of the 23rd foundation day of the regional party.In the development index, Odisha is behind many States despite the BJD being in power since its formation. The State Government has not been able to fulfil the basic needs of the people, said State BJP vice-president Samir Mohanty.Twenty years is a long time but the BJD government has failed to keep its promise to provide irrigation to at least 35 per cent of arable land in each of the 134 blocks, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to convert all kucha houses to pucca with all facilities, including drinking water by March 2022.The State has to construct more than 30 lakh houses which seems impossible.He said the State Governments claim of achieving significant growth appears hollow as the people are still dependant on other States to meet their demands for onion, potato, egg and fish."

If you will resolve to do anything, make sure it is in a dive bar late on a Saturday night, when you are drunk enough to make tall claims  but others are equally drunk, so they will not remember it the next day. From bungee jumping in New Zealand to skydiving over Dubai, running an ultra in a desert to free-climbing a blooming rock, avoid these classic tropes, and some more which I am listing below.Vegans: Be it for the social quotient or because your role-play fantasy is tree-hugger, both imply that your food issues are of the first world order. I feel for you, if only because you are as detached from reality as you are from any sense of taste.Intermittent Fasting (IF): Not only do I hate people who wont eat animals, I detest those who dont eat at all too! I always thought that dying of hunger would be a cheap way to go but IF is one lame marketing gimmick; it makes you lean like being hit by a truck full of books makes you wise. There are adages wise about moderation none of which apply to IF.Seven Summits: The 1858 Geosphere by Montblanc is an exquisite tribute to those whove scaled the seven summits, something best left to the experts. Buy this watch and admire the seven peaks as they turn on tiny dials at the end of your arm. But stop with the carbon emissions and rubbish dumping on the hills just to prove to yourself that you can be pushed up every mountain by Sherpas. If an adrenalin rush and high is what you after, put on some Bob Marley andyou know what comes next.World Major Marathons: You know the best part about running 42.2 kms  theres none. But the second best part is that, being a metric unit of measurement, its the same everywhere in the world. So trudge them out in NYC or Nala Sopara, itll take about the same time. Why not come over and run it on my treadmill, which is hooked up to a dynamo which powers my house for then you can claim to have truly shed light on others lives?Keto: While on the topic of methods of self-inflicted torture, Keto is another good way to starve the system. Ketosis, like detox, are things the body does on its own. To retrain your system of a few millenniahow about we start simple  like remembering birthdays?Superfoods: The only thing that makes superfoods super is the economics of supply and demand where the supply is controlled by a nifty multinational conglomerate with billions in investments while the demand is fuelled by marketing-addled you.Just eat a balanced diet, dont be a couch potato, and learn to keep your mouth shut around friends, alcohol and the New Years Eve: the rest will take care of itself."
2019-12-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/as-2020-nears-we-look-at-the-last-decade-in-food/article30402825.ece,Looking back at a decade in the world of food,"Unity in diversityFood, it is said, is one of the greatest dividers. The opposite though, is also equally true. Nothing unites as well as food. Think about it: food binds, you share life stories over plates of delicious food with friends and strangers alike. It often tends to be the biggest point of conversation too.This past decade saw people (read amateur cooks and home chefs) opening up their homes to strangers in an attempt to introduce them to their family/communitys culinary heritage, by way of food pop-ups. From Ayandrali Duttas traditional Bengali pop-ups in Delhi, Suman Soods Himachali dham (food prepared during a wedding) in Delhi and Shruti Yashs North Indian street food pop-ups in Bengaluru, to the more famous The Bohri Kitchen, that hosts elaborate meals replete with keema samosas and roasted raan in Mumbai and conducts pop-ups in other cities as well.These home food pop-ups heralded the trend of celebrating micro-cuisines in a country where cooking techniques and flavour profiles vary every 50 kilometres. Restaurants and chefs werent far behind when it came to giving micro-cuisines their moment in the sun. Soon collaborations became the buzzword, with chefs calling upon home cooks to share their expertise in regional cuisines in the professional kitchen. From Iti Misras soul-satisfying Bengali Bhoj for The Bombay Canteen, to Anoothi Vishals Kayasth Khatirdari pop-up in collaboration with Manish Mehrotra, the list of these interesting tie-ups featuring regional cuisines has been winning hearts across the country.The fact that the culinary world has been looking for inspiration closer home  in a bid to reduce food miles and use locally grown ingredients while exploring uncharted flavours  could be one of the major reasons why hyperlocal cuisines are now being celebrated. Celebrity chefs themselves have been working with hitherto unheard-of ingredients to tickle the fancies of their diners.For instance, at the JW Marriott Mussoorie, it is not uncommon to find a typically Uttarakhand staple of kandali ka saag (made with stinging nettle and tempered with jakhia) make its way onto your plate. Vivanta by Taj in Guwahati doesnt shy away from featuring Assamese food in its breakfast buffet or seasonal Assamese thali meals either. Down South, chefs such as Regi Mathew and Mathangi Kumar are known to collaborate with home chefs to put up meals from communities such as Gujarati, Mudaliar and Nagarathar as well.Out with the faux meatMock meats, soya nuggets and Seitan burgers take a bow. Then, exit.Finally, its curtains down for wannabe meats, bound together with soy, salt, flavour enhancers and regret. Over the last decade, as talented chefs experimented with ingredients from all over the world, it became clear that old-fashioned vegetarian meats pale in comparison to the real thing: vegetables.At trend-setting Noma, Chef Ren Redzepi first made foraging trendy. For the first half of this decade, inspired by Redzepi, cooks across the world went scuttling into forests and fields, looking for edible mushrooms, herbs and weeds. In 2017, he launched Vild Mad (Wild Food), a free mobile app that helps foragers read a landscape and unlock its culinary potential. More recently, he announced that Noma will run a vegetarian-only menu from summer to early fall.Hes not the only one. Noticing customers demanding more inventive fare, as they convert to vegetable-centric diets, fuelled by a need to better their health and that of the planet, restaurants have begin to experiment  with surprising, and delicious results.At Noma, Redzepi had summer flowers on the menu in 2014. In 2015, the Noma Japan menu featured pumpkin simmered with kelp and salted cherry blossoms. They have made a celeriac and truffle shawarma, marinated for hours and slowly cooked into a sweet, golden, caramelised main course.While mushroom burgers and jackfruit tacos were served in food trucks and markets, restaurants vied with each other, plating up increasingly detailed, complex dishes. The theme: to discover new techniques and ingredients, then use them to present classics in unusual ways.At Ducks Eatery in New York, they serve an entire smoked watermelon ham that takes four to six days to prepare. In Pittsburgh, Apteka customers can order burnt young sunflower, to be eaten like corn on the cob. In India too, there has been a rise in trendy vegetarian restaurants, proving again that there is more to vegetarian menus than carbs, potatoes and paneer. From popular chain Burma Burma to Mumbais chic Kitchen Garden by Suzette, these are all big on organic, vegan, Instagrammable food.Meanwhile, those chewy soya chunks of the past have been replaced by cleverly engineered burgers by companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. Malaysian start-up Phuture Foods began working on a plant-based pork substitute for Asia. Scientists found ways to create kinder, healthier lab-grown meats. In India, Good Dot got popular for its protein-packed vegetarian achari tikka, burji and biryani, which they say have no cholesterol or transfats.Watch this filter down to home kitchens, already bristling with air fryers for vegetable chips and dehydrators for fruit leathers. The availability of ingredients like liquid smoke, imported mushrooms and high-quality sauces means you can make a steak out of anything now, from cauliflowers to tofu. It helps that chefs techniques, from fermentation to sous vide, are easily available via social media, and YouTube lessons.Clearly, its going to get easier every year to be vegetarian, flexitarian, pescatarian, vegan or a combination of them all. Finally, you can have your steak, and eat it too.Of food miles and carbon footprintsIf the last decade treated the opening of sustainable restaurants in Spain, Asia and Australia as unique, applause-worthy initiatives, this decade saw the movement go mainstream. And India joined in with gusto.Today, the onus of sustainability has been taken up not only by celebrity chefs in their eponymous restaurants, but also by bartenders, a rising crop of bean-to-bar chocolatiers, and even supermarkets. In 2016, France became the first nation in the world to penalise supermarkets and grocery stores for throwing away products that were still edible by humans. Needless to say, others followed.In India, restaurants focussed primarily on sustainability (like the gas-free Arth in Mumbai) are still rare. The shift instead has been that of habits and practices, from bamboo and metal straws (The Whisky Bar in Gurugram took it a step ahead with lemongrass straws) to responsible sourcing of local, seasonal ingredients that reduce the carbon cost of transportation and storage, and lower the need for artificial preservation. In bars, this shift in ingredients was another excuse for creativity (think cocktails served in repurposed condensed milk cans and bourbons infused with mint stems). In restaurants, local ingredients naturally went hand-in-hand with an exploration of regional cuisines  chefs (like London-returned Alfred Prasad of Omya at The Oberoi, Delhi) made a habit out of meeting with farmers and fishermen to understand terroir, crop varieties and sustainable practices, while also getting to sample a whole new world of food in the hinterlands. It was a change that diners seemed to be lapping up.Zero waste has been a major buzzword  if nose-to-tail cooking has been a part of traditional Indian cuisines, root-to-stem was a new trend picked up not only at restaurants, but also at home chefs kitchens and even in cooking classes. Then there were those working far away from the scene of cooking. InSeason Fish managed to educate restaurateurs and consumers around the country through its calendar of which fish varieties to eat or avoid as per coastline and season.But this was also the decade that saw the rise of home deliveries, with a spurt in delivery apps and cloud kitchens. This has brought with it added concerns about packaging and transport: concerns the industry will hopefully address soon."

Retail inflation hovered mainly in the range of 2-3.30 per cent from January to August and started to move up steadily post-monsoon as crop damage due to unseasonal rains hurt the supplies in a big way.It unexpectedly hit a pause button on cutting the key (repo) interest rate, giving more importance to prevailing inflation pressure and rising food prices over a worrying slowdown in the economy.The status quo came in after five consecutive cuts in repo rate since February, as the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, unanimously voted to hold the key repo rate at 5.15 per cent and reverse repo rate at 4.90 per cent. ""Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors.First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020,"" RBI said on December 5.ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar expects moderation in vegetable prices to a large extent by early 2020.""Healthy groundwater and reservoir levels bode well for rabi output and yields of various cereals.However, the year-on-year decline in the area sown under rabi pulses and oilseeds poses a concern, given the high inflation being recorded by some of these items,"" Nayar said.ICRA expects the CPI inflation to spike further to 5.8-6 per cent in December 2019. On the wholesale front, the 2019 inflation story was on a different trajectory with prices moving downwards from a high of 3.58 per cent in January to the lowest 0.16 per cent in October mainly on account of cheaper fuel and power.The up-tick of WPI inflation to 0.58 per cent in November was attributable to costlier vegetables, mainly onion as well as pulses.As per the government data, prices of onion in the wholesale market went up by 172 per cent in November from a year ago.On the WPI-CPI divergence, brokerage firm Anand Rathi said at 5.5 per cent in November, retail inflation was at a multi-year high while, in the same month, WPI inflation at 0.6 per cent was modest.""High food inflation contrasted with deflation in fuel and manufactured product inflation is creating this situation as the retail price index assigns much higher weights to food than does the WPI.Besides, the inclusion of services in retail but not in the wholesale index continued, as, despite being on a falling clip, services inflation was relatively elevated,"" as per Anand Rathi.CARE Ratings expects inflation to range in 4-4.5 per cent for the rest of the year (2019-20), adding the ""base effect will not be favourable in the coming months"".While the surge in vegetable prices will eventually reverse, the elevated inflation for pulses needs to be watched with caution, unless rabi sowing picks up pace, according to Nayar.""The RBI rate pause is likely to continue. The RBI targets retail inflation, which has jumped 240 basis points (bps) in the last four months and is now close to the upper end of the RBI's target zone. Consequently, despite low core and WPI inflation, as also deflation in fuel and manufactured product prices, the RBI is unlikely to cut the policy rate soon. Low growth, however, rules out any rate hike,"" Anand Rathi brokerage said."
2019-12-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/raise-a-toast-to-the-momo/article30410675.ece,Raise a toast to the momo,"Tucked away in a corner of my kitchen is a little bamboo contraption that gave us all great joy once upon a time. It came from Kolkata and was introduced to us as a momo steamer. Shape your momos at home, place them in the steamer, cook them for some minutes  and you can have a plateful of piping hot dumplings to be eaten with a sizzling red chilli-garlic dip.Even a decade or so ago, momos were not as ubiquitous as they are now, so the steamer came in handy. Today, I dont know where the steamer is, because I dont need it anymore. These days, you can spot a momo stall in every street corner in every city. Someone enterprising steams momos at home, and then makes a small profit selling them on the street side. If and when I have a yen for momos, all I have to do is step out of the house and stop by at the nearest momo stall.I am often asked if there is a street food item that can be described as pan-Indian. There are quite a few popular dishes you will find across India, including the omnipresent dosa or the tandoori chicken, but I think the humble momo has pipped every other dish to the post of being pan-Indian.Everyones fancyIts not surprising to see why the momo has caught everyones fancy  from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kolkata. Its the sellers dream item, needing neither much capital nor effort. You knead some dough, boil minced chicken with ginger and mild spices, shred it and keep it aside. You make small balls of the dough, shape them into bowls and stuff them with the shredded chicken (or pork in some happy circles) or shredded and boiled cabbage, then close the mouths and steam them. Voila  they are done. Cities such as Delhi even have some centralised kitchens where the dumplings are prepared in large quantities for momo sellers to take away.For those who love their momos, the dumpling is like no other. For one, the name is easy to pronounce: It is a lot easier than, say, katlambe, a fried poori of north India, or radhabollobhi, a stuffed poori from Bengal. Momos are easy to eat  unlike, say golgappas, for which you need a wide mouth and military-like precision to enable you to pick up and pop the mint-water-and-potato-chickpea-filled ball into your mouth just before it breaks or spills. Momos are easy to customise, too. You like your food hot? Then just smear your momo with the hot sauce that it is usually served with. You like your food bland? Ignore the sauce. If you like fried food, momos ably step in  for you get some delicious fried momos, too. A momo is an otherwise healthy (despite the flour casing) and hearty snack. And a plate of momos (sometimes served with broth-like stock) is a meal in itself.But whats equally interesting is that the momo, unlike its other street food cousins, also occupies the high table. In fine dining parlance, of course, it is known as the dim sum or shumai, or the Japanese gyoza. The casing may vary, as may the filling. Sometimes, egg is added to the flour. The fillings can be anything from sauted shrimps and ground meat to steamed and chopped asparagus or water chestnut and Chinese mushroom. Hotels and restaurants even serve dim sum meals, where you can eat all the dumplings you want.Bizarre formsMomos have started taking on new forms as well, some more bizarre than others. They are not just simple steamed dumplings anymore but are dumped in gravies or cooked in a tandoor. I was urged to try out the tandoori momo at a Mussoorie restaurant that served Oriental food. The momos were fiery red in colour, and I wanted to call for a fire brigade when I had my first bite. I am not going back there.Be that as it may, the little dumpling has a story for us. I would like to think that it shows, in some small way, the opening of doors of our very insular world. I remember the time when the only place we got momos was at a complex that we called Tib Dhabs (short for Tibetan Dhaba) in north Delhi. Then eateries near Chanakya Cinema started serving momos, and soon some of the Northeastern outlets in Dilli Haat had momos on their menus. Today, the dish that is believed to have come to India across the Himalayas from Tibet is as much a part of our food lexicon as, say, the South Indian vada or the Mumbai pav bhaji, the Bengali phuchka or the North India papri chaat.Lets raise a toast to the momo. It is not just our window to the world, but reminds us, in these difficult times, to keep our doors open.The writer likes reading and writing about food as much as he does cooking and eating it. Well, almost."

The caps for stocking potato and onion are 500 quintals and 250 quintals respectively for wholesalers in Cuttack, Rourkela, Berhampur and Sambalpur."

Spot 360 at DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Bangalore, Sarjapur Road, was launched last Saturday with a similar vision in mind: To provide guests the opportunity to have a rooftop experience on the 12th floor, complete with peppy music, swimming pool, bar and live counters.I walked in and chose a table beside the pool, and almost immediately, was served a welcome drink  watermelon juice mixed with lemon and pepper  with a flowery presentation. It was a simple drink, yet so soothing, and on top of that, I could even feel the pulp in my mouth.A few appetisers reached our table, with both vegetarian and non-vegetaran options like Masala Pork Sausage, Keema Juicy Lucy, Paneer Keema, Cheese, Carrot Raisin and Onion Slaw served with crispy breads. My favourites were Paneer Keema and Pork Sausage, as their flavours came out really well and the added cheese made them fulfilling. Executive chef Tanmoy Majumdar also sent us a bowl of popcorn along, which felt like a great start to the evening.As cool breeze kept the weather chilly and songs of Rihanna played in the background, the Chaat slider made an entry, with Golgappa shots, Palak Patta, Paapdi Chaat and Aloo Tikki sitting pretty on it. The not-so-spicy Golgappa was served with Meetha and Khatta paani, but the Paapdi Chaats garnished with ketchup, potatoes and various spices, were something I will look forward to the next time.The all-day breakfast dish  Egg Benedict Raj Style  was oozing out curried hollandaise, which is a rich sauce made of butter, egg yolk and lemon juice, from a smooth egg poach placed on top of a round bread. With apple green chilli used as seasoning, it is spicy yet extremely flavourful. Smashed Avocado and Kachumbar on Sourdough toast is a specialty of the restaurants, and people who want to add a bit of healthy ingredients to their menu can go for this. Topped with basil seeds, try this veggie overload for a different experience.To get a glimpse of tandoori cuisine, I tried and loved the freshness of the fish, although it was a bit too salty. Add a pinch of lemon and youll be set. The Tandoori cauliflower felt a little bland and is probably a good idea to ask the chef to customise it according to your preferred food choices. Our main course took the cake away. With Daab Chingri, Moge wala Martaban meat and Kerala rice, it was a satisfying meal. The mutton was topped with lentils but somehow did not add any extra flavour to it. The Bengali prawn curry, cooked and served inside a green coconut (Daab Chingri) was succulent and stuffed with spices. Pairing it with the rice did justice to the whole experience.Their in-house desserts  DoubleTree Choco Chip Cookie Cup, Broken Cookie Sundae and Cookie Sandwich Mousse Sandwich  are beautifuland satiating.

However, onion and potato continue to hassle consumers. The price of cabbage has come down from Rs 50 per kg to Rs 25 per kg. Similarly, brinjal, which was selling for Rs 40 per kg, is now available for Rs 20 per kg. Price of pumpkin has gone down from Rs 35 per kg to Rs 20 per kg and tomato now available for Rs 20 per kg.Tapan Parida, a Government employee said prices of vegetables have fallen by almost 50 per cent. However, the price of onion and potato has remain unchanged. I am hoping it will come down in the next two weeks, he said. Even as consumers are glad that the prices of vegetables have come crashing by almost 50 per cent, it does not augur well for farmers. The farmers said with the dip in price, they are unable to make up for their expenditure on fertiliser and irrigation.Jiban Behera, a vegetable farmer from Chandol said traders from Cuttack and Bhubaneswar procure vegetables from the district and sell them for huge profit in malls. He said exploitation by middlemen is rampant in the district. Secretary of district unit of Krusaka Sabha Gayadhar Dhal said owing to lack of cold storage and food processing plants, vegetable growers of the district are forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices."

(Photo: Twitter) Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath distributes blankets to homeless persons at Maharana Pratap Inter College in Gorakhpur on Sunday. (Photo: Twitter)Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claimed on Sunday that the state government was providing farmers more than 1.5 times more than the cost of their produce through minimum support price (MSP).Till three years ago, farmers in the state used to get less than the minimum support price for their agricultural produce, said the CM. In 2015-16, the minimum support price for paddy was Rs 1,400, but farmers could not get more than Rs 900-1000. This year the price is Rs 1,835, which is being sent directly to the farmers account. Apart from this, the state government is giving an additional Rs 20 per quintal for filtering and transportation. Through the support price only, the state government is providing more than 1.5 times of the cost [of produce] to the farmers, which is an attempt to bring a comprehensive change in their lives, Adityanath told farmers at a felicitation function organised by NABARD.He said today was the time of branding, adding that the more we can promote our brand, the more value it will get.Many farmer producer organisations (FPOs) are branding their product by doing better work and they are getting better benefits, he said. The CM said that there are a total of 823 development blocks in the state. By the end of this financial year, set up one FPO in every development block that can be a role model for the farmers there, he said. The CM said efforts should also be made towards establishing one FPO in all 60,000 gram panchayats of the state, pointing out that this would help in increasing farmers income manifold.He said FPOs and banking institutions could contribute significantly to increase the income of farmers.The CM said that earlier, purchases were made in the state through mediators. Naturally, they were the ones who used to earn profits. Today we are purchasing 53 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and 50 lakh metric tonnes of paddy directly from farmers. We are declaring the support price for potato, and the support price for pulses and oilseeds while furthering its procurement, said the CM.The CM said that in May 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mentioned that the aim was to double the income of farmers by 2022. In our country, farmers and agriculture complement each other. As long as we do not take this large population towards prosperity, there will not be prosperity in the country, he said. He said several efforts had been started in this regard. Several schemes such as Soil Health Card, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Agricultural Irrigation Scheme and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi had been implemented. On the same lines, the state government has provided better facilities like loan waiver of farmers, advancing the policy of procurement and drip irrigation, said Adityanath.

The minimum temperature that the city stood at 11.4C, which was lower by two degrees than normal.December 29, 2018 was when the Bayan City had registered decades lowest minimum temperature with mercury dipping to 7.2C.Meanwhile, tourists in Abu groaned under bone-chilling weather as mercury levels went to sub-zero degrees in the night from Saturdays 1.5C. Adding to their woes was the chilly winds that kept blowing throughout the day.In Banaskanthas Deesa town, a one degree rise in with mercury from 6.5C to 7.5C on Sunday was a little respite from the three days of chill. Roads wore a deserted look, especially after the sun set as people refrained from going out except for necessary work.Wrapped in blankets and woollens, bonfires seemed the only source of some heat in villages while urban homes got some respite from electric heaters that worked all the time. Parents too looked reluctant to send their children to school early in the morning.On the contrary, the cold wave conditions are congenial for the potato growers in north Gujarat. An official from the agriculture department said, The climate is quite suitable potato and all other rabi crops that have been spared by the recent locust onslaught. Even if the mercury slumps few more notches, it will benefit the crop.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light showers at isolated places in South Gujarat and Saurashtra on Monday. According to an IMD bulletin, the wet weather is the result of cyclonic circulation over south-east Rajasthan and neighbourhood between 1.5 km and 2.1 km above mean sea level.The bulletin states that some places in districts of Bharuch, Valsad, Navsari and Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli, Rajkot, Dwarka, Gir Somnath and Bhavnagar are expected to receive light rain."

We already have a substantial number of farmers switching over to organic farming, he said. By switching over to organic farming, agriculturalists stand to gain in the long-run, not only in terms of their own health and welfare, but also ensuring better soil fertility in their fields, and lesser input costs.Long-term impactWe are concerned about the long-term impact of the use of chemical pesticides, which are known to impact the health of cultivators as well as the public, who can get exposed to the toxins by other means, said Mr. Samraj. Discussions will be held with farmers associations to convince them to adopt organic farming practices, he added. There has been pushback from several farmers associations in the district, who plan to hold protests in the coming weeks, fearing that the district administration plans to place an outright ban on the pesticides.If chemical pesticides are restricted in the Nilgiris, lakhs of farmers will stand to lose tremendously, as many of the vegetables popularly grown in the district, such as potatoes, carrots and even cabbages require high inputs of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and weed killers, said a farmer. It would be unfair to only place restrictions on agriculturalists in the Nilgiris, while farmers elsewhere are allowed to use chemicals to grow their crops, he said."

Not only did Israeli diplomats and residents here get to celebrate the eighth and last day Hanukkah with fervour and in grandeur, but for the first time in Bengaluru, they also got to do so in an Israeli hotel. Hosted in collaboration with The Den Hotel, Bengaluru, the celebration was held at Layla, an Israeli restaurant in the city which gets its name from the Hebrew word for night. True to the spirit of the Israeli festival of lights, the party kicked off just as day turned to dusk, with the twinkling lights of the city as the perfect backdrop.One of the highlights of Hanukkah  which celebrates the miracle of a small amount of oil providing light for eight days  is lighting the eight candles of the Israeli diya, called the Hanukkiah, which are placed in the candlestand known as Menorah. The consulates celebration too had a candle lighting by Dana Kursh, Consul General of Israel to South India, Ariel Seidman, Deputy Consul General of Israel to South India, and other dignitaries. Theres never been anti-Semitism in India. As Israeli diplomats here, we have a special connection and feel very welcome here, said Seidman, while referring to a recent attack at a synagogue in New York.And since miracles are at the core of this festival, Kursh also highlighted the many moments she was thankful for. I got to spend half my Hanukkah in Israel, where I got to join Intel Indias Country Head Nivruti Rai for a day and a half during her trip there. I spent the other half here. For everyone at the consulate to be able to celebrate our festival of lights with friends and partners here is a miracle as well, said the diplomat, who was previously the Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Israel in India from June 2015 to July 2017.Agreed Seidman, who recalled how his favourite moment of the festival as a child was receiving presents. Now, as an adult, spending time with his family is what matters most. Its actually more fun here than back home since I get to show my friends something they dont know, he told CE. We had friends over every night except for one and got to explain our traditions and culture to them, he adds.Since no festivities are complete without food, the celebration also ensured that guests got to try some Israeli specials. These included potato pancakes and sufganiyot, which are jelly-filled doughnuts, or as one Indo-Israeli couple at the party, Shalini Elassery and Alex Skorohod, jokingly said, The real reason why we are here. Guests were also treated to the screening of an award-winning Israeli film Zero Motivation, Hanukkah songs (with both Kursh and Seidman doing a small performance) and music by The Chronic Blues Circus, a Bengaluru-based band. Also present were Maruo Katsumasa, deputy consul-general, Japan, comedian and actor Rubi Chakravarti, hospitality professional Aslam Gafoor and brand guru Harish Bijoor.Truly namma BengaluruThe city reminds Dana Kursh, who will be starting her third year in Bengaluru, of Israel, thanks to the similar vibrance, innovation hubs and temples she sees back home too. You can really see the heritage of the temples, she says, adding that she loves the Bull temple and finds the ISKCON temple to be very powerful. But I love the small temples as well. Its like back in home in Israel, when you cross the road and see many temples, she says, while also paying credit to the citys weather. But at the end of the day, its really about the people.
