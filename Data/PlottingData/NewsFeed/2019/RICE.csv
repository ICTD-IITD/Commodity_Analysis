Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.BATHINDA: The Punjab government is going to promote paddy transplantation through mechanized means this year. The state government has decided to introduce subsidy on paddy transplanters to make farmers opt for machines over labour.Farmers face the problem of labour shortage every year during transplantation of paddy. Now, it has decided to provide 50% subsidy on transplanters to small, marginal, scheduled caste (SC) and woman farmers. Other farmers will be extended a 40% subsidy on these machines.There are two types of tranplanters: one is operated by two persons and covers 4-6 acres in a day and the second one is a self-propelled machine which covers 10-12 acres per day. These machines ensure uniform transplantation of paddy, as per recommendations of Punjab Agriculture University.The smaller machine, which covers 4-6 rows of the crop, is priced at Rs 3 lakh, while the self-propelled machine costs nearly Rs 10 lakh. The larger, self-propelled rice transplanter, which takes care of about eight rows of the crop in one go, costs nearly Rs 16 lakh. As the machines are costly, the state government will encourage primary cooperative societies of villages to purchase these.The state agriculture department has sought applications from farmers interested in getting subsidized paddy transplanters till January 20, and farmers will have send their applications to block agriculture development officer or district agriculture officer.Paddy is expected to be transplanted in 65 lakh acres in Punjab. Experts say if machines are used for transplantation, production would increase from 25 plants in a square metre to 32 plants in the same area.Punjab agriculture department secretary Kahan Singh Pannu told TOI that the state government has directed that transplantation of paddy should start on or after June 20. The subsidy scheme will be funded by the Centre and the state government, in the ratio of 60:40. We expect to sell nearly 1,000 machines in the first year on subsidy, he said.Punjab has been facing an acute shortage of farm labour for the past few years due to a constant decline in manpower from other parts of the country. Because of this, said Pannu, farmers farmers wanted to use machines for transplanting the paddy crop.Farmer organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri, however, said the machines were costly and the results of these machines were not of much benefit to farmers. Just look at what happened to wheat sown using Happy Seeder, he said.A farmer of Sangat village in Bathinda , Dalbir Singh, said cultivators were not familiar with transplantation machines. Few would go in for them, he said."

Girija, project director, Agricultural Technology Management Agency, Wayanad, for the cultivation.He had also received an incentive of Rs. 20,000 from the Agriculture Department.As there is a huge demand for the seeds of rare rice varieties among the farming community in the country and pesticide-free rice from the elite class of society, I am trying to tap the huge potential, Mr. Kumar said.

At times, the bags delivered to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 2017-18 with printed Punjab lot number  were also found.Sources said the practice of recycling public distribution system (PDS) rice has been on for last few years in Punjab and Haryana. The illegal supply was detected last year between September and November. A probe showed that 1.90 lakh bags of paddy (37.5 kg per bag) and one lakh bags of rice (50 kg per bag) were seized by the Punjab food supplies department in 41 raids. The department got seven cases registered with the police.The modus operandi is simple. Under the National Food Security Act, 2013, the FCI procures paddy from Punjab and Haryana and in some cases after milling, distributes the rice to other states. This rice is meant for sale through the PDS system. Bags of rice or paddy come back in trucks (540 bags of rice and 400 bags of paddy per truck) and are bought by rice millers here at Rs 2,200 per quintal and sold back to the procurement agencies for Rs 2,900 per quintal, thus leading to a profit of Rs 700 per quintal. In UP and Bihar, the price is Rs 1,000 per quintal. Fake bills are produced as the MSP here is Rs 1,750 per quintal.Once this paddy or rice reaches rice millers they get fake bills and show it as purchased from the mandis. The paperwork is thus complete though no actual purchase is made. As rice does not attract any GST and no permission is needed for interstate transfer, traders make fake bills and the product is transferred. In most cases, when caught, traders presented these bills as they are difficult to verify, he said.Sources said the state government has instructed rice millers to show paddy and rice found in their mills as their own purchase and whenever they sell these commodities they need to record it with the district manager of the procurement agency concerned. It will ensure that they will not be able to pass off these stocks to FCI.Sources said that these bags of rice and paddy were coming from Muzaffarpur, Muradabad, Gaya, Sitapur and Gulabgarh in Bihar and Bulandshahr, Bareilly and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh.Director Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Punjab, Anindita Mitra, said, In the coming season, we will intensify efforts to detect and eliminate bogus purchases and billing through the use of technology and required amendments in the policy framework. We have already brought this matter to the notice of FCI.Sources said in last six years, the procurement of paddy was increasing every year despite the fact that the yield and area of production remained constant. In 2017, it was 179 lakh metric tonnes and in 2016, 165 lakh MT and in 2018 it was expected to cross 200 lakh metric tonnes in Punjab but it is now 169 lakh MT after the crackdown."

Unable to offload their paddy yield through the governments procurement system, they now stand as vulnerable to exploitative market conditions and non-realisation of minimum support price (MSP) as before. Across the state, stacks of non-procured paddy are lying in mandis as lapses, delays and irregularities have shrouded the procurement process this season. Farmers are resorting to agitations at various places to protest the gross mismanagement in the procurement process and irregularities in the mandis. They suspect the activities of millers, who are alleged to have delayed the lifting of stocks due to ulterior motives.If this was not enough, the government has suddenly gone ahead and announced the closure of paddy procurement operations from February-end, two months before the stipulated date of April 30. It has taken into consideration the plea of achieving marketable surplus paddy, surpassing last years achievement by over 45 per cent, and to prevent recycling by millers. But it seems to have forgotten its own proclamation in the food policy for the 2018-19 Kharif marketing season that there would be no bar on procurement if more paddy comes to the mandis. Though a target of procuring 55 lakh tonnes of paddy was announced, it was not binding.Putting an end to procurement at a time when a substantial quantity of paddy is still to be lifted at the mandis is questionable. The farmers will now be at the mercy of private traders and rice millers and forced to sell their paddy at prices much below the MSP. While the procurement mess will no doubt give a fresh impetus to the political blame game over farmers, the government should abide by its own commitments by ensuring that the produce is procured. Besides, the lack of storage facilities at procurement centres as well as at mills is what is hurting farmers the most. If the issue is addressed sincerely, it will resolve a whole lot of problemsboth for farmers and the government."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Alappuzha: Despite the destruction unleashed by the August floods , farmers in Kuttanad hope to reap a bumper harvest.After suffering devastating losses the yield per hectare has shoot upto eight tonnes. As per reports last year, the average yield was only four tonnes per hectare.The region had suffered a complete wash out of crops due to the deluge and the farmers had begun cultivation from the scratch.Principal agriculture officer Beena Natesh said this harvest season Kuttanad will produce additional 50,000 tonnes of paddy and the profit is estimated at Rs 125 crore.Harvesting would begin by February 25 and the agriculture department has made arrangements to purchase 500 combine harvesting machines to complete the harvest in a time bound manner.Mankombu Rice Research Station head Vandana Venugopal attribute the rise in yield to a combination of factors ranging from sedimentation due to the floods to low level of pest incidences.She said, the flood waters have brought down the iron toxicity level in paddy fields, which was major issue experienced by farmers across Kuttanad.As per estimates, the floods had resulted in depositing of silt varying from three centimeters to 20cm across the wetland system.Vandana added, the silt disposition improved the physical condition of the fields and level of calcium also shot up.After the floods, a study on the soil in Kuttanad was conducted, which revealed that level of magnesium and boron were low in the paddy fields. The farmers were provided with instructions on how to tackle the issue.The most crucial of these could be that after these fields remained submerged for several weeks, farmers this time could follow the crop calendar for puncha cultivation.The sowing was done in the months of October and November. Given the smooth progress of calendar, the harvest would be completed much before the arrival of saline water.The quality of seeds that was distributed by agricultural department was also significantly higher. Favorable climate resulted in low instance of pest and disease, thereby boosting the yield.Vandana Venugopal said, if farmers follow this trend, it would reduce pollution and further increase paddy production. Scientific experts had also raised awareness among the farming community on adoption of good agricultural practices post-flood.It is due to agriculture departments efforts to resume farming that puncha cultivation could be kicked off in September.Principal agriculture officer Beena Natesh said, before the floods, only 23,000 hectares was under puncha cultivation. Post-flood, the area increased to 30,500 hectares. Overt 32,000 farmers were engaged in puncha cultivation this time.Initially we expected only five tonne paddy crops per hectare this time and hoped for an additional 35,000 tonne paddy crop . However, now we are confident that we would get additional 50,000 tonne paddy. This is a historical achievement for us, she added.The agriculture department had distributed of Jyothi and Uma at free of cost. The farmers sowed Jyothi seeds in 1,000 hectares and Uma seeds in 29,500 hectares.The devastating floods had severely affected around 650 paddy polders and bunds of 167 polders were breached. The farmers had incurred a loss of more than Rs 200 crore. The farmers were able to resume cultivation with the help of the state government.The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) has made arrangements to procure paddy from the farmers. The Supplyco will distribute the paddy price to farmers immediately after the procurement. The procurement price offered this season is Rs 25.30.Yield per hectare would vary based on the nature of the soil. The yield from the kari lands tend to be a bit lower than those classified as Karappadam while the yield from the kayal land will always be on the higher side."

We want to sell at least two lakh tons more to the central agency so that more paddy farmers could be provided with minimum support price of Rs 1,750 a quintal, said a senior state government official.The state government needs around 36 lakh tons of rice annually to run cheap foodgrain schemes for financially weaker sections. For this purpose, the state buys about 52 lakh tons of paddy directly from farmers against an average annual production of 160 lakh tons.If the state can sell 3 lakh tons of paddy to the FCI, approximately 1 lakh more farmers could be brought under the paddy procurement net. The state government is offering a much higher price compared to current market price of paddy. The market price of paddy is hovering around Rs 1,350 to Rs 1,400 a quintal against the governments MSP of Rs 1,750, said the senior government official.Sources in the state food and supplies department said selling rice to the FCI at this time of the year was a bit difficult as the Centre usually fixed the FCIs procurement quota for different states in the September-October period.It was agreed at the food cabinet meeting with all states in Delhi in September last year that the FCI would buy around 12 lakh tons of rice from Bengal. Selling 3 lakh tons of additional rice to the central agency at this point of time requires lobbying, said the state official.However, sources said the state was lobbying successfully to sell additional rice to the FCI since last year when the central agency had purchased more than 1 lakh tons of rice. The state was urging Delhi to buy additional rice from Bengal to supply grains to neighbouring states like Jharkhand and Sikkim.We have promised good quality rice. We hope we can achieve the target of selling 3 lakh tons of rice extra to the FCI as the agency did not refuse our request so far, said a source."
2019-03-16,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/paddy-procurement-in-karnataka-hit-by-confusion-about-rider/article26550667.ece,Paddy procurement in Karnataka hit by confusion about ‘rider’,"The procurement of rice under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme in Karnataka has been sharply lower this year, mainly as a result of a newly introduced rider which specifies that purchases should be made from small and marginal farmers.As on March 8, only 43,192 tonnes of paddy had been procured, a little over a fifth of the allowed total quantum of two lakh tonnes. The annual procurement of paddy in recent years has ranged between 2.3 lakh tonnes and a high of 12 lakh tonnes, said an official in the sector, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Given that the MSP scheme is intended to provide price support to farmers, agricultural sector officials are concerned that the shortfall in procurement could add to the distress among farmers.According to sources, one of the conditions for being recognised as a small and marginal farmer  especially in the horticultural land sector predominant in the States Malnad and coastal regions  is that one should not own more than half an acre (20 guntas) of land. Officials in the Agriculture Department opine that this stipulation has mainly come in the way of procurement of paddy in these two regions.Intervention soughtTaking a serious note of the issue, the president, vice-president and members of the Thirthahalli Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee wrote to the States Agriculture Minister in January seeking his intervention. They pointed out that farmers owning anything more than 19 guntas of land were not being issued certificates identifying them as small and marginal farmers.The rider limiting procurement to small and marginal farmers was hurting the interests of many paddy producers, they contended.The Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission (KAPC) has also intervened by flagging the issue to the Food and Civil Supplies Department.In his letter, KAPC Chairman T. N. Prakash Kammaradi described the procurement rider as contradictory.While the notification on the one hand says that the maximum quantum that could be procured from a farmer is 40 tonnes, on the other hand it stipulates procurement from small and marginal farmers.Small and marginal farmers cannot grow this much quantum of paddy, he observed.Only given priorityIn its reply, the Food and Civil Supplies Department clarified that small and marginal farmers were only being accorded priority in procurement and that all farmers were allowed to sell their paddy under the scheme.However, field level officials involved in the procurement continue to cite the notification, which was issued in November and is yet to be amended.The fact that the quantum of procurement has continued to remain very low even though the market rates have not increased is a clear indication of this confusion, farm sector officials said.The introduction of a system to procure paddy through rice mills is also being blamed as another reason affecting procurement this year. This was because not too many rice mills were showing interest, the officials said."
2019-04-07,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/an-online-platform-that-puts-farmer-first/cid/1688291,An online platform that puts farmer first,"Amar Khamar means my farm. This farm works with real farmers but operates in virtual space. The idea of floating a platform such as this one came to Sujoy Chatterjee when he was with an organisation that worked with small-holding farmers in India and Africa. I realised that as in India, so also abroad, the economically backward do not have access to the market. They cannot sell their products directly, says Chatterjee. This inspired him to start working with farmers in Bengal.Amar Khamar works with co-operatives and not-for-profit organisations which in turn have farmers registered with them. Self-help groups assist the farmers in selling their produce  rice, cereals, pulses, indigenous spices, honey  online.After every sale, the customer can see in his or her online account, the name of the farmer whose produce he or she has purchased. To maintain transparency, we have made our website interactive. A customer can call up the helpline number and will eventually be redirected to the farmer if he or she has any questions about the produce and the method of farming, says Chatterjee.But not every interaction has to do with a query. Sometimes people from Bangalore, Delhi, Calcutta want to have a discussion with a farmer about some heirloom crop or the other, some have requests for homemade products like lentil nuggets or bori that have gone missing from the urban menu.Since its launch in 2017, the platform has knitted together 300 farmers, most of them based in south and north Bengal; most of them women. Says Chatterjee, There is little surprise in that. In rural Bengal, the farmhands are mostly women. The male members usually migrate to far-flung places in search of livelihood. The women have to do everything on their own. They go to the jungles to fetch wood, make lentil nuggets for sale. But it seems none of these products fetch them much money, as they do not know how to reach out to the market. Chatterjee adds, This is where we play a role. We try to better their remuneration by improving their market reach.And that is how, almost by default, Amar Khamar has come to be interwoven with womens empowerment. According to Chatterjee, these women used to sell the products at their doorstep at abysmal rates. Also, they sell paddy as paddy instead of paddy as rice  which means there is no value addition to the field produce, he says exasperatedly. In other words, if farmers de-husk grains and sell them, the price increases by 15 to 20 per cent. The price for rice is generally standardised at Amar Khamar and sales fetch almost the same money throughout the year. But in case of paddy, the price is at times very low, and sometimes it does not even get sold. That is why it is better to sell rice instead of paddy, he explains.But isnt the digital medium a challenge at the farmers end? Apparently not. Chatterjee points out that even in remote geographies, every other person is today armed with a mobile phone powered by an Internet service provider. What Amar Khamar does is use the smart technology to make the farmers market smarter.The self-help groups have training centres in villages, which are fitted out with computers. The farmers use these to look up market prices of other organisations and fix their prices accordingly. Chatterjee and team have trained them to do so, just as they have facilitated market-related learning and training sessions at these centres.The other stakeholder organisations  like the womens cooperative in Bagdogra or the self-help groups in Sandeshkhali II and Hingalganj in the Sunderbans  help farmers register with the portal.Says Chatterjee, When a customer wants to buy a product, he will be able to select the nodal agency from which he wants to buy it. He will then get to choose the region. Thereafter, the computer will select a farmer seller, who is generally the one whose sale is the lowest for that particular month. The farmer gets a message on his mobile and he has to make sure that his product reaches the nodal agency, which then takes care of the future transit. And thus, at one fell sweep, there is transparent business happening and at the same time some sort of social balance is worked out.Even logistics are taken care of. For the Sunderbans, there is a centre in South 24-Parganas, where farmers can store their products. We send them to the customers whenever there is an order, says Chatterjee. For products from north Bengal, we have a buffer storeroom in Calcutta to avoid unnecessary transportation costs for small orders, he adds.The organisation charges 15 per cent of the market price as operational cost and the rest of the money goes to the farmer. Chatterjee says farmers are made aware of this business model. He adds, We do not buy at the cheapest rates and sell at the highest rates.Last month, Amar Khamar, with some help from food blogger Sayantani Mahapatra, came up with a pop-up lunch in Calcutta that put faces and flavour to a conversation about seeds and produce and commerce. Six varieties of rice from the Sunderbans  kanakchur, chine kamini, rani akanda, hogla, Hamilton and kalabhat  were served with machh mawla or mashed spiced fish, kankra die puishak or crab cooked with Malabar spinach and Sundorboner kalo khashi, a special mutton dish. According to Mahapatra, the best part of it all that day was this  the farmers cooked the food.Organic to the end."

2019-04-09,https://indianexpress.com/elections/odisha-lok-sabha-elections-bjp-bjd-welfare-schemes-5667772/,"Across Odisha, a battle rages over govt schemes: It’s state vs central","Its 7 pm, darkness has settled over Bahalpadar village. And Raju Tandi, a farmer, is a worried man. Hes not sure whether opening up about the elections would land him in trouble. I hope it wont affect the state government schemes that I benefit from, he says.AdvertisingFrom the states Kalia scheme for direct transfer of cash assistance to poor and landless farmers, rice at Rs 1 and the Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana, to the Centres Ujjwala scheme for subsidised LPG cylinders  all the talk this election across Balangir district in western Odisha to Puri and Paradip in the east is about schemes. About who has benefitted, and who has not.In Balangirs Bahalpadar, Tandi and his neighbours are yet to get money under Kalia, the newest and most ambitious scheme that was rolled out by BJD president and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik before the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections were announced. If no one had got the money, it would have been fine. But we feel left out, says Tandi.Such is the divide, that on Tuesday, two days before polls in parts of the state, Patnaik approached the states Chief Electoral Officer to lodge a complaint against the Election Commissions decision to stop disbursement of funds under the Kalia scheme.But poor people dont understand the technicalities. They dont understand why the government has not been able to keep its promise. They are just angry this will affect the BJDs chances, says Saswant Khuntia, a betel-leaf farmer from Govindpur village on the coastal Jagatsinghpur district.Patnaik is seeking a fifth term and his party appears to be confident in rural areas. But in towns and the villages nearby, Patnaik and the BJDs conch is engaged in a fierce fight with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJPs lotus.On one side, is the BJDs strong network built over the years at the ground level with a slew of welfare schemes. On the other, is the BJPs propaganda blitzkrieg that has projected Modi as an strong and daring leader who gave a befitting reply to Pakistan  but without the machinery to convert that goodwill into votes.Click here for more election newsThe verdict is still an open question but on the ground, a desire for paribartan (change) is gaining strength, especially in areas near Puri where BJPs national spokesperson Sambit Patra is taking on BJDs Pinaki Mishra.There is a Modi wind blowing here, says Pandab Pradhan, a farmer who owns five hectares of land at Barapali in the Bargarh Lok Sabha constituency. His complaint is that Patnaik has not kept his promise of ensuring irrigation for 10,000 hectares in the region  the Gangadhar Meher project, cleared in 2017, is not yet complete. But with only around 15 per cent of farmers benefitting from the Centres crop insurance scheme, Pradhans choice is clear: Modi for Lok Sabha, BJD in Odisha.At the Haldipali tehsil nearby, Prahlad Rana sees an edge for the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls because Modi will benefit from the Balakot strike. However, Pradhan and Rana say the BJP bungled in distributing tickets.In villages across Odisha, though, Patnaiks welfare schemes over the last 19 years continue to have a resonance, despite complaints about ill-equipped hospitals, lack of teachers in government schools and shortage of clean drinking water.But BJD leaders like Pinaki Mishra, the Puri candidate, argue that the vote will be on local flavour. The BJD also continues to draw support from women voters  Odisha has around 6 lakh women self help groups for whom the state announced Rs 3 lakh interest-free loans this year.However, in districts adjacent to Chhattisgarh, the Congress has some leverage, especially after coming to power in the neighbouring state. After farmers in Chhattisgarh got loan waivers and bonus on paddy prices, farmers in Bargarh, the rice bowl of Odisha, have also started asking why cant they get it, says Lingaraj, a farmer activist.In fact, the Election Commissions decision to halt Kalia payments citing the Model Code of Conduct is now a campaign theme for the BJD. The partys Balangir MP and candidate Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo tells voters: Naveen Patnaik wanted to give you money, but Narendra Modi stopped it.Even the Centres Ujjwala scheme  the state has more than 40 lakh beneficiaries  has not really taken off. According to Subendu Kumar Sahu, a distributor, only 10 per cent of Ujjwala beneficiaries return for refilling in his shop in Kendraparas Ansarpur."

There will be a second term of the Modi government in Delhi and a BJP government in the State, he said at a public meeting at Sambalpur, 300 km from Bhubaneswar.People are giving such massive support to us because the country wants a strong and honest government. We amended the years-old mining law and ensured that a part of the fund from the resources extracted is utilised for the development of the locality. Thus, the District Mineral Fund was formed and Odisha received 6,000 crore, he said.The fund was supposed to be spent on construction of hospitals, provision of drinking water for tribal people and building of schools. You will be surprised to know that the BJD government could spend only 1,000 crore out of 6,000 crore and the rest is lying underutilised. People here are worried over meeting petty needs. When the intent of the government is such, the government is required to be changed and ousted. People have blindly reposed their faith on this government for 20 years. Now, Odisha has made its mind up for change, he said.Mr. Modi accused the Naveen Patnaik government of uttering lies on the cheap rice distribution scheme. The Central government procures rice at 30 a kg and sends it to Odisha. The Odisha government contributes only 2 a kg and it claims that it provides rice at cheaper price. It is a lie and betrayal.Similarly, the Central government hiked the minimum support price of paddy by 1.5 times, but the State government failed to make necessary arrangements for purchasing the paddy and left farmers at the mercy of middlemen, he stated.The Prime Minister promised to set up a jal shakti mantralaya for conservation of river water if the BJP returned to power."

The money that we earn during the period is hardly enough to run the family for an entire year, said a woman farmhand in Kothapurianatham in Thirubhuvanai Assembly constituency.The woman said when work is available in sugarcane and paddy fields she would earn Rs. 240 per day. We split the work during morning and evening hours, she said.She complained that the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, which ensured guaranteed work for 100 days, was implemented on paper alone. The only way to improve our livelihood is proper implementation of the scheme. The government should consider adding more days of guaranteed work under the scheme. But I dont think people are going to vote on these issues. Caste affiliation matters a lot during polls in our village, she said.Several women farmhands to whom The Hindu spoke wanted the government to distribute rice through the Public Distribution System instead of giving money through Direct Beneficiary Transfer mode. We need to travel and spend long hours in the bank to withdraw the amount. It is an arduous task, she said.For the marginal farmers it is the lack of remunerative price that has hurt them most.Shanmugham, a cane farmer, said after delay in payment from the Puducherry Cooperative Sugar Mill Limited, the cultivators have started sending their produce to private mills situated in Tamil Nadu. The Cooperative mill management was yet to pay arrears to farmers who had supplied cane during the last two crushing seasons, he added.The transportation cost has hit us badly. Like the decision to write off farm loan waiver, the government should take some urgent step to revive the functioning of the cooperative mill, he said.People also complained of delay in construction of community hall and crematorium. For the last 10 years, we are demanding a community hall and crematorium. Nobody has bothered to heed to our demand, said Anjapuli, a farmer in Karayambuthur said."

S. Mahendra Dev and M. Govinda Rao talk about the inability of governments to think of long-term solutions to tackle farm distress, in a discussion moderated by Vikas Dhoot. Edited excerpts:Despite farm productivity rising, severe distress in the sector is a concern. How grave is the situation, especially for small and marginal farmers?S. Mahendra Dev: Farm distress is real because there have been low agricultural prices and low farm incomes. The farm sector growth rate is much lower than in earlier periods. As a result, farm prices are low despite production rising. The demand is also low. So, whether the increase in farm production is enough for incomes is not clear. For small and marginal farmers, the additional problem is that the size of land holdings is declining. Earlier, the average size was two hectares, now it has come down to nearly one hectare. Marginal farmers have less than half a hectare. With these sizes, income is difficult to sustain. The recent stress is also because prices are much lower than the MSP [minimum support price] in the market, while long-term problems such as low capital formation in agriculture persist. Public investment in the sector as a percentage of GDP is also stagnant. So, these factors, along with two years of drought, have led to this. Another thing is that the non-farm sector creates jobs. As per NABARD [National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development] data, 23% of rural income is from agriculture, so the rest is from non-farm activity. The rate of growth in agricultural wages has stagnated and is lower than in earlier years when MGNREGA and the construction sector helped boost wages. The rural economy overall, agricultural as well as non-farm, is facing a demand problem and low incomes, which has caused farm distress.Would you say the governments focus on managing inflation in the early years of its tenure and the inability to generate jobs that could have created non-farm avenues for the youth in farming households has contributed to the stress?SMD: Yes. The agriculture focus is short term, [which is why we have] loan waivers, but the focus on how to generate incomes and jobs has been lacking. The construction sector was earlier responsible for higher wages and demand, but now that sector is also stagnating.Eleven years ago, the UPA announced a massive farm loan waiver scheme. Do you think its an easy way to deal with a far more complex problem?SMD: Yes, the UPA did, but the impact on farm income was limited. Second, institutional credit to farmers is just 64%, so the rest is from non-institutional sources. The large farmers corner the institutional credit, and small and marginal farmers get non-institutional credit at interest rates of 25-30%. Moreover, there is a moral hazard problem as banks get affected  farmers say they dont have to repay the loans as there will be a waiver some time. There are opportunity costs for this loan waiver spending. Several States have started them, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. This will also have fiscal implications. But some people say banks have written off 5 lakh crore of corporate sector debt, so why not farmers? But both the write-offs are bad.The Centre has announced the PM-KISAN scheme under which 6,000 per year will be given to 12 crore small and marginal farmers holding cultivable land up to two hectares. Is this any different from the loan waiver in terms of quality spending?SMD: This is similar but only slightly better than loan waivers, as smaller farmers could also get this amount. Telangana and Odisha have also started such schemes. The amount may not be very high for farmers, but its implementation may be relatively easier as its a direct cash transfer. But its also similar to farm loan waivers and is just a palliative.The Congress had announced farm loan waivers in States like Madhya Pradesh. It has also promised a new law to waive farm loans, a separate farmer budget, and a minimum income support scheme.SMD: In general, I support cash transfers to the poor. Farmers and agricultural labourers face several risks, so some social protection measures are important for an economy which has 90% of the workforce in the unorganised sector. But on the other hand, if you want to remove distress, these are not the solutions. In the NYAY [Nyuntam Aay Yojana] scheme announced by the Congress, its not clear where the money will come from.Loan waivers create a moral hazard for even those willing and able to repay their farm loans, so could this make banks wary of lending to the sector in the future?SMD: The moral hazard is a difficult problem as borrowers dont repay in the hope of a waiver being announced.Dr. Rao, what is your view on farm loan waivers?M. Govinda Rao: This is certainly not a solution. First, it doesnt really help the needy farmers who borrow from moneylenders. Second, it creates a bad credit culture. As we go along, commercial banks will become hesitant to give loans to farmers because from time to time, this particular problem comes up. This is not a good use of taxpayers money. You need to find a solution to the basic problems of farmers. Their distress is real, and on both the supply and demand sides.Do you need to reorient the entire system, from being consumer-oriented to producer-oriented? Whenever you have a problem, you want to protect the consumer with low prices for farm products. When prices rise, you want to import and ban exports. Your support price policy helps only a few crops for which you undertake procurement. That actually distorts the cropping pattern, so even if paddy and sugarcane are water-intensive crops, farmers prefer them as there is some stabilisation in prices. The money that you are using on farm loan waivers and other subsidies, if only you could use it on infrastructure, developing markets and processing and transportation networks, it would be a huge thing. Removing the oligopoly of agricultural markets is important.The government wants to double farm incomes by 2022. Would freeing farm markets from excessive regulation along with some safeguards be a better alternative to multiple state interventions at every step of the farming process?MGR: Exactly. Whichever government is in power, it says it will double farm incomes, put 15 lakh in your account, and all sorts of things. I would consider these as election gimmicks. The details are never worked out. Even if you increase procurement prices, it will be useful only for those crops that the government procures. Many States dont procure most items. Agricultural markets are in very bad shape and marketing reforms are very important as is the removal of middlemen. Many interventions are needed on both the demand and supply side.SMD: Yes, I think market reforms are the biggest change needed. MSP is not a solution, which focuses on cereals like rice and wheat. Dr. Rao is right  very few reforms have taken place in market infrastructure, value chains, logistics, processing and warehousing to boost farmer incomes. We also need a consistent import and export policy, which is lacking, so that farmers can sell their excess produce. For perishables, a different model is needed. Returns are much higher if the same amount of money spent on loan waivers and income support schemes is deployed on things like water and technology, research and extension services.Would you say that institutionally the government is predisposed to such policies as it has a vast bureaucracy built around the agriculture sector? The Agriculture Ministry has multiple joint secretaries. Do we need a reboot of these structures?SMD: Governments generally think short term. When I was in the Agriculture Ministry discussing medium- and long-term solutions, the Minister told me, We are interested in only short-term things. They may talk about other things in normal times, but policies are geared towards short-term goals.MGR: Political parties dont have a long-term view. Immediate solutions that lend themselves to sloganeering are the big issue. Somebody has to come and say, look, my agenda is not to double farm incomes, but these are the reforms I will implement for a better future for farmers. Another issue is the consolidation of holdings. Small farms have become unviable. Farm labourers are not available because of MGNREGA. Many of them have migrated to urban areas in search of work. We need to legally facilitate the consolidation of holdings. Information asymmetry is a big problem too. When the farmer is going to the market with his bullock cart full of produce, he doesnt know what prices he is going to get for his produce. If prices are low, he cant just return as he has to pay rent for the cart and other things, so there is a distress sale as many crops are perishables. We have never thought of this in a comprehensive manner, and unless there is a package of holistic measures, all this talk of doubling farm incomes is meaningless.The Prime Minister has also talked of a pension for farmers.MGR: Giving a minimum basic income deserves to be looked at, but you can do that fiscally only when you get rid of all other subsidies and transfers. The basic issue is the sustainability of a policy measure such as minimum income. The other important thing is farm insurance, which needs to be expanded much more so that farmers are protected from the vagaries of nature.Professor Dev, do you think farm insurance has worked in terms of protecting farmers?SMD: Compared to earlier schemes, the recent farm insurance programme is better, but still many farmers have not benefited because of implementation problems. Its a long way to go. We dont have crop cutting experiments, State governments are not working on it properly when disasters take place. Between subsidies and investments, there is a trade-off  when subsidies increase, investment declines. On old-age pension, there was a scheme that gave 200 a month earlier. State governments have offered 2,000 in some places. Farmers also come under that scheme. I agree basic minimum income can be considered if you remove non-merit subsidies and move fertilizer subsidy to cash transfers as you can save more and improve soil fertility too."

Previously, he was the state health minister. Yet this health sub-centre seldom opens. The project to construct a separate building for it was passed seven years ago, but is yet to take off. Should the Brahmins vote for him? Mishra says.The upper castes are also peeved with Choubey over his love for his native Bhagalpur, where he lived and was an MLA from before being asked to contest from Buxar in 2014.Choubey won from Buxar. He had promised to get an AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) built here, but when the central government agreed to the proposal he got it shifted to Bhagalpur. He is an MP from here, but his heart beats there, says Ramji Ojha of Dumraon.Others say whatever be the deficiencies of Choubey, they will vote for him because they will vote for Modi.Local BJP sources say Choubey, realising he was on a sticky wicket, sent an SOS to Modi to campaign in the constituency for him. Modi obliged, but shouts that the candidate (Choubey) from the constituency needs to be changed were also heard."

A 75-kg bag of paddy that sold at Rs. 1,200, is now priced at Rs. 1,400, which also finds reflection in rice prices.The reason that the Federation of Tamil Nadu Rice Millers and Paddy, Rice Dealers Association attributes for this fall in arrivals is the collection of marketing fee under the Agricultural Marketing Act at places other than marketing committee yards.A.C. Mohan, the federation secretary, said Agriculture Department officials were stopping vehicles from other States and collecting the fee on the roads.They are also visiting mills where farmers are directly selling paddy. The fee is not just for paddy but for all foodgrains and agricultural products, including cotton, he explained.Under the Act, it is mandated that marketing yards with facilities including storage spaces, weighbridges and parking space be provided for farmers.At these points, the produce is weighed and according to the its quality, a fair price is fixed. The government collects 1% of the total sale value, he explained.However, a G.O. issued in February gives powers to the Department to collect the fee wherever it wants. D. Thulasingam, the federation president, said this was unfair.The government does not provide any service like weighing or grading, then why should it collect a fee from a truck carrying paddy say from West Bengal or Andhra Pradesh? They just stop vehicles and collect the fee. These points become checkposts, though under the GST, checkposts and unnecessary taxes and fees were done away with, he said.Official sources in the Agriculture Department said this involved legal issues. We will still look into the demand of the millers, said the official."

Staring at an imminent groundwater crisis, the State government has decided to discourage rice sowing from the upcoming season.The government wants to save water but it seems to be unaware of the ground realities. If the government wants farmers to give up rice and cultivate some other crop then there needs to be a mechanism to purchase the alternative crop at MSP. The State government should enact a law, which guarantees that the produce of farmer is purchased at MSP, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, the Bharatiya Kisan Unions Haryana chief .Farmers will only leave rice cultivation if they are sure of reaping more profit with the alternative crop (maize and tuar), which the government is suggesting. During the last season farmers had faced great difficulties in selling their maize produce in mandis (markets), how can a farmer trust them?, he said.Pilot projectThe Haryana government has decided to start a pilot project from May 27 in seven blocks of Yamunanagar, Ambala, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Jind and Sonipat district, where sowing of maize and 'tuar pulse would be promoted by giving incentives to farmers. The government intends to diversify from non-basmati paddy to maize and pulse.There is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on MSP in the State. Problems like delay in setting up of procurement centres, exploitation at the hands of commission agents (arthiyas), who most of the times buy the produce from farmers below MSP, on one pretext or the other defeats the purpose of MSP. Unless farmers are given an assured market and assured price for their produce, they would continue to suffer, Mr. Chaduni said.In Haryana, under the new scheme, identified farmers will be provided seed free of cost and given a financial assistance for Rs. 2000 per acre in two parts. The maize crop insurance premium of Rs. 766 per hectare will also be borne by the government. Also, maize produce will be procured by government agencies at MSP.Likewise, seeds of tuar will also be provided free of cost to farmers and incentives will also be provided on a similar pattern."

The apex court refused to vacate the stay and has sent notices to the parties, including the Tamil Nadu government.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, despite his partys drubbing in the western belt, including Salem where he hails from, has started talking about the benefits of the project, emphasising that the government will not forcefully take the land away from the occupants of the area. At every opportunity, he reiterates the need for the corridor to fuel growth in the western districts. He seeks cooperation from the farmers and promises them good compensation and consultations before the project is implemented.On the ground, there still seems to be strong resistance to the eight-lane road that will cut through farmlands, ancestral properties, waterbodies and reserve forests in five districts. In Salem, the farmers who were relieved following the High Court stay, have frankly been taken aback. They feel betrayed. The NHAIs move triggered a fresh rounds of protests at different places along the proposed alignment for the road.Farmers fear that the BJP government at the Centre might be taking revenge on them for the partys complete washout in the Lok Sabha polls in Tamil Nadu. Besides, the concern over loss of agricultural lands, green cover and natural resources, other reasons that seem to be spurring the farmers into protests in the region are loss of ancestral property and the fear that the land  their only asset  will be usurped, and low compensation paid.Paramayi, a 70-year-old farmer protesting against the project in Salem, says, We will be losing close to four acres of land. This is our ancestral land and it is the only piece of land we have. We make a living through farming and if this land is lost, what will we do for our livelihood? She has four sons and the land is their only source of income.Another farmer in the area, R. Mohanasundaram, who stands to lose six acres of land for the project, says: We have lost our sleep. The alignment goes through my land. If the road comes up, I will have less than an acre.Stating that the Chief Minister has come up with new reasons to implement the project, the farmers here ask why he, a native of Salem district, has not even bothered to meet them once to explain the benefits of the project. Protesters also argue that the compensation offered is low. The market price for an acre here is between 12-16 lakh, but they fear that the compensation they will get would be less than 10 lakh.Fear of forceIn many places, the protesters also fear that the Central and State governments may use brute force to quell any dissent.Peaceful protests were stifled, unwritten gag orders were promulgated, and police force was used to handle the peaceful protesters who were making a request to spare them and their lands. Only after the court intervened did these high-handed actions subside, reads the Madras High Court order that quashed land acquisition proceedings for the project on April 8.Questioning the feasibility report, time taken to complete it and its legality among other things, the High Court, in its order, said: We are concerned about the innocent people who are not aware of their rights, as they know that they will not be able to survive without their agricultural lands. The nature of attachment to the land is inseparable.The High Court had also ordered that the revenue records that transferred private property as government lands be reversed and restored in the names of the landowners. According to Arul, an activist who is part of the 8-lane Opposition Movement, the survey numbers were locked and no sale can happen. We are collating information on the revenue records, he says.Some hyper-vigilant farmers continue to be suspicious of the State. A fortnight ago, a few of them seized trucks carrying illegally-felled bamboo trees in a forest area along the alignment near Manjavadi in Dharmapuri. They suspect thickets are being cleared to show them as barren areas as and when the environment assessment is carried out.Continued protestsCampaigns against the corridor continue across Tiruvannamalai district as it has the longest stretch of 122 km, starting at Nepathurai village in Chengam taluk and ending in Thethurai village in Cheyyar taluk.What do I know other than agriculture? If cultivable land from farmers like me is taken away for the sake of a road, people in the cities will have to go hungry, says K. Mani, a farmer in Pillur village in Tiruvannamalai district. A portion of his two-acre land has been identified for the project.I raise crops such as paddy and sugarcane, depending on the rain and availability of water. Only if 10 farmers cultivate paddy, rice will be available at lower cost to the people. If five of them lose their livelihood, the cost will go up. We will continue to register our protest, he said.According to Tiruvannamalai district officials, around 859 hectares of land were identified for acquisition. Of this, 712 hectares of private lands and around 125 hectares government lands were identified for acquisition in 79 villages. Of the private lands, nearly 100 hectares were wet land and 612 hectares dry. The project also requires nearly 21 hectares of forest land in Tiruvannamalai district alone.The High Court had made it clear that the grant of environmental clearance would undoubtedly require a thorough study of the area, and before that, a public hearing was needed.In its order, the High Court also referred to remote villages with no motorable roads because the Forest Department would not grant permission to lay a road lest it open the area up to poaching and illegal felling of timber. What would happen if a highway were to pass through a 10-km reserve forest? the court asked.Not on boardStatistics show that nearly one-fourth of the landowners in Tiruvannamalai are opposing the project. Out of the 4,456 landowners (patta holders) in the 79 villages, 1,082 objected to the project, 119 demanded higher compensation, 93 sought employment and 16 requested compensatory land.M. Sivakumar, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Tiruvannamalai, says they held a protest soon after the Chief Minister said that only 7% farmers were opposing the project and that the corridor was necessary.The project should not be taken up. In Tiruvannamalai, it would end up affecting villages in seven of the 12 taluks  Cheyyar, Vandavasi, Chetpet, Arni, Kalasapakkam, Tiruvannamalai and Chengam. In fact, persons will lose their houses in three villages  Narasinganallur, Muthanur and Padiagraharam, he says.S. Abiraman, advocate and chief coordinator of the protest federation, says they were planning to stage an agitation and submit petitions to the special DRO and Collector to implement the Madras High Court direction to restore the lands to the owners within eight weeks.Kancheepuram has not seen any strong protests but farmers here want the governments to drop the project. What is the point of a road if thousands of farmers are going to lose their livelihood? Even schools will be demolished in the process of laying the road, says K. Nehru, Tamil Nadu Vivasiyagal Sanagmam, Kancheepuram district secretary.Aproximately 2,000 acres of land, 110 wells, 200 houses, schools, two graveyards, lakes and ponds will disappear in the district, he says. Revenue officials, though, remain tight-lipped.K. Sriraman of Manalmedu village says he will lose 10 cents of agricultural land and a well. His uncle P. Subramani will also lose two acres of farm land and a well. There is no clarity. We have not been told what the compensation would be. We are not sure what to do if the government takes away the land forcibly, he says.Benefits stressedNHAI officials say the greenfield alignment has many advantages. It will help farmers who produce turmeric, mangoes, bananas and the poultry industry in the western districts and provide them better connectivity to markets.When compared to the present 368.4-km route via Vellore, the proposed road is access-controlled and will have only 5 National Highway and 10 State Highway crossings. The new 277.3-km route will facilitate high-speed traffic. The travel time will be brought down from the present 7 hours to two-and-a-half hours, officials say. Despite the anti-Narendra Modi vote in the Lok Sabha polls in Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK government has managed to survive by winning nine seats in the Assembly bypolls. It looks like it is on course to complete its five-year term. With the Assembly elections scheduled to be held in 2021, public sentiment could well turn against the AIADMK government if it forces projects, especially those on behalf of the Central government, against public will. Any vigorous push for the corridor could just be a tipping point, leading to its ouster in two years time.(Reporting by Vignesh V. in Salem, P.V.

Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy told his Cabinet colleagues that if he gets a whiff of corruption by any of them, they would be dismissed.The Cabinet also consented to launching from October 15 the Rythu Bharosa Scheme to pay Rs 12,500 per farmer per annum as farm investment support. The CM said this should be a government of farmers and this scheme should be implemented successfully. A committee of ministers will supervise the implementation, Information and Public Relations Minister Perni Venkata Ramaiah said.The government decided to set up AP Rythu Commission for development and welfare of farmers. A market stabilisation of agriculture produce fund of Rs 3,000 crore was approved. The CM will be the chairman of the commission, which will have 6 or 7 members including farmer leaders and agricultural experts. Paddy will be procured by the government at minimum support price.AdvertisingIt was decided to implement nine hours of free power supply to farm sector from August.In a bonanza for 4.24 lakh government employees, the government decided to pay 27 per cent interim relief from July 1 with an additional cost of Rs 815 crore. Salary of sanitary workers has been hiked to Rs 18,000 per month.The government proposed to distribute rice packets of 5, 10 and 15 kg by fair price shops at doorsteps from October 2.An education fee regulatory commission is proposed to be set to regulate school and college fee structure and ensure quality of education. Officials said that private schools may be asked to give 25 per cent seats to poor students free of cost. A committee will be appointed to recommend reforms in the education sector."
2019-06-11,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/north-east/tripura-buys-paddy-after-fci-snub/cid/1692176,Tripura buys paddy after FCI snub,"The Tripura government on Monday started procuring 10,000 metric tonnes of paddy at minimum support price (MSP) from the farmers of the state, after the Food Corporation of India (FCI) declined to buy the crop this year.State food and civil supplies minister Manoj Kanti Deb said, Last year, we procured paddy from the states farmers with FCIs support. This year, too, we tried to convince them to buy paddy from our state but they refused to do so. So, we have decided to procure 10,000 MT paddy at Rs 1,750 per quintal on our own.Speaking to The Telegraph, joint director of food and civil supplies Manik Lal Baidya said procurement started from Monday at Sabroom in South Tripura district, Sonamura in Sipahijala district, Teliamura in Khowai district and Udaipur in Gomati district. The rest of the state would be covered in a phased manner.Agriculture department reports say Tripura needs 3 lakh MT of rice every year according to the public distribution system (PDS) requirement. It produces 12 lakh MT paddy annually, including Boro, Aman and Aush crops.Tripura earlier set a 10-year target for food self-sufficiency in 2002-03. The target was not achieved at the time of evaluation in 2012-13. Barely 25,000 MT meat, 12.5 crore eggs and 1.05 MT milk was produced annually at the time. Later, the erstwhile Left Front government set a new target for self-sufficiency in food production by 2020.Shortly after the BJP-led government took charge in March last year, chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb stressed on the importance of achieving self-sufficiency in food production but despite repeated attempts, the government has failed to cut down on its import dependency.The state government still spends Rs 600 crore every year for importing paddy from other states like Punjab and Haryana for PDS since most of the paddy here cant be produced because of lack of milling and procurement facilities.There are only two rice mills in Tripura, which cant process all the paddy produced here and the government cant accept unhusked rice. If seven to eight new rice mills are set up here, they can process the entire paddy and we can procure them directly from here, food and civil supplies minister Deb said.Former horticulture director Baharul Islam Majumder said public procurement is not working out so far since milling charge is very high in Tripura.Baharul is credited with the introduction of the system of rice intensification in the state in 2002 for augmenting production of rice, which significantly increased paddy production in the state."

Veera Raghava Rao has exhorted farmers to take up collective farming, an innovative programme aimed at integrating small and marginal farmers to enhance their farm productivity by double and income by three times.Addressing the first general body meeting of the Parambai and Muduvai Farmers Producers Organisation (FPO) at Paramakudi on Tuesday, he said small and marginal farmers, instead of pursuing farm activities individually in small and fragmented pieces of lands could come together to form Farmers Interest Groups (FIG) and take up collective farming.Under collective farming, farmers could employ advanced technology and focus on mechanised farming by jointly procuring the technology and machineries and double the production, he said. Pointing that individual farmers were forced on distress selling of their produce, he said collective farming would help them to store the produce in godowns, process them and sell at good price.Instead of selling paddy at low price, farmers could convert the paddy into rice and earn additional income, he said. They could also make additional income by adding values to their produce, he suggested. This would be possible when they worked as groups under collective farming, he said.After forming FIGs, farmers could form Farmers Producers Groups (FPG) and FPOs, he said adding there were 760 FIGs, 152 FPGs and 10 FPOs in the district. The FPOs comprised 10 FPGs each or 1,000 farmers, he added.Farmers take up cultivation in 1.70 lakh hectares in the district by cultivating paddy in about 1.20 lakh hectares, chillies in 16,000 hectares, minor millets in 6,500 hectares and oilseeds in 4,000 hectares, he said. As farming depend on successful monsoons and monsoons often failed in the district, farmers should switch over to alternate crops, instead of relying on paddy and suffering losses, he said.Joint Director (Agriculture) L Sorna Manickam, Personal Assistant to Collector (Agriculture) S S Shaiek Abdullah, Joint Registrar, Cooperative Societies P M Murugesan, District Development Manager, NABARD S Mathiazhagan and Lead Bank Manager A Sankaran were present on the occasion."

He asked the prime minister to provide 100 per cent grant for a scheme providing drinking water through tap connection to each household in the state.He said there was a need to put extra efforts at national level to provide drinking water facility to each household similar to the efforts made by the Centre to ensure cent per cent electrification of villages across the country.Referring to recognition of forest rights during the meeting, he said there were several loopholes in the proposed amendment to Indian Forest Act, 1927 and it does not protect the rights of tribals living in forest areas. Baghel emphasised on better amendment.He said that the Centre has launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana to benefit small and marginalized farmers of the country but the scheme does not include farmers as beneficiaries under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. Baghel demanded that these farmers having forest rights should be given Rs 12,000 every year as felicitation amount under the scheme.Referring to the central government's Ujjawala scheme, the chief minister said that number of cylinders being refilled under the scheme is very less. He said that poor families do not have enough money for refilling the cylinders and less number of LPG distributers in remote areas is the main reason behind the less number.He said the share of kerosene for the state should be increased from 1.15 lakh kilo litre to 1.58 lakh kilo litre as BPL families require kerosene for cooking.ALSO READ| Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy meets PM Modi to seek funds in tackling droughtBaghel said annual percentage average of refill cylinders under Ujjawala Yojana in the state is just 1.7, therefore 5 kg cylinders should be made available to each district in the state through oil companies so that use of LPG is assured as per the buying capacity of poor families.During the meeting, he said that premium should be increased for mines allotted for government venture from Rs 100 per tonne to Rs 500 per tonne and the state should also be given a share in electricity generated.He urged the prime minister to bring improvement in several schemes such as crop insurance scheme, food subsidy, problem of allotment in MNREGA, Swacch Bharat Mission (rural), gobar dhan yojana, pradhanmantri awaas yojan (urban) and stand up Indian scheme."
2019-06-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/govt-drought-cover-record-stock-pulses-food-inflation-monsoon-fci-5782717/,Govt has drought cover: a record stock of pulses,"As India stares at the prospect of a sub-par monsoon  cumulative rainfall so far this season (June-September) has been 43 per cent below normal, on top of a 25 per cent deficiency in the pre-monsoon period (March-May)  it can take heart from two things that can significantly combat any threat of food inflation.AdvertisingThe first is the stocks of wheat and rice with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the Central pool. That, at 741.41 lakh tonnes (lt) plus another 120.08 lt of unmilled paddy (equivalent to roughly 80.45 lt of rice) as on June 1, is highest ever level for this date since 2012.It is also nearly twice the normative minimum operational-cum-strategic buffer of 411.20 lt to be maintained at the beginning of July.But what is perhaps more heartening is the large stocks of pulses held by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed). As on June 11, these, on its own account, totalled 27.46 lt  comprising 20.35 lt of chana (chickpea), 3.02 lt of urad (black gram), 1.47 lt of moong (green gram), 1.42 lt of arhar/toor (pigeon-pea) and 1.19 lt of masur (lentil).AdvertisingIn addition, the apex produce marketing cooperative was holding another 13.90 lt as buffer stock on the Centres behalf. That included 7.05 lt of arhar/toor, 2.41 lt of urad, 2.37 lt of chana, 1.43 lt of moong and 0.57 lt of masur.Never before have we had so much of pulses stocks (41 lt-plus) before the beginning of the agricultural year. This should help us comfortably tide over any domestic production shortfall in the event of a poor monsoon, said Sanjeev Kumar Chadha, managing director, Nafed.The prices of pulses went through the roof in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the first two years of the Narendra Modi governments first term, which also witnessed back-to-back droughts. Retail prices of arhar, which scaled Rs 180-200 per kg levels in October 2015, were seen to have contributed to the BJPs defeat in the Bihar Assembly polls that year.Wholesale inflation in pulses has climbed from 2.11 per cent to 18.36 per cent year-on-year between December and May this year. But most pulses, barring arhar/toor, are still trading in mandis at below their official minimum support prices (MSP).Also, unlike five years ago, government agencies have sufficient stocks to allow market intervention. The Modi government, for the first time, in October 2015, decided to create a buffer stock of pulses, initially through imports and later, by domestic procurement.From 2014-15 to 2019-20 (until June 12), aggregate procurement of pulses under the Centres price support scheme and price stabilisation fund programmes, at 87.86 lt, has been more than 12 times the 7.16 lt bought during the preceding 13 years. The bulk of this procurement has taken place after 2016-17 (see table).The stocks that we have built through our MSP-based procurement operations should also enable keeping imports within limits, Chadha said.Indias imports of pulses soared from 36.55 lt in 2013-14 to 66.09 lt in 2016-17. Subsequently, they fell to 56.08 lt in 2017-18, and to 25.30 lt in 2018-19, on the back of increased domestic production and procurement by Central agencies. For the current fiscal, the Centre has imposed quantitative restrictions, limiting annual imports to 2 lt of arhar/toor and 1.5 lt each of urad, moong and peas. Chana imports, too, now attract 60 per cent customs duty.Besides pulses, the Centre is seeking to create a 50,000-tonne buffer stock of onions, which has also recorded a spike in wholesale inflation from minus 63.83 per cent to 15.89 per cent year-on-year between December 2018 and May 2019. Out of the 50,000 tonnes target, Nafed has already procured 46,000 tonnes.On June 11, the Commerce Ministry withdrew the 10 per cent MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) subsidy on onion. The move was intended at discouraging exports of the bulb, which rose from 16.92 lt (valued at Rs 3,359.60 crore) in 2017-18 to 22.04 lt (Rs 3,521.33 crore) in 2018-19.In its first term, the Modi government was very hawkish on food inflation, invoking the Essential Commodities Act to clamp stockholding restrictions on pulses, onion, and sugar, apart from practically banning their exports while permitting unlimited duty-free imports.AdvertisingThe general expectation is that it may be more circumspect in the current term, despite wholesale inflation for food articles shooting up from minus 0.42 per cent to 6.99 per cent between December and May. One reason for this could be that in Maharashtra, which is slated to go to polls in October, the votes of sugarcane, onion and pulses growers may count just as much as those of urban consumers."
2019-06-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/monsoons-drought-water-crisis-marathwada-farmers-crops-narendra-modi-if-the-rains-fail-5783494/,If the rains fail,"Its early days yet, but the prospects of a failed monsoon loom large in the first year of the Narendra Modi governments second term, as in 2014 and 2015. The first half of this month has seen the country receive 43 per cent below-normal rainfall, on top of a 25 per cent deficiency in the pre-monsoon season (March-May). Moreover, Gujarat, Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, coastal Andhra Pradesh and large areas in the Northeast have been experiencing an extended dry spell since the last post-monsoon period (October-December). If current conditions persist  the US Climate Prediction Center has forecast an 81 per cent chance of El Nino, the abnormal warming of the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean waters known to adversely impact rainfall in India, continuing till July and 66 per cent up to August  kharif crop production will take a hit. The agriculture ministrys data already shows a 9 per cent fall in plantings so far this kharif season compared with last years corresponding acreage, with even sharper declines for pulses (51 per cent) and coarse cereals (26 per cent).AdvertisingThere is a difference, though, in the situation now relative to five years ago. In May 2014, retail food inflation was at 8.89 per cent year-on-year. In May 2019, it was only 1.83 per cent, while ruling below general consumer price inflation for an unprecedented 33 months in a row. Also, this time, government agencies are holding huge stocks of not just wheat and rice, but also pulses. While most pulses, barring arhar, are still trading below their minimum support price levels, even the little inflation now building up in many vegetables, milk or poultry products should not ring alarm bells. If anything, they represent a healthy price correction after a prolonged bearish phase in agricultural commodity markets, triggered both by global factors (collapse of exports) and domestic policies (inflation targeting and demonetisation).Given the delayed onset of monsoon and likely rainfall deficit, farmers should be advised to sow short-duration pulses (moong and urad), soyabean, groundnut, sesame, guar and fodder crops, apart from maize and cotton that need less water than paddy or sugarcane. More important, however, is to think beyond the immediate. That would mean freeing up agricultural markets by totally abolishing stocking, movement and export restrictions on produce; giving farmers the freedom to sell their crop to anybody and anywhere; and replacing all input and output subsidies with per-acre direct benefit transfers. The farm sector must no longer be viewed as a source of wage-goods for meeting industrialisation or inflation-targeting goals, but a potent instrument for raising rural incomes and reducing poverty."
2019-06-20,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/slow-monsoon-progress-delays-sowing-of-soyabean-cotton-crops-5789650/,"Slow monsoon progress delays sowing of soyabean, cotton crops","The late arrival of monsoon has delayed the sowing of major kharif crops across the country. While the sowing of cotton has been delayed by two weeks, there has been almost no sowing of soyabean. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said monsoon will arrive in Maharashtra on June 21.AdvertisingThe monsoon has already arrived in parts of south India, like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, but the rest of the country, except parts of east India, is yet to receive rainfall. The IMDs agrimet department has not issued any sowing advisory, though it has asked farmers to prepare the land for sowing.In Maharashtra, barring paddy nurseries in parts of Kolhapur, there has not been any significant sowing of crops. The sowing window for kharif crops like moong and urad is closing fast with farmers likely to divert land for other crops like cotton, tur and soyabean.Atul S Ganatra, president of the Cotton Association of India (CAI), said the delayed sowing of cotton by two weeks will affect seed prices. Kapas (seed cotton) prices will rise after a month, he said. But farmers are more concerned about the possible effect of the delayed sowing on production. While the sowing window of cotton is till July 15, delayed sowing can cause a 20-30 per cent dip in final production, farmers said. Last year, cotton was sown in more than 126 lakh hectares across India, which resulted in production of 337 lakh bales each weighing 170 kg.AdvertisingDelayed monsoon has also resulted in almost no sowing of soyabean, although the area under the oilseed is expected to increase in Maharashtra by 10 per cent. Last year, Maharashtra reported 36.39 lakh hectares of soyabean sowing, while the number was 108 lakh hectares across India.Naresh Goenka, vice-chairman of the Soyabean Processors Association of India (SOPA), said the three important states  Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh  have not reported any sowing. But soyabean is a sturdy crop and late sowing will not have any effect on yield or state of the crop, he said. Farmers of moong and urad, said Goenka, will prefer growing soyabean due to the delayed rains.Soyabean is expected to trade above its government-declared Minimum Support Price of Rs 3,399 per quintal this season. Prices at wholesale markets will be at least Rs 3,400-3,500 per quintal in the next season also, said Goenka.The higher prices, he added, will be mostly because of increased demand from the domestic poultry industry, which has turned towards deoiled cake (DOC) of the oilseed for feed. Millers generally extract 18-12 kg of oil from every 100 kg of bean (1 quintal). The remaining protein rich solid mass and other materials serve as protein source for the animal feed industry. The poultry industry has reverted back to DOC of soya as its protein source given the steep rise in price of other alternatives like DOC of rice bran, cotton seed. We expect the momentum to stay, he said."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityHYDERABAD: There is a lot to cheer about the 45 lakh acres of land to be brought under irrigation through the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP), but there is also more to worry about.Analysts, as well as data from the state government, suggest that Telangana is heading for glut in production of paddy. Government statistics show that paddy production for rabi and kharif seasons together had more than doubled from about 24 lakh metric tonnes in 2014-15 to nearly 54 lakh metric tonnes in 2017-2018. More worryingly, the rabi season of 2018-19 alone saw production of 73 lakh metric tonnes of paddy.As per government estimates, KLIP is set to increase the per acre income of farmers significantly. With lakhs of acres coming under irrigation, it may lead to excessive production of paddy, say experts.One of the main reasons farmers go for paddy cultivation is they get minimum support price (MSP) from the government, payment for which is made within two to three months of procurement. Excessive production means more headache for not just for authorities, but also for the farmers, said Ravi Kanneganti, convener of Rythu Swarajya Vedika.With KLIP set to irrigate land in a phased manner before its completion, experts say there is a general tendency among farmers to immediately take up paddy cultivation when their land comes under irrigation. This is because it is easy for cultivation compared to other crops, and besides, they also get MSP.The crop colonies proposed by the state government are meant to encourage cultivation of diverse and multiple crops. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has also reportedly expressed concern over the KLIP bringing more paddy under cultivation. The government is hoping to increase cotton cultivation as second-biggest crop in the state.Experts and agri scientists pointed out to the excessive use of water by farmers for paddy cultivation, and suggest adoption of better water management methods.Paddy requires more water. Farmers on average use 1,500 litres to produce one kg of paddy, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi had found. Some time back, the institute said that not more than 600 litres is needed for paddy cultivation if proper water management techniques are followed.Like in the country, Telangana also sees 45% of the total irrigation water being used solely for rice cultivation. Experts say that in the long term, excessive use of water results in lower yields, and has adverse environmental effects such as increase in soil salinity and water-logging."

The sector provides livelihood to close to half of Indias population and it is very important for inclusive growth, which also matters for this governments agenda of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. Sometime back, I did a study on how much decline in poverty was witnessed when there was 1% growth in agriculture and 1% growth in non-agriculture. I found that agriculture growth had much more significant impact than non-agriculture growth. We should recognise some of the positive changes that have taken place in the agricultural sector. In the 1970s, we were producing 1 kg of food per person per day  and food here includes not just foodgrains, but also fruits, vegetables, milk etc. At that time, our population was about 56 crore. Now, that has gone up to more than 130 crore, but our per capita food production today is roughly 1.74 kg food per day. This has its own implications, as we are no longer living in scarcity.Why Ramesh Chand?AdvertisingA member of the NITI Aayog, Ramesh Chand is seen as key to the Narendra Modi government driving agriculture sector reforms, especially in its second innings. A farm economist of repute, he has been an advocate of dismantling provisions under the Essential Commodities Act and APMC laws that enable restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports, besides preventing large retailers from buying directly from farmers. These views may find resonance in a context where food inflation and shortages have ceased to be a major worry, with the focus now shifting to addressing agrarian distress and doubling farmers incomesHARISH DAMODARAN: Do you think the Narendra Modi government in its first innings was excessively pro-consumer and not pro-producer?I doubt the government was pro-consumer at the cost of producers. We draw this conclusion only because producer prices have risen at a very low rate after 2014-15, when this government came to power. But agricultural prices historically move in cycles. During 2006 to 2012, there was a sharp increase in global agricultural prices, which fell just around when this government came. In 2012, they were at their peak. But still if one looks at the terms of trade for agriculture  the prices that farmers pay and what prices they receive  these had been improving up to 2015-16. Only in the last two years, the prices paid by farmers have increased at a slightly higher rate compared to the prices received. But overall, the terms of trade figure for 2018-19 is higher than 2011-12 This government has tried hard to keep these prices high with a new formula for fixing MSP (minimum support price) and also through procurement. So it is a combination of factors  international prices, demand and supply cycle  that is responsible for the current agrarian distress. It is very difficult for the government to influence prices beyond a point.AdvertisingHARISH DAMODARAN: As you say, the scarcity of the past is over. Is it time now to scrap the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), export controls and other restrictions that are clearly anti-farmer?The farmer is a consumer too. But I agree, the sectors interest today lies in scrapping these restrictions. In the last (June 15) meeting of the NITI Aayogs Governing Council, we proposed some reforms, including on the ECA, APMC (agricultural produce market committee) reforms and enabling contract farming. The Prime Minister announced that a high-power committee of chief ministers would be constituted to examine these reforms. In 2016, the Union government passed an order, after which there are no real restrictions on food commodities with regards to stocking, movement or exports. But people say that a similar order was issued in 2002, but when prices increased in 2006, the controls were brought back. So they believe that unless the Act changes, the government will always find ways to bring back control if things are seen as going against the consumer. The NITI Aayog has suggested a way out  classifying commodities into two categories: foodstuffs and others. There are some commodities such as drugs where the ECA is needed, but not in case of agri produce. If the ECA has to be used, let us clearly define the conditions. If, say, there is a 20% decline in production because of natural calamity of an extraordinary order, or a war, only then can the provisions be brought back.RAVISH TIWARI: How do you deal with political opposition to these reforms being suggested?The supply situation is much better than in the past. The need for ECA to stop hoarding or black marketing does not arise in the case of most commodities, where even exports are happening. When we meet politicians, we give them examples by asking them if they ever felt the need to have ECA on eggs or milk (which are non-perishable and cannot be hoarded). Price volatility may be extreme in onions, but not in most other commodities. The best way to address volatility is through buffer stocks, not by ECA. Recently, West Bengal, for example, imposed movement controls in potatoes under ECA, but that only did a lot of harm to its farmers. Todays India and its agriculture situation are very different.PRABHUDATTA MISHRA: How does the NITI Aayog plan to make MSP more effective on the ground?Everybody wants only the Centre to act. But agriculture is a state subject. It can only be the joint responsibility of the Centre and the states. The total production of all commodities where MSPs exist will be about 300 million tonnes. If the Centre is taking care of rice and wheat, whose production is about 200 million tonnes, cant all the states combined take care of the remaining one-third production? Under PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan), states were given the option to implement MSP by procuring up to 30 per cent of the produce (similar to what the Centre is doing for rice and wheat). If in the process of procurement and disposal, the states incurred a loss, the Centre would bear it up to 30-35%. But the states did this only at a very small level. When the financial cost is being borne by the Central government, the states should come forward and take advantage of PM-AASHA by putting in place a procurement mechanism.HARISH DAMODARAN: But instead of physical procurement, why cant we have direct benefit transfer and simply pay the difference between MSP and market prices into farmers accounts?The NITI Aayog has suggested this as well. If you take the MSP of wheat today, it is actually 30% higher than the international price. So if you procure wheat at MSP, you will only distort the market and exports will be hit, as domestic price is very high. Stocks, too, will pile. Direct benefit transfer is a very good idea and under PM-AASHA, we have the option of physical procurement as well as provision of deficiency price payments. In this case, we dont have to look at the price received by each and every farmer. Farmers just have to register the area they are sowing under different crops before the seasons start on a portal. For every state, the harvest season is defined. So, at the end of the season, we monitor the actual price received by farmers in every district. Every district has 3-4 mandis. We take the average price at these mandis for the produce of Fair Average Quality. If that price is lower than the MSP, the difference can be paid for the area that has been reported by the farmer on the portal and taking the average yield for the crop in the district. I think the Madhya Pradesh governments Bhavantar programme, despite the criticism it faced from some economists, was a good initiative. Today, the Food Corporation of India incurs a cost of Rs 700-800 per quintal in the process of paying Rs 1,600 as MSP to farmers. That can be avoided through direct payment of the price difference.PRASANTA SAHU: Following the implementation of PM-KISAN, should the government now use this scheme to replace fertiliser and other input subsidies to farmers?Income support and subsidies are two different things. PM-KISAN is the former. Subsidy was originally meant to promote the use of a particular input to ensure increase in productivity. When Dr C Rangarajan was the chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council (2009-2014), he asked me to find out the impact on the countrys food security and agriculture production if fertiliser subsidy was completely withdrawn and it was sold at market price. At that time, I calculated that if we do it suddenly in a knee-jerk manner, there will be 10% decline in foodgrain production. I look at PM-KISAN in a different way. It was brought in as some sort of income support, as crop prices remained low, and farmers in many places could not get the MSP. Subsidies are a different issue and they exist in many countries. We must try to make subsidies more efficient than they currently are. Subsidies in water and power are serious issues and must be addressed. Agricultural power subsidy for the country as a whole is about Rs 1 lakh crore. We did calculations to find how many irrigations a farmer would apply in case he is charged for power or if he is not charged anything. They will use 40% less irrigation on paddy alone if power is fully priced. Also in most cases, the yield will not fall.SANDEEP SINGH: Rural consumption is slowing down. The government had talked of doubling farmers income. Where are we on that?It is not proper to use agriculture and rural synonymously today. In rural India, only one-third of the income now comes from agriculture and two-third from non-agricultural activities. The last five years have been unique. For the first time in 65 to 70 years, we have had five consecutive years of less than average rainfall and the current one could even be the sixth. But Despite that, the annual growth rate of the value added in agriculture has been 2.9%, which is not bad. If growth rate becomes 5%, prices will crash and farmer incomes may decline by 30-40%. The slowdown in rural demand may be due to many reasons. One of it could be that loan waivers have reduced the flow of bank credit to rural areas. Industry people were happy when rural demand was good. But much of this demand was debt-based, with people taking loans to buy commodities. But families dont have internal income to buy resources. As far as agriculture is concerned, for doubling farmers income, you need it to rise by over 10% every year. In the last three years, the growth rate, according to my calculation, has been 6%. We can still achieve the target if we are able to do something to prices. If farmers get 10% more than what they are getting, the income elasticity with respect to price would be 1.6. Then, farmers incomes will increase by 16%.RAVISH TIWARI: How can we improve the current level of private and public investment in the agriculture sector?If you look at public investment in agriculture as percentage of the GDP, the latest available data for 2016-17 shows it at 2.35%. For most of the recent period, it was 3%. Almost 85% of public investment in agriculture comes from the states. The Centre invests about 15% and that includes investment on irrigation and agriculture technology. Within private investment, the bulk of it comes from farmers themselves. If investment has to go up, that should now come from the corporate sector, which is currently very low. That is why the Prime Minister said last week in Parliament that corporates should not only see investments in agriculture in terms of making and selling tractors. They should make investments in agriculture, including in backend extension and working directly with farmers. This government wants to create an enabling environment for corporates to invest in agriculture. That will also require making changes in the regulatory environment, particularly facilitating contract farming.RAVISH TIWARI: The private sector can invest in technology. But given the kind of protests against GM technology, how can the private sector be confident about investing?GM technology is not the only technology through which countries have made progress in agriculture. There is public sensitivity about GM technology. But the biggest damage was done when Jairam Ramesh (former environment minister) took the issue of whether GM technology should be adopted to the streets and not leaving it to be decided by an expert body. On GM crops, the NITI Aayogs stance has been  there should not be a blanket ban on the technology. It should not be encouraged in areas where we are able to get success through conventional means. The other thing that we emphasised was to finance public sector research in GM technology in a big way. This was mainly to allay the fears of people that private sector developers were charging hefty royalty. Some of our public sector research institutions were very close to developing a GM chickpea. Moreover, there are many more opportunities for the private sector other than GM. That includes GE or gene editing, which is different from modification (through introduction of alien genes).RAVISH TIWARI: Cattle trade rules enforced two years back disrupted the market. Do such rules help farmers or create trouble for them?AdvertisingThe livestock sector grew by more than 6% in the last five years. If there were so many problems, it would not have been growing so fast. On the other hand, the crop sector, particularly cereal, oilseeds and pulses, is growing at just around 1.15%. This is why the overall agricultural growth rate comes down to 2.9%. But on the whole, I would say that Indian agriculture has now reached a stage where more the intervention by government, the lower will be the growth. The more the sector is liberalised, the higher will be the growth rate."
2019-07-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cabinet-announces-minimum-support-price-of-14-kharif-crops-5813777/,Cabinet announces minimum support price of 14 Kharif crops,"Even as the slow movement of the monsoon has drastically affected the Kharif crops sowed by farmers across the country the Union Cabinet on Wednesday announced a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of 14 Kharif crops.AdvertisingThe MSP hike, the first since the government was re-elected earlier this year, pales significantly when compared to increase in the last Kharif season, just before the general elections this April. The quantum of increase however, does not significantly deviate with the increase in non-election years.This year, for paddy  the countrys main Kharif crop  the new MSP is Rs 65 per quintal more compared to last year.The MSP of rice, which was bought by Central and state governments last year at Rs 1,750-1,770 per quintal last year, has increased by Rs 65 this year to Rs 1,815-1,835. The crop, on an average, is sown in more than 40 per cent of the total area covered by the rest of the crops named for the MSP hike on Wednesday.AdvertisingThe new MSPs stood at Rs 2,550-2570 for Jowar, Rs 200 for Bajra, Rs 3,150 for Ragi, Rs 1,760 for Maize, Rs 5,800 for Tur (Arhar), Rs 7,050 for Moong and Rs 5,700 for Urad. The MSP for cotton is now Rs 5150-5450 per quintal. Among oilseeds the MSPs for Groundnut, Sunflower seed, Soyabean, Sesamum and Nigerseed are Rs 5,090, Rs 5,650, Rs 3,710, Rs 6,485 and Rs 5,940 per quintal respectively.In 2018 the MSPs for Ragi, Jowar, Bajra and Maize had jumped by 57 per cent, 42.9 percent, 36.8 per cent and 19.2 per cent respectively when compared to 2017.Data from the agriculture ministry, which was published on June 28, also indicated that sowing of Kharif crops has been slower compared to the average for the corresponding week. The data shows that rice, normally grown in 35.54 lakh hectares during this time, has only been sown in 27.09 lakh hectares  a dip of roughly 24 per cent. Similarly, the sowing area for Jowar fell by less than half from 2.37 lakh hectares to 1.11 lakh hectares. The slowest crop however, was Soybean, sown in just 2.75 lakh hectares  barely a fifth of the total area it normally covers.Apart from a delayed monsoon, the country also witnessed a 32.8 per cent deficient rainfall for the month of June. But according to the India Meteorological Department, monsoons will be better in July and August."

Also, 28 godowns with a storage capacity of 36,000MT will be set up in several places at Rs 59.4 crore.Asbestos roofs in godowns will be replaced with modern roofs and new concrete roads would be laid. These will cost Rs 76.09 crore.A solar-powered cold storage facility with a capacity of 1,000MT will be set up at Palacode in Dharmapuri district to help farmers store vegetables, fruits, tamarind, dal, flowers and farm produce. As many as 125 buildings would be built for cooperative institutions to offer the best service for the customers, Palaniswami said.That apart, 143 institutions will be modernised. The headquarters of Chennai Central Cooperative Bank will be modernised at Rs 8.88 crore.The chief minister said the state government would set up five district consumer cooperative wholesale stores in Ariyalur, Pudukkottai, Theni, Kanyakumari and Krishnagiri zones to offer essential commodities at a fair price.Amma mini cooperative supermarkets, a new initiative for the benefit of family card holders, were set up in 103 fair price shops. The shops sell 300 products at 5% lesser than the maximum retail price. The scheme will be expanded by setting up 582 more shops, the CM said.The cooperation department will set up three godowns with a capacity of 36,500MT."

The area under maize has already increased by 16% as compared to last kharif season, at a time when sowing is still underway.AdvertisingKharif season is considered the main season in Punjab for sowing maize. Last year, 1.08 lakh hectares area was under maize and this year, till July 8, the area touched 1.25 lakh hectares (a surplus of 17,000 hectares or 41,990 acres). This is one of the highest in the past three years. The state government is planning to achieve a target of 2.20 lakh hectares under maize.Farmers got good rates for their spring maize at Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,200 per quintal, which is much above the rate fixed by the government last year (Rs 1,700/quintal). This has also encouraged them to go for kharif maize, said Director, Department of Agriculture, Punjab Dr Sutantra Kumar Airy, adding that increasing the area under maize is much needed in Punjab to decrease area under the water-guzzling paddy crop.Maize needs much less water as compared to paddy while the income from both crops is almost same  between Rs 52,000 to 55,000 per acre at fixed price. The MSP of paddy is Rs 1,815 per quintal this year while maize is at Rs 1,700 per quintal. The yield of paddy is 28 to 30 per quintals per acre, the yield of maize is 25 to 26 quintals.AdvertisingAround 16 Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) recommended varieties are being sown in Punjab. A farmer needs 8 kg seed per acre, which yields 25 to 26 quintals of moist grain, which needs to be dried before selling.Currently, Hoshiarpur district is leading with 62,800 hectares under maize, following by the Ropar district with 16,800 hectares.We had earlier fixed a target to bring 1.60 lakh hectares under maize this year but now, our target is 2.20 lakh hectares, out of which we have already achieved 56%, said Airy, adding that sowing will continued for another 10 days.To promote micro irrigation technique, 1,000 acres of maize is being cultivated under drip irrigation in Punjab this year. Secretary, Punjab Agriculture, Kahan Singh Pannu said that drip irrigation would not only conserve water but also increase yield. He said that out of 1,000 acres of maize to be brought under drip irrigation, 900 acres shall be on surface-based drip system while 100 acres shall be under sub-surface based drip system. Preference is being given to farmers who are diversifying from paddy crop.Pannu further said that in a first, a pilot campaign of micro irrigation on cotton was also undertaken by the soil conservation department this season, under which 200 acres of cotton crop has been brought under drip irrigation, which will be regularly monitored by departments and scientists.Under the New Diversification policy launched in 2013 for kharif season, the then SAD-BJP government had envisioned bringing around 5.50 lakh hectares under maize by 2017 across the state by decreasing paddy (parmal rice) area from 25 lakh hectares to 19 lakh hectares. However, data sourced from the Punjab agriculture department showed that Punjab was nowhere close to this figure and the maximum area under maize during the tenure of the previous government was 1.65 lakh hectares in 2015-16. After that, there was a continuous declined till 2018, when it was 1.08 lakh hectares.We are happy to diversify from paddy to maize if we get good rates like this year but there should be some system so that the prices do not fluctuate so much as its difficult for farmers to bear variations, said Jasbir Singh, a farmer from Khuradpur village in Jalandhar, adding that last year. He added that last year, he had sold his crop at the rate of Rs 800 to 900 per quintal, while this year the rate was around Rs 2,000 per quintal.Farmers go for paddy just because of its assured market, if the same happens to the maize crop, farmers will automatically go for it as no one wants to play with groundwater, said another farmer, Kartar Singh of Haripur village."
2019-07-16,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/farmers-urged-to-go-for-alternative-crops/article28493527.ece,Farmers urged to go for alternative crops,"G.S.G. Ayyangar, Special Officer from the Centres Jal Shakti Abhiyan, has appealed to the farmers to look at alternatives to mango crop, such as guava, jamun, sapota and pomegranate, apart from employing drip irrigation to save every drop of water.The official visited Pulicherla and Ramachandrapuram mandals during his current tour of Chittoor district. At Anuppalle village, located 15 km southwest of Tirupati, he inspected the farm pond developed with 2.14 lakh by a farmer Nagi Reddy. With low rainfall, the farmer manages to grow mango and sapota with the help of drip system, thus getting better yield with low water utilisation.His farm pond has helped in recharge of borewells in the vicinity. The official inspected another farm pond measuring 20m x 20m in the nearby forest area abutting Gokulapuram, which provides water to animals and birds, besides helping groundwater recharge. Farmer Mohan Reddy, who employs drip irrigation to wet his 350 Benisha mango trees in his five-acre farm, admitted to have seen a quantum leap in profit from 70,000 last year to 1.50 lakh this year.Farm pondsAddressing the farmers later, Mr. Ayyangar laid emphasis on using less groundwater to achieve higher yield. Chittoor district has a record of digging 1.06 lakh farm ponds and plans are afoot to develop another one lakh in the future, he said. With every farmer going in for mango orchards, the prices have plummeted due to oversupply, observed District Collector N. Bharat Gupta, who also advised the farmers to go for alternative horticultural crops, which of late are in great demand. He offered to supply these saplings under MGNREGA and asked every household to dig rainwater harvesting pit to conserve the running water.Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Ayyangar said the farmers need to be educated on growing alternative crops, which would go a long way in increasing revenue.SRI methodGrowing paddy in System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and similar method in sugarcane will bring down water usage. Growing multiple horticultural crops will also help, he said, adding that a three-year programme would be developed to improve groundwater situation in the state.Mr. Ayyangar later held a review meeting in Chittoor on his observations over the last two days and will visit Nindra mandal on Wednesday.Project Directors Naga Raju (DWMA) and Y. Vidyashankar (APMIP), DWMA Assistant Project Director Srinivasa Prasad, RWS Superintending Engineer Venu, Joint Director (Sericulture) Aruna Kumari, Deputy Directors Saraswati (Horticulture) and Sankaraiah (Groundwater) took part."
2019-07-23,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-constituency-then-state-nation/story-6ZrWdYrzqWouzvAVUERwlJ.html,"'First constituency, then state, nation'","D Ravikumar often jokes that his political journey began when he was six.In his first month as a Class 1 student in Tamil Nadus Nagapattinam district, Ravikumar met a passionate teacher who taught Tamil. As a young Ravikumar struggled to master the difficult alphabet, his teacher, Kanniyan, used rationalist ideology to get through to his student. He taught me to write There is no God. Those were the first words I wrote, he said, laughing.It was the late 1960s and Tamil Nadu was ablaze with protests against the central governments imposition of Hindi language and the rationalist movement.His parents were marginal farmers, and Ravikumar spent five hours every day on a train getting to school and back, reading books in Tamil his teacher had suggested. Politics was becoming a part of me, said the 58-year-old first-time MP from Viluppuram.By the time he graduated high school and entered Annamalai University, Ravikumar had read Karl Marx and BR Ambedkar, and slowly drifted towards the Left parties. But after I joined them, I was disappointed. I saw they had no clear idea of what caste was, he said.Stung by the leftists vacillation towards caste, Ravikumar started working with human rights groups, and by the early 1990s, established himself as an activist. His work anchored him to the northern parts of the state where several caste atrocities had flared up. It is here that he met Thol Thirumavalavan, a lawyer who was part of the Dalit Panthers and had started the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), a party focused on the uplift of Dalits and other marginalised sections. At the time, the VCK boycotted polls because it believed the electoral system was stacked against the lower castes, but formally entered electoral politics in 1999. I persuaded them to participate. My experience taught me that Dalit people get some rights through electoral politics, he said. Despite rising to the position of general secretary of the party, Ravikumar was a reluctant politician and preferred his books and poetry  he co-founded the noted publishing firm, Navayana, in 2003  to the grime and uncertainty of campaigning.His election to the Tamil Nadu assembly from Kattumannarkoil in 2006 began with a sleight of hand by his party chief, who proposed his name without checking with Ravikumar. I told him I was not comfortable with elections, he said.Comfort zoneThe past month has been a whirlwind for the writer-turned-politician who won from the constituency reserved for scheduled castes (SC) with a margin of almost 130,000 votes. His party, VCK, was part of the DMK-led opposition alliance and he fought on the Dravidian giants popular rising sun symbol.Operating from a room crammed with papers and books in Delhis Tamil Nadu Bhavan, the MP has made interventions in Parliament on subjects as diverse as dam management in southern India, scholarships for Dalit and adivasi students and the data protection regime.The legislative arena is his comfort zone, he confessed, and the reason he waded through the uncomfortable process of electioneering at the height of summer this year. I have a more broad-based agenda. From Day 1, I concentrated on national issues, he added.Ten days after his swearing in  which he insisted on doing in Tamil  Ravikumar introduced a private members bill on data protection and privacy. He followed up with seven questions in the Lok Sabha on topics ranging from the delayed publishing of National Crime Records Bureau to crop support prices.He also met finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, to press her on increasing allocation for SC-ST communities and an airport in his constituency.Most of Ravikumars legislative prowess comes from his stint as an MLA, when he was crucial in pushing through an e-waste policy and played a key role in setting up six government welfare boards, including one for transgender people. He runs a Tamil research journal, Manarkeni,and spends his free time reading and translating French philosophers, Michael Foucault and Jean Baudrillard, and postcolonial icon, Edward Said, to Tamil.The long hours in the Lok Sabha has forced Ravikumar to cut back on literary pursuits, and his only moments of unwinding have been a trip to the Qutub Minar and watching the ICC cricket World Cup final, in which he supported New Zealand.From education to airportSituated in the northern Tamil Nadu, Viluppuram is ravaged by an agricultural crisis and water shortage.Half of the land in the district is used for farming and the region is known as the rice and sugar bowl of the state.But three consecutive poor monsoons have robbed farmers of their income. Middlemen are making syndicates and procuring paddy at a low cost from us, said L Ramasamy, a farmer. This year, the rainfall has fallen short of the average mark by 50%, and groundwater levels have plunged. De-silting work was not done properly, so Viluppuram is facing a severe water scarcity, said Ravi Karthikeyan, a resident.Ravikumar also has his work cut out in education and industries, especially for the impoverished Irular tribe but says he is up for the challenge. I have three [areas of] focus: first constituency; second state; and third nation. I have already pushed for an airport, and a desalination plant to ease the water crisis, he said. He has instituted a scholarship for SC-ST women students, and ordered that a hostel be built for them. The problem area of agriculture, he admits, is too big an area for an MP to resolve. But I plan to invite experts to sensitise farmers about modern methods and making farming viable.Annihilation of casteTo the outsider, Tamil Nadu presents a paradox. The state is the fountainhead of the rationalist movement that sought to end Brahmanical domination. And yet, it leads the nation in sanitation worker deaths, and cases of caste-based atrocities are prevalent.Tamil Nadu is very casteist in character. Caste is the main thing in everyday life, Ravikumar said. He reasons this held a lesson for the two main Dravidian parties, who need to accommodate marginalised sections, and follow the teachings of Periyar and Ambedkar.Viluppuram has a history of caste discrimination and the politician himself faced hostility from the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) during the campaign. The PMK, controlled by the dominant Vanniyars, sought to polarise the electorate along the lines of caste and project Ravikumar as only a leader of Dalits.Despite having a large following, our leader Thirumavalan, who fought on our own symbol, won by just 3400 votes. It shows the lack of acceptance for independent Dalit leaders, he reasoned.Ravikumar worries about the governments approach towards Dalits, and says vocational and skill-based training will push the marginalised community towards traditional occupations. Why cant you push Dalits in artificial intelligence? His dream is for the complete annihilation of caste, when Dalits will not need a party to espouse their case. Dalits want to read philosophy but society forces us to read data of killings. When will this end?First Published: Jul 23, 2019 08:56 IST"

The restriction has been imposed in block 47 and 48, according to a Revenue Department official.Before the registration of land, owners should get permission from the Devikulam Revenue Divisional Office (RDO), said an official.Large swathes of sugar cane farms were filled by the land mafia and were being resold as plots at high prices misusing the exemption of rules on conversion of land given to farmers to construct houses.The sugar cane fields in Marayur were once paddy fields. Large-scale land filling was reported from Sahayagiri, Kudavayal, Indira Nagar, Pattom Colony, Meladi and Puthuchivayal.In May, District Collector H. Dinesan visited the area following media reports about large-scale land-filling and asked the Subcollector to give a report in this regard. Following the visit, Mr. Dinesan cancelled the mutation of land reclaimed for reselling in Marayur and Kanthalloor region.The famous Marayur Jaggery recently received Geographical Indication (GI tag) from the Central government. It was pointed out that land filling would adversely affect jaggery production in the region.Eco-sensitive areaIn addition, Marayur is a rain-shadow region and an ecologically sensitive area in the eastern side of the Western Ghats. It was pointed out that land-filling would affect water availability and traditional farming in the area.Once known as the rice bowl of Idukki, farmers in the region shifted to sugar cane cultivation after the depletion of groundwater level."

The CM emphasised on welfare schemes for tribals and paddy farmers, announcing a bonus of Rs 500 per quintal for paddy.AdvertisingAt Navegaon Bandh in Arjuni taluka of Gondia district, Fadnavis stepped out of his rath into the open, setting aside his security ring, and walked into a village tea stall called Yatharth Raj. The chief minister settled for a cup of sugarless tea and was accompanied by adivasi children, who encircled him for a chat.With his act, Fadnavis appears to have conveyed a message of all is well in the Naxal belt. However, his visit to the Naxal corridor, passing through long stretches of dense forest, came less than 24 hours after Naxals allegedly killed six persons in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, just across the border.Amid tight security, the CMs visit ended with a dozen rallies and roadshows. Standing in the open rath, Fadnavis interacted with people across villages and towns. Taking forward his agenda of socio-economic development, he emphasised on welfare schemes for tribals and paddy farmers. Paddy is the main kharif crop in the districts of Gondia, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur and Bhandara, also known as the rice bowl of the state.AdvertisingAt each rally, the chief minister stressed on higher remuneration for paddy farmers. Fadnavis said, In the last five years, we have ensured a higher bonus and minimum support price for paddy. We will give a bonus of Rs 500 next year too.He said the government had invested Rs 50,000 crore for farmers in five years, which comes to Rs 10,000 crore per year. Whether it was Wadsa Desai gang in Gadchiroli or Brahmapuri in Chandrapur, the CM talked about how tribal reforms in agriculture and education were transforming livelihoods.Fadnavis also unveiled the government developmental plan worth Rs 1 lakh crore for transformation of the Naxal corridor. He said almost 30,000 km of roads were built, including 25 per cent in the Naxal belt. For better education of adivasis, the government had launched welfare schemes in English medium as well as tribal residential schools, he added.Late into the night, the CM addressed a large crowd at Gadchiroli. Fadnavis has visited Gadchiroli 11 times in the last five years.He said, I have adopted a human approach centred on development in the Naxal belt. The primary reason of frequent visits to Gadchiroli was to fast-track development. The overwhelming support from people in Gadchiroli makes me nostalgic. Our new industrial policy has focused on incentives to promote industrial investments."
2019-08-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/plant-protection-the-next-blockbuster-basmati-crop-5906430/,Plant protection: The next blockbuster basmati,"Onkar Singh has been cultivating Pusa-1121  the basmati variety that, till recently, accounted for nearly three-fourths of Indias exports of the aromatic rice ($ 4.71 billion in 2018-19)  since 2008.AdvertisingThis year, the 53-year-old from Majitha village in the same tehsil of Amritsar district, has slashed his Pusa-1121 acreage to two acres, from 10 acres in 2018. Simultaneously, his area under Pusa-1718, a new improved basmati bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi, has expanded five-fold to 10 acres.Pusa-1718 is essentially Pusa-1121, which they (scientists) have made more disease-resistant. You dont need to spray any pesticides now. I tried it out first last year and got an average paddy yield of 23 quintals per acre, against 18-20 quintals from Pusa-1121. Also, the crop tillered better (more side stems produced from the initial parent shoot), says Onkar, who grows the short-duration Pusa-1509 basmati variety on the remaining 33 acres of his total 45-acre holding.Onkar Singh farms only basmati paddy, which has no assured government procurement at minimum support prices (MSP). Pusa-1509 matures in just 115-120 days, from the date of nursery sowing to harvesting. I can transplant it from June 10 to June 25 and harvest between mid-September and early-October. It gives the flexibility, then, to plant matar (pea) in September and potato in October for harvesting by late-November/early-December. There is time to sow wheat, winter maize or ajwain (celery) even after that, he explains.AdvertisingPusa-1121 is a longer-duration basmati (140-145 days, seed to grain), mostly transplanted during June 10 to July-end for harvesting towards October-end and mid-November. It leaves scope only to sow wheat. Yields, too, are lower than the 24-28 quintal/acre from Pusa-1509. The only advantage is price. Last year, I got Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal for Pusa-1121, whereas Pusa-1509 paddy fetched Rs 2,600-3,000, he adds.This is where the new variety could make a difference.Pusa-1121 was susceptible to bacterial blight. We have basically made it resistant to the pathogen by introducing two genes Xa21 and xa13, derived from a wild rice species (Oryza longistaminata) and a traditional land race (BJ1), respectively. The resultant variety (Pusa-1718) also possesses a non-lodging habit from a strong culm (stem). It is, hence, less prone to falling and can withstand heavy rain or water-logging better than Pusa-1121, A.K. Singh, head of IARIs Division of Genetics, tells The Indian Express.Davinder Singh (30), of Khabba Rajputan village in Tarn Taran district and tehsil, agrees. This farmer has dedicated 20 acres to Pusa-1718 in the current season, from last years two acres, while halving it from 40 acres to 20 acres for Pusa-1121.I did it after seeing how the new variety stood tall, despite being submerged under water for a week after incessant rains in September 22-24. And my yield was 27 quintals/acre, compared to 18-19 quintals of Pusa-1121, states Davinder, whose total 150-acre holding also includes 50 acres each under Pusa-1509 and non-basmati paddy varieties, and 10 acres of other crops (maize, vegetables and pulses).Onkar and Davinder Singh are both bullish on Pusa-1718, which also matures 10 days earlier than Pusa-1121. The traders are paying Rs 200-300/quintal lower for the new variety, just as they once tried to beat down the price of Pusa-1509. But the grain quality of Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1718 is just the same, claims Onkar.According to Davinder, the economics of basmati cultivation today is superior to non-basmati. A yield of 25 quintals/acre from Pusa-1509 and Pusa-1718, at an average Rs 3,000/quintal rate, gives more return than from non-basmati varieties even at a guaranteed MSP of Rs 1,835/quintal on 34-35 quintals/acre. Progressive farmers like him are able to harvest high yields through practices such as incorporating crop stubble into the soil (rather than burning) and applying farm yard manure, in addition to granular sulphur and other secondary nutrients.Talwinder Singh of Nauli village in Jalandhar district/tehsil is growing Pusa-1718 on three of his nine acres this time. Amarjit Singh from Viram in Amritsars Majitha tehsil has, likewise, halved his Pusa-1121 area to five acres, while planting Pusa-1718 on five and Pusa-1509 on his balance 18 acres. Both have cited the same reasons  better disease resistance, less lodging-prone and more tillering ability.Farmers in Punjab have sown a total basmati area of 6.29 lakh hectares (lh) this kharif season, 1.92 lh more than last year, while bringing it down under non-basmati varieties from 26.66 lh to 22.91 lh. They have also stepped up cotton acreage from 2.67 lh to 3.91 lh. The reduced non-basmati area would mean less pressure on government procurement agencies. Within basmati, a significant switch from Pusa-1121 to Pusa-1718 has taken place. G.S. Bal, chief agricultural officer of Amritsar, estimates the new variety to cover 30-35% of the districts basmati area of 1.39 lh this time.Increased planting, of course, comes with price risk. Farmer realisations have been good in the last couple of years due to a rebound in basmati exports (see table). The value of shipments have marginally slipped during April-June ($ 1,255 million versus $ 1,285 million in the same quarter of 2018-19), with the payment problems in Iran adding to the uncertainty.One way to protect the countrys export interests is by preserving basmatis premium quality attributes  aroma, long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking and fluffiness  and minimising use of chemical pesticides. The Punjab government, last month, issued an advisory to farmers not to spray formulations of five insecticides (acephate, thiamethoxam, triazophos, buprofezin and carbofuran) and four fungicides (tricyclazole, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim and propiconazole).An alternative approach to pesticide application is to breed for disease resistance. This is what IARI scientists have sought to do through transfer of specific disease-resistance genes, from landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy, into existing high-yielding basmati varieties. Pusa-1718 is a result of such marker-assisted backcross breeding, which helps avoid use of streptomycin or tetracycline combinations to control bacterial blight.A similar variety Pusa-1637 has been bred by incorporating a Pi9 gene, sourced from Oryza minuta (a wild relative of the normal cultivated Oryza sativa paddy), into the popular Pusa Basmati-1. This gene provides high-to-moderate resistance against leaf and neck blast, obviating the need to spray fungicides such as tricyclazole, azoxystrobin and picoxystrobin.AdvertisingVijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters Association, feels Pusa-1718 is a good variety. But he emphasises that farmers should not put all their eggs in a single variety, while advocating tough action against companies aggressively marketing pesticides. So long as an insects population is below the economic threshold level  at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest  there is no need to spray at all, he points out."
2019-08-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sustainable-agriculture-going-beyond-soil-health-cards-5906464/,Sustainable agriculture: Going beyond Soil Health Cards,"Agriculture supports roughly half of Indias population and is the key to its food security. We have, indeed, avoided the spectre of food shortages, thanks to our farmers increasing production using modern inputs and technology developed by agriculture scientists. But there has been a collateral cost to this  in the form of overexploitation of our natural resources, especially soil and water  which has brought issues of sustainability to the fore.AdvertisingTo my mind, three pertinent issues relating to sustainable agriculture need addressing. The first is falling groundwater tables on which the Prime Minister himself has recently focussed attention. The second is the depleting organic matter content in our soils. The third one is a much broader concern of climate change; its impact on monsoon rainfall vagaries or temperature spikes during the cropping season doesnt require elaboration.This articles focus is limited to the second issue. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is extremely important for agriculture. About 58% of organic matter mass exists in the form of carbon. The percentage of organic matter in the soil can, thus, be estimated by simply multiplying the SOC% by a conversion factor of 1.72 (100/58). While farmers may apply urea or di-ammonium phosphate, adequate SOC levels is what makes the nitrogen and phosphorous from these chemical fertilisers bio-available to crops. Organic matter is also the source of food for the microorganisms that help increase the porosity and aeration of soils. The soils moisture holding capacity, too, goes up with higher carbon levels, thereby reducing water runoff.Simply put, SOC levels have direct correlation with soil productivity and, by extension, sustainability of agriculture. There is a link to climate change as well: Atmospheric carbon dioxide is stored in the form of SOC through the process of absorption in crop production and plant residue retention in soil. This sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide can, indeed, be a powerful mitigating measure for climate change.AdvertisingBut in the last four years, based on sample testing results under the Centres Soil Health Card Scheme, the picture emerging isnt all that encouraging, with SOC levels found to be very low in most parts of India. The soils in temperate climates have better carbon levels. It is quite the opposite in hot and tropical atmospheric areas such as ours, where the soils tend to lose carbon through decomposition (mineralisation) of plant residues. Rising temperatures from climate change further aggravates the situation.SOC levels matter can be raised through higher retention of farm residue and adding organic matter from outside. How can these be done?The first step is proper crop selection. Plants, we know, take atmospheric carbon dioxide and convert it into food through photosynthesis process. Ideally, only crops producing more aboveground and root mass  which contribute to long-term productivity by enhancing soil organic matter  should be grown. But farmers, being rational economic agents, will go only for crops that give higher and assured returns, even if in the short run. A change in cropping patterns, to ensure high SOC and long-term productivity, will not take place unless the desired alternative crops are remunerative. It calls for appropriate policy intervention, including encouragement to set up agri-processing units for such crops, which will, in turn, make it profitable for farmers to grow them.Second, even the aboveground mass remaining after harvesting of the grain and dried stalks needed for fodder should be returned to the soil as much as possible. This requires scientific crop residue management. Burning of crop stubble has a negative impact not just on environment and human health, but also on soil fertility. The crop residue when burnt, instead of raising SOC through mixing with the soil, gets converted into carbon dioxide. A strategy focused on both in situ and ex situ management of residue is necessary today. Farmers burn the leftover straw and stubble after harvesting of paddy mainly because of the narrow time window to prepare their fields for sowing the next wheat crop. Currently, it is being sought to address the issue through subsidised provision of implements such as Happy Seeder, Super-Straw Management System attachment, mulcher and chopper-shredder. But all this is mostly in areas closer to the national capital. For sustainable farming and improving soil health, we need all states to pitch in.Third, to add organic matter from external sources, use of compost must be promoted. There is definitely a case to subsidise building of vermicompost pits or Nadep mud/clay brick tanks using money from MGNREGA and other schemes. Even urban green waste and manure from sewage treatment plants can be returned to farm soils. There is clear evidence that when nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium is used in conjunction with farm yard manure, the fertiliser response ratio itself goes up with rising SOC levels. Fourth, crop rotation. In the rice-wheat system, planting of legumes, either as a summer or full replacement crop in the kharif/rabi season, is most needed. Legumes have root nodules harbouring rhizobium bacteria that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. This nitrogen also helps bind and retain carbon in the soil for a longer time. Farmers, however, are hesitant to cultivate pulses for lack of a proper system of government procurement at minimum support prices, unlike that for wheat and paddy. Inclusion of pulses in the public distribution system would go a long way in promoting the cause of soil health as well as nutritional security for our masses.Fifth, the use of no-till implements deserves a big push. Organic carbon is retained in large soil aggregates. Deep ploughing equipment that break these aggregates cause SOC loss, whether through runoff with water or evaporation as carbon dioxide. Zero-till seed drills, Happy Seeders and Direct Seeded Rice machines will ensure minimal disturbance of aggregates and less depletion of organic matter.Last but not the least, we need to launch a comprehensive awareness programme for enhancing the organic matter content of soils, with specified and time-bound targets. The very act of monitoring and measuring outcomes will help focus attention on this important aspect. Farming should, of course, be profitable. But it must also be sustainable. And who better to understand that than farmers.The writer is Principal Secretary of Agriculture, Uttar Pradesh government. Views expressed are personal"

People, whose mainstay of livelihood was farming, were just picking up pieces of their lives and coming back to normalcy post the flood of August 2018, when mother nature let loose her fury once again, devastating them in the process.According to Prajesh Rajan, a farmer at Kothamangalam, high winds and heavy downpour destroyed his banana crop. The crop was doing good and I was expecting a bumper crop for sale during Onam season, he said. However, all that remains of his crop are toppled banana trees and immature fruit bunches.Nendran variety has a huge demand closer to Onam as they are used to make banana chips. But the vagaries of nature destroyed everything, he said. According to Anita James, technical assistant, District Agriculture Office, among crops that got destroyed in heavy rain and winds, banana plantations were the most hit. Around 15,42,462 number of bunched banana crops and 3,53,157 number of un-bunched banana crops were destroyed, she said.Of course, some of these immature raw fruits can be salvaged. But it wont get the price it would have otherwise fetched, she added. According to her, besides banana, paddy crop too suffered damage. But they are in a submerged condition and a correct figure can only be arrived at later. At present, the figure of loss stands at 433 hectares in the district, said Anita.Among spices, nutmeg and pepper suffered the most damage. As of now, it is estimated that around 6,546 acres of nutmeg and 2,441 acres of pepper plantations have been affected, said Anita. According to her, the areas that suffered most damage in agriculture sector are Kothamangalam, Nedumbassery and Muvattupuzha. The case of Pokkali rice too has been really bad this year. First, the lack of rain during sowing season, then the deluge, all severely affected Pokkali farmers, said Anita.A farmer checks out the cowpea crop in his field atChoornikkara. The crop that should have yieldeda good harvest has started decaying after excessive rainFish farmers too hit hardThe flood swept away the dreams of fish farmers as well. Both infrastructure and crops were damaged in the flood, said Devu Chandran, extension officer, Fish Farmers Development Agency. According to her, Aluva and Kunnathunadu taluks suffered the most damage. Paravoor, Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam and Neriamangalam are other places where fish farms sustained damage, she said.The entire picture of the damage caused can be arrived at only after a few days. The figures as of now are 10.51 hectares of carp fisheries, 1.8 hectares of gift fish farms, 0.72 hectares of stunted carp fish farms, one hectare of indigenous catfish farms, 7.2 hectares of air-breathing fish farms and 0.04 hectares of crab farms, she said.Besides crop loss, 18 units of cages used for cage fish farming and two recirculating aquaculture system units too have been damaged. In comparison, crops sustained more loss than infrastructure facilities. Fish got killed due to variation in pH levels of water and an increase in turbidity following flooding, she said."
2019-08-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/paddy-tube-wells-and-depleting-groundwater/article29112950.ece,"Paddy, tube wells and depleting groundwater: Why Punjab’s water resources are under strain","Gurmeet Singh, 60, a tall land-owning farmer in Bhattiwal Khurd village, which is located in Punjabs Sangrur district, has yet again planted the water-guzzling paddy crop this summer (kharif) as he is sceptical of any other crop fetching him a remunerative price.Standing on the edge of the Ghaggar branch canal, which flows barely a few metres away from his field, Gurmeet reveals that hardly anyone in the village irrigates his/her field with canal water. That is because motor-operated tube wells, with their powerful submersible pumps, have become an easy and preferred choice for most of the households to extract groundwater, he says.Punjabs policy of providing free electricity to farmers, in place since 1997, along with the Central governments favourable attitude towards paddy cultivation, are the key factors that have motivated farmers like Gurmeet to persist with paddy, despite the grave groundwater crisis faced by the State.Most of us here in the village have tube wells installed, be it on our farm or inside our houses. We use groundwater for irrigation, drinking and other domestic purposes. In 1977, we got our first tube well drilled at a depth of 35 ft-40 ft. Water at that time was easily available at 15 ft-20 ft. Since then, we have drilled as many as four tube wells as the water levels have been consistently falling. I got the latest one installed two years ago at around 300 ft. It cost me around 1,00,000, he says, his head dropping in despair as he mentions the high cost of his latest tube well.The green revolution impactGurmeets father Magar Singh, 90, intervenes to point out that farmers like him shifted to cultivation of rice and wheat during the hara inquilab (green revolution); till then, he says, crops like pulses, maize, vegetables and cotton were mainly grown in the village.Paddy (rice) requires far more water than other crops and as farmers started cultivating paddy, the need for tube wells arose. The extraction of groundwater only increased as farmers shifted from the use of monoblock pumps in the 1980s to other types like submersible pumps, he says.Ideally, groundwater should be available at a depth of 50 ft to 60 ft, but in Punjab, its level has significantly dropped to 150ft to 200 ft in most places. Many attribute this drastic fall to an indiscriminate extraction of groundwater in the last two decades.Further, deepening of tube wells, and purchase of the powerful motors to carry out the deepening, is costing farmers 1,100 crore per year, according to government data. The State, which gives free power to farmers, is also facing an increased financial burden due to the rising use of electricity. This year, the total power subsidy to the farm sector is estimated at 9,674 crore.To counter this, the Punjab State Farmers Policy, drafted by the States Farmers and Farm Workers Commission in June last year, suggested rationalising of power subsidy and asked the government to restrict the subsidy to the non-income tax payee farmers. It also recommended that cultivation of paddy on common lands be disallowed. Common (shamlat) village lands, whose utilisation is regulated under Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act 1961, have been increasingly used for paddy cultivation over the years. Experts feel that a restriction on such usage can help arrest groundwater depletion. The government, however, is yet to take a final call on these policy proposals.The Punjab government is well aware of the fast depleting groundwater reserves. Last month, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh directed the State Planning Board to chalk out a comprehensive crop diversification model. The Board was also directed to undertake a detailed review of the various schemes of the agriculture department to bring in much-needed reforms in the sector.The Chief Minister, who has been stressing the need to prioritise the cultivation of crops that consume less water like maize, cotton and sugar cane, asked the Board to come up with a strategy to persuade the farmers to shift to these crops.However, while the State government has been advocating crop diversification to save groundwater, farmers dont seem to be keen on shifting to other crops unless they are given an assured market and a guaranteed price for their produce. I am aware that paddy consumes more water than other crops but what is the alternative? Government agencies purchase rice and wheat (during rabi season) at the minimum support price (MSP), which assures me of a remunerative return. But in the case of other crops, theres hardly any such assurance. The government should purchase all major crops at MSP as is done in case of rice and wheat; until then, it's difficult to shift, says Randhir Singh, 51, who grows paddy at his three-acre farm in Bhattiwal Khurd village.This sentiment is echoed in other parts of the State as well. In Fatehpur village, located in the Chief Ministers pocket borough of Patiala, Karamjeet Singh says that after suffering financial loss owing to a price crash in the market, he stopped the cultivation of potato a few years ago. Three years ago, I planted a potato crop in my field but prices in the market crashed badly. The potato was fetching as low as 2 per kilo in the market. I couldnt even recover the cost of my crop and suffered a loss of around 3,00,000. Since then, I have stopped its cultivation and have been sowing rice and wheat, for which I am assured of getting a remunerative price as government agencies will purchase my produce at the MSP, he says, as he takes a seat along with his fellow farmers at the public shed in the village.Wrong to blame farmersAs the farmers beat the heat and humidity of an August afternoon under a fan mounted on the sheds ceiling, Ajaib Singh, 62, points out that it is wrong to blame farmers for groundwater depletion. There are industries and factories that are extracting a huge amount of groundwater  legally and illegally. Not only this, the unsystematic disposal of waste from these industries is contaminating the water, making it increasingly alkaline, he says.For Dilbag Singh, 43, usage of water from the Kherimala branch (canal), which flows barely three km from the village, is an affordable and doable way to reduce dependence on groundwater. The government needs to upgrade and work on maintenance of canal irrigation system. It needs to ensure the supply of water at tail-ends [the last part of the water outlet]. If an underground pipeline system can be laid, it will help us optimise water use. Also, it will check the theft of canal water, he says.Farmers like me are using tube wells because its an easy way of extracting water with powerful submersible pumps these days, but if the government develops a mechanism and lays a pipeline till my farm, why would I need to invest in a tube well? I remember we used to get water in canal outlets and also from wells for irrigation during the 1980s, but now almost every house in the village has a tube well, says Kesar Singh, 52, who has sown rice in his five-acre farm.Another rice-growing farmer, Nirmal Singh, who is a farmer leader as well, points out that the government needs to focus on establishing an assured market mechanism. What farmers want is a market  where the purchase of their products is guaranteed and they get an assured remunerative price, he says.Punjabs economy is highly dependent on agriculture. The sector. however, is experiencing slower growth as the States cropping intensity and irrigation potential have been fully exploited and the growth in productivity has also reached a saturation point.The intensive groundwater extraction in the last five decades through installation of shallow tube wells is reflected in tube well numbers  which have increased by almost 200% in 35 years, from six lakh in the 1980s to 14.76 lakh in 2017-18. Also, the area under rice cultivation has increased from 11.83 lakh hectares in 1980 to 28.86 lakh hectares in 2017-18. On an average, there are 34 tube wells per sq. km of net sown area in Punjab (2015-16).According to the Draft Dynamic Ground Water Estimation Report-2017, 109 blocks out of the 138 blocks taken for its study were over-exploited, two blocks were critical and five blocks were semi-critical while 20 blocks are in safe category. The water table was declining in nearly 80% of the area of the State.The report also said that while the annual replenishable groundwater resource in Punjab was about 17.5 million acre-ft (MAF), the annual draft (extraction) was 29 MAF, implying that the extraction rate outstripped availability by quite a few notches.If this trend continues, it will adversely affect the agricultural economy of the State and it is apprehended that irrigated area may decrease by up to 15% in the year 2025. Further, in the coming 20 years, supply from about 60% of top aquifers may be jeopardised. There will be an increase in the cost of raising crops, placing an increased financial burden on farmers and the government. A shortage in water supply could also act as a deterrent when it comes to investment in industries requiring water. Around 30 million residents of the Punjab region may face a collapse in agricultural output, says S.K. Saluja, Superintending Engineer, Directorate of Ground Water Management.Salinity in waterThe report also raised concerns about the deteriorating quality of groundwater due to pollution caused by urbanisation, industrialisation and an increased use of fertilisers and pesticides. It said that while nearly 50%-60% of groundwater was fresh and fit, 20%-30% was moderately saline and of marginal quality. Further, about 15%-25% of the groundwater was saline, alkaline and not fit for irrigation.Water in south and southwestern districts  like Sangrur, Muktsar, Bathinda and Mansa  came under the last category, containing varying concentration of soluble salts and its use for irrigation will adversely affect agricultural production, said the report.Farmers in Fatehpur, Patiala, looking at an abandoned well, which once used to be a major water source for irrigation but has now run dry due to over-extraction of groundwater.An increased awareness about the need for safe drinking water has caused many households in Bhattiwal Khurd village to install RO (reverse osmosis) water purification systems. I felt the need for RO system at my home after my family members started falling ill due to water-borne diseases at regular intervals. We have been consuming groundwater directly from tube wells for a long time, says Randhir Singh.Untreated industrial effluentsP.S. Rangi, a noted agriculture economist and a former adviser to Punjab State Farmers Commission, says that water quality is being impacted by untreated or inadequately treated industrial effluents and sewage that flows into rivulets and rivers in Punjab.Also, traditional water bodies such as ponds and wells in the villages are under threat. In most of the places, ponds have been filled and encroached upon while in other places, they have become a dumping ground for sewage. The problem is further compounded by the mixing of storm water and sewage in various municipal towns. The pollution and contamination of water resources due to industrial waste, sewage and excessive use of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a major cause of concern that needs immediate attention, says Rangi.Given the grim situation, Punjabs Department of Water Supply and Sanitation is planning to implement 10 surface water projects at a cost of 1,021 crore. These projects intend to provide potable piped water supply to 1,021 quality-affected villages, making them less reliant on groundwater and more on canal water.A total of 130 such villages  including 85 uranium-affected villages in Moga and 45 iron-affected ones in Roopnagar  have so far been shifted from groundwater to canal water.Lakhwinder Singh, professor of economics at Punjabi University, Patiala, who has been mapping rural Punjab for decades, asserts that agriculture in the State thrived in the past due to easy availability of both groundwater and surface water but, over the past few years, the availability has reached a saturation point.Increase in indebtednessSuccessive State governments invested on drainage systems that saved crops from damage in the case of heavy and untimely rains. Over the years, due to an incentivising of groundwater irrigation by the government and an irrational increase in the number of electric tube wells, water tables have receded. Experts have been time and again cautioning the State on the long-term consequences of excessive exploitation of groundwater. Now, farmers are forced to borrow from informal and formal sources to install tube wells, causing indebtedness and farmer suicides, says Lakhwinder, adding that that faulty public policy and irrational cropping system should be blamed for the scenario.Governments never visualised a scenario where agriculture would block the natural groundwater recharging process and create conditions for falling water tables, he says.He proposes that the drainage system be used for artificial recharge of groundwater. There is also a dire need to change the cropping pattern, especially in major parts of Malwa, which need to take up cotton cultivation again, he says, adding that water recharging system, if put in place, can solve weather-related problems and economic incentives can be used to change farmers mindsets, making them shift to multi-cropping system.He feels that a major policy shift with long term vision can solve both the agrarian crisis and the problem of water depletion.Realising the magnitude of agrarian crises, the draft policy framed by Punjabs Farmers and Farm Workers Commission points out that a decade of business as usual has left farmers in an unenviable position.The policy strikes a cautious note in telling that the State is struggling to meet the aspirations of its farmers and the time has come to take a critical look at the deteriorating resources, the changing economic environment and the emerging market scenarios."

The department may introduce strict provisions for criminal action against traders and millers, who deal in recycled rice with the intention of mixing it in rice from freshly procured paddy.An official of food and civil supplies department told HT, on anonymity, that anyone caught mixing cheap rice procured in previous seasons with freshly shelled rice during the upcoming procurement season will be charged under Sections of Essential Commodities Act and provisions of Indian Penal Code such as cheating and criminal conspiracy. After a proposal for a new CMP is finalised, the draft will be taken to the state cabinet for approval.The department came to know that the practice had been rampant in the previous years. However, in absence of provisions in the CMP, defaulters escaped on the pretext of non-stringent norms, said an officer in the department.Explaining how defaulters escaped from the rule of law, an officer said that traders who were caught bringing cheap rice from other states, particularly UP, said they would sell the rice in the open market but in most cases it was brought to be mixed in freshly shelled rice. He hinted of a few hundred crores involved in the illegal trade causing heavy losses to state exchequer.What is recycled rice?Traders from Punjab and Haryana buy cheap rice from UP and Bihar which is mostly kept for public distribution. It is mixed with freshly shelled rice to be handed over to the food corporation of India (FCI) and has a high value due to the increased minimum support price which is increased every year by the centre. It is a straight case of cheating and direct loss to the exchequer and we want to check this practice, said the officer.More millers in bank guarantee ambitThe food department, in the forthcoming year, plans to bring rice millers with milling capacity of 3,000 tonne under the ambit of a bank guarantee. In the previous year, millers with 5,000 tonne milling capacity were brought under bank guarantee purview. Now a miller who mills more than 3,000 tonne of his milling capacity will pay 5% of the price of paddy.Food department officials say it is done to ensure that the entire paddy is handed back to FCI in form of rice. A shortcoming if any will be retrieved from the bank guarantee. Officials add the system of bank guarantee has eased the system of handing back rice and the new provision will help make systems even better.First Published: Aug 19, 2019 00:09 IST"

2019-08-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-government-exploring-new-ways-to-curb-farm-water-use/story-EOsEVlioX8XJWMvhhKjBvJ.html,Narendra Modi government exploring new ways to curb farm water use,"indiaUpdated: Aug 19, 2019 07:30 ISTThe Narendra Modi government is set to unveil a series of measures to reduce water consumption in Indias agriculture sector, which uses a disproportionately high amount of 89% of the countrys entire groundwater, officials familiar with the plan said on Sunday.The new steps will try to ensure more sustainable methods of cultivation, as large parts of the country routinely face water crises amid alarming levels of ground water depletion. The proposals under consideration include making drip irrigation mandatory for sugarcane, one of the two biggest water-guzzling crops, along with paddy.Uttar Pradesh (which has the largest area under cane), Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are the largest sugarcane growing states. In states where sugarcane is grown, it consumes between 60-70% of the available water.According to estimates by the government, Indian sugarcane plantations consume less water than the global average, but they are less efficient than South Africa and Thailand. On average, India gets around 5.2 kg of sugarcane with one cubic metre of water. This is better than the global average of 4.80 kg/m3. But South Africa produces up to 7.8 kg with the same quantity of water and Thailand gets between 5.8 and 6.5 kg/m3 of water, said an official.Drip irrigation is a method of micro-irrigation that releases small amounts of water at regular intervals at the roots of any crop. It is used extensively across the world for sugarcane plantations.The government is likely to also formulate policies to shift a major chunk of rice cultivation out of Punjab and Haryana to rain-surplus regions of the country. This will ensure that groundwater will not come under excessive pressure in large parts of the northern India. Recently, Union minister for Jal Shakti, Gajendra Shekhawat had said, Our studies say that to grow one kilogramme of paddy, we consume 5,600 litres of water whereas China produces the same amount of paddy with just 330-400 litres of water.Policies will be formulated to encourage farmers in water-scarce states, including Haryana and Punjab, to move to other crops, such horticulture. The government is also looking at how farmers can be motivated to shift to solar-powered farms to cut down on electricity consumption.The water ministry has proposed to a panel set up by Prime Minister Modi to review agriculture and rural development sectors moving to a production system of alternative crops, depending on agro-climatic zones, better irrigation system and financial incentives to farmers for optimal water usage.We have to re-look at our water consumption, especially when there is a severe water crisis in many parts of the country, Shekhawat said, pointing out that of the 178.7 million rural households in the country, only 32.7 million or 18% got drinking water from tap connections.The government also plans to bring fallow land, especially in rain-surplus eastern and northeastern parts of the country, into cultivation of water-intensive crops to make good any loss of area in other parts.In grain-bowl states of Punjab and Haryana, a practice of paddy-wheat cycle (paddy during summers, wheat during winters) has driven aquifers to a historic low. Haryana has announced cash incentives and freebies for farmers who trade paddy cultivation for maize. Fifteen thousand farmers in the state has signed up for the programme this summer.If the government wants to be successful, it will have to rework its procurement policy and minimum support prices (MSP), which are mainly responsible for skewed water consumption. MSPs have to be sufficiently attractive for non-paddy crops, said R Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.Modi has called for a mass movement on water conservation along the lines of Swachh Bharat, flagging concerns over depleting water levels in the country.In his first Mann ki Baat after his government retained power in the national polls this summer, Modi urged upon all citizens to create awareness on water conservation, share knowledge of traditional methods to conserve water and highlight success stories on conservation.According to the Economic Survey 2018-19, by 2050, India will be in the global hot spot for water insecurity.India is the second-largest producer of rice after China. The two Asian giants contribute to nearly half of the worlds total rice production. The Economic Survey pointed out that around 89% of groundwater extracted is used for irrigation and crops such as paddy. Sugarcane consumes more than 60% of surface irrigation water.The survey said, Focus should shift from land productivity to irrigation water productivity. Therefore devising policies to incentivise farmers to improve water use should become a national priority. Thrust should be on micro-irrigation that can improve water use efficiency.Shekhawat added that rationalisation of water can only be done with the help of the states. In Punjab farmers get free power to use pumps to extract groundwater. The state government has started a scheme whereby farmers are given cash incentives if they consume less electricity in agricultural fields. Lower use of pumps means less extraction of groundwater. In Maharashtra, farmers are encouraged to use drip irrigation for sugar-cane cultivation. It is also a proven fact that sugar-cane fed by drip irrigation has better sugar yield. So, we need the help of all states to address the issue of over-exploitation of water, the minister said.First Published: Aug 19, 2019 07:17 IST"

As the paddy saplings remained inundated for nearly three weeks last month, the crops are now besieged by pest infestation.Paddy cultivation in the current Kharif season was taken up on around one lakh acre in Jeypore, Borrigumma, Kundra and Kotpad from June to July this year and high yielding varieties like Lalat, 1001, 1010, MTU, Puja were planted. Although the saplings had grown well, they were damaged by rains and are now faced with pest attack.According to reports, paddy crop in around 5,000 acre have already been damaged. While the crops in some areas are facing Rice Blast disease, pests like brown planthopper (BPH) have damaged crops in the rest of the areas. Most of the affected crops have turned yellow or brown. Pesticides are not available in the market at subsidised prices and not all farmers are able to purchase them from open market at `700 to `1,000 per litre. While Agriculture Department officials should have assessed the damage and sent report to the Collector for facilitating supply of pesticides at subsidised prices in Government run outlets, it has not been done. Farmers are now apprehensive of pest attack spreading to new areas and affecting crop yield. Members of pani panchayats have appealed the Collector to take urgent action on the issue."

Large, flashy flex boards on either side of the road announce a moi virundhu, a sort of crowd-funded gathering over a feast, spread over the entire Tamil month of Aadi.Moi virundhu, in its traditional form, used to be a poor persons call for help, where one would organise a feast for friends and family in times of distress in return for monetary help. But over the past decade or so, the custom has evolved into an annual feature when families take turns to organise the feast, and raise money. And after natural calamities such as Cyclone Gaja, their numbers too seem to increase.Despite the penetration of banks, the tradition continues to remain popular in parts of Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Madurai districts. In Madurai district, it goes by different names  illa vizha (family function) or vasantha vizha (spring function). Both these functions have no ritual or ceremony, but are organised with the sole objective of collecting moi  cash gifts.Such functions were unheard of in earlier days. Tamil literature has no such mention. These are modern day inventions like Fathers Day and Mothers Day, says retired Tamil Professor and film personality Ku. Gnanasambandan.But with each passing year, the feasts appear to become bigger. So much so that families now rope in banks to collect and transport the cash from the venue. Special software is also being used to enter details about the contribution of each guest.At Vadakadu, the gathering happens under a makeshift shed with metal sheets and in the midst of festive music, where 17 people  the organisers of the feast, all clad in white  welcome guests with folded hands.But, theres one more step before getting to taste the virundhu. In what seems like an elaborate arrangement, relatives of the organisers sit under rows of banners with registers to receive the moi. The banners carry the pictures of each of the organisers  some of whom have multiple flex boards for each of the villages from where he expects his guests.Nowadays, people organise moi virundu feasts in groups to split expenditure, often erecting separate ex boards for each organiser. | Photo Credit: M. MoorthyIt has come a long way from the actual tradition  something you find depicted in the movie Chinna Gounder, says Karthik, a relative of R. Pushparaj, one of the 17 organisers. People now organise moi virundhu in groups to reduce the cost and everything is done in a systematic manner here. One would expect nothing less, given the fact that the feasts often rake in money to the tune of crores of rupees.After making their contribution, the guests head off to the feast. Ten workers have slaved overnight to cook about 400 kg of mutton and 800 kg of rice. By 3 a.m., a large feast of rice and mutton curry is ready to cater to nearly a thousand people. More uncooked rice and meat is kept in store, in case the turnout surpasses expectations. Before the pots start boiling, a ritual is performed the previous night at the organisers in-laws houses to announce the feast. The register, cash box, and even the pen used have to come from the parents-in-law as a gift, says Mr. Pushparaj.After parting with their money, the guests go home content with the food, while the organisers, who have their coffers full, turn debtors  unlike in the traditional version of the custom. The records of moi given will be safely preserved, for generations with the family, and the return gifts will have to be commensurate, or more.R. Karuppiah, a village elder, has seen the custom change over the years. When I was a child, moi was given during a celebration like an ear-piercing ceremony, child-naming, weddings and such. Earlier, it was about people helping others, now it is like a chit fund, where the occasion itself is the virundhu organised to raise the money paid and some more, he says.There are unwritten, yet rigid, social norms which dictate the payment of moi. It has to be paid when the donor organises a virundhu, or within five years before it is their turn to organise the feast again. The practice has become popular as it is seen as a loan without interest. When one pays the moi back, they can choose the extra amount, to maintain goodwill. It is all based on honour and pride. You keep giving money until it is your turn to take a lump sum. It has become a vicious cycle, says Mr. Karuppiah.Earlier, people used to offer small sums like 10 or 50, depending upon how much cash they felt comfortable parting with, but now the lowest one receives is 500, says Mr. Karuppiah. Individual contributions go as high as 10,000-20,000.In late July, a moi virundhu organised by R. Krishnamoorthy, who runs a flex printing shop in Vadakadu, made headlines after he reportedly raked in as much as 4 crore from a feast that served about 1,000 people. He made so much money because in the last five years, he invested a significant amount in others moi virundhu, explains Mr. Karthik.Unofficial estimates say that moi virundhu season collection is around 250 crore a year in the district, which also brings its share of problems. At least one incident of assault and break-in is reported every year. This happens when an individual is not able to pay back the money, says a police officer in the Vadakadu police station. Sometimes, the organiser also names and shames those who were unable to return the money, he adds.Some have come to view the moi virundhu as a business, says K. Adaikalam, president, Agamudayar Charitable and Education Trust. Sometimes, businessmen organising the event turn loan sharks. After keeping the money that they require, the rest is loaned out at high interest. This practice is unique to this region, insists Mr. Adaikalam, who claims that this form of moi virundhu was born in his birthplace, Peravurani in Thanjavur district, and spread to neighbouring places. A vasantha vizha would be a like a traditional crowd-funding practice without an obligation to pay the money back, he says.Relatives of the moi virundhu organisers sit with registers and make meticulous records that are preserved, and the return gifts are expected to be commensurate during any future events. | Photo Credit: M. MoorthyInterest-free loanIn earlier days, every family had five to six children and there was no dearth of domestic functions when friends and well-wishers would contribute cash gifts. But, now many families have one or two children and hence, the illa vizha concept helps us conduct a function without any solid reason, says S. Santhanam of Usilampatti.He adds that illa vizha and vasantha vizha are popular with the Piraimalai Kallar community. It is a practice wherein the community comes forward to help an economically poor or a needy person with money. For practical purposes, it is an interest-free loan, he explains.He claims that he had conducted two events through which he collected 55 lakh and 45 lakh in the past. My economic status has gone up since then. I was able to do something good for the family such as buying a house or jewellery for the family, he says.Just as in the Nadar community wherein the community elders extend financial help to the poor in setting up a business or a grocery shop to lift them up economically, the Mukkulathors have adopted this practice of conducting a feast for collecting moi, says M. Murugan of Sellur. This concept of pooling money by the community for some familys well-being emerged in the late 1990s.Every household in the community maintains accounts of the moi received or given. People flip through the notebooks to verify how much moi someone gave them during a family function so that they can repay accordingly.If I had paid 5,000 moi to someone, he is expected to repay 6,000 or 10,000, depending upon our relationship and his economic status. And the amount multiplies significantly with every transaction between us. But, if the same person does not want to continue the practice with me, he will return 5,100, signifying that the account is closed. We need not pay moi to each other thereafter, Mr. Murugan explains.Mr. Santhanam says that many families belonging to the Piramali Kallar community have come up in life with moi collection alone. Which bank will give loans without any collateral? And where will these people go for collateral, he asks. But, the community will generously give moi even to those whose credibility is not great. The collection has been as high as 1.5 crore in Sellur alone, recalls Mr. Murugan.While more than 80% of the people invest the collection well, some fail to make good use of the money and go bankrupt. Some even flee the village, Mr. Santhanam says.As the practice of moi virundhu caught on, there was need for someone to keep record. In Vadakadu village, a man running a photocopying shop has become the book-keeper and almost has a monopoly over the business. His shop sells a cheque book of sorts with details such as names of the donor, their father, and address. Each of the leaves has blank space to enter the moi figure. The filled-in leaves are handed over to the people at the desk by the guests.A meal of mutton curry and rice is prepared for a moi virundhu, organised in the Tamil month of Aadi in Tamil Nadus Pudukkottai district on August 2, 2019. | Photo Credit: M. MoorthyThe shop also sells a register with a list of all moi virundhu events taking place. When I started, I went door-to-door to collect details. Now, the organisers make sure they come and register here, otherwise, guests may not know about the event at all if it does not get on the register, says V. Subramaniam, who owns the store. He prints at least 250 of the cheque books that sells for 100, while 1,000 copies of the register fly off the shelves every year at a price of 50.As the years passed, and the money in circulation increased, technology found its way into the tradition. Moi Tecch, an Android app and software service developed by M. Prabhu, has been making waves in these parts. Those who organise the virundhu hire Mr. Prabhus team to keep a record of the moi received. We replace the men with registers, make entries on a computer and print out a register for the organiser to keep, reducing the use of paper, manpower and improving accuracy, Mr. Prabhu says. Those who have Android phones also download the app to keep an easily accessible e-register. Each of the persons equipped with a computer comes at a price of 3,000. Those keeping record in books charge more than this and often make terrible errors, he says.Mr. Prabhu, a graduate in business administration, has a dedicated team that uses laptops, printers, currency-counting machines and mobile apps to collect moi at the venue. We give thermal paper receipts to those who pay moi. An app given to the customer will help him know the update of collection on a real-time basis. Since receipts are given to those giving moi, the accounts are clean, he says.For every 400 entries, one laptop and two persons are employed for which the company charges 3,500. While one person will make entries in the laptop, another person will collect the money. I have sent as many as 25 teams to a single feast, he says.Besides transparency in collection, the computerised moi collection is also user-friendly. The names those who paid are given in alphabetical order and also village-wise/town-wise entries are made so that people can easily find out how much was given by any individual, Mr. Prabhu says.Gentle remindersSince moi is seen as more than just a gift, the community also has a practice of reminding people about how much they need to repay. For instance, an invitation could read: Happy to meet you again after 2010. This means the person invited will have to verify accounts of moi he received (from the person inviting) at all the functions he organised since 2010 and repay accordingly, Mr. Santhanam says.When someone makes an underpayment, he is openly reminded of that after verifying the moi account once the function gets over. It is only an exaggeration in movies that people fight over the amount. The reminder could go through a common friend or a relative or through a phone call, says Mr. Murugan. The moi collection is also announced on a public address system in some villages."

Did you know that Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus the two main disease-spreading mosquitoes  will pose a threat to 49 per cent of the worlds population? Well, thats what a report prepared by a team of international researchers say. The tiny creatures cause diseases varying from the potentially-fatal Zika virus and Dengue to Chikungunya which can leave people grappling with joint pain for years.If no action is taken to reduce the current rate at which the climate is warming, pockets of habitat will open up across many urban areas with vast amounts of individuals susceptible to infection, Moritz Kraemer, co-author of the report and an infectious disease scientist at Boston Childrens Hospital and the University of Oxford, had said earlier this year.To counter the threat posed by vector-borne diseases, the World Health Organisation suggests a number of measures for protection from mosquitoes at the individual as well as community level.To identify the dwelling places of mosquitoes, it is important to understand that the first three of the four distinct stages of their lives are spent in water.- Depending on the species, an adult female mosquito lays around 100-400 eggs in clusters or singly on the surface of the water. The female mosquito may live as long as three weeks during the summer or several months over the winter in order to lay eggs when it gets warmer.- After they hatch into larvae within two to three days, the adult mosquitoes rest on the surface of the water until they are strong enough to fly away.Here are the places mosquitoes breed in and around homeThis is why any stagnant water body marshes, pools, ponds and even buckets of water and other containers of water near or in your house are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Air coolers can also prove to be effective breeding grounds for mosquitoes if they are not cleaned or the water is not replaced regularly.Potted plants, discarded tires, gutters, water puddles, birdbaths, uncovered trash cans, tree stumps, woodpiles, paddy and rice field, neglected swimming pools, storm drains, ditches also provide homes to mosquitoes. It is also important to keep bathrooms and toilets clean as these damp and wet places provide the ideal environment for mosquitoes to breed.Mosquitoes also rest in tall grass, weeds, and brush near inhabitations.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-09-04,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/sep/04/odisha-government-doublespeak-on-paddy-procurement-2028656.html,Odisha government doublespeak on paddy procurement,"Bijoy Pradhan ByExpress News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: Even as the State Government claims to have procured 65.49 lakh tonne of paddy during the 2018-19 Kharif marketing season, there is a complete mismatch between the official data produced by two of its departments on the marketable surplus of paddy.While the Government informed the Assembly in July that 65.49 lakh tonne of paddy was procured from registered farmers, a progress report of the Cooperation department said 42.29 lakh tonne of paddy was purchased from farmers under the minimum support price (MSP) scheme by Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) by end of June this year.Other than PACS, which procured paddy on behalf of Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation (OSCSC), agencies like Tribal Development Cooperative Corporation (TDCC), Women Self Help Groups (WSHGs) and Pani Panchayats were also engaged in the procurement process.In the absence of procurement figures of these agencies, it is construed that the balance 23.20 lakh tonne of paddy was purchased by them under price support system from the farmers. What is intriguing is that it is unclear whether these agencies have the capacity to purchase such huge quantity of paddy without having any infrastructural facility of their own.The TDCC, which has been participating in the decentralised procurement from 2006-07, procured 44,721 tonne of rice in 2015-16 which is equivalent to about 65,000 tonnes of paddy. But the corporation procured 9,850 tonnes of rice in 2017-18. It is anyones guess if the SHGs and the Pani Panchayats have the capacity to procure over 22 lakh tonne of paddy.While replying to a question from Congress legislator Tara Prasad Bahinipati during the budget session of the Assembly, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister RP Swain informed the House that the States rice production was 76.19 lakh tonne against its requirement of 68.31 lakh tonne. In effect, the State has a marketable surplus of 7.88 lakh tonne of rice this year.Another report of the Government said the State has a total rice production of 73.11 lakh tonne while the requirement is 67.98 lakh tonne. In this scenario, the marketable surplus comes to 5.13 lakh tonne."
2019-09-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rich-dividends-for-punjab-farmers-expected-from-bumper-cotton-crop-this-season-5968364/,Rich dividends for Punjab farmers expected from bumper cotton crop this season,"Cotton crop is expected to pay rich dividends to farmers this season as Punjab is expecting a bumper production. Though cotton crop season starts from October 1, bales of cotton already started coming in to Abohar Mandi on Wednesday. Full-fledged harvesting will start after September 15.AdvertisingFarmers got around Rs 5,611 per quintal as the opening rate of Kapas (raw cotton along with seed) against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5450 per quintal set by the government. Kapas is later ginned to separate the cotton seed, which is used to make cattle feed, oil, oil seed cake etc., while lint is used to make yarn.Abohar Mandi, one of the of biggest cotton markets in Fazilka district of Malwa region, received 125 bales on Wednesday with each bale weighing 170 kg.Farmers have brought around 500 quintals cotton to our mandi today. The main crop will start coming in mid-September. We are expecting a bumper crop along with good price, said Anil Nagori, president of the Arhtiya Association Abohar Cotton Mandi, adding that they purchased the cotton at a rate around Rs 5,611 to 5,650 per quintal on Wednesday.AdvertisingIn Fazilka mandi too, around 15 quintals cotton had arrived and farmers got more than the MSP rate per quintal, said Vinod Gupta, a commission agent of Fazilka Mandi.I have sown cotton on 10 acres land. The first round of plucking has started, and 2-3 more pickings will take place in October, November and December, said cotton grower Ram Kishan from Abohar, adding that the weather is quite favourable for the crop this time and the yield will also increase if the same weather continues.If the crop is good then a farmer can get 10 to 13 quintals raw cotton from one acre, said farmer Vinod Jyani of Abohar, adding that this year a bumper crop is expected and MSP is also good.Going by Wednesdays rate, which is around Rs 160 above the MSP, sale of raw cotton per acre at a rate of Rs 56,000 to Rs 73,000 in the market and can earn farmers Rs 36,000 to Rs 53,000 per acre after meeting all expenses.Cotton is a good alternative to Paddy in punjab, and and the state government is keen on diversifying paddy area under cotton. The MSP of paddy is Rs 1,835 per quintal this year and a farmers gets around 28 to 30 quintals paddy from one acre which can be sold at Rs 52,400 to Rs 55,050 at the MSP rate. The earning would be Rs 34,000 to 38000 after meeting production cost  which is lower than cotton.This year 3.91 lakh hectares area is under cotton crop against 2.83 lakh hectares last year, while paddy (parmal rice) area is still around 23 lakh hectares if basmati rice (around 6.29 lakh hectares this year) is excluded.Director, Punjab Agriculture department, Dr Sutantra Airy said that the opening rate is much higher than the MSP and they hope to increase it further.Punjabs cotton belt includes Bathinda, Mansa, Mukatsar Sahib, Fazilka, Barnala Moga, Faridkot and Sangrur.Following the white fly attack on crop in 2015, farmers in Punjab had decreased area under cotton drastically and since then, Punjab could not touch the 4 lakh hectares figure.Officials in the agriculture department said that farmers should not be worried about the crop now as the Cotton Corporation of India is ready to purchase the crop at MSP rate if the rate goes down in the market."

The Pudukkottai Organic Farmer Producers Company Ltd (POFPCL), an initiative of farmers, has been distributing seeds free of cost as parts of its efforts to revive and preserve native paddy varieties.Unlike other inputs for which farmers pay in cash, POFPCL distributes seeds with a rider - farmers have to return double the quantity at the end of harvest. Fearing that increasing use of chemicals and fertilizers could make agriculture difficult to sustain in future, POFPCL with support from Tamil Nadu Agri-marketing department, has been distributing free seeds for the past four years. The company has customer base of 1000 farmers in the district.Whenever we issue seeds, the only advice we give farmers is tell them not to use pesticides or fertilizers. Extensive use of hybrid seeds and chemicals have reduced the quality of grains. Growing crop without chemical use would help retain nutrient value of the rice, said A Adhappan, Managing Director of POFPCL.If a farmer collects 2 kg of Seeraga samba variety of paddy, he must repay with 4 kg of seeds after harvest. In this way we can sustain the business model and also can reach out to more farmers, said Adhappan.The company currently provides 46 varieties of native paddy seeds including Mappala Samba, Seraga Samba, Mysore Malli, Thuiya Malli and Kichidi Samba. The low investment needed for using native variety is encouraging many farmers approach the company. The biggest problem we face is investment on fertilizers and pesticides. The cost comes down while using native seeds, and it has made farming a lot profitable, said, Selvan, a farmer in Pudukkottai.Besides issuing seeds, the company operates procurement centres to buy harvested crop.  Compared to other farm markets, we provide higher price for the produce as rice is of native variety and grown organically. After procurement, we supply them to customers all over the country, Adhappan added.District Collector, P Uma Maheswari said,  Last year the company reported turnover of `1.8 crore. The facilities and service they provide are extra-ordinary and I hope the company reaches a wider farmer base."

The aromatic basmati variety 1509 has already arrived at the mandi in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts, but with US trade sanctions on Iran, Indias basmati exporters may lose orders worth many billion dollars. If exports are stopped to the cash rich middle-eastern country, farmers of Punjab and Haryana will face a direct hit.Of the total of 15 lakh acres under basmati cultivation this season, the 1509 variety is sown over 40% of the area (6 lakh acres) and rest1121 variety is expected to ripen in November.The rice that forms the bulk of Irans staple diet is 1509 and 1121 varieties, both famous for their long grain and aroma. In Punjab, they are grown in districts of Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Muktsar and Fazilka. In Haryana the aromatic variety is grown largely in Travadi belt in Karnal and adjoining districts.Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Visawjeet Khanna said that the state government and basmati exporters are working out a solution. Our foremost challenge was to diversify to basmati from the water-guzzling coarse grain paddy, which we have done successfully, he said.Basmati exporters are also worried because huge payments of the previous year are pending from Iran.Harmeet Singh a farmer from Qadian (Gurdaspur) said despite uncertainty over the sanctions issue, farmers opted for basmati to conserve ground water. If promoted properly we can sell our crop at a good price, he added.A look at the numbers explains why farmers are concerned. Of the total 40 lakh tonne basmati (worth Rs 30,000 crore) exported from India every year, 15 lakh tonne goes to Iran, with Punjab and Haryana collectively contributing to 75% grain for export, and Punjab contributing the larger share.Keeping the issue of sanctions aside, in Punjab, by the joint efforts of state agriculture department, more farmers opted to grow basmati, increasing the area under the aromatic variety from last seasons 5.28 lakh hectare to 6.29 lakh hectare.In 2017-18, the states grain ran into trouble when a large chunk was sent back from European countries, over traces over weedicide in the grain which was higher than permissible limits.Punjab is an important part of geo-tagged area for aromatic grain cultivation. We have the patent and we will not lose it. I am sure we will do better than the previous yearbe it an increase in area under cultivation, better quality grain and higher yield, said Khanna.After the 2018-19 fiasco, basmati growers and state department took corrective steps to make the grain acceptable to importers and farmers too made a good profit selling the produce at Rs 3,600 to 4,000 a quintal with each hectare yielding up to 50 quintals.Director agriculture Sutantar Kumar Airi said the department was able to control usage of harmful pesticides and weedicides such as Acifet, trizofan, thiamithoksam, carbandazim, tricyclazole, buprofazin, carbofeuron, propiconazole and thiofinate methyl. This will make difference to our crop, he added.Ashok Sethi, a basmati exporter, said arrivals have started in Amritsar in smaller quantities. He said the situation is tense regarding basmati exports. Iran and Bahrain buy 40% of the total basmati exported from India. Other countries such as Canada, Australia and Europe also buy from India.First Published: Sep 09, 2019 00:32 IST"

Journalists are getting goosebumps watching the official Independence celebration as if it was done for the first time. That it has been conducted for the last 70 years, in the same place and in the same fashion, is seemingly a matter of trivial detail. What matters is that Kashmir is seen to have been conquered and Kashmiris vanquished.While this in itself is significant, it feeds into the meta-narrative of undoing Jawaharlal Nehrus historical blunder. This, despite the fact that it was under Nehrus watch that the seed of Article 370 had been taken out. The BJP has now blown the husk away. What is even more interesting is how the BJP is following the footsteps of the Congress in seeking to assuage the feelings of the people of Kashmir after having disenfranchised them.Circa 1954, immediately after substantially eroding the constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) through the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954, a series of development initiatives followed. Goodies were doled out to all sections. The procurement price of paddy was increased by 35%, its sale price reduced by 18%, and amount of ration per head increased by 25%. The landed cost of rice of 89 paisa per kilogram (kg) was subsidised 60% to be sold at 37 paisa per kg. This subsidy was later to become an albatross around the neck of the Kashmiris. Almost every working day, a new cooperative society was set up and each one of the 280 cooperative societies were given Rs 10,000 a piece, a total of Rs 28 lakh.Universal education throughout the state, from the primary-level up to the graduate-level, was made free. Along with the abolition of educational fees, special educational facilities like mobile schools for Gujjars and Bakerwals were provided. Not only human beings, even animals were taken care of; imported studs, pedigreed bulls, stallions and rams were supplied at the block-level for better breeding.Sixty five years later, little seems to have been learnt. The development carrot is again being dangled to dampen the pain and anguish caused by the political stick. The Constitution (Application to J&K) Order 2019, which abolished the special status of J&K, is being followed up with the strategy of using money to buy loyalties. The tried, tested and failed model of corruption as a mode of cohesion is in operation yet again.Circa 2019. Exactly as in 1954, a politically-motivated, socially-corrosive and financially-damaging public expenditure policy is being implemented. It is expected that by dispensing largesse, peoples attention will be diverted from their disenfranchisement and disempowerment.It is not autumn quite yet, but the trees are already shedding; not dried leaves but fresh currency. The grassroots of democracy are being irrigated with cash; Rs 366 crore has been directly transferred to the panchayats. Sarpanchs and panchs have been given honorariums of Rs 2,500 and Rs 1,000 per month respectively. More than 2,000 people have been hired to keep accounts in panchayats. A remuneration package  the highest in the country  for urban local bodies has been given to mayors, deputy mayors and councillors.Anganwadi workers and assistants have got a 25% hike in salary; the stipend of court assistants is up 66%; and village level workers have got a 500% hike in allowances. The honorarium of 30,000 special police officers has been increased, and the hardship allowance for police personnel has also been raised. An additional 40,000 people have been enrolled for old-age pensions. An apple procurement policy at a substantial premium to market prices has been announced, and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (Nafed) has earmarked Rs 5,500 crore for this.The state government has become the employer of last resort. Over 4,000 teachers have been recruited in schools, and 30,000 rehbar-e-talim (learning guides) have been regularised. This, despite the fact that the student to teacher ratio in J&K at 16:1 is not only better than the national average of 24, it is even better than that of China at 19:1. Gujarat had a student to teacher ratio of 32:1 and Bihar is at 57:1.There is no development angle in any of this. If anything, all this will make Kashmir economically more insular, operationally more vulnerable, businesses more dependent on the government, and the government even more fiscally fragile. The unstated idea is to give some money to every stakeholder and buy his acquiescence.

Hangkhalian and others have expressed fear that there may be a famine-like situation in the State since the quantum of paddy production will be slashed in the coming days.Officials said that due to incessant rain last year, verdant paddy plants were destroyed due to flash floods.Due to this, the price of 1 kg of Manipur rice and black rice, which is unique to the State, has been hiked to a point where the average citizen cannot afford it, said officials on Friday.Manipur rice usually sells at 30 per kg, but is currently being sold at 50 per kg. Black rice is available at 75 per kg.In the wake of dry season, the government tried to buy all water pumps available in the market. Vast areas were irrigated though many other fields were left out as there is no source of water, said Mr. Hangkhalian.No canals for irrigationSocial activists said that though there are some small village dams across the ankle-deep rivers, the parched fields cannot be irrigated as there are no canals.In view of the problems faced by farmers, the State Cabinet resolved last week to approach the Centre to have Manipur declared as a drought-hit State, said officials. However, till date there has been no response from the Centre.State Consumer Food and Public Distribution Minister Karam Shyam said that currently Manipur has comfortable rice stock."

In 2018, the same variety fetched Rs Rs 2500 to 2600 per quintal, compared to Rs 2300/2500 this year.AdvertisingWhile traders said that US sanctions on Iran, which is a big importer of Basmati from India, was the reason behind the slump, the farmers blamed the arhtiyas of ganging up to show less demand in order to keep the prices artificially lower.Basmati crop is procured by the private players and paddy is procured by government beginning October 1 after main paddy varieties (non-basmati) reach the markets.Meanwhile, farmers also said that government procurement arrangements should be made a week in advance as and not from October 1 as this time paddy sowing was done a week in advance, from June 13 as against June 20 last year. Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh had announced early paddy sowing this year.AdvertisingThe opening price for basmatis early variety has worried farmers who grow late basmati variety- PUSA 1121 and PUSA 1718, which last year fetched Rs 3300 to 4000 per quintal. Both these are much superior varieties and come in the market in October.Ujagar Singh, a farmer who sold his crop at Tarn Taran grain market, said: I have sold around 500 quintals of PUSA 1509 in last 5 days and the rate on the first day on September 11 was Rs 2500 per quintal, while today I sold it at the rate of Rs 2300 per quintal as traders and arhtiyas fleece farmers due to no control of the government over its price.Traders create false market price when there is peak arrival period of the crop in the mandis and after that the rates suddenly goes up, said another farmer, Onkar Singh, who sold his crop at the rate of Rs 2500 per quintal Sunday at Sultanpur Lodhi Market. He said farmers have to go by the wishes of traders as they cannot hold back the crop once it is harvested and has to bring in the mandi.The rate of the crop should have been around Rs 2800 to 3000 per quintal, but it will be that once farmers have sold it, and it is time for the traders to mint money, said farmer Davinder Singh, who had sold yield from his 20 acres in the past one week.Former chairman of Punjab Mandi Board, Ravinder Singh Cheema, said: It is because of US sanctions on Iran, which is major importer of Basmati from India, that the situation is not clear about how much basmati will be exported to Iran this time. This has impacted prices in Punjab.A basmati exporter said that around 16 lakh tonnes basmati worth Rs 12,000 to Rs 13,000 crores is exported to Iran and this time they were worried due to US sanctions.This time we are expecting production of around 8 lakh metric tonnes of 1509 variety and it is arriving in Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Batala, Tarn Taran, Dhuri, Sunam, Phagwara, Fazilka, Sultanpur Lodhi markets, said Cheema."

An ordinance will be issued in the next few days: The Union Cabinet, which gave its approval to the measure, felt there should be some means of curbing antisocial elements. Conscious of the criticism that such a step would evoke, the government would ensure that the detention was subject to review by a board whose members would be chosen by the chief justices of high courts. Under Article 22 of the Constitution, a law can be made to detain a person for three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board.Cambodia ReliefAdvertisingWhile governments and aid agencies debate the politics and fine print of the problem, relief officials and diplomats say hundreds, if not thousands, may already be dying in Cambodia every day of hunger and disease. Why isnt large-scale international aid going to Cambodia  a country which has been stalked by wars and a reign of terror, and which now faces what US state department officials say is a famine terrible beyond imagination? US officials say the fault rests with the Phnom Penh government and its Vietnamese backers since they have thus far refused to agree on a programme of international controls over relief distributions.Paddy Prices FixedThe Centre has told state governments to ensure that the implementation of any system evolved by them for procurement of paddy, rice and coarse grains does not impede free flow of kharif cereals from one state to another. The method of procurement has been left to be determined by states taking into consideration local conditions. In a communication to the state governments and union territories, the union agriculture ministry has intimated procurement prices of different varieties of paddy. The procurement price of fine variety has been fixed at Rs 93 and superfine variety at Rs 103 for the 1979-80 marketing season."
2019-09-24,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-pushes-zero-budget-farming-farmers-experts-say-no-road-map-in-place-6026204/,"Govt pushes zero budget farming; farmers, experts say no road map in place","THE PUNJAB government has asked agriculture offices across all 22 districts to register 150 farmers each for zero budget natural farming to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, after getting a letter from the Centre on the same.AdvertisingFarmers however say that to implement zero budget farming, they need a lot of financial support from the government because yield would go down drastically in the initial years.UvThe government claims that if input cost is decreased, farmers will not need to take loans and with zero inputs, they will only earn from their crops without spending anything.Such farming is being done in parts of some states including Karnataka. However, in Punjab, where the per hectare consumption of fertilisers is highest in the country, farmers are skeptical about how this would work, and how such large scale area can be brought under it. We are going to enroll 150 farmers from various villages of Jalandhar district under zero budget farming, said Jalandhar ChiefAdvertisingAgriculture Officer Dr Nazar Singh, adding that when a farmer shifts from inorganic farming to natural farming, the yield for some years goes down because the soil, which is accustomed to a lot of fertilisers and chemical sprays, needs time to adjust to natural farming.How a farmer can suddenly shift to zero budget farming and what would be the guarantee of yield? asked farmer Jasbir Singh of Talwan village in Jalandhar, adding that they are getting 26 quintal wheat, 30 quintal rice per acre currently.Around five years ago, I left inorganic farming and shifted to organic/natural farming where I stopped using chemicals, fertilisers in my 15 acres land, due to which I got just 1/3rd of the yield in the first few years. My family was quite upset with me due to the loss we incurred, said Sher Singh (53) of Meerpur Saidan village, adding that he spent the next four years making up for the loss and is even now getting just half the yield.But the price of my crop is more than double compared to the crops grown using harmful chemicals. Also my soil has transformed into a poison-free soil. I store my Basmati and sell it after rice at the rate of Rs 170 per kg, earning Rs 1.50 lakh from one acre only, he said, pointing out that farmers will need double the price of their crop and financial aid for first few years if they shift to this practice.He further said, Though my yield is low, I slowly made a market for my produce and sold my crop more than double of the price against inorganic produce. I also sell vegetables, wheat and paddy at double the rate of the market. According to Sher Singh, natural farming is a need of the hour but for that farmers need a lot of support.Good idea, but no planning: ExpertsThe Modi-1 government had announced doubling farmers income by 2022. Now the Modi-2 government has been saying that zero budget farming will help farmers double the income, but is silent about the actual road map. Farmers need solutions not suggestions and there should be budgetary provisions under it to support farmers if crop fails under it, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartya Kisan Union (BKU), Dakaunda.Zero budget farming is good farming practice but in Punjab, which is the food bowl of the country and contributing around 30 million tonnes food grain to the central pool annually, shifting from the current form of farming to zero budget farming is impractical because it will drastically bring down the yield during the first some years. The country may suffer food shortage. Also zero budget farming needs a lot of research and development and huge funds to support the farmers in case their yield goes down drastically, said Professor Gian Singh, former head of the economics department, Punjabi University, Patiala.He also asked how this farming would double the income of 75% farmers of the country who have marginal land holdings on which they grow grain for the consumption of their families only.Dr Charanjit Singh Aulakh of the School of Organic Farming, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), said growing organic food is a great step but Punjab is the granary of the country and the huge shift from inorganic to natural farming is not possible here because for some years, the yield goes down.(For this produce we need markets also because the rate of it is double than that of the other crop. Farmers must be educated against the blatant usage of fertilisers and pesticides first and then transition to natural farming, he added.)"

But within its rural ecosystem, lies the virtues of self-reliance and sustainability, models that the modern world is now frantically trying to mimic. The bearers of Indias indigenous heritage, especially our enduring art and crafts, are embedded within these village clusters, but continue to be disengaged from the mainstream for the large part. Dastkari Haat Samiti is an annual occasion to re-connect with these occupations through a crafts bazaar that highlights these artists.This year, 90 artisans from remote parts of India are showcasing and selling their craft. The idea of Swadeshi as propounded by Mahatma Gandhi is seen abundantly through their practice.This year being Gandhis 150th birth anniversary, the Samiti has commemorated the man who revolutionalised the handicraft sector, with a special display.Gandhi is not just a philosophy to be read and intellectualised. It is found in the hands of these craftsmen, says Jaya Jaitly, Founder of the Samiti.These metaphors as portraiture or abstract forms are found on tie and dye work, shibori embroidery, batik, durry weaving, traditional art styles like Godhna, Gond, Patachitra, Miniature, Madhubani, Worli, Kavad Art and Terracotta.Crafts depicting Gandhi include wood carving and inlay, bamboo, rice and thread work, Sanjhi paper cut work and silver work.As Jaitly walks us through this make-shift village, sounds of Alghoza, Dhadd, and Ektara folk instruments greet at every step.A few steps down the aisle, we are greeted by a reserved man. His dexterity is remarkably seen is the use of fine, narrow garlands that he makes out of paddy husk and thread, both practically no cost materials.He has also made a 4ft Gandhi statue with these materials. He tells us he can make anything we fancy and that too, right in front of us.There is Mohd Arshad from Uttar Pradesh who has craved a smiling face of Gandhi from a wooden block.West Bengals Kartik Manna has used batik to depict the Dandi march and Babus chakra among other elements of Swadeshi. Uttar Pradesh based Mohd. Kalams carpet weaving with Gandhis shadow-like portrait is striking too, while Ranjeet Kumar Paswan from Bihar has created an intricate Godana painting showing Gandhi walking.Along another path, perched upon a stool sipping tea is an artist who, were told, hails from a far-flung village in Madhya Pradesh. This craftsman consults a famous book of birds by the late ornithologist Dr Slim Moizuddin Abdul Ali. He handpaints birds exactly as shown in the book over small papier-mch. I tell him he should charge double the price because an ordinary village person cannot do this. Only a master artist like him can.Till: October 8,At: Mati Ghar Grounds, IGNCA and Twin Art Gallery"

Whereas, we need to do a lot in Delhi and we are trying, however all governments and all agencies need to work to stop crop burning also (sic).The National Green Tribunal had also directed the office of chief secretary of Delhi and neighbouring states to constitute special cells for monitoring the problem of air pollution by burning of crop residue, on a daily basis this month.According to data from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), the state had recorded 435 incidents of stubble burning till October 11 last year. This year, the figure has shot up to 630.Amritsar alone has reported 295 incidents of farm fires during the period.

The overall count this year will be less than last year, he asserted.Mr. Pannu said that according to the Centres data, stubble burning incidents in Punjab from October 1 to 10 reduced from 1,714 in 2016 to 430 in 2019.The Punjab government gave 28,000 farm implements, such as happy seeder, super straw management system, paddy straw chopper and mulcher, to farmers and cooperative societies on subsidised rates in 2018 and has sanctioned 23,000 more this year, he said.Of the 23,000 machines, 15,000 have already been disbursed, he said.Farmers claim it is unimaginable for everyone to buy the expensive modern farm machinery to manage stubble.They say they cannot afford to rent it as the rising diesel prices have increased the input cost manifold.Mr. Pannu said a financial incentive of 100 per quintal of paddy can resolve the problem once and for all.On an average, a farmer reaps 28-30 quintals of rice in one acre. 100 per quintal will mean 2,800 to 3,000 per farmer per acre which is sufficient to cover the fuel cost for using machines, he said.The Punjab government is also conducting a massive awareness drive which includes meetings with farmers, radio jingles, and public advertisements on TV and in the print media, he said.The Punjab Pollution Control Board has also roped in around 1.2 lakh NSS volunteers from all government universities in the state in the awareness campaign against stubble burning.We have formed around 6,000 teams, each comprising 20 members, which have been visiting every village in the state and persuading farmers against burning crop residue, PPCB chairman S.S. Marwah said.Mr. Marwah said Delhi itself is responsible for its bad air and Punjabs contribution to its pollution is insignificant.The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, which noticed a spike in stubble burning incidents over the last few days, said these will start affecting Delhis air quality now.The stubble burning activity in Haryana, Punjab and nearby border regions are moderate but increasing, it said.After oscillating between satisfactory and moderate categories till October 9, the national capitals air quality turned poor for the first time on Thursday, two days after effigies of Ravana, Meghnad and Kumbhakarana were burnt on Dussehra."

We can only guess how much basmati Iran will buy, said Ashok Sethi, director with basmati exporters association that engages in an annual trade of at least Rs30,000 crore export of aromatic varieties of rice.There is no commitment of exports from Iran but it is likely they will book some stock because of the high quality grain produced in India, particularly Punjab, Sethi added.Iranian ambassador to India, Dr Ali Chengeni, who was in Chandigarh last month, had said that if India does not buy oil from Iran, his country would not import basmati from Punjab. Even now Iran maintains its stand, so we want our government to talk to them, adds Sethi.Of the total 40 lakh tonne basmati (worth Rs 30,000 crore) exported from India every year, 16 lakh tonne goes to Iran and Saudi Arabia, with Punjab and Haryana collectively contributing to 75% grain exported, and Punjab contributing the larger share.In Punjab a total of 15 lakh acres is under basmati cultivation this season. The 1509 variety is sown over 40% of the area (6 lakh acres) and rest, which is the 1121 variety, is expected to ripen in November. The 1509 variety has fetched Rs2,500 per quintal but prices are expected to fall when the 1121 variety arrives because of apprehensions of glut.A team of exporters from Iran will try to carve a middle path with the Indian government so traders and farmers dont suffer. Despite the fact that oil imports have stopped, we can import dry fruit and urea from Iran so that our corpus contains the funds, adds Sethi.So far the scenario is not worrisome, as the quality of our aromatic grain has improved and traders from other states are also buying basmati from Punjab, said secretary agriculture, KS Pannu. In 2017, after the traces of insecticide tricyclazole was reported in basmati by European countries and Saudi Arabia, Punjabs agriculture department and the exporters association ran a campaign to control the usage of insecticide and pesticide.Pannu said he is hopeful that trade sanction over Iran will be lifted as with higher basmati export, prices too would increase manifold.BASMATI16 lakh tonne  total basmati exports from India to IranRs 14,000 crore  worth of export to Iran45% of total basmati grows in Punjab15 lakh acres  under basmati cultivation in PunjabFirst Published: Oct 13, 2019 23:29 IST"

Having so far sold 40 hens for Rs 10,000, Shubhangi (35) says she earns more than she ever did from domestic work in Mahad, a hilly region in Raigad.Like Rajaram, 700 women in Mahad are indulging in poultry farming. Each paid Rs 3,000 to get a shed for 100 chicks constructed last year. They underwent a two-day training program under experts. Dilip Khambate, project manager in Raigad, said in Mahad 90 per cent families have at least one member who migrates to Pune or Mumbai for additional income. During monsoons, they return to Raigad for paddy cultivation, but with scanty rainfall in last three years, the rice cultivation has been badly hit.Last year, around 2,200 families were surveyed in Mahad and 700 economically poor, migration affected women, several of them widows, were selected to do poultry farming. We helped them construct a shed and gave them 100 chicks, all 21 days old and fully vaccinated. Thirty kg of poultry feed was given free to start poultry farming, Khambate said.AdvertisingRaigads deputy commissioner of animal husbandry department, Dr Subhash Mhaske, said they provided support in vaccination of chicks.Shubhangis husband had migrated to Mumbai to work at a press unit. Two years ago, the factory shut. He was jobless. My income was not enough to feed our two kids, she said. Last June, the landless couple was informed about the poultry project. They borrowed Rs 5,000 and bought a 100 square ft land. Today, Shubhangi does three daily visits to feed the chicks and sweep the shed. Locals from nearby villages come to buy meat at her shed. I sell a hen for Rs 250, she says, then adds, Now even my kids eat chicken regularly. She has also started brinjal, ladyfinger and cucumber plantation nearby to grow enough to feed her family.The chicks take at least 70 days to gain over a kg weight before they are ready to be sold, and 80 days before they start laying eggs. Dapoli, 40 km away, provides a good market as several tourists have a taste for country chicken.Poultry farming in this water-scarce region has become a profitable revenue model as these women need only 2-5 litres per day for 100 chicks.Poultry farming has been carried in Vidarbha and Marathwada pockets too. In Raigad, we are seeing it as a good income source for women. This will prevent migration, said Mhaske, deputy commissioner of animal husbandry. He added the government has also started similar poultry program is 45 tribal villages with over 840 beneficiaries.Neelam Makhejani, country director of Childfund, said they plan to scale up to include 5,000 women.Arvind Sutar, who coordinates with vendors to sell the hen, said there are 44 vendors in the region where chicken at the wholesale rate of Rs 125 per kg can be sold. The women plan to use self-help groups to sell the hens in neighbouring villages to fetch better prices."

Read MorePunjab produced 83% GHGs in 2018Problems in use of CRM, happy seedersBest solution: plough paddy straw back into soilChoice of paddy varietyDespite numerous efforts made by Punjab and Haryana governments, paddy stubble burning continues to hound the states, much to the chagrin of environmentalists and experts.Though the number of incidents of paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana have reduced in the last three years, experts feel that a lot more needs to be done. A committee constituted by the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare to look into the issue of crop residue burning has flagged off serious concern regarding initiatives being taken by the state governments. The committee has called for an urgent need to look into after-sales service for the crop residue management (CRM) machinery, especially happy seeders, in Punjab and Haryana. The committee has also recommended modification of agronomic practices according to local and farm-level conditions.The committee headed by Nagesh Singh, head and consultant in the centre for poverty studies and social registry of National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD), has found that despite various efforts Punjab has recorded the higher number of paddy farm fires in 2018 when compared with Haryana. A total of 28.10 million tonnes of paddy straw was produced in Punjab and Haryana in 2018 out of which 11.3 million tonnes was burnt in fields. Punjab accounted for 88.15% of the paddy straw burnt in these two states.This year, despite all measures, Punjab saw 4,373 incidents of paddy straw burning till October 23. Haryana has registered 2,714 farm fire incidents.Around 23 million tonne of green house gases (GHGs) and particulate matter (PM) was estimated to be emitted from paddy residue burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in 2018. Out of the 23 million tonnes of GHG and PM emission, Punjab contributed 82%, Haryana contributed 11% and UP 7%. Of the total emissions, carbon dioxide contributed 93.7% of the pollutants.In Punjab, Sangrur, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Mansa and Patiala districts witnessed high incidence of paddy straw burning. Whereas in Haryana, highest number of farm fires were witnessed in Fatehabad, Sirsa, Kaithal, Karnal and Kurukshetra. The committee has also recommended, Some form of coercive action, such as imposition of fines on farmers still indulging in burning of paddy straw would also be helpful in combating straw burning.The committee, after interaction with various farmer bodies in a number of districts in Punjab and Haryana, has recommended, both the state governments would need to frame rules on after-sales service and work out an incentive/disincentive mechanism for machinery suppliers so that they invest in after-sales service.Citing an example, the committee, during one of its visits to the Sirsa district in Haryana, found that after an initial one or two days, happy seeders developed snags and lack of after-sales support from the vendor left farmers with no other option but to resort to crop burning . Another significant observation by the committee is that untrained or poorly trained happy seeder operators have resulted in unnecessary snags. This was pointed out by a farmer producer organisation, being assisted by a team of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) that is supporting crop residue management initiatives in 19 villages in Ludhiana and Patiala districts.The interaction with farmers also led the committee members come to a conclusion that delayed delivery of happy seeders is one of the main reasons for burning paddy residue. The committee, therefore, has strongly recommended that CRM machinery needs to be provided to farmers latest by September 30. Procurement of paddy in Punjab grain markets starts from October 1.The committee has pointed out that many farmers took to CRM machinery for sowing wheat for the first time in 2018. Naturally, they were apprehensive. The committee, in its interaction with farmers has found out that those who used happy seeder for sowing wheat are satisfied with the growth of the wheat crop. The committee recommended that this should also be publicised among farmers.Both Punjab and Haryana governments as well as the central government have been trying to convince farmers for a long time now to move from paddy-wheat cropping cycle and try something else. But these efforts have not been very successful, noted the committee.The other measure that the governments have been pushing quite aggressively through incentives is the utilisation of paddy straw in industrial applications, especially power generation.But the committee, after studying the ground scenario, feels that the most sustainable solution for paddy straw is its incorporation in the soil. This can be easily achieved by supporting farmers in buying CRM machinery and running a sustained information, education and communication campaign for proper utilisation of the machinery, reads the report.Many farmers have also told the committee that their choice of paddy varieties is influenced by the preference of the rice millers and the price that millers are willing to pay, outside the scope of the minimum support price. This is an issue that needs further examination and a solution that is acceptable to the farmers should be worked out, the committee has recommended.According to the farmers feedback, the earliest maturing variety of paddy, PR 126, had a higher brokerage percentage during milling. The committee pointed out there were reports that many millers had advertised in newspapers in May to discourage farmers from planting PR 126. Punjab has a strong network of more than 3,600 rice mills and they play a major role in the varieties that the farmers grow, reads the report.In the study conducted by the committee, basmati paddy variety has come across as a crop that leaves behind very little residue, as it is harvested mostly manually. But this is a choice the governments have to consider carefully weighing in the other factor, basmati guzzles a lot of water than non-basmati varieties."
2019-10-27,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/oct/27/western-odisha-farmers-strike-gold-with-black-rice-2053617.html,Western Odisha farmers strike gold with black rice,"Mayank Bhusan Pani ByExpress News ServiceSAMBALPUR: A group of farmers in Western Odisha is not just reaping the benefit of cultivating black rice but also popularising the crop among paddy growers in the region.Black rice has a niche market for its nutritional and medicinal benefits, both in Odisha and outside. Known as Kalabati Dhana in local parlance, the indigenous rice variety is being grown by a few farmers in Western Odisha, Bargarh and Sambalpur particularly, as the crop fetches a premium price with little input cost as compared to the normal white rice.One among them is Sudam Sahu, a progressive farmer from Bargarh who has been growing Kalabati Dhana from 2014. Five years back, Sahu collected two varieties of black rice seeds from Sambhav Farm in Nayagarh which he has preserved till now.I came to know about benefits of this rice variety from various sources and decided to experiment on one acre of land. The return was good because it was in demand due to its medicinal properties, said Sahu, who grows the rice using organic methods. Kalabati gives a yield in 150 days. According to rice scientists, black rice has more vitamins, calcium and other minerals compared to white rice besides, it is rich in fibre and has anti-carcinogenic properties. The plant is black in colour and so is the grain.Over the next few years, Sahu collected more varieties of black rice and at present, he has 12 varieties of seeds of which, four varieties - Kalabati, Kala Maliful, Handisal and Debanna - have huge demand in many States outside Odisha. During the current season, he mobilised 50 to 55 farmers for growing these four varieties over an area of 60 to 70 acres. And he has also sold 70 quintals of seeds in other States.""We used to sell the seeds as well as rice at Rs 500 per kg. Since we want to popularise black rice in the region, we have revised the price for local market. From this season, we are selling rice at Rs 150 per kg and seeds at Rs 200 to Rs 250 per kg in local market. Besides, we are planning to gift a fixed quantity of black rice to other farmers here to encourage them to start growing Kalabati Dhana,"" said Sahu.He claims to have grown another variety of black rice -Buddha Bhog - this crop season which is a boon for diabetic patients as it helps in controlling sugar levels.Like Sahu, Sunil Pradhan of Hatibari under Jujumura block had cultivated the crop over seven acres during last kharif season and harvested 12 bags per acre, which he sold at Rs 500 per kg. ""The State Government is not very serious about black rice because it is low yielding. But if it includes black rice in its procurement schedule and facilitates marketing, growing Kalabati Dhana will become beneficial for both farmers and locals,"" said Pradhan.Currently, the State Government is not providing any incentive for growing black rice.While 70 farmers are growing Kalabati Dhana in Bargarh, 20 farmers are trying their luck with it in Sambalpur."

The hapless farmers of Punjab and Haryana pitted against the angry, breathless urbanites of the National Capital Region. The farmers are burning paddy stubble, contributing to between a fifth to a third of the air pollution in Delhi these days. This has pushed the air quality to unliveable levels. It is endangering the lives and well-being of hundreds of thousands of people. Its also poisoning the farmers themselves.Its ironic. Paddy needs water, but Punjabs water tables have fallen precipitously. To conserve water, farmers were asked to delay paddy sowing in time for the rains. At the other end of the paddy cycle, the new scheme left little time between the paddy harvest and the next sowing season. There isnt enough time to pull out the stubble by hand, for sowing the next crop on time is critical.Ive met several women whove been plucking out stubble from the fields. They appreciate the stubble  it means adding to their meagre annual income. The stubble is mixed with greens as fodder in the winter. One of them told me that they were too few in number to replace burning with plucking in such a short window of time. One might argue that in public interest, its worth using the MGNREGS instrument to ensure stubble is manually handled, not turned to char. But thats an idea that requires a smart policy intervention based on inter-state coordination in a political ecosystem. During my discussions on stubble burning from several farmers, Ive been surprised by their dismissal of the Happy Seeder (a technology I was optimistic about) for financial, logistical and social reasons.The only sustainable way forward is to work with farmers to change what is planted. The best crop option is millets, as many themselves point out. Apart from using very little water, millets are suited for the land, and can be climate-resilient. They are highly nutritious. But, this would mean giving up the rice option.Back in Delhi, the demand is growing for Punjab to control the farmers. The chief minister says theres little he can do unless states act against the farmers. Meanwhile, everyones breathing poisoned air.The crisis requires new kinds of cooperation. Delhi can prevent its annual health catastrophe by creating markets for these nutritious millets. What if Punjab and Haryana included millets in their mid-day meals in schools? Apart from positive health outcomes for children, this could also be a fix for an earlier, polluting policy flaw. Delhi could offer to work with Punjab to identify how much millet supply it can procure and consume next year, and pilot a downstream project in select schools. The lessons should be incorporated to scale up and feed children with millets more frequently. Punjab should do this too. But it should also work with specific districts to grow millets and incentivise this change by guaranteeing prices, in coordination with Delhi.Its time to go beyond looking at the issue as a zero-sum game.Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi must come together.Bharati Chaturvedi is founder and director, Chintan Environmental Research and Action GroupThe views expressed are personal"
2019-11-03,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/urea-shortage-troubles-pineapple-farmers/article29866392.ece,Urea shortage troubles pineapple farmers,"A shortage of urea has left the States pineapple farmers in distress.Urea, along with potash, is the most needed input for pineapple, both for growth and for uniform flowering, says Joy Mathew, pineapple farmer. He points out that there appears to be less of urea being allotted for the State.The shortage comes at a time when farmers are coping with excess rainfall and trying to recoup previous seasons losses through more intense cultivation, says Mr. Mathew. Pineapple price has dropped to 18 a kg for best quality fruit now, but farmers expect the price to move up with the rain subsiding.In place of rubberAnother pineapple farmer Baby John says the acreage under pineapple cultivation has gone up substantially with farmers in Kottayam, Kanjirappally, Pathanamthitta, and Kozhikode using vacant land for pineapple cultivation as little rubber replantation is taking place. It is estimated that around 18,000 hectares is under pineapple cultivation in the State with about 5,000 farmers in the business.Fertilizer industry sources say a key reason for the shortage is the more than average rainfall across south India, which has boosted the demand for urea for paddy cultivation in States such as Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu reservoirs are full and urea allocation has gone to rice-growing areas in large quantities, sources indicate.Even in Kerala, allotments are mostly earmarked for rice-growing areas in Thrissur and Alappuzha, sources say. A load of around 1,200 tonnes arrived in Aluva last week. While the consignment may meet the demand temporarily in some areas, it is not sufficient to meet the demand across the State, Mr. John adds. Priced at 6 a kg after subsidy, urea is a sought-after fertilizer input among farmers across India.The FACT factorMeanwhile, industry sources say a key reason for the shortage of urea in Kerala is the stoppage of production by Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) in 2003.The FACT plant had a capacity to produce two lakh tonnes of urea a year, of which one lakh tonne was allocated for Kerala, where the demand is between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes a month."

He hopes his crop, the Pusa 1121 variety of basmati rice, would be ready for harvest in the next couple of days.Farmers in and around his village mostly grew basmati rice and harvested the crop manually, he said. The grain of basmati is damaged during mechanised harvesting and fetches a lower price. We therefore harvest using labour, though it costs a little extra, said Mr. Jitender. Farmers, he said, make up for it by selling parali (the upper part of paddy cut during harvest). He claimed that incidents of paddy stubble burning in and around his village have virtually stopped over the past two years because of the growing demand for parali as fodder. The parali usually fetches a farmer 2,000-3,000 per acre. The stubble is mixed in the field while preparing the land for the next crop, said Mr. Jitender.The region comprising Jhajjar, Sonipat, Panipat, and Jind districts, mostly growing basmati varieties, account for only 20-30% of stubble burning incidents; the majority of fires are reported from Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Karnal and Yamuna Nagar districts  better known as the rice bowl of Haryana. The farmers in this region prefer high-yielding PR variety because of easy availability of water and the harvesting is done through combine harvesters. The removal of stalk and straw left in the field is a labour-intensive process.Combine harvestingMalkeet Singh of Landi village in Kurukshetra said small farmers could not afford to incur three-four times the usual cost to prepare the field for the next crop after combine harvesting and preferred to set the stalk and the straw on fire. Instead of treating the farmers as criminals and registering a case for burning crop residue, the government should compensate us. The inputs cost of farming has increased several fold over the years, but the price for paddy has reduced to half. The farmer is well aware of the consequences, but it is cost-effective for him to burn [the stubble], said Mr. Malkeet.Rajinder Singh, president, Haryana Gyan Vigyan Samiti, Karnal, who is working with farmers of around a dozen villages in his area to combat stubble burning, said the government must link cutting of paddy stalk and clearing of fields after combine harvesting with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to deal with the problem effectively.It will be a win-win situation for all. The labourers would get work under the MGNREGS and the stubble burning would stop, he said.Hans Raj of Firozpur Bangar village in Sonipat said the farmers were an easy target to blame for air pollution, but industries and vehicles were responsible for the prevailing situation in Delhi-NCR and the National Capital Region.Farmers burning the crop residue is mostly in Punjab and Lahore in Pakistan. There are very few instances in Haryana, he said, adding that parali was, in fact, in short supply in his village.Local parali trader Gopi said the paddy residue is in huge demand in dairies and cowsheds and is also used for packaging purposes. He said he bought the parali from around a dozen villages in Kharkhoda area of Sonipat and not a single instance of crop burning was reported there this year. Why would the farmer burn when he can make good money out of it, he asked.With the farmers failing to fetch adequate price for their produce, 3,000 per acre for parali is a welcome money for them, said Shamsher Singh, from the neighbouring Saidpur village."

An official of the Punjab government told News18, The Act was one that had to be implemented due to the water crisis the state was facing. But while it helped with its aim of preserving water, it had a series of unintended consequences and compounded some existing problems.A law, a labour crisis and unintended consequencesThese existing problems and unintended consequences can be traced back to five decades ago, to the 1970s, with the advent of the green revolution in the plains of Haryana and Punjab. Since then, the agricultural landscape in Punjab and Haryana has remained affected by a series of changes  the increasing cultivation of paddy, a decline in groundwater levels, growing mechanisation of agriculture, migration, and, finally, the 2009 legislation.HS Jat, principal scientist at the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI), explained that ultimately it is a question of economics. While there was no problem with the availability of labour, there was no stubble burning. Harvesting was done by hand. Shiv Kumar Lohan, assistant research engineer at Punjab Agricultural University, added that initially, the harvest would be cut by hand and would be cut right at the root.This changed in the 1990s, with Punjab facing a labour shortage. There were new jobs in a newly liberalised economy. Given that wages were low and the job was physically laborious, most of the labour was brought in from eastern India, said Jat, and noted that the period coincided with the introduction of combine harvesting. But even then, harvesting would be done by hand. When the NREGA scheme came into effect, migration from regions like Bihar decreased, he added.The mission statement of the 2005 scheme was to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.More unintended consequences, the Punjab government official admitted. There was a noticeable shift after the 2005 NREGA scheme, he explained Workers now had work in their home states. They didn't need to move far, and wide and that meant that farmers in Punjab had no option but to adopt the combine harvesters.Add to this another crucial factor. Farmers get only a small window of about 15 days between crops. If the sowing is delayed, then the yield is decreased by about 20-25 per cent, added Jat. He explained that the Pusa Basmati 1509 variety of rice was being grown for the past five-six years, since it matures early, ripening in 120 days and its height is short. But a temperature change of just two-four degrees (because of climate change) can result in it taking 160 days in maturing.The result: a single hectare of land that was cultivated by 250 people, is now being done by a single machine. Multiply that 31,267 times. That's the number of fires that have been recorded in Punjab alone since September 23, as per data maintained by the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre.Jat went on to break down the farmers problem of dealing with the stubble amid a labour shortage and warming temperatures due to climate change, to its most basic: (To manage) 25 million tonnes of stubble in a fortnight versus a technology that can be produced for one rupee, the cost of a matchbox.The situation is identical in Haryana. In the district of Karnal alone, a total of at least 120 FIRs have been lodged against farmers. Deputy director (agriculture) Aditya Dabas said, The problem is that 10-15 years ago, the harvesting was manually done. It would take 2 days to harvest a field and there was no requirement of any fire. Now, the machines are doing it...fast...and they leave behind stubble.""Rice, water and climate changeRice was introduced in 1970, after the green revolution, with its main target areas being the states of Punjab, Haryana and western parts of Uttar Pradesh. Since then the cultivation of the crop has spread to 450 million hectares, said Jat.The 2009 Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act was a reflection of the innate problems that the sole cultivation of rice has. Simply put, rice uses up groundwater like few other crops do.The Act, which barred nursery sowing and transplanting of paddy before May 15 and June 15 in a bid to ensure that rainwater and groundwater are utilised for production, shifted the harvest closer to the winter. This meant that the stubble fires were happening later in the year, when the air was colder and had more moisture. The result: more pollution, an official at the Met department said.But there are larger concerns about the future of rice and food security with the mounting threats of climate change. Consider this: each degree Celsius increase in global temperatures would, on average, reduce the global yield of rice by 3.2 per cent, found a study, published by American scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2017. The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) underscored that the number of malnourished people in drought-sensitive countries, like India, had increased by 45 per cent in the last seven years, in a report released this year.In August, during the launch of a special report on climate change and land by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Geneva, experts warned of the inevitability of yields declining especially in the tropics, along with inflation and reduced nutrient supply impacting nutrition. As Hans-Otto Prtner, a working group co-chair of the IPCC put it, there was no possibility for anybody to say, Oh, climate change is happening and we (will) just adapt to it. The 2009 law had only stemmed water depletion -- not stopped it. Nowhere is this more obvious than Haryana. Today, the state, in spite of occupying just 1.5 per cent of Indias total landmass accounts for 15 per cent of its total agricultural produce, with 96 per cent of the states arable land under cultivation.A 2017 report by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Indias apex water monitoring agency, found that 78 out of 128 blocks across 22 districts in Haryana were over-exploited or dark zones  where pumping of groundwater exceeds 100 per cent. Since 2013, when the survey was last conducted, these dark zones have increased by a figure of 12. This misuse of groundwater, scientists and experts point out, can primarily be attributed to the growth of paddy farming in the state  an increase of seven times in just 50 years. The state also has the dubious distinction of having the least forest cover in the country of just 3.59 per cent, as per the Forest Survey of India 2018.The groundwater depletion is increasing every year since rice needs at least 150 centimetres of water, added Jat. Rainfall, he explained, contributed to less than half of this on average, so the rest was dependent on rainwater and the deficit is increasing every year. Heavy rainfall (is happening) in a short period, so the water is being drained, he said.So many people have called for crop diversification. Despite the productivity of rice and wheat being the same, farmers have been unable to adopt maize because here the government gives assured procurement for rice, although minimum support price is there for rice and wheat, Jat said. So there should be an assured procurement of maize as well, which will solve the issue.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-11-05,https://www.news18.com/news/india/blame-on-punjabs-malwa-belt-for-47-of-stubble-burning-but-experts-says-mechanisation-push-real-culprit-2374437.html,Blame on Punjab’s Malwa Belt for 47% of Stubble Burning. But Experts Says ‘Mechanisation’ Push Real Culprit,"New Delhi: The Centre on Monday named four districts of Punjab for contributing to 47 per cent of stubble burning incidents. These include Bathinda, Sangrur Patiala and Tarn Taran districts of the vast Malwa belt of Punjab.The Malwa belt of Punjab is one of the three major regions including Majha and Doaba that make up the state. It is located south of the river Sutlej and make up a majority of Punjab region consisting 11 districts.Famous mainly for cotton farming, the belt includes cities like Ludhiana, Rupnagar, Patiala, Mansa, Firozpur, Moga among others. Besides cotton, the Malwa belt also produces large quantities of paddy.Food and trade policy analyst Devinder Sharma told News18 that it is primarily the small and marginal farmer that are contributing to stubble farming. He, however, reminded that stubble burning has increased due to the rise in combine harvester machines because of mechanisation in the region.The area under stubble burning increases with the increase in number of combine harvester machines. It is because when the machine operates it leaves behind a stock of 1 feet standing. This is the stubble that the farmer has to cut despite the use of technology and machinery, he said.Sharma suggested that much of the issue of stubble burning is due the corporate nexus behind the capitalisation of technology and labour in Indian agriculture. We need 1 lakh tractors in Punjab, but we have 4 lakh. We are pushing six machines to the farmer to harvest and sow. They are forced to constantly update the technology, he said.Last year, under a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) more than 28,000 Happy Seeder machines were sold in Punjab. These tractor-operated machines, costing around Rs 1.5 lakh, were developed by the Punjab Agricultural University so that farmers can directly sow seeds, without losing the stubbles organic value.The paddy is first harvested using a combined harvester or tractor of 55 horsepower and more, fitted with state mandated Super SMS (Stubble Management System) equipment. Despite the subsidies, heavy agricultural equipment cost between Rs 14 lakh and Rs 22 lakh on average. The Centre gives 80 per cent subsidy to cooperatives for the purchase of Happy Seeder, while individual farmers are given 60 per cent subsidy.However, farmers in Punjab have voiced strongly against the Centres non-cooperation to provide them compensation of Rs 200 per quintal to manage stubble by employing labour instead of giving subsidies on equipment. As a mark of protest, farmers in Punjabs Mansa district burned stubble last week.In addition to issues related to machinery, stubble burning in Malwa belt also arises from the kind of crop grown, farmer rights activist Ramandeep Singh told News18.More than 30 lakh hectares is under cultivation in Punjab this season. Of this figure, around 6 lakh hectare has basmati rice growing, while the rest is paddy. Basmati can be harvested by hand. The problem mostly arises with harvesting paddy with SMS machines, he said, reasoning why unaffordability of equipment and cropping pattern make a bad combination.Here, Jagmohan of the Bharatiya Kisan Union provides details. Sangrur district has highest percentage of paddy production while Patiala comes on the second spot in paddy cultivation. More stubble burning witnessed here in these districts. In Tarn Taran, farmers also sow advanced variety of paddy. They go for large-scale cultivation of peas as well thus leading to more stubble burning, he said.He pointed out that the Captain Amarinder Singhs government allowed advance sowing of paddy by 10 days due to the elections this year. This has aggravated the problem by this time of the year. It should be mitigated by mid-November.As a solution to the present problem, Singh opined that Punjab could also attempt to grow more pulses like maize. Paddy residue contain silica which makes them an unattractive fodder option for livestock. The livestock problem does not arise in Haryana because they have an option to grow wheat, he said.The farmer rights activist suggested that the Punjab government could consider giving a Minimum Support Price (MSP) in maize production given that the Centre government last year released a notification allowing ethanol production from maize. Ethanol is used for blending in petrol production and thus more maize production and lesser paddy production is a viable option for both the economy and the environment, he added.The Supreme Court of India on Monday came out strongly against the failure of various agencies in controlling stubble burning leading to grave danger to life in the North of the country specially Delhi NCR region.Delhi and parts of northern India took a breath of relief when on Tuesday the Air Quality Index (AQI) was reportedly better than the past six days. The AQI reported across Delhi and nearby areas was reported between very poor to severe category over the past few days, according the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Local paddy rice prices are firm,"" an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh said. The Indian rupee fell to a two-month low on Wednesday, increasing exporters' margins.Tepid demand from African countries for non-basmati rice has also played a role in dampening exports, which were down 29% year-on-year in August at 644,249 tonnes.Many rice-growing states received rainfall earlier this month, which delayed harvesting and damaged paddy crops ready for harvesting, exporters said.Last week, cyclone Bulbul ripped through coastal areas of Bangladesh and eastern India, damaging 23,000 hectares (56,834.24 acres) of paddy fields, as per a preliminary assessment by Dhaka's agriculture ministry.""We will get a clear picture of the extent of the damage by next week,"" said Mizanur Rahman, a senior official of Department of Agriculture Extension.This could be a major blow to the country at a time when farmers have been unable to secure benchmark prices for produce, with no fresh overseas deals in sight.Elsewhere, Thailand's benchmark 5% broken rice edged up to $395-$409 a tonne from last week's $390-$408. Demand for Thai rice has remained relatively flat despite some optimism over a recent rice deal with Iraq, traders saidHowever strength in the baht - Asia's best-performing currency this year - continued to dent demand for Thai rice, making it more expensive than grain from competitors such as Vietnam and India.""Right now, domestic prices are too low for farmers,"" a Bangkok-based trader said. ""Prices could go up as supply may shrink, or the government could step in to buy rice at a high price.""""But the current prices are already higher than our overseas competitors, so it is tough to export.""The Thai government has asked farmers in 22 rice-growing provinces not to grow off-season crops as the country braces for a dry spell amid low water levels in main reservoirs.In Vietnam, rates for 5% broken rice stayed flat at $345-$350 a tonne. The market was dull, with trading done only on previously signed contracts, a trader said. ""I think the market will stay this quiet until the end of next year.""In October, Vietnam exported around 450,000 tonnes of rice, down 5.9% against September, customs data showed.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

Srinivas Reddy said here on Thursday that Telangana was the only State in the country procuring paddy at minimum support price. In spite of the exercise being a financial burden on the State government, it was being procured keeping in mind the interests of farmers.He, however, cautioned the officials against the possibility of paddy produced in the neighbouring States coming into Telangana due to ceiling in procurement and lack of support price there. Some middlemen and traders were trying to sell the paddy from other States here harming the interests of local farmers, Mr. Srinivas Reddy said.Water for irrigationStating that huge production of paddy was expected in Telangana this season owing to the availability of sufficient water in irrigation projects, 247 free power supply to farming and input support given under Rythu Bandhu scheme, the TSCSC Chairman said they have plans to open 3,406 paddy procurement centres this season, of which 1,447 have been opened already. The online procurement management system (OPMS) being followed in the State would also prevent delays in payments to farmers in lieu of sale of their produce, he said."
2019-11-16,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-punjab-s-paddy-boom-hit-delhi-s-air/story-XGXdqrwJqe1B7eXraBhZyK.html,How Punjab's paddy boom hit Delhi's air,"indiaUpdated: Nov 16, 2019 23:40 ISTTheres no better account of Punjabs giant strides in agriculture than Ramesh Chands. The farm-policy head at state-run think-tank Niti Aayog, Chand is a native of the state that sowed Indias Green Revolution. When we were young, nobody grew rice in Punjab, he had told this newspaper on the sidelines of a seminar two years ago.Now, the state is the third-largest producer, the biggest exporter and largest contributor to state-held stocks. Paddy sits on close to 54% of its cropping area during peak kharif or the summer-sown season. Acreage has exploded, from just 0.2 million hectares in 1967 to nearly 3 million hectares sown in 2018-19.The boom is partly responsible for the pollution crisis that has become an annual occurrence in recent years as farmers set afire the stubble left behind after harvesting. Experts say that in addition to the increase in acreage, the timing of sowing and harvesting also adds to the problem.Punjab has legally required farmers to delay paddy sowing to June from May in an effort to save its groundwater  but the measure hasnt paid off, experts say. The idea was that sowing ought to coincide with the monsoon season, which runs from June to September.Since farmers have free power to draw groundwater, they dont wait for rainy spells anyway. On the other hand, harvests now have been pushed back by a month to November, a period when wind directions change and start blowing into Delhi from Punjab, said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology at Skymet, a weather forecasting firm.Palawat said if Punjab were to go back to its earlier practice of sowing in May, it would greatly lessen the pollution problem. Harvesting could be wrapped up a month early in September, when wind directions wont allow smoke from the states paddy leftovers to be blown into the national capital.This is only a visible part of the damage. The transformation into a paddy powerhouse is worrisome for several other reasons too. Diminishing returns have set in, the Green Revolution has faded and the dangers of unsustainable paddy cultivation have begun to bite.The Green Revolution was actually a brown revolution. It was limited to rice and wheat, said Uma Kapila, an economist who formerly taught at Delhis Miranda House.Punjabs rich landscape of corn, barley, gram, lentils and nutritious coarser cereals began disappearing fairly rapidly, within a decade of big cereals entering the state in the late-1960s.Skewed policy nudges are to blame. Over the years, agricultural universities and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research have developed five times as many high-yielding rice varieties than, say, lentils.Research shows rice has not only been environmentally devastating, it has also put limits on the income potential of farmers and flattened the states farm-growth curve. Average farm growth has plateaued around 2%, while it could have been clocking 5% annually if only farmers had not given up cultivating non-cereals, according to research by economists Ashok Gulati and Siraj Hussain of the think-tank ICRIER.This means Punjabs farmers are poorer now. The states agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), a broad measure of farm income, grew only 1.61% annually, less than half the all-India average of 3.5% between 2005-06 and 2014-15, their research shows.The diminishing returns are clear from Punjabs fall from high-farm growth rates of 5.7% achieved between 1971-72 and 1985-86.Punjabs farmers know only one mantra, says Balwinder Singh Sandhu, the states agricultural commissioner: Paddy aur wheat lagaao, mandi mein le jao (Grow paddy and wheat; dump them straight into the markets). With the government ready to procure, theres no need to worry about buyers.At a psychological level, this policy has finished the enterprising ability of Punjabs farmers. At a physical level, paddy has finished all our water and soil and agricultural chemicals have finished our health, says Sandhu.Wheat and rice, the two biggest grains, now account for two-thirds of the states farm income from crops, thanks to steady minimum support prices (MSPs) and assured procurement by the government.MSP is a floor price set by the government. The government then buys paddy and wheat at MSPs rates to build stockpiles for redistribution to the poor.Cheap fertilisers, free electricity for drawing water and better seeds spurred a trend of mono-cropping, or the practice of growing just rice in summer and wheat in winter.Punjab takes about 5,500 litres of water to grow one kg of rice, five times as much China needs, pointing to the states low water productivity. Northern and central districts are severely water depleted, while south-western districts face water logging and soil salinity or alkalinity. Grain bowls such as Muktsar, Fazilka, Bathinda and Faridkot are notoriously degraded.The Central Ground Water Board put out a dire warning in May this year: at the current rate of water extraction, Punjab would be a desert within the next quarter century. Paddy has meant a groundwater extraction rate of 165%, a jump of 16 percentage points since 2013.Hussain said free power is one of the main reasons for Punjabs crisis. It doesnt allow farmers to escape the pull of paddy.I have moved from shallow tubewells to six deep tubewells in my 12 acres. My expenses are going up because I have to dig deeper and deeper every year, says Ravinder Uppal, a paddy grower in Sangrur.Big cereals have stoked an insidious rise in costs, annually growing 5-6%, pushing farmers into debt, says Sandhu. According to a debt investment survey of the National Sample Survey Office, 40% of cultivators in Punjab are indebted. Average debt per rural household stands at Rs 64,548.In fact, the increase in paddy support prices has barely kept pace with rising costs, if one includes the imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital, a cost yardstick known as C2 costs, Sandhu says.Increasing the share of capital, such as harvesters and investment, is necessary for growth. But pumping more and more capital without routine technological advancements can lead to what Nobel winning economist Robert Solow demonstrated to be a steady economic state, where all new investment goes into replacing exhausted capital without productivity gains. The economy stalls, as a result.Punjabs agriculture is right in the middle of such a stagnation, as the Green Revolution has run its course. Why else are 1.5 lakh people migrating abroad every year? asks Sandhu."
2019-11-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/burning-fields-farmers-say-they-are-helpless/article29995283.ece,Burning fields: farmers say they are helpless,"On a November morning, Charanjeet Singh, a 64-year-old farmer in Pakhoke village in Punjabs Barnala district, was sitting outside his house reading a Punjabi newspaper when he noticed something startling: his name had appeared in an article along with three other villagers in a list of FIRs filed by the police for a crime that has become rampant across Punjab at this time of the year  stubble burning.Behind the house, wheat had already been sown in parts of the 24 acres of his charred field.Nahi jalana chahiye, par kya karen, aur koi hal Nahi hai. Majboori hai (The stubble should not be burnt, but what else can we do, there is no other solution. I am helpless), the sexagenarian said sitting on a cot. Mr. Charanjeet is a fourth-generation farmer growing paddy in his fields.And he is not alone.Across Barnala, more than two dozen farmers whom The Hindu met gave the same reason why they burn paddy stubble: Majboori. Any other method to dispose of the crop residue would cost the farmers thousands of rupees per acre in the form of labour, rent and machines and transport cost. A 1 matchbox is the most economical solution for them to prepare their field for the next crop.At least 10 million metric tons of the 20 million metric tons of paddy stubble generated in Punjab every year is burnt by farmers, according to the State government.Wind movementThe north-westerly wind carries the smoke from the stubble burnt in Punjab and Haryana to Delhi, contributing to the citys air pollution in a range between 0% and 53% (in the last two years), as per the central government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research).The issue has become political over the years with the AAP government in Delhi blaming the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments for the pollution the city faces and the central government also getting involved in the blame game.The number of stubble fires in Punjab fields between September 23 and October 13 has grown from 44,845 in 2018 to 48,689 this year  a rise 8.5%, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. On the other hand, the number of fire counts in Haryana in the same period has reduced by about 20%.Most farmers said they came to know from television and newspapers reports that stubble burning contributed to pollution in Delhi, but they did not have any other option.Attempts to stop burningPunjab was traditionally not a rice-growing State. Earlier, it used to grow maize and cotton among other crops in May-June and wheat in October-November.In the 1960s, the government pushed the farmers to grow rice as India had to feed millions of people, said Devinder Sharma, an agricultural expert.Unlike in south India, the farmers in Punjab do not prefer to give paddy stubble as fodder to cattle (they feed them wheat stubble) and thus disposing of the residue becomes a problem, said experts.In the 1980s, the farmers started using combine harvesters to cut paddy and it left longer stubble, about 50-60 cm long, in the fields, compared to cutting by hand, which left behind 5-10 cm long residue. The longer stubble led to increase in burning of stubble.The government has started providing different machines to treat the stubble at 50% subsidy to individual farmers and 80% subsidy to farmers groups.The Supreme Court on November 4 termed the air pollution in Delhi-NCR worse than Emergency and directed the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to immediately stop the farmers from burning the stubble.However, a week later, The Hindu spotted dozens of burning fields in Barnala, Punjab. Following the Supreme Court order, the Punjab government has decided to pay 2,500 per acre to all small and marginal farmers who did not burn their stubble. But the process will take time. Two other Supreme Court directives to the governments  to collect stubble and give machines free of cost to small and marginal farmers  are yet to kick off.On November 13, as Mr. Charanjeet talked outside his house in Punjab, the air pollution levels breached the severe category in Delhi, forcing the authorities to shut all schools in the city for the next two days.Unhappy seederMr. Charanjeet said that he has been burning the stubble for the last 35 years, except for 2018 when bought a Happy Seeder at a subsidised rate of 1.6 lakh.The Happy Seeder is one of the machines the government has been pushing as a solution to stubble burning. It can be attached to a tractor and can sow the wheat seed with the paddy stubble still standing in the field.Last year, after harvesting, Mr. Charanjeet used another machine, straw chopper, to cut the standing stubble into small pieces and evenly distribute it on the field. He then sowed the wheat using Happy Seeder.The crop germination did not happen properly and the layer of stubble caused pest infection. I suffered a loss of about 2 lakh last year, Mr. Charanjeet said, adding, so, I set the field on fire this year. On November 14 afternoon, on a side of Barnala Road, Gurcharan Singh, 43, and his two sons were setting fire to paddy stubble in parts of their 50-acre field. He said he too had tried Happy Seeder, but wasnt happy with the machine at all.We have another 30-acre field where we sowed wheat using Happy Seeder amid the paddy straws which were about 50-cm-long. The produce was less by about two quintal per acre, he said. Also, I couldnt use the stubble from wheat for cattle as the paddy straw got mixed with it, he added.While many of the bigger farmers, who used the machines, faced problems, smaller famers said they could not afford the machines and their running cost.Solutions at handIn Mehal Kalan village, the farmers said that the governments decision to give 2,500 for not burning stubble was announced through loudspeakers at the local gurdwara.Pointing to a field that was on fire, Avtar Singh, 55, who owns a one-acre land, said: The decision [incentive] came very late. Almost 90% of the farmers have already burnt the stubble in their fields. Since everyone else has burnt the stubble, the few who are left are not going to take care of the residue by spending their own money, he added.Barnala District Commissioner Tej Partap Singh Phoolka admitted that stubble burning was happening in the district but said it was less than last year as many farmers had adopted different techniques.We have filed 73 FIRs and have issued 539 challans, but the farmers associations are really strong here and they have announced a dharna here tomorrow [November 15], he said.He said the 2,500 incentive announced by the government will go a long way in stopping stubble burning. Next year, I feel, the burning of stubble will come down by about 80%, he said.The farmer will have to fill up a form after harvest, declaring that he has not burnt the stubble. Then there will be an inspection by the Revenue Department. After that the form will go to the registrar of cooperative society and the money will be deposited in the farmers bank account, he said.The farmers can get the money immediately or it may take up to two months, Mr. Phoolka said.Monetary incentiveWe have been requesting the Central government for the last five years to provide 100 per quintal [of rice] to all farmers, small and big, if they do not burn the stubble. But they have not accepted it. We are also asking them to take the burden of rice from Punjab and procure maize instead at a fixed price, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu told The Hindu.A combination of these two is the only solution to prevent stubble burning. How many people can we put behind the bars, he asked.The farmers said that they can treat the stubble in situ by using a combination of different machines if they get the incentive from the government. We have the idea [how to treat stubble in situ], but we do not have the money, said Mr. Charanjeet.Asked if he is convinced that the government would pay the farmers, he shook his head and said: Kuch Nahi hoga. Sarkar kuch Nahi karegi (Nothing will happen. The government is not going to do anything).Most farmers across Barnala said they were not sure if the government would actually pay the money.Mr. Avtar Singh of Mehal Kalan said that if the government goes back on its promise, it will only worsen the situation. Now that the government has made the promise, if it and does not pay the farmers, they will never believe the government and the burning will go on."

But, Government of Indias Food Ministry informed last month that Government of India would not procure rice/paddy for central pool from the states. I would like to draw your attention towards the fact that payment of proper value of their yield has resulted in prosperity and accelerated development in rural areas. Chhattisgarh remained untouched by the recession across the state in the fields of construction, automobiles etc. This also indicates that the hike in minimum support price has positive effects on financial condition of farmers and also boosts overall economy, stated the CM in his letter.He further said that he met Union Agriculture Minister and Union Food Minister again last week to present his demands but Union government has not reconsidered its decision regarding procurement.Chhattisgarh is known as the rice bowl of India. Government of Indias decision may have adverse effects on procurement along with other long-term negative impacts, he said in the letter.Chief Minister further said, I request you again to kindly issue necessary directive-instructions for procurement of paddy at Rs 2500 per quintal in Chhattisgarh and to accept 32 lakh metric tons of paddy from Chhattisgarh for central pool."
2019-11-20,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-cash-for-stubble-couldnt-save-delhi-from-toxic-air/articleshow/72143625.cms,Why 'cash for stubble' couldn't save Delhi from toxic air,"CHANDIGARH/BHATINDA: I could have got Rs 6,100 and would not have burned my field, said Mohinder Singh while doing the calculation on his fingers. A week after the farmer in Bhamme Khurd village in Bathinda set his one hectare of land on fire, the Supreme Court directed Punjab Haryana and UP governments to give Rs 100 for every quintal of paddy stubble to farmers to manage crop residue.In another farm in Mansa districts Jhunir village, Sukhdev Singh is aware that burning stubble leads to toxic fumes in the air, it even makes the soil less fertile, but he said he didnt have another option. It would have been better if the relief was provided in time, he said.Many farmers that TOI spoke to in several districts welcomed the apex courts decision to give them monetary aid  which many farmer organisations had been demanding for a long time  but admitted that it had come late. Farmers said that by now much of the non-basmati crop has been harvested and fields set afire to prepare for wheat sowing.The Supreme Court had directed the three states on November 6 to dole out the money as operational costs to small and marginal farmers within seven days. With the money, farmers can hire straw management machinery to clear stubble instead of setting it on fire. Following the directives, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh ordered the agriculture department to work out the modalities.But a week on, money is yet to reach farmers. Punjab agriculture secretary and nodal officer to curb farm fires, Kahan Singh Pannu told TOI that the scheme is under process and disbursal of funds would start soon. Pannu added that the cash incentive would be given to farmers with less than two hectares of land. The state agriculture department has sought applications from farmers and village panchayats will also certify whether a farmer has burnt stubble or not, he said.The ideal time to sow wheat is until the second week of November, by which time 80% of the winter crop is sown. This is one reason why farm fires did not show a dip even after the scheme was announced. Farmers did not want to wait that long. Sukhdev Singh Kokri, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) in Moga district, said, While wheat can be sown later as well, late sowing can lead to decreased yield. So farmers are unlikely to wait for the cash to reach them.In Haryana as well, officials said disbursal of funds is likely to start by the last week of November. The state has earmarked Rs 50 crore for the purpose and appointed five financial commissioners to monitor the process.To end the menace, experts have suggested that apart from the cash incentive, crop diversification could be a long-term solution. After the 1960s, when Green Revolution swept through the fields in northwest India, productivity of rice and wheat increased dramatically. In the past three decades, the land of makki di roti has continuously moved towards paddy. When the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy and maize for the 2018-19 kharif marketing season is compared, the gross returns per acre for paddy are Rs 14,000 higher than maize in Punjab. In the 2019-20 kharif season, 29.20 lakh hectares are estimated to be under paddy cultivation in Punjab. In Haryana, it is 13.5 lakh hectares.Former VC of Punjab Agricultural University Kirpal Singh Aulakh advises shift from paddy to alternative crops during kharif season, also to save the states water resources. Over time, area under paddy has grown substantially as farmers get assured marketing of their produce. This has hurt Punjabs key natural resources  water and soil. In US, there is more area under maize now than wheat as there has been a thrust on developing high-yielding varieties of maize that make it the switch attractive to farmers.Leading geneticist and rice breeder Gurdev Singh Khush said crop diversification has been discussed for about 30 years but nobody has proposed an alternative crop. I have suggested soybean as a possibility, Khush had told TOI earlier.A government officer who didnt wish to be named said punitive action like disconnecting power connections should be taken against farmers. The state has already registered over 1,500 FIRs under section 188 of IPC (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant) against farmers found burning stubble."
2019-11-24,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/karimnagar-farmers-on-distress-sale-of-discoloured-paddy/article30064212.ece,Karimnagar farmers on distress sale of discoloured paddy,"Farmers across Karimnagar district are resorting to distress sale of their discoloured paddy to rice millers at less than the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government as IKP procurement centres are refusing to purchase the damaged paddy.The rice millers are paying the farmers  1,500 to  1,600 per quintal against the government MSP of  1,835 per quintal for Grade A variety, and  1,810 per quintal for the common variety. Besides, the rice millers were weighing an extra four kg for each quintal of paddy weighed, and additional one kg for the gunny bag.Short weighingTo compound the farmers woes, if a farmer is arriving tractor load, millers were deducting four to five quintals of paddy per load. Against the normal weight of 51 quintals in a tractor load, millers were paying for only 46 quintals. Farmers allege that weighbridge authorities had colluded with the millers and cheating them.Rythu Ikya Vedika district president M.Venkat Reddy said the farmers were at the receiving end this Kharif season. We expected a bumper harvest following bountiful rains. But the unseasonal rains had shattered our dreams as the crop got discoloured. Though the government had set up IKP procurement centres, officials there are vehemently opposed to purchasing the damaged paddy, he complained.With no other way to dispose of the produce, farmers were approaching millers only to be short-changed by them on the pretext of discoloured paddy. Though the paddy is discoloured, its in good quality and will be good quality of rice after milling, he stated. He added that millers were exploiting the farmers on the discoloured pretext even as the government had not given any instructions to its procurement centres not to buy discoloured paddy from farmers.Mr. Reddy urged the government to take appropriate measures for the procurement of discoloured paddy by the IKP procurement centres, and also traders."

Surprisingly, none of the two is.Going by accounts of some farmers and officials, collection of biometric data of farmers registered under the paddy procurement automation system (P-PAS) seems to have drawn the ire of middlemen and agents of millers who have misinformed and instigated the farmers to go on the path of agitation.Problem started when iris recognition as a method of biometric identification is done at paddy purchasing centres to authenticate the real registered farmers and validate their data under P-PAS, sources in Subarnapur district administration said.Under the new system, registered farmers have to be present at mandis for sale of paddy to Government agencies under decentralised procurement of paddy. Paddy from the farmers can be procured after obtaining iris recognition and thumb impression. Such procedure is adopted in all the paddy procurement districts.It has been a practice since long that agents of local rice millers collect paddy from the farmers at a mutually agreed cost and sell the same at mandis by showing the token issued to registered farmers by the PACS concerned. The rice millers used to get a commission of Rs 200-250 per quintal from the farmers after cost of the paddy is sent to their accounts under DBT from the Government, sources added.The issue of token through SMS to the mobile phones of the farmers from a centralised system in Bhubaneswar to check such irregularities is believed to have triggered panic among rice millers who have engaged such agents in all the districts for paddy collection.Realising that biometric identification will put an end to the current malpractice of selling paddy on behalf of the farmers and they are going to lose crores of business, the rice millers are believed to have instigated farmers to oppose the new system.At a conservative estimate, the commission business alone in Bargarh district, considered to be rice bowl of Odisha with a paddy transaction of about 10 lakh quintal, will be in the range of Rs 5-10 crore.The other major paddy procurement districts include Sambalpur, Kalahandi and Subarnapur.Everyone has a pie in the business starting from PACS further up in the administrative chain. What is unfortunate is that the farmers do not realise the new system will save them from exploitation of the millers and other unscrupulous traders, said a progressive farmer of Bargarh on condition of anonymity.It seems the Government is determined to break the nexus of millers, politicians and procurement agencies by sticking to centralised token system, he added.However, the Government, on its part, appears to have failed to communicate the new system to farmers at large which is aimed at ushering in reforms in paddy procurement."

Madhavilatha on Monday opened a Paddy Purchasing Centre (PPC) at Machilipatnam Market Yard.Buying directlyA total of 264 PPCs have been opened across Krishna district, putting a check on direct involvement of rice millers in procuring paddy from the farmers to ensure implementation of the Minimum Support Price (MSP), said Mr. Nani.In the case of farmers cultivating paddy in the assigned land, the Village Revenue Officer will issue a certificate to be produced at the PPC to allow the paddy purchase procedure without the need of producing the Passbook, added Mr. Nani.No MSP for higher moistureAddressing the farmers, Collector Imtiaz stated paddy with a 17 per cent moisture content would be offered MSP. Paddy with above 17 per cent moisture will also be purchased at the PPCs, but MSP will not be offered, clarified Mr. Imtiaz.Elaborating on the procurement rates, he said: The MSP for Grade A quality is  1,835 per quintal and  1,810 for Common Grade. The government is prepared to purchase the entire paddy that is brought to the PPCs. In Krishna district, paddy was sown in above 1.25 lakh hectares in kharif 2019-20.Protecting farmersJoint Collector K. Madhavilatha said the existing method of paddy procurement was aimed at excluding rice millers from the purchasing cycle. Henceforth, rice millers will have to procure only from the PPCs instead of directly from the farmers and make a killing.Further, Ms. Madhavilath has asked the farmers to ensure registration of their crop before bringing it to the PPCs."

The objective is to make paddy procurement transparent without any discrimination and tampering at the primary society level, he said.Now, farmers will receive tokens through SMS in their mobiles. The new system will empower small and marginal farmers and eliminate ghost farmers, private traders and middlemen, he added.Swain said more opportunity will be given to farmers who failed to sell their paddy on the assigned date provided they have registered their names under Paddy Procurement Automation System (P-PAS).Informing the House that biometric identification has been introduced for the first time to ensure that only registered farmers can sell their produce, he said iris scanners have been provided to all paddy purchase centres (PPC) for authentication of registered farmers.For old, infirm and persons suffering from any disease identification could be done through Aadhaar cards.Moreover, gunny bags will be returned to farmers after delivery of paddy to mandis or cost of the bag will be provided by rice millers tagged to the market yard, Swain added.Procurement has started in Bargarh, Sambalpur, Subarnapur, Nuapada, Balangir, Malkangiri and Koraput districts and the process will start in other districts where harvesting has started.Government has already procured over 1.75 lakh quintals of paddy from these districts by November 24.The Ministers statement came following a direction from Speaker SN Patro as Opposition members created ruckus in the Assembly supporting the agitating farmers and Labour and Employment Minister Sushant Singhs assurance to Bargarh and Sambalpur farmers that Government will procure paddy without token."

We have reduced paddy straw burning by around 40-45 percent, so far.""It was purely through enforcement. We have not made any changes policy-wise. We studied the behavioural pattern of farmers in certain villages who would burn stubble time and again. This time, we specifically concentrated on those villages,"" he said.He said only 10 per cent of around 7,000 villages in Haryana are burning stubble.Haryana produces around 7 million tonnes of paddy straw every year.Almost the whole of paddy straw, except that of Basmati rice, is burnt to make the field ready for sowing of wheat or potato.Experts say farmers resort to burning the crop residue because other solutions are not economically viable.Stubble burning is considered a major reason behind the annual smog episodes in Delhi-NCR.This year, the contribution of farm fires to pollution in the region peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, triggering a public health emergency.The Haryana Pollution Control Board member secretary said the air pollution issue won't resolve without a political will and proper implementation of anti-pollution measures.""Departments such as transport and agriculture should also have a proper policy,"" he said.Narayanan also said that there's nothing ""green"" about green crackers and that ""fireworks should be banned completely (on Diwali). There's no other way out.""With Delhi's air quality plummeting to dangerous levels around Diwali every year, the Supreme Court had in 2018 banned polluting firecrackers and ordered that only green firecrackers, which is said to cause 30 per cent less pollution, can be manufactured and sold and enforced a two-hour limit for setting them off.However, a large number of revelers brazenly flouted the Supreme Court-enforced two-hour limit for bursting crackers this year too.Green pyrotechnics also failed to draw good responses both from sellers and buyers, primarily due to lack of variety, limited stock, and high prices."

""Rahul Gandhi is the undisputed leader of the Congress party. Party workers from across the country are with him and he must return as the Congress chief soon,"" Baghel told PTI.""He is the only national leader who is outspoken on issues concerning the country and puts forth his views aggressively. Ever since he has resigned, people are missing him as an outspoken leader,"" he added.Answering a question, the chief minister said, ""Whenever I meet him (Rahul Gandhi), I will urge him to take over the reins of the party"".Asked if the announcement to reappoint Gandhi as Congress chief is likely to be made at the December 14 rally or after the Delhi Assembly election due early next year, Baghel said: ""I cannot comment on this.""Sonia Gandhi was on August 10 was appointed as Interim President of the Indian National Congress at a crucial meeting of the party's working committee, after Rahul Gandhi refused pleas by partymen to take back his resignation.The announcement was made on night of August 10 after Congress Working Committee (CWC) accepted Rahul Gandhi's resignation at its second meeting of the day.Baghel, appointed the party's star campaigner for the upcoming assembly election in neighbouring Jharkhand, said the Congress-JMM alliance will register a massive victory. ""The ground reality is that the people are fed up with the BJP government and I am hopeful that the Congress-JMM alliance will win 2/3rd majority in the state,"" he said.On the issue of procuring rice from the central pool, Baghel said: ""We are not asking for money from the central government. We are only requesting the slackening of the provision to procure rice from Chhattisgarh for central pool in larger interest of farmers.""According to the decision taken by central government in 2014, rice will not be procured from the states that provide bonus against paddy procurement at support price, the statement issued by the state government said. ""Even if we don't get any relief from the Centre, we will continue to procure paddy at Rs 2500 per quintal,"" he said.Baghel, who will be completing one year as chief minister on December 17 further said: ""We have worked a lot for the farmers and the youth.

As they are selling their stock at much lower price as fixed by the Government, the millers are benefiting from the crisis. The procurement process in the district will start from December 27. Sukadev Behera, a farmer of Dasipur village said he is desperate to sell his produce and it is not possible for him to wait till the procurement process starts at a Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society (PACS), located at Marsaghai, around 12 km from his village.Sukadev said he sold three quintal paddy to a trader for Rs 4,500, which is much less than the MSP of Rs 1,810 per quintal fixed by the State Government for Fair Average Quality (FAQ) paddy. Sankar Parida of Shyamasundarpur said he had harvested 30 quintal paddy from his farmland two weeks back. He said millers and their agents are camping in villages to purchase paddy from farmers.Farmers leader and president of district unit of Krusaka Sabha Umesh Chandra Singh said farmers in the district had started harvesting their crops in November. But, the authorities decided to purchase paddy from the farmers from December 27. The month-long delay forced several farmers to sell their produce to traders at throwaway prices. Till date, only 34,205 farmers have registered their names to sell paddy to the Government against 41,270 last year.Civil Supplies Officer Rajanikanta Das said Odisha State Civil Supply Corporation (OSCSP) has decided to procure 5,47,500 tonne paddy in the first phase from farmers in the district. The task of procuring paddy from the farmers has been entrusted to 116 PACS. After purchasing paddy from the farmers, the PACS will hand over the stock to 14 rice mills in the district. The millers will provide rice to us. We are determined to check distress sale of paddy by the farmers, he said."
2019-12-28,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/dec/28/unseasonal-rains-worry-farmers-2081966.html,Unseasonal rains worry farmers,"By Express News ServiceBHAWANIPATNA/KENDRAPARA: Rains since Thursday have added to the woes of Kalahandi farmers who are already hassled over delay in lifting of paddy from mandis or procurement centres. Farmers after harvesting paddy have stocked them at mandis and threshing yards for procurement.After quality checking of paddy, the stock is procured and then lifted by millers. Farmers alleged that procurement and lifting of paddy at many mandis are being delayed due to lack of adequate vehicles. At some mandis, farmers have been waiting for over a week to sell their stock.They said due to unseasonal rains, moisture level of the grains go up reflecting on the quality. As a result, farmers will fail to get the minimum support price for their produce. Those who could manage to procure polythene sheets have covered their crops while the rest are approaching Civil Supply officials for help.Civil Supply Officer Sibaprasad Dora said so far 22 lakh quintal of kharif paddy has been procured and over 32 lakh quintal would be purchased in the second phase. By the end of the season, procurement will exceed 40 lakh quintal, said Dora. He added that since millers are busy both lifting paddy and delivering milled rice, there is shortage of vehicles for lifting paddy. Steps are being taken to mobilise more millers and vehicles to lift paddy at the earliest. We have set target to lift 1 lakh quintal paddy every day, he said.In Kendrapara district too, farmers are worried over damage to ripe paddy and vegetable crops due to unseasonal rains. In the current crop season, 70 per cent of paddy crops have been harvested and stocked in either open fields, threshing yards or mandis. Farmers fear that crops would be damaged if rains continues.Agriculture Department officials have advised farmers to shift their paddy to safe places and cover them with polythene. However, farmers said many of them cannot afford polythene sheets or labourers to cover and shift the harvested crops. I have recently harvested paddy on two acre of land. Since labourers are not available easily, my entire family harvested the crop which is now in the threshing yard. But how can I shift the large stock to godown now in such a short span of time without labourers? asked Bijay Sahoo, a farmer of Bharatpur.Apart from paddy, groundnut farmers are worried as rains during peak harvesting season might damage the crops. On the other hand, owners of tractors and paddy harvesting machines are minting money by renting them out at a premium."
2019-12-28,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/paddy-procurement-to-begin-from-january-1/article30421553.ece,Paddy procurement tobegin from January 1,"Paddy procurement for Anna Bhagya scheme in the district will commence from January 1, 2020, and the minimum procurement price fixed by the Union government will be paid to the farmers.The Joint Director of Food and Civil Supplies, P.

After remaining reluctant for merger of Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) with Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) yojana since the polls, the State gave in to the convergence of the two schemes towards the end of the year as it was burdened under financial constraints.The convergence will benefit the State with a net saving of Rs 3,060 crore taking the number of beneficiaries to 51 lakh.Eligible farmers will continue to get Rs 10,000 (Rs 6,000 from the Centre and Rs 4,000 from State). However, the State will take care of the landless agricultural households as promised before the election.Farm politicsWith farm politics taking the centre stage after political parties promised moon in their election manifestos during the elections, the farmers started asserting their rights.The Naba Nirman Krushak Sangathan (NNKS), which has been spearheading a movement on its demand over price, prestige and pension, is slowly but successfully emerging as a force to reckon with.Organising its second national mega convention of farmers in the Capital City in November, the NNKS went beyond the demand of price, prestige and pension asking for a right in policymaking.Cyclone Fani & BulbulProne to natural disaster, the State was visited by cyclone Fani in May and Bulbul in November causing considerable damage to the farm sector.Fani took away the livelihood of over 50,000 farmers in six coastal districts of Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Jagatsingpur and Kendrapara by uprooting around 14 lakh coconut trees.The untimely rains under the impact of cyclone Bulbul damaged standing kharif crops mostly paddy in several coastal districts including Balasore and Bhadrak. The Centre came to the rescue of the affected farmers for its prompt and timely assistance.The great onion crisisOnion crisis is not new the state. However, never before the pungent edible bulb has tormented the people so much as it did this year. Considered poor mans diet, onion went beyond the reach of middle-class families for nearly two months with its price skyrocketing to Rs 150 a kg.This great onion crisis thoroughly exposed the inefficiency of the State Government with people asking What happened to the Onion Mission in Odisha? which the ruling BJD announced a couple of years ago to achieve self-sufficiency in production. Similar is the story of State Potato Mission which ended 2017-18 with a miscarriage.Token System under P-PASCentralised token system for paddy procurement, a first of its kind in any part of the country, ran into rough weather with loud protest from farmers of western Odisha demanding its withdrawal and restoration of the old method of physical token issued by PACS.Realising that vested interest groups led by rice mill owners are behind the agitation, the State Government put its foot down and refused to accept any changes.The new system proved to be more efficient with less error and less time consuming for the farmers who used to wait at Mandis for days to sell their surplus paddy."
