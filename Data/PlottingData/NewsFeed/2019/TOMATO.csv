Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: At the time when indications are that the Centre is devising a financial package to quickly address the issue of farm distress, the agriculture ministry has stepped up efforts to roll out some new measures. It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities."

Now that the standards (on food products) are more or less in place, our focus is going to be on compliance, monitoring, inspection and enforcement,"" Agarwal told .A Parliamentary Standing Committee on health and family welfare in a report submitted in 2018 had rapped FSSAI over weak enforcement of food safety laws and also recommended restructuring of the autonomous body that functions under the health ministry.Asserting that the big focus will be on enforcement, Agarwal said while some of the standards are made effective from January 1, the implementation time for other products has been extended by three or six months depending on the cases.The new standards effective from January 1 are for all varieties of pulses, whole and decorticated pearl millet grains, de-germed maize flour and maize grit, textured soy protein, sago flour, bee wax and royal jelly.Microbiological standards for fruits and vegetables and their products, all provisions of organic food regulations and standard for honey, except few parameters where test methods are being validated -- are made effective from Tuesday.According to FSSAI, three-month extension has been given to businesses to comply with the tolerance limit of antibiotics and pharmacology active substances.Similarly, standards for alcoholic beverages will come into force from April 1, 2019 to coincide with financial year requirements of excise laws.Food fortification norms will come into force from June 1, compliance of labelling requirement for frozen dessert would be applicable from July 1, FSSAI said.The regulations on advertising and claims, packaging and labelling requirements of blended edible vegetable oils will come into force from July 1, this year.In 2018, new standards for fruits and vegetables including canned tomato, jam, jelly and marmalade came into effect from July. The revised standards for milk and milk products also came into effect from the same month. LUX LUX ANU ANU"

Beginning Sunday, the next three weekends will see three grand events on the sprawling grounds: Bhim Mahasangam, a meeting of the citys scheduled caste communities on January 6; a two-day convention of national leaders, elected representatives and state office bearers on January 11 and 12; and Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20, when party leaders will address the youth.Senior party leaders claimed Bhim Mahasangam will be a unique event in which chef Vishnu Manohar will break his own record by preparing 5,000 kg of khichdi in a single vessel. Manohar had entered the Guinness Book of Records with a 3,000-kg khichdi event in Nagpur in October 2018. The oversized vessel Manohar used at the Nagpur event has been retrofitted for a bigger quantity of food and transported to Delhi. Gas stoves will be installed on a 15ftx15ft platform constructed close to the dais.We have collected over 10,000 kg of rice and lentils from about three lakh SC families in the past few days for the dish, disclosed Ashok Goel, media convenor, Delhi BJP . The rest of the ingredients  tomatoes, garlic, onion, salt, etc  have been arranged by the party. We will set up distribution points on the ground and a team of 1,000 people will serve the dish to people attending the meet.The party is expecting over 25,000 people at the event. The idea is to bring all sub-castes of the SC community under one roof and deliver the message of unity in diversity. The party leaders will elaborate on the work the Modi government has done for the community, said the head of media and IT cell.The bigger challenge for the party workers, however, is the organisation of the national convention on January 11 and 12, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and top leaders from different states. More than 12,000 delegates are expected to attend.Apart from the main event area from where the top leaders will address the delegates, we are also setting up separate lounges for the Prime Minister, national president and the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states, said a party leader. There will be two separate halls where the members of the national executive and other delegates will be served food. Arrangements are also being made for the PM, Union ministers and CMs to discharge urgent administrative work from the ground itself.BJP has formed 24 teams to look after the travelling arrangements, local transport and accommodation for the delegates and manage the logistics, work stations and internet connectivity, sound and LED screens and well as the internal and external beautification of the venue. Over 80,000 city youths are expected to participate in the Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20."

He wanted to do something to save their livelihood and the Class VIII student of the panchayat union middle school at Nallaganakothapalli in Krishnagiri district discussed the matter with his teacher A Subashini and friend V Archana. The trio have come up with a solution today.The vegetables are rotting quickly because of the water content in them. Hence, we decided to remove the water content and powder them, so that they could be used for days together, Silambarasan said. He explained that instead of drying the vegetables in sunlight, they were dipped in liquid nitrogen the temperature of which is -321degree Fahrenheit to remove the water content. The process will take only a few seconds.Whenever farmers could not sell their produce, they could always powder and store them, so that they wont incur loss, he said. The innovation was on display at the two-day Science and Technology Festival that got under way at the Codissia Trade Fair Complex here on Sunday as part of the ongoing Coimbatore Vizha celebrations.Another innovation that was on display was an alternative to plastic cups. And there wouldnt have been a better time to showcase the alternative, with the plastic ban is on in the state. The specialty is that these cups are edible. A Abinaya, Class VIII student of panchayat union middle school at Bagya Nagar in Ooty, along with her teacher L Sundaram, has come up with the cups that are made of wheat and corn flour.Moulding the flour mixture in the form of cup, it is heated for about 10 minutes in a chamber with IR lamp and reflectors. The cup could be used to drink any liquid immediately. We could either eat the cup or throw it for stray animals to consume, Abinaya said.A total of 100 schools and 37 colleges in and around the district participated in the expo on Sunday. R Vishnu Prabhakar, chairperson of the Vizha, said they had scrutinized the projects for one month and selected only the ones that are functional. They had received more than 250 entries.The theme of the Vizha is impact and inspire and the science expo was organized for the first time in the city to inspire the citizens. With numerous projects such as drone race and virtual reality, a separate zone was created to offer the children the experience of basic science and inspire them, he said.The Vizha also featured a parade on Sunday, showcasing the citys unity in diversity. More than 16,000 participants from 16 community associations and six school bands took part in the event.We may have different cultures, but we want to show that we are yet united. It not only shows how secular the country is, but also sort out the communal differences among the people, said Preeti Shah, one of the participants."

Then it adjusts both nitrogen and water absorption down, Ms. Wolff added.The researchers said that everything that can be tested on Earth has now been carried out.Effect of gravityThe next step is to grow beans in space to observe the effect of no gravity on plants ability to transport water and absorb nutrients. Simulating the absence of gravity cannot be done on Earth.The beans would be placed in a centrifuge to sprout and grow in the space station. The centrifuge would be rotated to create different amounts of gravity.The art of getting something to grow in space can be transferred to our planet, Ms. Wolff said.This is how we create a setup that produces both the microgravity conditions in the space station and the 1-g (gravity) force that exists on Earth.That will allow her to compare how the different gravitational levels affect the plants in space.The dream of every astronaut is to be able to eat fresh food  like strawberries, cherry tomatoes or anything thats really flavorful. Someday that will certainly be possible. We envision a greenhouse with several varieties of vegetables, Ms. Wolff said."

One, a chef, cleaned fresh red snapper filets with a sharp knife. The other, a filmmaker, pointed her camera into a large pot of simmering vegetables.What would you say this is, low heat or medium? Tuleka Prah asked, setting the camera aside.Low heat, said 38-year-old Touty Sarr, who runs the kitchen of a popular cafe in Dakar. She turned to her daughter, who was watching her cook. This one, if you put it on high, it would all get dry. Thats one of the secrets.Senegal was Ms. Prahs fifth destination since her project began in 2012. She hopes to show the care and skill that goes into African dishes, such as South Africas fried dough amagwinya and Kenyas kachumbari, an onion and tomato salad.The idea, at its most basic, is to present the food how people who love it would love it, Ms. Prah said. Its like a database or a digital vault where people can open the drawer, see recipes, see some ingredients.Born in England to a Ghanaian father and a South African mother, she lived in six African countries during her childhood, including Namibia, Kenya and what is now South Sudan. After finding no reliable recipes online for Ghanaian dishes and no photos that made the beloved food look appetising she started My African Food Map.Cuisines of a continentShe celebrates the cuisines of a continent often marred by negative stereotypes.Africa is often associated with poverty, with hunger, with failures of food in a political and nutritional sense, said James C. McCann, chair of the history department at Boston University and a specialist in African environmental history and cuisine. Its an area of the world that has not been covered by the food craze.Other culinary historians, chefs, and foodies are fighting such stereotypes. Some, like author and professor Jessica Harris, have studied African and diaspora cuisine, exploring the roots of foods taken far from home by slavery. Others, like Fran Osseo-Asare and her Ghanaian-focused project Betumi, investigate the foods of a single country.The internet was the democratisation of African food writing, said Osseo-Asare, who said she has blogged about African food since the 1980s. When the internet came, you didnt have publishers as gatekeepers that could stop you from getting your work out.Unique among prominent bloggers, Ms. Prah takes an almost pan-African approach.I always feel like I am from the whole continent, she said. I can find myself in different aspects of different countries I visit.The best outcome is when people say, That is our food, that is our dish, she said, remembering her work in Kenya. I was extremely happy when the first comments I got on YouTube were, Oh, this reminds me of home.To find authentic recipes and skilled chefs, Ms. Ms. Prah asks everyone she meets in a country  hosts, cab drivers, shopkeepers and strangers  about their favourite foods. She met Ms. Sarr this way, through friends of friends.I learned from my grandma. I used to follow her everywhere, said Ms. Sarr, who wears her stiff white chefs uniform every time she cooks, even at home, because it makes her feel more professional. And our grandmas, they think that taking time with the food gives it more flavor. So I take time, too.She said she became a chef after money ran out to pursue her dream of being a doctor.By smell, sound and tasteShe dropped garlic into sizzling oil, then stepped back as Ms. Prah moved close to the pot to film. The two women orbited each other, artists collaborating over the pot burbling on the stove.Ms. Sarr said she cooks by smell, by sound and by taste, but Ms. Prah wrote her steps down in order, recording a recipe for others without the guidance of grandmothers and mothers at their side.After two hours, the platter was ready.Ms. Prah snapped a picture, and then another, before putting her camera aside to try the dish.Its really good, she said."

Tuleka Prah asked, setting the camera aside.Low heat, said 38-year-old Touty Sarr, who runs the kitchen of a popular cafe in Dakar. She turned to her daughter, who was watching her cook. This one, if you put it on high, it would all get dry. Thats one of the secrets.Senegal was Ms. Prahs fifth destination since her project began in 2012. She hopes to show the care and skill that goes into African dishes, such as South Africas fried dough amagwinya and Kenyas kachumbari, an onion and tomato salad.The idea, at its most basic, is to present the food how people who love it would love it, Ms. Prah said. Its like a database or a digital vault where people can open the drawer, see recipes, see some ingredients.Born in England to a Ghanaian father and a South African mother, she lived in six African countries during her childhood, including Namibia, Kenya and what is now South Sudan. After finding no reliable recipes online for Ghanaian dishes and no photos that made the beloved food look appetising she started My African Food Map.Cuisines of a continentShe celebrates the cuisines of a continent often marred by negative stereotypes.Africa is often associated with poverty, with hunger, with failures of food in a political and nutritional sense, said James C. McCann, chair of the history department at Boston University and a specialist in African environmental history and cuisine. Its an area of the world that has not been covered by the food craze.Other culinary historians, chefs, and foodies are fighting such stereotypes. Some, like author and professor Jessica Harris, have studied African and diaspora cuisine, exploring the roots of foods taken far from home by slavery. Others, like Fran Osseo-Asare and her Ghanaian-focused project Betumi, investigate the foods of a single country.The internet was the democratisation of African food writing, said Osseo-Asare, who said she has blogged about African food since the 1980s. When the internet came, you didnt have publishers as gatekeepers that could stop you from getting your work out.Unique among prominent bloggers, Ms. Prah takes an almost pan-African approach.I always feel like I am from the whole continent, she said. I can find myself in different aspects of different countries I visit.The best outcome is when people say, That is our food, that is our dish, she said, remembering her work in Kenya. I was extremely happy when the first comments I got on YouTube were, Oh, this reminds me of home.To find authentic recipes and skilled chefs, Ms. Ms. Prah asks everyone she meets in a country  hosts, cab drivers, shopkeepers and strangers  about their favourite foods. She met Ms. Sarr this way, through friends of friends.I learned from my grandma. I used to follow her everywhere, said Ms. Sarr, who wears her stiff white chefs uniform every time she cooks, even at home, because it makes her feel more professional. And our grandmas, they think that taking time with the food gives it more flavor. So I take time, too.She said she became a chef after money ran out to pursue her dream of being a doctor.By smell, sound and tasteShe dropped garlic into sizzling oil, then stepped back as Ms. Prah moved close to the pot to film. The two women orbited each other, artists collaborating over the pot burbling on the stove.Ms. Sarr said she cooks by smell, by sound and by taste, but Ms. Prah wrote her steps down in order, recording a recipe for others without the guidance of grandmothers and mothers at their side.After two hours, the platter was ready.Ms. Prah snapped a picture, and then another, before putting her camera aside to try the dish.Its really good, she said."

Sources said the ground frost and the extreme cold weather were causing some crops to wilt and hampering the growth of others.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer in Nashik, said sensitive crops like tomatoes, gourd, chillies, leafy greens and eggplants have been affected. We have noticed an increased incidence of fruit dropping in tomatoes. The extreme cold conditions have affected almost 35% of the produce, Pawar said. The exposure to frost and then sunlight in the afternoon causes black blotches to appear on vegetables, he said.Mahesh Shelke, the director of a farmers producer organisation in Junnar , seconded Pawar. The frost has a direct impact on crops, causing considerable damage. Even grapes in many fields are cracking, he said.In Vyalla village of Akola, Gajanand Wahoka is struggling to shield his gram crop from the cold. The crops are stiffening. Close to 25% of my crop has been affected. Vegetables like spinach , eggplant and dill are facing problems, he said.Though cold conditions are required for rabi crops, the extreme cold  with temperatures several degrees below normal  is detrimental. The normal winter minimum is around 15C, but the temperatures in some places have dropped to below 8C, said Amit Naphde, the MAHA Farmers Producer Company Ltd director."

Although most salmonella outbreaks are linked to contamination from post-harvest handling and transportation, this infectious bacterium can also enter the plant from contaminated soil, researchers said in a statement.But how exactly does it enter from the soil? In their study, the researchers said unlike other disease-causing bacteria that enter the root, fruit or leaf by producing enzymes to break down the plants cell wall, salmonella sneaks in through a tiny gap created when a lateral root branches out from the plants primary root.This is the first time we have shown how different salmonella are from other plant pathogens based on their ability to colonise roots, said Kapudeep Karmakar, a PhD student, department of microbiology and cell biology, IISc, and first author of the paper published in BMC Plant Biology.Karmakar and his colleagues studied how different types of bacteria, including salmonella, colonise the roots of tomato plants. While other bacteria were spread across the root, salmonella bacteria clustered almost exclusively around areas where lateral roots emerge.When a lateral root pierces open the wall of the primary root to spread across the soil, it leaves behind a tiny opening. Using fluorescent tagging and imaging, the researchers figured out that salmonella bacteria were using this gap to enter the plant.Researchers also noticed that under the same conditions, a plant with a more lateral roots harboured a greater concentration of salmonella than one with fewer lateral roots. Similarly, when plants were artificially induced to produce more lateral roots, the salmonella concentration increased."

Prices of many vegetables have escalated, thanks to cold weather and less yield this time. Market experts see tomato prices touching Rs 100 per kg in the retail market . Tomatoes are currently being sold at Rs 60 per kg while the price was around Rs 25-30 till a few days ago. Owing to drought in Karnataka and Maharashtra (from where Karnataka receives supplies during this season), there is shortage of tomatoes in local markets. This has led to an increase in prices. If the shortage continues, tomato rates may go up to Rs100, said an official from Hopcoms.Siraj Ahmed, a vegetable merchant at Russell Market, said tomato prices in Mumbai markets have also surged and the producers in Maharashtra are sending most of the produce there as they are getting good returns. To get tomatoes from Maharashtra, local traders have to struggle a lot. Even in local markets, owing to rain deficit and lack of good returns, farmers havent shown much interest in cultivating tomatoes and other vegetables. Acute cold conditions are posing a challenge to the storage of vegetables. All these factors are having an impact on vegetable prices, Ahmed added.Low temperature and water shortage have resulted in less production of other vegetables as well, which are basically short-term crops. Prices of brinjal, carrot, beans and ladys finger have also gone up, said a Hopcoms official.Pramod P, a farmer from Kolar, said the production has come down this season in Kolar, Chikkaballapura and other districts around Bengaluru, which supply vegetables to the city on a regular basis. Seeing the market demand, farmers have now started cultivating vegetables. However, it will take one to three months before the yield arrives in Bengaluru markets, he added."

Under such circumstances, it is hard not to overstate the consequences of extreme oscillations in its price, both on consumers and farmers. While Mysureans were purchasing tomato over the counter at Rs 20 per kilo only a week before, citizens had to shell out anywhere between Rs 48 and Rs 60. Traders and wholesalers attribute the spurt in the prices to the demand in Bengaluru, where one kilo of tomato cost Rs 90 last week owing to a spike in demand.While the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (Hopcoms) charged Rs 48 for one kilo of tomato, traders in markets and other hawkers were selling it at Rs 60. Besides the huge demand from Bengaluru, this is the Sankranthi season, which is another reason why the prices have soared. Till Tuesday, we were procuring 50kg of tomato at Rs 500, and selling it at Rs 14 to Rs 15. But, supply to the city has come down sharply since. Cultivators and wholesalers are sending the crop to Bengaluru, where they are getting a better price for their crop. Naturally, the price has increased in Mysuru, said Siddappa Appaji, a wholesale vegetable trader in Devaraja Market.Appaji added that the bandh also had an adverse impact on supply of tomatoes to the city.A Hopcoms employee said, The price was hovering around Rs 22 in the first week of January, but it has jumped to Rs 48 now at Hopcoms. This is still cheaper compared to the open market. But, yes, there are fluctuations in the supply of the crop.Abdul Sharif, a supplier in MG Road Market, said that the demand for tomato was markedly higher in Bengaluru compared to Mysuru. Every day, on average, around seven to eight trucks carrying tomatoes are supplied to Mysuru. Thanks to the cold weather, this number has come down. Moreover, tomato farmers and traders from HD Kote, Bannur and Hassan are taking their crop to Bengaluru, where they get three times as much as they would in Mysuru, said Sharif.Homemakers are understandably perturbed with the steep rise in the cost of tomatoes and other vegetables. As they prepare for the Sankranthi festivities, the rise in vegetable prices has left them a worried lot. We are extremely worried about how we will balance the budget, said Jayashri Bhat, a resident of Vivekananda Circle."

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru have found that infection with S. typhimurium is a pre-harvest phenomenon and not a post-harvest problem as commonly thought. The researchers found irrefutable evidence of the bacteria entering the plants through tiny openings that form on the main root for the lateral roots to emerge. Contaminated irrigation water and open defecation are the main sources of this bacterial strain in the soil.While the bacteria are killed on cooking, Salmonella infection is usually caused when raw vegetables used in salad contain the bacteria. While studies are now being done to see if the bacteria infect other vegetables used in salad in the same manner, the key is to avoid eating any raw vegetable in the current scenario, said Dipshikha Chakravortty, from the IIScs Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, who led the team.Salmonella bacteria do not have the necessary enzymes to degrade plant cellulose and pectin and so cannot degrade cell wall. So active invasion by degrading the cell wall is not possible. Hence, S. typhimurium have to rely on natural entry points. Lateral roots are formed by remodelling of the main root. During the formation of the lateral root, a small opening is formed for the lateral root to emerge, said Professor Chakravortty. The pathogen takes advantage of these openings in the primary root to enter the plant.High colonisationEarlier studies had indicated that the bacteria colonise and enter the root through lateral root emerging areas. But the precise mechanism of entry was not known.The researchers observed very high colonisation of Salmonella in the lateral root emerging regions compared with other regions of the primary root. Other pathogens that have the ability to degrade the cell wall were found to colonise all regions of the root equally. Using an Arabidopsis mutant that produces fewer lateral roots and a chemical that induces lateral root formation, the researchers were able to increase the number of lateral roots. Compared with wild Arabidopsis, colonisation by S. typhimurium was significantly enhanced when lateral roots were formed by the mutant.In soil pre-treated with the bacteria, colonisation was more in the case of wild Arabidopsis compared with mutants. Unlike the wild Arabidopsis, the mutant produces fewer lateral roots. Since the mutants were not induced to produce more lateral roots, bacteria colonisation was more in the case of wild Arabidopsis, said Kapudeep Karmakar, Ph.D student in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, IISc, and first author of a paper published in BMC Plant Biology .As the salinity increases, the number of lateral roots formed increases. By varying the salinity of the soil the researchers found significant increase in lateral root formation in both Arabidopsis and tomato plants. We found 50 millimolar was the best concentration to induce maximum lateral root formation in Arabidopsis, said Professor Chakravortty.As the number of lateral roots increased in number, the percentage of tomato fruits infected with S. typhimurium also increased. Also, the severity of infection was higher in tomato grown in saline soil compared with controls.So salinity is a stressor and makes the plant susceptible to severe Salmonella infection, said Mr. Karmakar. This is the first time the salinity-induced lateral root proliferation and transmission of S. typhimurium to edible parts of the plant has been studied."

All this from an investment of just Rs 2lakh.At a time when sugar cane and onion cultivators are struggling to make adequate returns from their produce, some farmers in the Junnar tehsil are making a killing from coriander thanks to the demand-supply mismatch for the herb caused by extreme cold conditions and a paucity of water. Junnar is about 92km from here on the Nashik highway.Kute said this year has been exceptional. In the past decade, I have never got such good returns from coriander. For the past two years, I have been growing tomatoes, leafy vegetables and summer fruits like watermelon and muskmelon, but I never made so much money due to the low prices in the market. In fact, a few months ago, I had to throw away hundreds of crates of tomato due to market fluctuations and suffered heavy losses, he said.Like Kute, many coriander farmers have made good profits from the high prices their produce is fetching due to the demand-supply gap this year. Reports from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Narayangaon and Pune reveal that the kitchen staple, which usually sells for Rs 5-10 a bunch, is now commanding between Rs 30 and Rs 50.Kamlakar Wajge, a farmer from Narayangaon who is also a commission agent, earned Rs 2 lakh from the coriander harvest. Vegetable production shortage is unusual during the winter. But this year, the scenario is different. Many farmers could not grow several vegetables because of a water shortage. Now, there is a gap in demand and supply. This has resulted in an unprecedented price escalation for coriander in the market.Satish Dombale, from Otur, who made Rs1lakh in a week, added, I had cultivated coriander on 20 gunthas of land. I faced losses with all the other vegetables I had grown last year. But coriander has saved me. I can now use this capital to grow more vegetables in the coming months.According to the Narayangaon APMC data, in the past 10 days, it has received around 1.5 lakh coriander bunches every day from Junnar, Shirur, Ambegaon and Khed tehsils. Usually, in the winter months, we get around 2.5 lakh coriander bunches daily, said Sanjay Kale, the chairman of the Narayangaon market, putting a figure on the volume of shortage.At the Pune APMC market, the officials reported getting just 1 lakh coriander bunches every day against the usual supply of 2.5-3 lakh bunches. In January, a bunch of coriander usually sells for Rs 3-5. But over the past fortnight, a bunch is selling for Rs 25-30, said a senior APMC official.Talking of the possible cause for the low production, Rajaram Deshmukh, former vice-chancellor of the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, said, Growth of vegetables is affected when the temperature drops below 10C. In recent times, the night temperatures have been low. This must have adversely impacted the vegetable harvest."

So active invasion by degrading the cell wall is not possible. Hence, S. typhimurium have to rely on natural entry points. Lateral roots are formed by remodelling of the main root. During the formation of the lateral root, a small opening is formed for the lateral root to emerge, said Professor Chakravortty. The pathogen takes advantage of these openings in the primary root to enter the plant.High colonisationEarlier studies had indicated that the bacteria colonise and enter the root through lateral root emerging areas. But the precise mechanism of entry was not known.The researchers observed very high colonisation of Salmonella in the lateral root emerging regions compared with other regions of the primary root. Other pathogens that have the ability to degrade the cell wall were found to colonise all regions of the root equally. Using an Arabidopsis mutant that produces fewer lateral roots and a chemical that induces lateral root formation, the researchers were able to increase the number of lateral roots. Compared with wild Arabidopsis, colonisation by S. typhimurium was significantly enhanced when lateral roots were formed by the mutant.In soil pre-treated with the bacteria, colonisation was more in the case of wild Arabidopsis compared with mutants. Unlike the wild Arabidopsis, the mutant produces fewer lateral roots. Since the mutants were not induced to produce more lateral roots, bacteria colonisation was more in the case of wild Arabidopsis, said Kapudeep Karmakar, Ph.D student in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, IISc, and first author of a paper published in BMC Plant Biology .As the salinity increases, the number of lateral roots formed increases. By varying the salinity of the soil the researchers found significant increase in lateral root formation in both Arabidopsis and tomato plants. We found 50 millimolar was the best concentration to induce maximum lateral root formation in Arabidopsis, said Professor Chakravortty.As the number of lateral roots increased in number, the percentage of tomato fruits infected with S. typhimurium also increased. Also, the severity of infection was higher in tomato grown in saline soil compared with controls.So salinity is a stressor and makes the plant susceptible to severe Salmonella infection, said Mr. Karmakar. This is the first time the salinity-induced lateral root proliferation and transmission of S. typhimurium to edible parts of the plant has been studied."

In fact, it was an opportunity to sell packed food to some local labourers for a few days that got him thinking about 10 years ago. Thanks to the overwhelming response he received  especially for the variety rice items  S Siva immediately quit his autorickshaw riding business and started a roadside food stall called Sri Chellayi Tiffin Centre on Thanjavur Road near Old Palpannai.Right from the word go, the locals started loving his food with sambar rice being in high demand. The food stall is open from 11.30am to 3.15pm every day and serves at least 150 customers. According to Siva, his mother used to sell idlis for close to two decades and that was how he got to know the basics of food sales. The local labourers knew about his interest when they gave him a chance to try out his culinary skills by packing lunch for them for a few days. They loved what I sold. I learnt cooking from a person named Krishnamoorthy. Hes my guru who taught me everything that I know now, he added.Siva said that adding chickpeas in sambar rice worked wonders as several people loved the idea. In sambar rice, he also adds multiple vegetables including carrot, beans, drumstick and potato. In the beginning, when I used to sell sambar rice, it used to get over within 2pm itself. It gave me confidence that my eatery would be a success in the longer run, he said. Along with sambar rice, he serves coriander-mint chutney and pickle. Apart from this, people also get medhu vadai and they say that the combo tastes really well, Siva said.Kuska, lemon rice, tomato rice and curd rice are the other variety rice items that are sold at his food stall. While kuska costs Rs 25 a plate, other items are available for Rs 20 each. Siva said that apart from him, his wife S Moogambigai and mother S Gnanavalli also help him with cooking. Its only because of them that Im able to manage the demand, he said. Siva said that about 100 of the roughly 150 customers he served every day got their food parcelled. Those who buy parcels say its for their families. It gives me happiness that Im able to reach all kinds of people, he said. Though he also serves breakfast from 8.30am to 10am, he said it receives lukewarm response. Siva is also opening a tea and coffee stall near his food stall after Pongal.What: Sambar riceWhere: Near Chellayi Amman Temple, Thanjavur Road, Old PalpannaiWhen: 11.30am to 2.30pm"

In Chennai, the hybrid navin variety hit a high of 60 per kg in retail markets on Friday, while the local variety cost 50 per kg.Several hotels in Chennai have come up with solutions that includes cutting down on tomato use. We are restricting the use of tomatoes as much as possible and alternatively using tamarind... We are ensuring that customers are not affected in any way, said M Ravi, who runs the Vasantha Bhavan chain of vegetarian restaurants and is Chennai Hoteliers Association president.The situation is the same across the state, with Cyclone Gaja that ravaged Dindigul district, a major tomato hub, being cited as a reason for short supply. Around this time last year, wholesale tomato prices in places like Madurai hovered around 5 per kg.At the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai, there has been a 50% drop in number of trucks bringing in tomatoes, mainly from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. A 15 kg box of tomatoes sold for 250-260 four days ago and crossed 500; higher quality tomatoes even sold for 550- 600 per box on Friday, said Bhuvaneshwaran, a wholesale trader.A huge drop in tomato cultivation in TN has forced traders from Dindigul and nearby districts to look for supplies from AP and Karnataka, adding to the woes, says Ravi S, another wholesaler.For Madurai region, this is when local markets get large supplies, mostly from Dindigul. Horticultural crops on 5,600 hectares were damaged by Cyclone Gaja. Though tomato crops were not damaged, there was heavy flower drop, affecting supply, said Dindigul deputy director of Horticulture, K Srinivasan.In Coimbatore region, the unusually cold weather has taken a toll on cultivation, spiking prices from 30 per kg a fortnight ago to 60 now. While bad weather forced reduction in acreage of tomato cultivation, the yield from cultivated crops too dropped. I used to harvest 15 tonnes per acre. This season, I managed only seven tonnes, said S Ganesan of Thalavadi in Erode district. Farmers who used to raise tomato crop on more than 600 acres, this season cut it down to 250 acres.Its a seasonal phenomenon, when tomato suffers damage during extreme cold. But, we have not seen any alarming damage or fall in yield in Coimbatore, said M Chinnadurai, Centre for Agricultural and Rural Development Studies, TNAU."

I have had way too much of chicken in the last few months, so I let the Lahori chicken be and concentrated instead on the dessert, which was stupendous. I enjoyed the chikoo cheese cake and the chocolate fondant immersed in a cup of south Indian filter coffee.The prices at The Fire are pretty reasonable, if you consider the fact that its a luxury hotel. The salad was for Rs. 295 (before taxes), the vegetarian dishes on the platter were for Rs. 395 and the meat or chicken ones for Rs. 645.The desserts are for Rs. 345, and the prices of the mains vary between Rs. 445 and Rs. 795 (the latter for the Pandhi pork curry).Chef Basu offers us a delectable meal to beat the cold: it is regional, healthy  and ever so tasty."

While farmers had reduced acreage of tomato cultivation owing to the weather, the yield from cultivated area has also come down.I used to harvest 15 tonnes of tomato from an acre. But this season I could manage to get only seven tonnes, said S Ganesan, a farmer from Thalavadi in Erode district, a tomato hub.Farmers in Thalavadi taluk who raise tomato in 600 to 700 acres every season have cut short the cultivation to just 250 acres. I have cultivated tomato in just one acre of my land. Usually I will cultivate in three acres, Ganesan said.In Coimbatore, the retail price of apple tomatoes which hovered around Rs 30 a fortnight back had shot up to Rs 60 while the country variety is sold at Rs 52. The wholesale price was Rs 20 a week back. But now it is Rs 37, said a hotelier.Though there was not much damage to the crops in Coimbatore, frost in Karnataka affecting yield there has spiked the demand resulting in a sharp rise in prices here.Its a seasonal phenomenon when tomato suffers damage during extreme cold. But we have not seen any alarming damage or fall in yield in Coimbatore, said M Chinnadurai, director, Centre for Agricultural and Rural Development Studies of Tamil Nadu Agriculture University.In Coimbatore, most farmers were saved from poor yield as they usually shift to other crops during Pongal season. Farmers in Hosur, where tomato is cultivated extensively, have also switched to other crops, leaving the households feeling the pinch.Since there was poor yield from tomato last year due to erratic rainfall many farmers had switched to other crops. Karumandhurai, Thekkalpattu, Vellimalai, Pagudupatu, Maniarkundam, Thavalaipatti, Pethanayakanpalayam and surrounding areas are tomato hubs.Thalaivasal market alone will receive about 60 truckloads of tomato from these areas while Vazhapadi market will receive 15 truckloads. But not even a single truckload came to these markets on Friday, M G R Palaniswamy, a wholesale tomato trader in Vazhapadi market.Since Hosur is also a hub of cut roses, many farmers have switched to rose cultivation, eying the Valentines Day market.Murugan, a farmer from Vazhapadi, said there was no adequate northeast monsoon rain in Salem region forcing them to drop tomato. I was all set to cultivate tomato. Since there was no water I switched to other crops, he said.There are several nurseries in and around Omalur, Rayakottai, Ayodhiyapattina, Hosur and Salem. Thousands of saplings were left unsold and the nursery owners have suffered a loss.The nursery owners have also moved to other crops like cabbage and chilli.Market experts from TNAU said the situation will improve by the end of this month as harvest of tomato would pick up."

We are here to taste their award-winning sparkling wines. The Blanc de Blanc  a sort of a posh version of Aussie sparkling with a pink grapefruit flavour and a complex creaminess reflects the four-year ageing. They are also one of the only wineries in Australia to use a Rondinella Corvina varietal for their classic Ripasso Della Valpolicella wine style.We finally arrive at our home for the night, the quaint Peppers Craigieburn resort  a stunning rural property nestled on the outskirts of Bowral in NSWs Southern Highlands.

I must be the only Indian who knows absolutely nothing about cricket and confess my ignorance to Rina Hore, the executive director of the museum. Having said that, it is a fabulous museum, beautifully curated and even has a section devoted to Sachin Tendulkar!Bowral itself is a quaint town but the village that really stole my heart was Berrima, which is widely recognised as the best-preserved example of a Georgian village on the Australian mainland. From 1831 to the 1860s was a time of promise and growth for Berrima, which came to an abrupt end when the railway bypassed the village in 1867. For the next 100 years there was little or no development. Todays visitor to Berrima can experience the quiet charm and romance that comes from those features of the village which remained frozen in time. It is clearly an affluent area with delightful shops selling everything from basket ware to gourmet jams, desserts and designer ware and quaint cafes.

2019-01-13,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-picnic-with-fish-fingers-and-a-dj-anyone/cid/1681565,"A picnic with fish fingers and a DJ, anyone?","The Bengali word for picnic is choruibhaati. Chorui means open space and bhaati, feasting. In my mind, somehow, the term had come to be punched with a passage from Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyays Pather Panchali. A teenaged Durga whispering conspiratorially to her little brother: Choruibhaati korbi, Apu? Will you join me for a picnic, Apu? Brother and sister then collected some wild potatoes, stole a fistful of rice, a little bit of oil from their mothers kitchen, and then gleefully stirred it all in a pot on a wood-fire.Now I realise that it was less than a frugal meal even, much less a picnic  but all through my childhood the image held a different flavour for me.This winter, after ages, my husband and I went on a picnic with some friends from the neighbourhood. I had not been to attend the meetings in the run-up to the big day; all I knew was that I had to pay a certain amount and that we would be going to a resort in Baruipur in South 24-Parganas.On the appointed day, the car arrived at 7am. It was still misty and the sun was mellow. I slipped into a corner seat and nodded off. Time was when the very utterance of picnic worked like a magic spell, suggested a flurry of activity. A big bus would ferry a whole bunch of us to some nondescript spot. Anxious mothers would carry with them half their households  sheets to sit on, a medicine kit for emergencies, tiffin carriers heavy with snacks and flasks of tea. There would be skipping ropes, carrom boards, badminton racquets and half a dozen shuttle cocks for us.The fathers, smartly dressed in their pullovers, would holler at each other imperiously as they loaded (rented) utensils and cutlery, crates of soft drinks and bags full of grocery for the grand cookout.The car stopped and I woke up. We had reached the resort and someone was playing Bidi jalaile Bewildered, I checked my phone; it was 8am. I was told later that a picnic without a DJ is unimaginable now, as is a wedding, a thread ceremony, a birthday  so far funerals are out.The current day picnic is a completely outsourced affair Telegraph pictureWe had barely settled down, when uniformed catering staff started to serve breakfast  fish fingers, French fries, boiled eggs, sandwiches and tetrapacks of fruit juice. In the old days, it used to be singara with cauliflower stuffing or kochuri-alur dum or luchi-bonde and jilipi.Breakfast done, the DJ played Bryan Adams Summer of 69. The kids headed for the swing, the teenagers for the badminton court for some net flicks, some others just sat glued to their phones, earphones in place  their parents said they were overwhelmed they had deigned to come along. The adults sat around, drinking beer, chatting, stealing covetous glances at their phones, some got up to shake a leg.In the golden days, this was when the adults would get busy prepping for lunch. The women would chop and peel. The men would get the clay oven started, fetch more firewood; oftentimes, they would cook. But now there is no work to be done. Everything has been taken care of, paid for. The DJ started to play Pretty Woman and I got up to admire the flowers, but ended up tripping over a pair of canoodling teens, falling and flattening three dahlia plants.The picnic menu used to be really basic. Bhaat, beguni (fried brinjal slices in batter), labra  a vegetable mix. There would be some gooey chatni  tomato  and papod, finished off with mishti doi and rosogolla. But the pice de rsistance and possibly the only thing the men actually cooked, when they did, would be the fiery mutton curry. For days on end after the picnic, they would congratulate each other on the curry, its fine balance of spices, its chilli kick, the way the meat came off at the bone, till it moved their better halves from indulgent to sour to bitter.After lunch, the children would return to their play. The gaggle of mothers would bring out their knittings from their bottomless carrybags. The men would be busy with the cleaning up, the winding up. A quick round of tea and the picnic was over, everyone was bone tired but satiated.That day lunchtime came and went and people barely noticed. We sat at individual tables and ate off La Opala plates. The menu was elaborate  two kinds of fries, a dal, a sabzi, fish, mutton, chatni, papod, rabri. It was good cooking. But adults and children alike were busy, first clicking and then posting photographs of the food on social media. The eating was hurried, even incidental. Only the DJ played away persistently  Samundar mein nahaake aur bhi namkeen ho gayi ho."

So, the overall sales are showing a dip for many of us.He adds, Gaja cyclone hasnt impacted the arrival of sugarcane .

We are expecting more supply by this morning, and the prices are expected to fall further, he says.Raghavan, a vendor from Porur, says that the supply of turmeric and ginger, considered to be indispensable for the festival, are less compared to last year. Needless to say, the prices of the same have shot up. While a bundle of manjal kizhangu kothu (comprising approximately 40 plants) is being sold for `50-`60 at Koyambedu, each plant is sold for `30 in other parts of the city, he says.However, the salubrious weather seems to have helped flower sellers. Kalai, a flower seller, says, Since we have enough supplies, we are able to sell flowers for a nominal rate. While Jasmine is being sold for `500-`600 a kilo, all other flowers are now being sold in the range of `100-`150 per kilo.Chandra, who had come to buy vegetables at the Koyambedu market, says, I think most people have gone to their native places. I was sceptical of the prices, but they havent gone up. Except for tomato, there is no spike in prices on account of the festival season."

The prices of sugarcane and most vegetables have shot up because of the vagaries of the weather Among the Pongal staples, sugarcane costs Rs 450 for a bundle of 18 to 20 stalks. Sellers blame the high prices on loss of crop caused by early onset of the monsoon, worsened by insufficient rain later in the season. Last year, the upper limit for sugarcane was Rs 350 a bundle.Around 600 truckloads have arrived so far and 500 more are expected in the next few days. The market is currently selling the produce at a fair price, which will come down further to Rs 150 for a bundle in the next few days said an official at the Koyambedu Market. He said the trucks were mostly coming from Melur, Erode, Villupuram, and Cuddalore and from a few places in Andhra Pradesh.On Sunday, loads of trucks arrived early in the morning at Koyambedu with sugarcane, turmeric, and bananas ahead of Pongal. Turmeric was sold at Rs 20 to Rs 50 with Rs 40 being the standard price for a bundle of 8-12 pieces. Ginger was sold at Rs 30 to Rs 40 for a bundle of 4-5 pieces. The price of turmeric and ginger has not increased unexpectedly, said Vinayagamoorthy, a retail trader from Ennore. Dry coconuts were sold at Rs 35 to Rs 40, well within expectations, but tender coconuts were dearer as supply has been affected this time.However, vegetable prices, especially that of tomato , beans, and broad beans have gone up considerably this Pongal season. A colder than expected winter has hit arrivals of these vegetables at Koyambedu.Cyclone Gaja is responsible for the short supply of coconuts as lakhs of trees were uprooted in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Pudukottai districts. Supply from these districts is zero, said Koyambedu fruits, vegetables and flowers merchants welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar.Explaining the reason for hike in prices of tomato, he said three months ago the tomato yield was very high but the farmers were unable to get a good price. It fetched only Rs 8 per kg. As a result, many farmers switched to growing other vegetables. Unusually cold weather in the southern states further reduced the tomato yields."

While this has been a constant over the past few years, colleges too have been doing their bit. With Grow your own Veggies movement taking city folk by storm, we find out how city colleges fare at thisMany colleges have been making conscious efforts to preserve the green cover on campus. With several sapling drives and initiatives, colleges have been doing their bit. Many colleges boast gardens that have medicinal plants and herbs on campus , which is often maintained by students and faculty members and are mainly used for educational purposes. We grow plenty of herbs and medicinal plants on campus, since a lot of it is used for practicals, where we show them how to make herbal medicines. It is difficult for us to go out and source these plants, which is why we grow them ourselves. The gardens maintained by our department are mostly for education purposes, says Lekha George, professor Department of Botany at Mount Carmel College.Similarly, Geeja S Kurian, HOD, Department of Botany and Biotechnology at Jyoti Nivas College, says that students and faculty members are involved in the maintenance of these gardens. We have a small medicinal garden called Sanjeevani, which is maintained by our department, where we grow a lot of medicinal plants. We also have a small orchard where we grow fruits. The students who live in the hostel make the most of it and get to take those fruits , says Geeja.While many campuses do boast ample greenery, not many are able to grow vegetables and fruits due to the lack of space. One of the biggest reasons we dont grow vegetables and fruits on campus is because of the space crunch we face. If there is a patch of land that is available, we would definitely grow fruits and vegetables and actively involve students in this activity. We have enough manpower, but no space, says Lekha. Similarly AK Bopaiah, professor at St. Josephs College, agrees and says, Though we have a big green house on campus, we mostly grow ornamental and medicinal plants there. Some students from the environment science department have planted some plants that bear fruits, but its not done on a large scale because of the construction work thats currently going on. Once thats over, we will take it up and plant more trees, especially those that bear fruits, says Bopaiah.But that doesnt mean that there is lack of enthusiasm among students, say teachers. Even if we dont have a full-fledged vegetable garden on campus, students do come up to us and ask for pointers on how to grow fruits and vegetables at home and we help them, says Geeja. Several workshops and seminars too are conducted to get more students actively involved. We get experts and conduct workshops on a regular basis for students, so that they understand the importance of growing fruits and vegetables at home. In Bengaluru, terrace gardening has picked up and we promote the same. Once they (students) graduate many take it up professionally, says Bopaiah. Colleges also offer several courses in horticulture, encouraging students to try their hand at growing vegetables. Since it is a part of our course, we grow ladies fingers and tomatoes. We have it in patches and its scattered across the campus, says Amal KV, final year BSc student, Christ (Deemed to be University)."

MudurScientists have for the first time spotted the little Indian field mouse in farms and granaries in the cold, high-altitude region of Ladakh and called for surveillance and management of this crop pest there.A two-year study by scientists from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to explore the diversity of rodents in Ladakh has revealed the presence of the Mus booduga at altitudes up to 3,768 metres.The tiny mouse has long been recognised as a major crop pest elsewhere across the Indian subcontinent where it damages many field crops, vegetables and fruits. Scientists have recorded the mouse causing damage to groundnuts, maize, rice, raddish, wheat, apples, peaches, plums, cauliflower and tomatoes, among other crops.Earlier field surveys by the ICAR had documented the presence of the little Indian field mouse only up to 3,696 metres above sea level, its highest locations hitherto in Uttarakhand.Several larger rodents  other mice, rats and squirrels  cause more damage to various crops than the little Indian mouse in other parts of the subcontinent. But the little Indian field mouse appears to be the major pest in Ladakh.In Ladakh, weve found the mus booduga thriving in fields during summer and in granaries during winter, Vipin Chaudhary, an agricultural entomologist and principal scientist at the ICARs Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur, told The Telegraph.Chaudhary and senior CAZRI scientist Rakesh S. Tripathi, whos also coordinator of the All India Network Project on Vertebrate Pest Management, have published their findings in the research journal Mammalia.The scientists say the presence of the little Indian field mouse warrants greater surveillance to determine the extent of crop damage it might be causing and the adoption, if necessary, of appropriate pest management practices.Ladakh is widely viewed as a cold, dry desert, but agriculture is the backbone of 70 per cent of its population, Chaudhary said. Local communities grow wheat and barley during their seasons and vegetables throughout the year. Vegetables are grown in open fields in summer and inside special protective housing during winter.The scientists said their finding did not imply that the little Indian field mouse had expanded its range into Ladakh in recent years. Were not claiming that the little mouse is a new arrival in Ladakh  it just hadnt been observed thus far, Chaudhary said.He said that understanding the biodiversity of an ecosystem was important for crop management. While the CAZRI had in the past conducted multiple surveys of crop pest rodents across India, the rodent diversity in Ladakh remained unclear.The latest study has also documented a vole, a squirrel and a rat in Ladakh, but each of these species had already been observed there."

The ban on wood-fired kilns has left him fretting away on his charpai the whole day. His only hope is that the authorities have a change of heart. The 60-year-olds plight is worse than for the 400-odd households in Kumhar Gram in west Delhi for he is blind.A father of seven, Chand was diagnosed with glaucoma in 1998 soon after the birth of his first daughter. I underwent a surgery 28 years ago, but my vision kept deteriorating and by 2000 I was completely blind, the potter said. But I could still shape clay lamps, money banks and foot scrubbers.When Chand was a child, he had seen his grandfather slap a mound of freshly kneaded clay on a wheel. The handcrafted lamps , pots and sculptures were placed in a tray and put out in the heat of the summer sun before being baked in the kilns. After he died my father took over and then it was eventually up to me to carry on, said Chand.After the imposition of the ban on December 18, Chand has not touched clay. As Chand whiles away the afternoons on his charpai, his son, Jag Dev, 23, struggles to sell the remaining stock.Across Chands house lives his relative Naraini Devi. She pulled her red sari around her and expressed her dismay. My children know only the art of pottery and so are running out of options. They will probably have to become rickshaw pullers now, she said. There was similar undertone of apprehension on Jag Devs voice when he added, With the kilns prohibited, our future is uncertain because the notice does not have a date for the possible lifting of the ban.With no current production or sales and with little to survive on, Chand's family is adapting to the forced austerity. ""We mostly grind a tomato and chillies into a chutney and have it with chapatis, revealed the elderly potter.Chand, after fully losing his eyesight, got a certificate made that gave him free travel on buses and some assistance. But the municipal councillor disbursal that he received every month stopped in 2016. I had a stall outside the Qutub Minar metro station where my son and I sold pottery. But we were removed from there, he said.With no word from the authorities of an alternative, the only way out for Chand and his ilk is getting non-pottery jobs or a space where the potters of the Uttam Nagar can start afresh.

Creation of an exclusive budget will lead to more allocation of funds for agriculture, make crop insurance payouts, fixing of minimum support prices and loan waivers easier. With agriculture just a part of the general budget, the allocation it receives is minimal compared to industries, defence, railways and other sectors, association president S Palanisamy said.Fixing a minimum support price for staple crops like tomato and small onion, spices like turmeric and pepper, and grains was critical for farmers survival, the petition said. Only if you have an exclusive budget will you calculate the cost of calculation of a specific crop. During crop damage, you have to take that cost, add a little more money and pay it out to the farmer. Or at least the cost of cultivation has to be given to the farmer, district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivaisaigal Sangam P Kandasamy said. Minimum support price is critical to support farmers when onion prices crash, like it did last year. Also, once fund is allocated for it, the government will find it easier to distribute it.Agriculture is also an industry, which also requires support, the petition said. The number of farmers in the country is steadily decreasing and more families are moving to urban areas. Unless you recognize agriculture as an industry, giving it the loans, loan waivers and support prices required, more and more farmers will keep quitting and one day, we will have a food shortage, Palanisamy added."

It has been a trend that after rainfall, prices of vegetables usually go up. However, the rate of tomato will increase to double, said Santosh, a vegetable vendor at Sector 23.The city gets tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh and Nashik. Following snow and rainfall in Himachal Pradesh, there is a significant delay in the supply of vegetables due to which the prices, which are otherwise cheaper at Sector 26-based sabzi mandi, are also expected to rise.Bittu, another vendor at Sector 26 mandi, said they needed to make necessary changes to deal with rainfall as they had to cover their shops, which further led to increase in wholesale prices.He said prices of some exotic vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers would also increase.The consumers have started buying vegetables in bulk. A buyer from Sector 15 said prices of vegetables increase after rainfall every year, so they buy it in bulk.However, a vendor said prices of vegetables at sabzi mandi are higher in the morning in comparison to the prices in the evening.He said they buy fresh vegetables in the morning and because of it the prices of the vegetables are higher during the morning hours."

This is for the first time that such a shift has been witnessed, he added.Crop production is up 1.5% year on year and about 8% higher than the previous five years average. Singh said horticulture production contributes 29% of the countrys GDP. This despite horticulture occupying only 14% of the total area under agriculture at 140 million hectares. Potato, tomato, onion, brinjal, mango and banana are other major horticulture crops the country is producing, he added.A senior researcher from ICAR said with increasing production, India is set to expand its footprint in horticulture crop exports on the global trade map. Potato, onion, mango and banana are in high demand in other countries. For the first time, we recently exported bananas from Tamil Nadu, he added.Researchers attribute the rise in production to higher returns farmers are getting per unit area of cultivation. While paddy gives a maximum yield of only 30 quintals per hectare for a cultivator, the same for banana is 400q/ha and grape is 100q/ ha. Consumption of horticulture crops which are rich in vitamins and nutrients, has also gone up. Farmers are investing in flowers used for decorative purposes as well, he added."

The platform seeks to help farmers in getting better market access, find more buyers/traders for their produce and earn higher income. Small Farmers' Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) is the lead agency for implementing eNAM under the aegis of the Union agriculture ministry.Trade in 585 mandis is currently taking place on the electronic network, which helps discover price in real time in a transparent manner. The government aims to integrate 200 mandis this year and another 215 next year with the e-NAM platform. There are about 2,700 APMC mandis and 4,000 sub-market yards in India.Earlier, trade used to happen within the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) mandi or between two APMC mandies situated in the same state.Recently, the first inter-state transaction in tomatoes was carried out between a trader of Bareilly e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh and a farmer of Haldwani e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand.On the same day, another transaction in potatoes was carried out between a trader of Rudrapur e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand and a farmer of Moradabad e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh. In both the cases, e-payments have been made through e-NAM portal.Further, inter-state transactions happened between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The interacting mandis were Gadwal mandi from Telangana and Kurnool mandi from Andhra Pradesh.The latest development is from the Palanpur mandi of Gujarat which sold green gram to Sumerpur mandi of Rajasthan, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Though the volumes of inter-state trade on e-NAM platform are low currently, the programme will prove to be a giant leap in reforming the agriculture market in India, the official added.The ministry has integrated 585 wholesale regulated markets/ (APMC) markets in 16 states and 2 Union territories (UTs), who have carried out requisite reforms in their state APMC. Currently, seven states -- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand -- are working on the modalities to establish inter-state trade.Farmers can access the information on e-NAM easily through their mobile phone from anywhere. This online trading platform aims at reducing transaction costs, bridging information asymmetry and helps in expanding the market access for farmers.eNAM is a virtual marketplace with a physical market (mandi) at the backend, networking the existing APMC/mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities for pan-India electronic trading. Mandis handle huge volumes of farm produce. eNAM provides quick quality assaying solutions to promote online trading.Logistics providers' information is also being provided on the e-NAM portal to traders from outside the state which will facilitate transportation of commodities.The agriculture ministry is in the process of developing a separate dashboard to promote inter-state trade among e-NAM states.There are also discussions ongoing among the officials of the ministry, SFAC and state governments on dispute settlement mechanism. Initially, the dispute has to be settled by the mandi of origin where the e-trade is going to be executed. MJH HRS"

He was ready with a plan for the purpose even before he took over as the CM. Hamne loan waiver ki baat hawa mein nahin ki thi. There was a planning on how Rs 55,000 crore would be arranged to waive off loan of 53 lakh eligible farmers. I had the plan ready before I actually became the CM. There was a possibility of me becoming the CM and I had done my homework on how to go about it. By the time the model code comes into force next month, we would have waived off loans of 35 lakh farmers, he said.He further said that farming must be seen in a fresh perspective. Seventy percent of population in MP is based on agriculture. They are not farmers alone. Grocery shops, automobile shops, textile. They also largely depend on agriculture sector for good sale. . Only boost in production is not enough. Production increased during the previous regime as well, but what about marketing of those products? Farmers had to pay for increasing production of commodities like tomato, potato or garlic. Ironically, farmers earlier used to demand increase in support price, now they are forced to demand that their produce is at least sold on support price, he said."

Many order huge garlands to fulfil their vows, and not everyone has cloth bags to carry them, so the vendor is ready to offer them the banned plastic bags.I open my shop as early as 5 am in the morning and cannot expect people, who come early to the temple to bring eco-friendly bags for the flowers. I have enough carry bags to give them, said a vendor, who has his shop at the entrance of the temple, adding that people refuse the flowers if they are not given a carry bag.Senthikumar, who has a small grocery store in Villapuram, said that their sales amount to about Rs 5,000 per day, but when they refuse carry bags, the customers say they dont have a way to carry the goods.When somebody refuses to buy a coconut I lose about Rs 5, so I must provide a bag, he said.Farmers markets throughout the city are another place, where a few kilograms of bags can be seized if the enforcing officials conduct raids, said S Thiagarajan, of Chinna Chokkikulam, adding that these vendors are a reason why such initiatives to ban plastics fails.They should be given a proper alternative, for a woman, who sells tomatoes, losing the sale of half a kilogram will impact her daily earnings and cause loss, he said.If you are regular at the meat shops, it is one place where you can go confidently without an eco-friendly bag as the butcher is ready to provide you with a bag.The plastic ban is something that will not become viable in the near future without a proper alternative, and the government should explore ways to make the people dispose it properly, said A Asokan, Madurai district secretary of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam.We are comparing the life of people 20-years-ago, when they brought utensils and bags and purchased goods, but we should keep in mind that the things happened at a slower pace, now people do not have the patience to stand till an item is wrapped in paper, hence an alternative should be explored, he said.Madurai Corporation commissioner, Aneesh Sekhar said that they would intensify their checks on the shops."

High production depresses prices and farmers are left in the lurch.Production of high-focus TOP (tomato, onion and potato) is estimated to be higher than the output of these crops in 2017-18 with potato at 52.58 MT recording 6% growth, followed by tomato (2% higher) and onion (1.5% higher).Records show that horticulture production has been consistently rising since 2012-13. Production is up. Producer is down. Thats the story of Indian agriculture, tweeted Yogendra Yadav , national president of Swaraj India who has been raising farm related issues.The remarks summed up what other observers too feel about growing production of not only horticultural produce but also of foodgrains. Record production of horticulture crops is the result of favourable weather and expectations of higher income based on past experience. But record production is not translating into higher returns, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said.Panwar, a farm expert and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, cited two major reasons for it. First, the central governments policy of containing inflation in food items and second, over-dominance of middlemen in supply chain of fruits and vegetables, specifically corporates, in some segments, he told TOI.Initial efforts of government such as price stabilisation funds and boost of food processing industry could not be rolled out because of budgetary constraints and lack of focused approach, he added.Actual production figures of horticultural crops in 2017-18 show that fruits recorded slightly higher growth than vegetables. Production of fruits in 2017-18 was estimated at 97.35 MT which was 4.8% higher than the previous year. Vegetables output at 187.5 MT in 2017-18, on the other hand, was 3.5% higher than 2016-17."
2019-02-02,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/modern-asian-cuisine-taste-of-the-east/cid/1683496,Modern Asian cuisine: Taste of the East,"People always talk about trends in fashion and whats in and whats out. I like to observe gastronomy in the same way  the evolution of food tastes, presentation styles, personal preferences, availability of ingredients to keep up with the changing demands, and so on.The popularity of Asian cuisine began in most places with Chinese immigrants giving the locals a taste of the new cuisine wherever they settled down.In India, we grew up on the so-called Indian Chinese, which meant red-lantern restaurants with red tables serving oily spring rolls and other fried appetisers, the popular Manchurian and chilli chicken and the comforting fried rice doused in dark soy and vinegar.Gradually, Thai cuisine became popular in the international and Indian food scene and everyone was talking about coloured curries and chicken satay. The age-old sweet corn soup was replaced with spicy tom yum soup. Lemongrass was an exotic herb and coconut milk became a trendy ingredient to cook with.I remember my mum (and many other North Indian ladies who had never dealt with coconuts) trying to demystify the process of extracting coconut milk. She was soon saved by the several brands of coconut milk which were introduced in the Indian markets.Asian quinoa bowl Picture credit: Natasha CelmiThe next wave was Japanese food with sushi taking the world by storm. I was a student in the UK those days and recall how sushi bars sprung up all over and it was cool to be struggling with a pair of chopsticks and digging into California rolls and nigiri. It was hilarious to see peoples reaction to that little green blob of potent stuff called wasabi. Eating raw cold fish was a strange concept which became normal in no time.Soon, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia , Indonesia and other neighbours joined the space to create Pan Asian cuisine.So whats next you might ask? Encompassing a diverse array of cultures, countries and cuisines, modern Asian is a new member in the contemporary foodscape. Classic Asian flavours are complemented with popular Western dishes to have a universal appeal. Using fresh local ingredients and adapting dishes to local flavours is the order of the day.Cooking from scratch and ditching the plethora of preservative-filled bottled sauces and pastes is the healthier approach. Replacing traditional ingredients and cooking techniques with healthier substitutes suited to specific diets yet maintaining the robust Asian flavours makes it a vibrant cuisine.Thai red curry with kale Picture credit: Natasha CelmiI like serving a hearty Thai curry over a bed of spaghetti instead of the usual steamed rice or noodles. Try it, it is such a refreshing change and the spaghetti absorbs the curry really well.I like to get innovative with salad dressings by making a simple mix of lime juice, honey, soy sauce and fresh chillies. Ditch those heavy creamy dressings and just add this Thai-inspired dressing to a bowl of crunchy raw veggies. Light, simple and delicious!I made this gorgeous salmon dish by infusing some smoky lapsang souchong leaves into orange juice. The combination was a match made in heaven. The dish is completed with some seasoned quinoa, ginger steamed bok choy and grilled oranges.In an earlier article, I had talked about alternate grains. Ditch your usual white rice and replace with quinoa, millets, barley, brown and red rice. These are way more nutritious and filled with lots of good carbs and iron. So the next time you are making some fried rice at home, follow the same recipe but replace rice with cooked barley or quinoa. Trust me, you will love it and it is super easy.Curried peanut dip Picture credit: Natasha CelmiHeres a simple trick to make conventional vegetable soups interesting  add an Asian touch! When making any homemade soup with wholesome veggies (tomato, pumpkin, broccoli), drizzle some coconut milk towards the end with some basil and chilli for a Thai touch, or add a dash of soy sauce, minced ginger and garlic for a Chinese influence.Coming back to changing trends, do you remember how big the coffee wave was when it first hit India? I was in high school when the Cafe Coffee Days and Baristas introduced us to the world of cappuccinos and lattes (it took me a while to figure out the difference between the two, I have to admit). Today, world over, people are shifting towards the Asian beverage called tea as it is considered healthier, with less caffeine. I was in Europe during Christmas and was surprised at the variety of teas offered in traditional coffee-dominated cafes.Teriyaki orange tofu Picture credit: Natasha CelmiEarl Grey panna cotta Picture credit: Natasha CelmiNatasha Celmi is a culinary specialist and food stylist based in Bangalore.

Around 70 kg of ganja worth around Rs 70 lakh were seized from him, said inspector-in-charge, Baliguda police station, Ramakant Patra.He said the ganja was being transported from Sindurigaon near Baliguda to Kalapatahra in Cuttack district . They accused have been identified as Prasanna Kumar Sethi, driver of the vehicle from Kalapathara, Nakula Polai of Baideswara in Cuttack, Sachitra Dalai of Tilugaon, Birupakhya Dandia of Barkhama and Rajiba Dalabehera of Gumma Padara, he said.Following a tip-off, police intensified patrolling on the National Highway and checked almost all vehicles passing through the stretch, he added. Drug smugglers are now smuggling ganja by packing it with other substances to hoodwink the police after we intensified our crack downs, Patra said.In 2018, 10 ganja smuggling cases were registered, 23 smugglers were arrested and 260 kg of the contraband seized under Baliguda police station limits, the IIC said. Besides, illegal ganja cultivation on around 550 acres was destroyed, he said.On Friday night, police arrested seven persons for allegedly peddling country liquor manufactured from mahua flowers at Manjigada under Tumudibandh police limits, said IIC of Tumudibandha police station Baba Saheb Saraf."

However, no major allocation of funds has been made till now to create significant animal-friendly facilities inside the sanctuary to ensure its food, water and safety. The water being filled-up in the small tank inside the sanctuary is not apparently sufficient to meet the requirement.While the compound wall on the western side of the sanctuary is found damaged at several spots, most of the stone pillars holding the barbed wire fence on the other sides have fallen down. Consequently, the spotted deer can easily move out of the sanctuary and the non-availability of food and water inside this damaged enclosure drive the animals out. Whenever the spotted deer come out of the sanctuary in the night, the animals wander up to Abhishekapatti on the west and the forests beyond Kayathar in search of food and water, braving threats from poachers and stray dogs.With the region receiving scanty northeast monsoon last year, most of the waterholes situated around the sanctuary now have little quantity of water. Water stagnating in the stone quarries situated around the sanctuary quench the animals thirst to some extent.Whenever we cultivate brinjal, ladys finger, tomato etc., we need to be extremely vigilant, particularly during night, as the spotted deer herd cause extensive crop damage. This is happening every year as no permanent measure is in place to ensure sufficient food and water inside the sanctuary, says K. Murugan, a farmer from Maanur, a village which is situated about 10 Km from the sanctuary.Though fodder was cultivated inside the sanctuary at regular intervals to feed the spotted deer, the erratic monsoon wiped out the crop and dashed the forest departments hopes. Consequently, the animals now feed on the rapidly drying grass, fruits of thorny bushes and the water being stocked in the tank inside the sanctuary.Officials in the forest department say that proposals have been forwarded to the government seeking sizeable allocation of funds for creating fodder, water and a credible fence around to ensure the safety of the animals."

And the satisfaction I felt when I bit into that plump, juicy red fruit  no tomato tasted as good before or since then.That was, of course, a couple of decades ago. Growing vegetables in the backyard is now an impossible dream for most urban Indians who live in cubbyhole apartments with little sunshine or ventilation.It has, however, not dampened the enthusiasm of some die-hard gardeners. No open space for a garden? Lets just grow plants indoors! And, to make life easier, there are now indoor gardening systems available in the market. These new-age gardens usually fit on a countertop or a windowsill and can be tailored to your skills and experience as an amateur gardener.A basic smart garden usually comes with the following parts: pods prefilled with the right type of soil and seeds, a self-watering vessel, an LED lamp that works on a timer and a built-in WiFi connection. You plant the pods in the container, fill it with water and turn on the LED light. The LEDs are automatically regulated, according to the plant you are growing. The WiFi is not exactly necessary but can help you check the plants status. That way you get to know if your plant baby is getting the right amount of light, water and nutrients. And if it needs extra care, you get to know it too.What is different about SproutsIO is that it can grow plants without soil. This micro-farming system has been developed by grad students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, and uses a hybrid hydroculture technology. It combines the two main types of plant-watering  hydroponics, which involves submerging a plants roots, and aeroponics, which waters a plant through misting.Aeroponics nurtures your plants with a nutrient-rich mist. Its makers claim a reduction of 98 per cent in water use and 60 per cent in fertiliser use over conventional cultivation.Based on research initiated by Jennifer Broutin Farah at the MIT Media Lab in 2011, SproutsIO allows people the joy of growing their own food. It took three years of intense research to come up with the worlds first-ever intelligent, plug and play, hybrid hydroculture system.Farah and her team have recently finished their complete functional prototype phase, and will continue to create systems for beta testing. And I am waiting for the opportunity to rekindle my passion for growing tomatoes, this time on the windowsill of my flat.MiracleGro Aerogarden Bounty Elite File picturePop pickAnother indoor smart gardenMiracleGro Aerogarden Bounty Elite: You can grow up to nine plants in this smart garden.

Of them, 14 people succumbed to complications induced by the virus the same month. At the moment, the condition of five other patients diagnosed with swine flu is critical. They have been put on ventilator support at different hospitals in the state  one in Nagpur and four in Pune.The woman had developed an influenza like illness on January 14. She succumbed to swine flu-induced septic shock, with multi-organ failure on January 26, said a doctor from Jupiter hospital.The woman had a history of diabetes and hypertension, and had been on medication for last 20 years. She was admitted to Jupiter hospital on January 22.We have screened over 2.22 lakh people with influenza-like illnesses and administered oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to about 2,301 suspected patients as a precautionary measure just in January, a state health official said.Medical experts have advised precautionary measures in view of the fluctuating weather conditions, which provide an ideal setting for the growth of influenza viruses, including swine flu.As for viral infections like fever and common cold, doctors have advised people to wash hands at regular intervals and keep themselves warm, as the viruses attack when the body temperature goes down.The elderly, especially those above 65 years of age, are at high risk of developing influenza, pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia during the winter season. To avoid any complications, they should go for swine flu vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination (once in five years), family physician Dinesh Gharge said.Vitamin C is known to be very effective in fighting germs. It can be found in berries, citrus fruits (oranges, lemons), guavas, tomatoes, melons and papayas, among others, Gharge said.The virus had claimed 461 lives and infected 2,593 people across the state in 2018."

The rates will continue to be low for another three to four weeks, said Panaji vegetable vendor, Jafar Mokashi.Another seller Rafiq Saigal said that the stock mainly arrives from Belagavi to Goa. The rates have decreased in Belagavi, going at Rs 15 per kg, due to which we have also reduced the wholesale prices here, he said.Besides onions, the sale of other essentials like tomato, coriander and potatoes also brought forth enthusiastic customers.With prices of most commodities being at an all-time high, it had become problematic for the average middle-class family to manage finances. The declining prices of vegetables has come as a welcome relief for us, said a housewife from Porvorim.Another buyer, Yesha Madan, from Panaji said that while the low prices are a good trend, efforts must be made by the horticulture department to ensure that vegetable rates remain pocket-friendly throughout the year.There must be more focus on organic vegetables, otherwise theres no point in buying vegetables that are cheap, she said."

The Sena chief also criticised the letter from the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), which conveyed good wishes to the activist, as condemnable and laughable.Hazare said, The Modi government is nearing completion of its full tenure, but it has not shown any inclination towards appointing a Lokpal. It is merely giving false promises to the people, said Hazare.Hundreds of villagers visit the Yadav Baba temple at the main square of the village every day to express their solidarity with Hazare.The veteran activist slammed the governments latest move of allocating Rs 6,000 per year to small farmers in the recently presented interim budget, saying it was trying to woo the community ahead of this years general elections. We have been demanding that the government start a monthly pension of Rs 5,000 for farmers who are aged over 60 and do not have a source of livelihood. The Rs 6,000 allocation is paltry as farmers will get only Rs 500 per month. How can they benefit from this amount? In fact, it is a bribe to the distressed farmers to get their votes in the upcoming elections, he said.Hazare said the NDA government has neither introduced progressive policies nor has taken positive decisions to resolve farmers issues. But at the same time, the government has exempted lakhs of crores of tax and loans of businessmen, he added.Such moves clearly show that the Modi government is more worried about businessmen than farmers. Even after 72 years of Independence, farmers are committing suicides, he said, alleging that the government was lying by claiming that it has given good prices for farm produce. If that is so, then why are farmers throwing their produce like onions, potatoes, tomatoes and milk on the roads? he asked.Hazare said the NDA government has not considered the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission. He also took a dig at other political leaders saying that they are now trying to project themselves as clean in a bid to gain political mileage in the elections.Earlier in the day, Hazare told the media that he was losing faith in chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as he had not fulfilled the promises he had made while convincing him (Hazare) to withdraw his fast on March 29 last year at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi. The CM has not fulfilled any of his promises relating to mitigating the problems of farmers and the appointment of Lokpal/Lokayukta, he said.On Sunday evening, state minister for water resources Girish Mahajan, who has been acting as an emissary between the government and Hazare, visited Ralegan Siddhi and had a closed-door meeting with Hazare for almost half an hour.Speaking to TOI, Mahajan said, I apprised Anna about various welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat health scheme and the subsidy on drip irrigation. I also explained that the state government has implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and has bought farmers produce with 1.5 MSP in the last few years. As far as appointment of a Lokayukta is concerned, I told him how it has got delayed due to various administrative issues and how the government will implement it at the earliest.Hazares personal secretary Datta Awari told TOI, The minister assured Anna that the state government will accept all his demands including implementation of the Swaminathan commissions recommendations. He also spoke to the chief minister over the phone for five minutes and discussed the same issues. As far as the central government issues are concerned, the minister promised that the PMO will soon communicate to the activist by Monday.Leader of the opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and former state agriculture minister Balasaheb Thorat met the activist and urged him to end the hunger strike considering his age and health issues. They also assured that they would put pressure on the government to consider Hazares demands, Awari said.Hazares office has, meanwhile, issued a statement calling upon his followers to intensify their agitation across the country."

The package will receive Rs 1,500 crore in 2019-20, which will include Rs 550 crore from state plan fund, Rs 100 crore through central sector schemes, Rs 350 crore from LSGDs, Rs 250 crore from KIIFB and Rs 250 crore from Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) and other sources, he said.The aim is to have a development strategy to enhance production of tea, spices like pepper and cardamom, fruits and vegetables, Isaac said. The initiatives will include promotion of value added products, branding of Idukki tea, expansion of the Spices Park, integrated project for cattle farming modelled on Ksheera Sagaram project and a Brahmagiri model meat processing unit.The Idukki package will also take care of issuance of soil health cards to farmers, who will be provided with organic and bio-fertilisers required to restore soils health lost in the recent calamities, before the monsoon season.New organic and bio-fertiliser manufacturing units and establishment of modern facilities to ensure the quality of fertilisers and pesticides will also be proposed.The district will have an afforestation scheme like the one proposed for Wayanad, and another major thrust would be in tourism sector, establishing tourism clusters and circuits, and development of other destinations, Isaac said.Increase in wagesMaking additional budget proposals in his concluding remarks on budget discussions, Isaac announced an increase in wages for workers under various schemes. The wages of pre-primary teachers and ayahs, anganwadi workers, Asha workers and coordinators of various other schemes will be hiked. The lump sum grant given to SC/ST students has also been hiked by 25%.Isaac announced an allocation of Rs 50 crore to Supplyco for effective market intervention in addition to Rs 150 crore already earmarked in the budget.The budget has also allocated 1,035.58 crore as ration subsidy, Rs 525 crore for paddy procurement and Rs 100 crore for Consumerfed, for market interventions.The finance minister also said that the state would launch a scheme for the Civil Supplies Corporation and the Consumerfed for direct purchase of onion, tomato and other produces from north Indian farmers, which could rescue those farmers who are on the brink of suicide due to price fall."

V Sai Prasannas installation exposes the struggle that women and nature undergo today. A Thalamuthu, another artist, placed some postcards on the floor. You write your name and address, and the artist would send you a drawing done by him. R Moovendran exhibited the portrait of a man on terracotta that he made without using tools. V Saran Raj's installation using barbed wire and balloons questions the practice of honour killing in the remote pockets of Tamil Nadu Works of 15 young artists of the Madras Art Collective, a group of graduates of the Government College of Fine Arts, being exhibited at Spaces on Elliots Beach, evoked tremendous response from people.Archiving Labour, the group art show, attracted people from various walks of life. The idea was to take art to the layman.We wanted to communicate with people through our works. It was a great success because many walked into the venue asked us many questions. We had great interactions with people, said Saran Raj, artist and a member in the group. There was another reason behind the success. Each work, whether its installation or painting, was different in its own way. K Padmapriya said she was very close to her grandmother, who taught her the basics of life. When she got a chance to explore her grandmother, she chose memories, maps, dreams, seeds, betel leaves and tomato among other things.I have made special paper for all the 12 works that I have exhibited here. Making paper was challenging. But I enjoyed it mainly because it was a soul-searching experience, said Padmapriya. As children, we would go and ask grandma for tomato when she cut the vegetables. I used pieces of tomato in my painting besides the forms of memories and material associated with us, she said.Asked why he decided not to use tools while making sculptures, R Moovendran said, In art, we should practice different methods to communicate. I made a sculpture of man without using any tool. I practised it and now I dont need a tool to make a sculpture. , he said.When people asked Raj why he used red and blue balloons inside the huge balls made of barbed wire, he said it was deliberate. The red symbolises love and the blue, eternal beauty. The wire represents honour killing and inequality in society, he said."

The government has released Rs 5,450 crore towards the farm loan waiver scheme, he added.To counter Prime Minister Narendra Modis recent promise to give Rs 6,000 per acre a year to 12 crore farmers, Kumaraswamy announced a new scheme called Raitha Siri to offer farmers financial assistance of Rs10,000 per hectare to encourage farmers to grow millets. The government plans to increase the area under millet cultivation to 10,000 hectares.Keeping in view diminishing paddy yield and cultivation area in recent years, especially in coastal and Malnad districts, he announced the Karavali Package, financial assistance of Rs 7,500 per hectare to motivate farmers to cultivate paddy.Another new scheme, Raitha Kanaja, will provide minimum support price to 12 notified farm produce. A permanent collection centre is planned to be opened through the year in all Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees through a revolving fundThe government will also offer remunerative support price to six important minor millets, besides providing marketing facility and platform (Hopcoms, Nandini and other outlets) to sell their produce directly.With agriculture at the mercy of the monsoon, Kumaraswamy announced the implementation of the Israeli Model of Micro Irrigation System (IMMIS) with a corpus of Rs 145 crore and Zero-Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) with a corpus of Rs 40 crore. While both were envisaged last year, theyre being implemented this fiscal to grow crops profitably by using less water and promoting natural farming methods.To prevent distress sale of onion, potato and tomato when prices crash, the government will announce a base price and provide incentives under Price Deficiency Payment Scheme if produce is sold below it.The government has also decided to set up a Debt Relief Commission on the Kerala model to receive complaints from farmers about private monet lenders and redress their grievances. Itll shortly bring in the Gruhalakshmi Crop Loan Scheme for small and marginal farmers who will get a crop loan on their ornaments at an interest rate of 3%.Karnataka has the most dry land after Rajasthan. Our state has been affected by drought for 14 of 18 years since 2001. Farmers have become desperate due to repeated losses. While Malnad and coastal areas, including Kodagu, have suffered due to heavy rain, 156 taluks have suffered from drought.A glaring omission was the Raitha Belaku scheme announced by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government. Under it, farmers in drought-affected areas will get Rs 5,000 per month per hectare if the monsoons fails. The scheme has been scrapped in favour of the loan waiver scheme. It also means that Rs. 3,500 crore earmarked for the project last year will not be released, said a senior Congress leader.* Milk producers will get incentive of Rs 6 per litre* Rs 15,000 crore for interest subvention on farm credit* Rs 5,500 crore for crop insurance* 50% subsidy for agri startup entrepreneurs* Two world-class permanent farm demonstration centres at VC Farm, Mandya and Sindhanur, Raichur* Special package of Rs 150 crore to improve condition of pomegranate and grape growers* Mango processing units in Ramanagara and Dharwad districts under PPP model* Tomato processing units in Kolar district under PPP model* Mobile veterinary clinics in 15 districts* Fishing jetty for development of fishing at Malpe harbour in Udupi district* Smart weighing machines in all 162 APMCs"

2019-02-10,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/marseille-is-home-to-the-perfect-bouillabaisse/cid/1684087,Marseille is home to the perfect bouillabaisse,"The picturesque Old Port in Marseille. The city has been renovating old docks and heritage buildings in the recent past Image: Karen AnandI find myself in Marseille on the Cote dAzur in the south of France in a region known as Provence. The excuse is to find the best bouillabaisse (pronounced boo-ya-bes), a fish stew for which this city is famous. Marseille has, in recent years, been on a rampage to change their somewhat seedy image, renovating and rebuilding old docks and heritage buildings, opening new hotels and restaurants and encouraging foreign investment. It is the second largest city of France and now considered one of Frances most exciting cities.A bowl of bouillabaisse (pronounced boo-ya-bes) Image: iStockMarseille is a mini Paris by the sea, a softer, more laid-back version with grand boulevards, an Arc de Triomphe (called the Porte dAix), a long history and an enviable coastline with beautiful beaches.I check into the 18th century Hotel Dieu, a former hospital that has been completely refurbished and renovated and now run by InterContinental. It also happens to be right in the centre of town, a two-minute walk from the Old Port and bordering the oldest part of the city, Panier, which is steeped in history and where many famous movies have been shot.The hotel has massive staircases, vaulted passages and magnificent terraces that bear witness to the former status of the building and it is now a classified historical monument. Today, these passageways have been transformed into private terraces overlooking the Old Port and the beautiful Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica in the distance, a neo Byzantine-styled cathedral which locals believe protects the city. In 1993, the last patients left Saint-Espirit Hospital (now Hotel Dieu). It closed its doors definitively in 2006 before work started as a hotel. I look out from my spacious terrace to see a stunning pink sunset over the Notre-Dame de la Garde. I begin to understand what painters and photographers refer to when they talk about the light in the south of France.View of Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica from Hotel Dieu Image: Karen AnandSecret ingredientsThe next morning, I trot off at 6am (which is when fish markets the world over start bustling) to the picturesque Old Port in search of phase one of my search for the perfect bouillabaisse  the fish. Theres no one in sight. The waiters at the nearby cafe, pastis (the anise liqueur from this part of the world) still on their breaths from the night before, inform me that the fisher folk arrive only at 10am! I go back later to find a sprinkling of fishermen and women under the Norman Foster sun shelter.This is no tourist trap but a lively little market with colourful characters. The word bouillabaisse means to boil and to lower the heat. It was a poor mans fish stew made from fish nobody wanted  bony, often small and ugly but full of flavour because they come from the rocks, reefs and calanques (mini-fiords) on this part of the coastline.The traditional fish for bouillabaisse are Congre (a big fish with a slightly chewy flesh), Rascasse (an ugly red fish with a big Neanderthal-like mouth), Rouget (a red fish), Saint-Pierre (John Dory) or Turbot and a small fish, which is deadly to filet, called Vive.There is much written about the ingredients that go into a bouillabaisse, like Cognac and so on, but I am reliably informed that all it takes is good olive oil, tomatoes, orange zest, saffron and fennel. The stock or fumet is reduced and sieved and the fish is then added. Most restaurants in Marseille serve the fish, filleted at the table, and the soup or consomme separately with rouille, a mayonnaise made with dried chilli, and a garlicky mayonnaise known as aioli, on the side.At the Old Port one can find the freshest haul of fish, even though the fisher folk arrive only at 10am Image: Karen AnandAvoid cheap imitationsI spend the day wandering around the narrow, cobbled streets of the old district of Panier right next to the hotel. Its a working class area and the primary schools have just finished hurling out tons of noisy little French children. Although the area has been gentrified, it still has an edgy underbelly worth exploring.I walk down to the more modern remodelled J4 dock area, past the very impressive Mucem, a collection of contemporary museums and galleries devoted to European and Mediterranean civilisation. You can almost walk around the centre of Marseille in a day. Heading back to town is a brisk 30-minute walk or a 10-minute taxi ride.In between a busy shopping avenue and the spice market of Noailles is a shop devoted to cookware, known as Maison Empereur. It is the oldest shop of its kind in France (1827) and has retained its decor and charm over a trio of buildings. It is simply the best, biggest, most exquisite kitchen and accessories shop I have ever seen. Locals come here regularly for anything from a string bag to pots and pans. It is here that I find a large cast iron cauldron, exactly what locals use to cook bouillabaisse at home.Maison Empereur cookware shop Image: Karen AnandBouillabaisse is undoubtedly the dish that symbolises this city but I have been warned to avoid cheap imitations, which will contain frozen fish and leave you with an everlasting bad impression of this wonderful dish. So I pick one of the most famous seafood restaurants in the city  an institution for bouillabaisse, Chez Fonfon.After a quick change, we drive to the seafront or corniche and park right opposite the island of Chateau dIf (one of the settings of Alexandre Dumass novel The Count of Monte Cristo). We walk down some uneven steps to an old fishing village known as Vallon des Auffes. In the enchanting mess of boats, we find Chez Fonfon. We start off with black olive tapenade, a staple on the table in all local restaurants.Then comes the dish I have travelled many many miles for. A big tureen of aromatic red consomme with the fish served on the side. The aioli and rouille on the table and crusty bread to lather it on.The next day I try a version of bouillabaisse  the famous bouillabaisse milkshake of chef Lionel Levy at Hotel Dieu. I have heard much about chef Lionel Levys interpretation. Seen as the leader of the New Mediterranean cuisine, Levy learned his craft from internationally acclaimed chefs such as Eric Frechon and Alain Ducasse.The bouillabaisse milkshake at InterContinental Marseille Hotel Dieu Image: Karen AnandHe moved to Marseille in 1999 and gained a Michelin star in 2005 for his first restaurant. His menus showcase local, seasonal produce with a selection of the best freshly-caught fish from the Vieux-Port served simply, market garden vegetables grown locally and in his intimate garden at the hotel. Inventive, inquisitive, playful and always eager to discover new recipes, his version of the stew stumped me  a creamy drink with layers of aioli sauce, egg and mascarpone mixture and finally the fish soup.There are many reasons to visit the south of France. Looking for the perfect bouillabaisse should be one of them.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur. In recent times her name has been synonymous with farmers markets.

During 2018-19, agricultural produce market committees had received 101 complaints from farmers for non-payment of over Rs 2 crore, which were pending towards commission agents and many feel this number could be much more.Raising the issue in the assembly recently, CPI(M) MLA from Theog Rakesh Singha said that several crores had been duped by commission agents over the years not only in Himachal but also in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata. He said of the total 30 proclaimed offenders only four had been arrested.The BJP MLA from Chopal, Balbir Verma, said that in his area farmers had not received payments totalling Rs 3 crore for their produce. He said that this figure was of those cases where FIRs had been registered with police while in many cases cheques had been given but payments not made. He further claimed that over 1,000 cases were pending in courts. Verma said that the entire scandal if unearthed would be of around Rs 50 crore as for many years farmers had not received payment for apple, tomato, cabbage and peas crops.Agriculture minister Ram Lal Markanda said that the state government was serious on this matter and 101 cases had been registered by the present government while in the past no such cases had been registered. He said that 30 commission agents had been booked and four of them had been arrested for not paying Rs 2.15 crore to farmers.He further said that in the government-run marketing yard, farmers had got their payments while roadside commission agents were a matter of concern as they take produce but do not make payments and for this law needs to be made to ensure that farmers were not duped of their hard-earned income. He said that notices had been issued to 30 commission agents and they had agreed to make the payments soon, or else they would be arrested."

The Akshaya Patra, an initiative of International Society for Krishna Consciousness Iskcon ), has been serving food in schools and jails in India, and also some public places abroad.In an email interaction with TOI, Madhu Pandit Dasa Akshaya Patra Foundation , said his mission is to reach 5 million children every school day by 2025. Excerpts:A: Srila Prabhupada, the founder acharya of Iskcon, once witnessed the disturbing sight of children fighting with dogs for scraps of food. Deeply touched, he asked his followers to work towards a world where no one, especially children, would go hungry. With this, we started our school lunch programme in 2000. Over time, like-minded people came on board and their unwavering support helped us scale up from 1,500 to over 1.7 million beneficiaries. Our mission is to reach 5 million children every school day by 2025. We are driven by our belief that feeding children is not charity, but a social obligation, for these children are tomorrows flag-bearers.A: India being a huge country, each social issue needs to be addressed on a large scale to make a positive impact. Then there are factors that arent in our control. In schools, for instance, standards of hygiene of the place where food is stored after we deliver it, and until it is served, can be improved. Similarly, due importance should be given to the quality of water children drink when they have their meals. These are bigger challenges...A: We use our centralised kitchens, equipped to prepare 50,000-100,000 meals over a few hours, for social welfare as well. In Rajasthan, for instance, we have been using our kitchens to implement the state governments Akshaya Kalewa programme and serve food at a subsidised rate to the needy. In Vrindavan, we feed hundreds of widowed mothers. In times of adversity, we have used our kitchens for disaster relief work.A: Serving children safe, nutritious, hygienic and tasty food has and will always be our priority. Our meals are designed to meet the nutritional requirements recommended in mid-day meal (MDM) guidelines by the ministry of human resource development  450 kcal and 12g protein for children studying in classes 1-5 and 700 kcal and 20g protein for children in classes 6-8. To ensure a tasty meal experience that is not monotonous we have a menu cycle that repeats once a month. One may say that onion and garlic enhance bioaccessibility of micronutrients. However, expert nutritionists, on the basis of several research papers, aver that bioaccessibility of micronutrients is enhanced also by items like turmeric, lime, cumin seeds, drumstick, curry leaves, tamarind, jaggery, tomato, green leafy vegetables and seasonal vegetables. We ensure all of these are used daily in Akshaya Patra menu."

Delicate pink oyster mushrooms for your butter garlic stir fries, piquant, umami capers and crunchy, micro-greens with a bite to add that sass to any dish. South India is teeming with family-run businesses and small, local producers who are growing everything  from seedless Italian lemons to blooming mushrooms in terrace flats and raising rows of baby radish greens via hydroponics. And all these growers are finding a thriving market right here in the city  not just at restaurants, but even at homes.While artisan sourdough bread, sparkling kombuchas, purple corn and gourmet cheeses have already been in circulation for a few years now, food entrepreneurs ofare always looking to make our dinner tables, a little bit more exciting. And they are all consciously staying away from mass produced and processed goods. Most of their produce are an attempt at inching towards a farm to table or farm to fork experience and we are overjoyed. What a time to be alive!Former lawyerwas always passionate about food and wanted to understand how to grow it and where it comes from. Shifting base to Bengaluru from Delhi led to her moving into an apartment with a terrace where she started growing herbs and vegetable patches. After having a son, Goenka was reluctant to go back to her day job and started looking for business options, something she could do from home. She came across a course on mushroom cultivation being taught at ICAR - Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Hesaraghatta, and enrolled herself. During the course she learnt that there were so many varieties of mushrooms beyond the usual button versions. Mushrooms are fuss-free and dont require too much space to grow; and because they grow vertically so there is no pressure on the land. They grow on agricultural waste such as compost, paddy straw and sawdust. For me, this seemed like a sustainable practice, growing something from waste into a healthy produce high in protein, says Goenka.She first started growing mushrooms on her terrace. Depending on Goenkas harvest, you can expect mushrooms such as the elm oyster, pink oyster, king oyster and shiitake. Goenka also offers dried jackfruit, amlas, organically grown Bengal black rice, fragrant Gobindo Bhog rice and nolen gur (smokey palm jaggery).Living Food Company (LFC) co-founder and CEO Akash Sajiths mother and father were both diagnosed with cancer in May 2014 and March 2018. He wondered how his non-smoking, vegetarian parents could get cancer. A deep dive into cancer research revealed that soil in India could be one of the major causes for this fatal disease because of ground water being polluted by carcinogenic substances. In Karnataka, the cropping patterns have altered over the last 30 years to move away from Ragi and other millets that grow exceedingly well in dry, arid areas. Instead, the cultivation of water-intensive crops that deplete water resources as well as nutrients in soil has increased. For example, the area under sugarcane cultivation inhas increased by five times in the last 25 years. Research has shown that sugarcane has adverse effects on the nutrition profile of soil and contributes significantly to soil degradation. This coupled with indiscriminate and unregulated use of pesticides is severely affecting the ground water and soil contamination levels. During 2016-17, Indians consumed close to 57,000 MT of chemical pesticides through food, including those that have been banned in other countries (source: Ministry of Agriculture data), says Akash.Because of soil contamination issues, no local seeds have been used. Instead non-GMO kale seeds from the US, arugula from Europe, mizuna (Japanese mustard greens) from Japan, Chinese kai lan (Chinese broccoli) and 22 kinds of micro-greens comprise their inventory. Restaurants such as the Fatty Bao, Sly Granny, Sanchez and hotels like Shangri-La and Hilton have signed up as part of the B2B format.The micro-greens and herbs are grown in climate-controlled rooms in hydroponic pods; instead of soil the seeds are grown on recycled choir mats on a base of water.Coffee plantation and eco retreat Kerehaklu is here to help with not one but seven kinds of avocado. Pranoy Thipaiahs grandfather first started Kerehaklu, primarily a coffee plantation, in 1953. A 270-acre estate that also offers four eco cabins, the plantation grows alternative crops such as avocados, Italian lemons, litchis and mulberries. According to Thipaiah (who is managing partner along with his father and brother), the avocado season is between June and October and he harvests every two weeks. The idea is to switch to a farm-to-table system as much as possible and to stop relying on imported stuff when we have excellent avocados (locally called butterfruit), oranges, and litchis of superior quality coming from Ooty, Chikmagalur and Kodaikanal, says Thipaiah. To that end, he has been supplying to Bengaluru restaurants and individuals via orders on Whatsapp and Instagram for the last 18 months or so.While an imported avocado at gourmet supermarkets can cost Rs 300 or more, Thipaiah says good local varieties are easily available at Malleswaram and Russell Market for less. Kerehaklu grows seven different kinds with origins in Guatemala and Mexico: Pinkerton, Hall, Reed, Zutano, Fuerte, Choquette and Gwen. The avocado trees were planted as shade trees, 40 years ago, by Thipaiahs grandfather to provide shade to coffee bushes. Thipaiah realised that there was a demand for avocados in Bengaluru and he could supply his farms produce. Apart from avocados, the estate also grows seedless Italian lemons, Devanahalli pomelos (local name chakkota), and limited quantities of shahtoot mulberries. The pomelos come with a thick rind and a sweet and slightly bitter-sweet pink, juicy flesh  perfect for Thai salads than juicing. He is also experimenting with oyster mushrooms, mango ginger and fresh turmeric. To get your stash, look out for the harvest information on Kerehaklus Instagram page and order (on a first come first serve basis). Thipaiah drives down the produce himself to Bengaluru and you can pick it up from him or Dunzo it. Kerehaklu also does regular pop-ups around the city. Though Bengaluru restaurants and individuals are his main clientele, he also has supplied to restaurants in Delhi and Jaipur.Though not Bengaluru-based, Tamil Nadus Ishka Farms delivers capers cured in brine, in sea salt, caperberries in brine, Tuticorin sea salt, caper salt and shade-dried moringa leaves turned into moringa powder to the city regularly. Founded by KN Suryanarayan, whose legacy business is photographic equipment and office products in Cochin, Ishka farms, run by his son Srikant Suryanarayan (managing director) and wife Fiona Arakal (director) was an attempt to branch out into something different. The family invested in buying a tract of barren land in 2012 in Niravi Pudhupatti village in Tuticorin district, Tamil Nadu. The area was drought prone and at that time there had been no monsoon for seven years, says Arakal. So we needed to zero in on a crop that would not be rain-fed and did not need a lot of water.The duo did not want to grow the usual tomatoes or gherkins which everyone else was doing at that time and wanted something that could grow with the Israeli method of drip irrigation (run water through drip lines instead of flooding land in water). In terms of creative marketplace, no one was growing capers, although in parts of India like Gujarat and Rajasthan they do grow wild and are also consumed widely. But those kinds are thorny and hard to grow and cultivate, points out Arakal. Our capers are from the same plant family but are cultivable spineless, easier to harvest, she says. Because the gastronomy choices in our country have begun to change, according to Arakal, there is a possibility for capers to become big because currently there arent even many organic certified caper farms in the world, forget India. Morocco, Yemen and Dubai can collectively account for the current caper supply to the world.Having access to local, chemical free gourmet produce does away with those expensive trips to supermarkets. So ditch those expensive imported Thai pomelos, Peru avocados and Moroccan capers and embrace what is fresh and grown locally."

Meat can now be cultivated in laboratories, and Mumbai just became the worlds first city that will host a dedicated research centre to do that.We are proud to announce an MoU with industry leaders to set up the worlds first dedicated centre on cellular agriculture, said Dr Rekha Singhal, dean of research, consultancy and research mobilization at the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Matunga, on Monday.The ICTs Centre for Excellence in Cellular Agriculture will be supported by the US-based non-profit Good Food Institute (GFI). The centre, through a process called cellular agriculture, will aim at creating healthy, clean meat foods without involving animal cruelty, like slaughter. The state governments permission has been formally taken. Cabinet minister Vinod Tawde attended a function at Sahyadri Guest House with ICTs vice-chancellor, Dr G D Yadav, and GFI India MD Varun Deshpande, to announce the partnership.Globally, companies like Mosa Meat and Memphis Meats have pioneered the application of this research in the market. Companies around the world have also created plant meat, with two popular products being Impossible Burgerengineered to taste and smell like meat, but made entirely from plant ingredientsand tomato tunatouted as a cheaper, healthier alternative to real tuna.With the help of the Mumbai centre, we could see more cell-based meat companies in India too, poised to grab a share of the $4.6 billion global meat substitutes market, said a GFI spokesperson.

The only Haryana farmer to be awarded for his endeavours in horticulture , Kumar was recognised for bamboo-stacking and other innovative methods of food cultivation which have resulted in high yield of vegetables.Necessity is the mother of invention, says Kumar, philosophically, when asked about the thought behind the cultivation techniques that have brought him fulfilment. Until three years ago, we incurred a 25%-30% loss of produce, as vegetables like tomatoes and gourds would rot due to excess irrigation water, explained the 38-year-old in a thick Haryanvi accent.Some of the fruit growing on the ground would be concealed by excess vegetation, and would eventually be crushed by foot during harvesting. So, using trial and error, and subsequently guided by the horticulture and agriculture departments, Kumar adopted Machan Vidhi, or bamboo-stacking technique. Since then, 99% of the produce has been healthy, he adds proudly.The practice of stacking vegetables on bamboo pillars has proven mightily effective, helping improve the quality of crops.If the bottle gourd is simply left to grow on the ground, it turns crooked. Similarly, tomatoes when grown without the stacking practice, are devoid of sunlight resulting in uneven colour, reveals Deen Mohammad Khan, the district horticulture officer who mentored Kumar. With stacking, the produce gets sunlight and the colour of the vegetable is uniform.On Sunday, the president addressed the closing ceremony of the 4th Agri Leadership Summit, organised in Ganaur, Sonipat, by the Haryana government. He called for locating agriculture in a wider entrepreneurial context, and linking traditional farming to the agricultural value chain. He also expressed confidence that farmers would help find an answer to the problem of pollution, which is a by-product of stubble-burning.Meanwhile, the efforts of men like Kumar, who has been farming since he was 17, can help ensure that, amid all the depressing news on the farming front, agriculture has much to look forward to.(With inputs from PTI)"

Money factor becomes negligible, when it comes to country. Nation is above all.Every year in the season, around 50 to 100 boxes of mangoes (1 box weighing 10 to 20 kg) per day come to Indore from Pakistan but this season no trade is likely to take place. The average minimum trade during the season is around Rs 1 crore.Mangoes from Pakistan are priced for its rich pulp and extra sweetness. As these mangoes come once Indian mangoes are exhausted, they extend the season for mango lovers by two to three months. The season for these mango starts from August and ends by October.Harish Demia, mango dealer at Choithra fruit market said, All dealers met and unanimously decided to not continue trade with Pakistan. Not even a single piece of mango will reach Indore from Pakistan.Pakistan origin mangoes are offered in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 150 per kg, according to dealers.There are about half a dozen dealers in Indore, who deals in mangoes from Pakistan.Inflamed after the dastardly terror attack on CRPF convoy, where over 40 personnel were martyred, traders in almost all sectors have refused to deal with Pakistan.From tomatoes to dry fruits, dealers trading in items originating from Pakistan have pledged to shun all ties.Even items that are manufactured in the country but sourced through Pakistan are likely to see a decline in trade.According to wholesale kirana traders of Siyaganj, supply of dry fruits such as pistachio , figs, anjeer among others is also likely to get squeezed as these items comes from Afghanistan via Pakistan border."

The India Meteorological Department, however, has only reported rain at isolated places in the region.Also, the current hot weather conditions are likely to affect late-sown wheat in particular. Since most crops, like rabi jowar and gram, are being harvested, they would not be affected much by this heat. However, an impact of this unprecedented heat is likely to be felt on fruit and vegetable crops, an agriculture department official said.The department is still compiling data on the crop loss due to hail and heat, but farmers said it amounts to nearly 50%.Amit Naphade of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited said the hail will likely affect 40-50% of the horticultural and rabi crops in eastern Vidarbha. The drought has been so severe in western Vidarbha that very little sowing happened there, so we dont expect much effect on rabi crops, he said.Santosh Sahane, technical director, Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), told TOI that information coming in over the past few days indicates that vegetable crops have gone pale due to the extreme heat. Whenever the difference between day and night temperatures is over 10C, it starts to affect the growth of vegetable crops. Meanwhile, due to extreme heat, the plant tends to expend its entire energy only on survival and not much else, which too affects its physiological growth, said Sahane.Sahane said such extreme weather conditions have not been seen in the past decade. The worst-affected have been new tomato and chilli crops, which are sown after January 15 and the produce from which comes into the market in the first week of April, he said.He added that the hail in parts of state, particularly Jalna and Buldhana have also caused damage to rabi crops.Achyut Patil, a farmer in Akola, said nearly 50% of his crops, especially gram, wheat, and rabi tur, were affected. The gram crop too was ready for harvest, but was damaged by the sudden, unseasonal hail. Also, the sudden rise in the heat increases the crops water requirement at a time when the region is reeling under drought-like conditions, he said.Junnar farmer Shankar Dumbre said that the oscillating weather is making crops susceptible to diseases, which affect photosynthesis and consequently, nutrient absorption. This in turn affects the fruiting of the vegetable and fruit crops. Close to 40% our grape produce has succumbed to such strange weather conditions, he said.After experiencing extreme cold in the first few days of February, many places in the state touched 40C in the this cool winter month.These places, including Pune, Malegaon, Mahabaleshwar, Kolhapur, Satara and Beed recently registered record day temperatures.On Thursday, at least 19 locations in the state had day temperatures over 35C. In most of these locations, the day temperature departures were high  around 3-5C."

Not only that, it had great potential to enhance potato seed production in view of its geographic location and climatic conditions, he added.Amarinder noted that with the establishment of tissue culture and aeroponic technology at the Centre of Excellence for Potato, situated at Dhogri, Jalandhar, the whole seed potato producing area in the state will come under certified seed potato in the coming 4-5 years. Also, due to the soil being free from serious pathogens and pests, particularly brown rot bacterial wilt and potato tuber moth, Punjab had already been considered a Pest Free Zone for potato production, he stressed."

Were no longer going to allow the tomatoes to be exported to Pakistan, said farmer Basanti Lal Patidar.Two other tomato farmers Bherulal and Ravindra Patidar appealed to both the Central and the state government to help find newer overseas markets.The tomato season here spans from October to mid-February. The impact of our refusal will be felt across the border from next season only, by when, we hope to offset the losses by exporting the same produce to Dubai, which will be our gateway to the Middle East. During the season, 15-20 consignments of tomatoes are sent to Delhi from our fields. Each consignment contains around 125 quintals, Amad said speaking to the media.Beef politics returnsJust a few days before the Election Commission of India (ECI) is expected to announce the dates of the 2019 general elections, a senior national leader of the BJP has raked-up the issue of beef eating by a first-time Congress MLA in MP.

Were no longer going to allow the tomatoes to be exported to Pakistan, said farmer Basanti Lal Patidar.Two other tomato farmers Bherulal and Ravindra Patidar appealed to both the Central and the state government to help find newer overseas markets.The tomato season here spans from October to mid-February. The impact of our refusal will be felt across the border from next season only, by when, we hope to offset the losses by exporting the same produce to Dubai, which will be our gateway to the Middle East. During the season, 15-20 consignments of tomatoes are sent to Delhi from our fields. Each consignment contains around 125 quintals, Amad said speaking to the media.Beef politics returnsJust a few days before the Election Commission of India (ECI) is expected to announce the dates of the 2019 general elections, a senior national leader of the BJP has raked-up the issue of beef eating by a first-time Congress MLA in MP. In an oblique attack on All India Muslim Personal Law Board member and first time Congress MLA from Bhopal Central seat Arif Masood on Saturday, the BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said its a matter of concern and shame for all workers of the party as to how a beef-eater man won the election from here."

As we had no clue about agriculture, it took some time to learn the techniques. We planted brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and pumpkin, and appointed a full-time farmer to take care of the garden he told TOI.The NGO decided not to use chemicals in the garden from the beginning. We fed our plants organic manure and have been using organic pesticides like neem oil to get rid of harmful insects. For watering the plants, we have placed a 6,000l tank, which is filled whenever the corporation supplies water to the locality. As it is sufficient to water the plants for only a day, we have been purchasing water. We plan to set up a rainwater harvesting system in the garden, Ganesh said.The garden is growing and now giving in abundance. Helping Hearts is harvesting about 2kg vegetables a day, which is used to prepare nutritious food for the inmates of its old-age homes.Once the summer season starts, we will sow seeds of crops that consume less water, Ganesh said and thanked the local residents, corporation and organisations including Restoring Nature Trust and Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore for supporting the initiative.The whole ambience of the area has changed after the garden was set up, said V Sathish Balaji, a resident and the managing trustee of Restoring Nature Trust. This land was once a den of anti-social elements. Now, peacocks and squirrels visit the place, he added."

Hundreds of fruits and vegetable plants like pomegranate, guava, grapes, mosambi, lemon, strawberry, mulberry, tomatoes, beetroot, curry leaves, mint leaves and other plants are arranged in neat rows, some in pots and a few in plastic containers.I always wanted to have a garden of my own, but since we have moved into an urban locality, I was not able to have a full-fledged garden outside our house. Thats when we chose to turn our terrace itself into a garden, says Sholly.An approximate area of 1,000 sqft has been utilised to grow their terrace garden. Squirrels and small birds are all-time visitors to their garden and the family feels it has helped them obtain aesthetic balance. The family has also set up small nests in bamboo plants for the birds, which makes the garden come alive with the chirping of birds every day. To nourish the soil and help in plant growth, they use only cow dung from a nearby farm."

In every colony, there is a shop where you get, apart from fresh meat, marinated chicken and fish. If you are lucky, you get ready-to-cook lamb, too. Some of these places are rather good, some eminently forgettable. But they do help when friends suddenly turn up for a meal. You rush to the local shop, get your chicken lollipop or tikkas, fry and grill them at home, and you have something tasty to offer your friends.Conversing with butcherNow, of course, you dont even have to go to the butchers. My local butcher is a great pal of mine, and whenever I drop by there, we talk about haleem and nihari, and where one should go for the right kind of kababs. He has an array of ready-to-cook stuff, too, but I dont usually buy those. For, I must admit, I am not greatly fond of the orangish chicken and meat pieces that you find in glass counters in most of these meat shops.But then, as I discovered recently, you can order some neat ready-to-cook stuff from online stores. For a while now I have been ordering my fish and chicken from an online outlet called Fresh to Home. A few days ago I tried out another popular online delivery outfit called Licious. And then, when two of my friends said they were coming home for dinner last week, I decided to order some ready-to-cook dishes from Licious.I asked for some prawn zafrani, Bengali-style chicken cutlets, fish tikka, and creamy Afghani chicken. The food was excellent, and the rates were really low. There was a scheme on, because of which every dish came at a discount.The prawn zafrani (10-12 pieces), for instance, is for Rs. 297, but I got it for Rs. 262; the eight pieces of chicken cutlets were for Rs. 199 but were being sold that day for Rs. 169, fish tikka for Rs. 239 (actual price Rs. 319) and Afghani chicken for Rs. 224 (otherwise for Rs. 299). I put the cutlets in the air-fryer, and within 10 minutes, we had a plate of crispy chicken chops. I dont know why the cutlets were called Bengali for they didnt much look like Bengali cutlets, which are usually oblong or rectangular. But they were hot, and went really well with kasundi  which is a sharp mustard sauce popular in Bengal. We stir-fried the prawn zafrani, and those came out well, too.The prawns were crunchy and the spicy masala on it was just right. The friends enjoyed the fish, again shallow-fried, but I think we went wrong with the Afghani chicken. We should have grilled or perhaps lightly sauted it. Instead, we put the chicken in a tomato-based sauce, which, I fear, didnt come out very well. But we live and learn.Licious has some other nice stuff, which Id like to try out: The lamb chapli kabab (Rs. 297) and habanero chicken wings (Rs. 149 for ten pieces), for instance. They also deliver quail, rabbit, and duck.As I said, I feel sorry for our local butchers. What will happen to them if we all go online? I think I shall follow the middle path  visit my butcher now and then, and order online when friends suddenly drop by. Let everyone blossom."

Their reward: an abundance of fresh vegetables and flowers in the terrace garden.Students of classes V to IX at Sri Sri Academy have grown cauliflowers, coriander, chillis, brinjals, tomatoes pomegranates, oranges, mangoes and flowers such as petunia, dianthus, dahlia and marigold as part of their gardening class every Saturday. About 60 students have opted for gardening as an activity.Everything now is available to students through technology and while we are so focussed on development and technology we must not forget nature. Children do not get to smell flowers, feel the soil or see the eco-system living under the earth. As a school we need to teach them that we live in nature and it is a symbiotic relationship, said Suvina Shunglu, the principal of the school.The school feels most students dont see gardening as an exciting hobby unlike robotics and would rather play Farmville on their smartphones, but the idea is to start with a few and gradually involve others as well.Teachers accompanying students on excursions say it is not unusual to hear a child scream at the sight of an insect.Initially, the children were given gloves but then the school decided to give them a feel of the soil.After potting a plant, each child writes his or her name on the pot to observe it as it grows, transferring it to a bigger pot as and when necessary. Many of them take home the vegetables they grow and hand it over to their families with pride.My grandma loves spices and I gave her chillis that I had grown in school. She loved them and said they were really hot unlike the ones that were available in the market, said Adit Singh, a student of Class VIII. As the students toil under the sun, they gradually develop sensitivity and start caring for the plants. I come to water the plant and tend to it to check if there is any fungus growing on it. When it grows properly, it makes me happy, Roshni Ray of Class VII said.The children get really involved with the plants. The compost is also made in school, said Samriddhi Singhvi, the gardening teacher.The gardening class has also helped some students persuade their parents to grow plants at home."

This is exciting because limonene is inexpensive, its not harmful and its a lot less risky to use than pesticides, particularly when you dont apply it to the crop and it is only a weak scent in the air, explains Niall Conboy, Ph.D. scholar at the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University in a release. He is the first author of the study published in PLOS ONE .Limonene has been found to have activity against a number of different insects, mites and microorganisms. It is also commonly used as part of mosquito repellents. So there is a clear potential that this could work for other tomato pests, he adds in an email interview to The Hindu .Glasshouse studiesIn the first set of experiments, marigolds were grown with tomato plants throughout the cultivation period. The team then assessed the whitefly population and found that intermediate marigolds significantly reduced whitefly numbers.The second experiment, termed emergency measure, tried to find out if planting marigold after whitefly infestation would help save tomatoes. They concluded that the emergency measure was less effective compared to growing marigold throughout the cultivation period.The paper also noted that a mixture of edible and ornamental plants would also be economically viable as it reduces the use of additional chemical control measures.There must be more of these commonly used folk methods for protection of crops. We should look to test these techniques scientifically to potentially use on commercially grown crops in the future, adds Mr. Niall.The team has planned to use limonene in the form of dispensers (similar to hanging air fresheners) from the start of the growing season, to see if it has a more pronounced effect on whiteflies."

I am one of those, but I am even luckier because one of those is Zoroastrianism which celebrates not one, but two New Years in a year. Imagine that.This Navroz in March was just slipped in to give us an excuse to celebrate and give free legal reign to our gaiety and to one of our tenets: to go forth, eat, drink, be merry. Also, to guffaw out loud, talk about food, fast cars, Freddie Mercury and Frederic Chopin.Jamshedji Navroz, as the festival is formally called, is the start of the New Year as per the Shahenshahi Calendar of ancient Iran. It coincides with the spring equinox. Named after King Jamshed of Iran, who was powerful, wise and just, the festival also encapsulates the joy of the coming of spring after a long, cold winter.The Parsis, who are the Zoroastrians of India, celebrate this festival even if they live in Bombay, where the concept of winter belongs to the stage of Comedy Central. The thresholds of houses are decorated with rangoli, torans (fresh flower garlands) are hung across doorways, and breakfast is usually a sweet affair of Rava, which is semolina prepared in milk, sugar and egg, or Sev, which is thin vermicelli prepared in milk and sugar.Then off to the agiyary (fire temple) we go, dressed in new clothes, doing a lot of kissi-koti (kisses-hugs) to wish everyone. Some pray to Ahura Mazda for health of their family; a considerable portion also prays for the well-being of their cars and motorcycles.The much-anticipated afternoon meal can be either Dhandar patiyo, which is rice, plain yellow dal made with just turmeric, and a tangy fish or prawn gravy usually made from tomatoes, cashews, tamarind and jaggery, or even mutton pulao and dal. Of course, this will all be washed down with beer or gin and tonic. The evenings are meant for more merriment that includes going out for a Parsi naatak or a play and then for a meal. If you really want to celebrate Navroz the Parsi way, befriend a Parsi now and get invited.If youre not that quick, get a taste of Navroz at SodaBottleOpenerWala, the funky restaurant thats brought the cool to the humble Irani caf. Theyre doing a month-long celebration. . Theres a thali that also comes in a vegetarian option. Borderline blasphemy, but since we live in a world of nonsensical political correctness, oh well. (At various locations in Delhi; Rs. 695 for the real and glorious option, Rs. 625 for the vegetarian; Rs. 1,200 will get you the thali plus bottomless sangria.)Rustoms in the Parsi Anjuman will be shut on the 21st but will serve a special Paatru (meal on a banana leaf) on 23rd and 24th. This will have those lip-smacking delicacies that are served at Parsi weddings (Rs. 1,350 for the non-vegetarian option; Rs. 1150 for the unfortunate option).The Parsi Anjuman, at the end of Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, near the Delhi Gate, has a private function planned. You can gain entry as a guest of a member, but if you cant order from Dhun Bugli (9810788287), who will be catering, and pick it up after 8 p.m. Savour chicken pulao, Dhansak dal, mutton mince and Salli, thin and crispy fried potato straws, and Rava and chapatti."

Jagan Mohan Reddy at a public meeting at Tadipatri in Anantapur district on Monday.He said fee reimbursement would be revived and those women sending their children to schools will get Rs. 15,000 in their bank accounts. Beyond schooling, if the students pursue their studies their fee would be taken care of, he added.Criticising Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for politicising everything, he advised Mr. Naidu not to resort to diversionary tactics by targeting Telangana Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao and his party.Mr. Naidu is unable to ask votes based on the development he had done in the State, hence propping up Vivekanandas murder or KCRs alleged Rs. 1,000 crore donation to me, Mr. Jagan said. Mr. Jagan also accused Mr. Pawan Kalyan of surreptitiously helping the TDP and also alleged that Mr. Naidu was propping up candidates in all constituencies with helicopter symbol to confuse voters.A large number of TDP leaders including a former MLA from Tadipatri joined the YSRCP in the presence of Mr. Jagan.

However, the TDP had only laid the foundation stones in 2019, as an election gimmick.Addressing a public meeting at NTR bus stand junction at Madanapalle in Chittoor district, Mr. Jagan said that Mr. Naidu was trying to dupe people by announcing Rs. 3,000 social pension promise.Tomato marketHe alleged that Mr Naidu had encouraged commission system at Indias largest tomato market in Madanapalle, and made profits by selling the produce at his private firms.

2019-03-30,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/us-is-more-ambitious-than-get-out-and-in-some-ways-more-unsettling/cid/1687764,"Us is more ambitious than Get Out, and in some ways more unsettling","Jordan Peeles new horror movie, Us, is an expansive philosophical hall of mirrors. Like his 2017 hit, Get Out, this daring fun-until-its-not shocker starts from the genres central premise that everyday life is a wellspring of terrors. In Get Out, a young black man meets a group of white people who buy  at auction  younger, healthier black bodies. What makes Get Out so powerful is how Peele marshals a classic tale of unwilling bodily possession into a resonant, unsettling metaphor for the sweep of black and white relations in the United States  the US, or us.Us is more ambitious than Get Out, and in some ways more unsettling. Once again, Peele is exploring existential terrors and the theme of possession, this time through the eerie form of the monstrous doppelganger. The figure of the troublesome other  of Jekyll and Hyde, of the conscious and unconscious  ripples through the story of an ordinary family, the Wilsons, stalked by murderous doubles. These shadows look like the Wilsons but are frighteningly different, with fixed stares and guttural, animalistic vocalisations. Dressed in matching red coveralls and wielding large scissors (the better to slice and dice), they are funhouse-mirror visions turned nightmares.The evil twin is a rich, durable motif, and it winds through Us from start to finish, beginning with a flashback to 1986 at a Santa Cruz, Calif., amusement park. There, a young girl (the expressive Madison Curry) and her parents are leisurely wandering the park. The girl is itsy-bitsy (the camera sticks close to her so that everything looms), and she and her parents maintain a chilly, near-geometric distance from one another. Shes clutching a perfect candied apple, a portentous splash of red and a witty emblem both of Halloween and Edenic forbidden fruit. Movies are journeys into knowledge, and what the girl knows is part of the simmering mystery.The Wilsons, a family of four headed by Adelaide (a dazzling Lupita Nyongo) and Gabe (Winston Duke), enter many years later, introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery. The birds-eye view (or gods-eye, given the movies metaphysical reach) evokes the opener of Stanley Kubricks The Shining, a film Peele references throughout. A true cinephile, Peele scatters Us with nods and allusions to old-school 1970s and 80s movies including Goonies, Jaws, A Nightmare on Elm Street. (One disturbing scene suggests that hes also a fan of Michael Haneke.) But The Shining  another story of a grotesquely haunted family  serves as his most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually.Peele likes to mix tones and moods, and as he did in Get Out, he uses broad humour both for delay and deflection. Theres a cryptic opener and an equally enigmatic credit sequence, but soon the Wilsons are laughing at their vacation home. Its a breather that Peele uses for light jokes and intimacy (Dukes amiable performance provides levity and warmth) while he scatters narrative bread crumbs. Theres a beach trip with another family, this one headed by Kitty (a fantastic Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker), who have teenage twin girls (cue The Shining). At last, the movie jumps to kinetic life with the appearance of the Wilsons doubles, who descend in a brutal home invasion.The assault is a master class of precision-timed scares filled with light shivers and deeper, reverberant frights. Working within the houses tight, angled spaces  soon filled with fluid camerawork and bodies moving to dramatically different beats  Peele turns this domestic space into a double of the funhouse that loomed in the amusement park. After much scrambling and shrieking, the Wilsons and their weird twins face off in the living room, mirroring one another. Adelaides shadow, Red (the actors play their doubles), takes charge and splits up the Wilsons, ordering her husband, daughter and son to take charge of their terrified others while she remains with Adelaide.A vibrant, appealing screen presence, Nyongo brings a tremendous range and depth of feeling to both characters, who she individualizes with such clarity and lapidary detail that they arent just distinct beings; they feel as if they were being inhabited by different actors. She gives each a specific walk and sharply opposite gestures and voices (maternally silky vs. monstrously raspy). Adelaide, who studied ballet, moves gracefully and, when need be, rapidly (she racks up miles); Red moves as if keeping time to a metronome, with the staccato, mechanical step and head turns of an automaton. Both have ramrod posture and large unblinking eyes. Reds mouth is a monstrous abyss.The confrontation between Adelaide and Red testifies to Peeles strength with actors  here, he makes the most of Nyongos dueling turns - but, once Red starts explaining things, it also telegraphs the storys weakness. Us is Peeles second movie, but as his ideas pile up  and the doubles and their terrors expand  it starts to feel like his second and third combined. One of the pleasures of Get Out was its conceptual and narrative elegance, a streamlining that makes it feel shorter than its one hour 44 minutes. Us runs a little longer, but its surfeit of stuff  its cinephilia, bunnies of doom, sharp political detours and less-successful mythmaking  can make it feel unproductively cluttered.Peeles boldest, most exciting and shaky conceptual move in Us is to yoke the American present with the past, first by invoking the 1986 super-event Hands Across America. A very 80s charity drive (one of its organisers helped create the 85 benefit hit We Are the World), it had Americans holding hands from coast to coast, making a human chain meant to fight hunger and homelessness. President Reagan held hands in front of the White House even while his administration was criticised for cutting billions for programmes to help the homeless.In Us, the appearance of unity  in a nation, in a person  doesnt last long before being ripped away like one of the movies masks. Peele piles on (and tears off) the masks and the metaphors, tethers the past to the present and draws a line between the Reagan and Trump presidencies, suggesting that we were, and remain, one nation profoundly divisible. He also busies up his story with too many details, explanations and cutaways. Peeles problem isnt that hes ambitious; he is, blissfully. But he also feels like an artist who has been waiting a very long time to say a great deal, and here he steps on, and muddles, his material, including in a fight that dilutes even Nyongos best efforts.Early on, Peele drops in some text about the existence of abandoned tunnels, mines and subways in the United States. I flashed on Colson Whiteheads novel The Underground Railroad, which literalises the network of safe houses and routes used by enslaved black Americans, turning it into a fantastical subterranean passageway to freedom. In Us, Peele uses the metaphor of the divided self to explore what lies beneath contemporary America, its double consciousness, its identity, sins and terrors. The results are messy, brilliant, sobering, even bleak  the final scene is a gut punch delivered with a queasy smile  but Jordan Peele isnt here just to play."

At the Jubilee Hills outlet, theres a full-fledged buffet where dozens of excited diners skip sitting down after entering, instead heading straight for the buffet to prep their stomachs for the delights to come. Whats remarkable is the age bracket of the diners; theyre all between mid-twenties and early-forties.Rates Jubilee Hills outlet: Telangana special buffet: Veg 599 plus taxes, non-veg 799 plus taxesHitec City, Ameerpet & Lakdikapul outlets: Telangana special thali: Veg, non-veg and seafood starting at 249 plus taxesTurning to the zestiness of the diners around us, Jyothi explains, These are the people who love home food, whatever lifestyle they lead. These food items remind them of home.First, as any hospitable thali event would kick off, have some buttermilk and some fresh lime water before moving onto the hot soups. Jyothi has been avidly recommending the mamsam bokkala shorva, a light and intensely fragrant concoction derived from the goodness of mutton.Pesaru gaare with creamy white and unsalted venna | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniWorking with the Rayalaseema Ruchulu in-house chefs, Jyothi keeps a sharp eye on the balance of salt, karam podi, jeera and more. She also says, Im very particular about how the vegetables are cut. If you want to keep it authentic, green chillies and onions have to cut the way people are used to at home.This food festival has equal shares of consideration towards vegetarians, non-vegetarians and pescetarians. The starters are not oily at all as one would expect but some items do offer some buttery goodness. Dont miss out on kodi miriyala vepudu and the kodi rekkalla vepudu; the cuts are succulent with mindful doses of masala. The pesaru gaare with creamy white and unsalted venna are also a treat, and Jyothi encourages all to try the diet-friendly homemade butter.The rice  the binding dish across the board  is what makes or breaks a thali and here, you can choose between bagara annam, steamed rice or mamidikaya pulihora. Mix these with the podis on offer with a generous splash of golden ghee and your meal is almost set. What completes it, apart from the dozen of katoris of curries and pappus, are the tomato and beerakaya chutneys.Chef Jyothi V at Rayalaseema Ruchulu in Jubilee Hills | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniTo round off the experience, head straight for the dessert. I dont think Jyothi will let diners leave without indulging in the gummadikaya halwa and bellapannam. The halwas texture is slightly crunchy and isnt sickeningly sweet.Whats her own culinary journey been like? The vetted home chef chuckles as she says, 15 years ago, I didnt know how to make a perfectly round and flat roti. Now she has penned a few Telugu books including Andhra Special Vegetarian Vantalu about a corner in the culinary world thats being propelled by women home chefs. I love that there is more appreciation and the position of women as home-makers is gearing towards becoming home-chefs. Its important because before it was frowned upon if we worked. Now its become a space for business.Pakka Telangana Ruchulu will be running at Rayalaseema Ruchulu outlets until April 20."

For Hyderabad-based Bhargavi Bijjam, it led to a more eco-friendly and healthy lifestyle. She left her job in an MNC in 2013 to pursue different priorities in life, and the same year, she began taking baby steps in gardening. I was inspired by my grand parents who led a zero waste lifestyle, right from brushing their teeth to cleaning the dishes, says Bijjam.She has a 300 sq yard terrace space, of which 40 per cent is utilised for her garden. Besides brinjals, tomatoes, chillies, gourds, cauliflower, cabbage, drumsticks, radish and carrot, Bijjam also grows fruits like mango, sapota, sweet lime, Indian plum (regi), banana and water apple.Keeping the plants healthy requires a lot of effort and she relies on traditional composting at home. My potting mix is a ratio of soil, dry leaves and cow dung.It not only makes the soil weigh light but the dry leaves start decomposing, releasing the needed nutrients for plant growth. I get most of the seeds from my native and a few from online sources like greenmylife and Nativus farms, Bijjam says, adding that she also had many lady bugs to control most of the pest problems, while the rest were controlled with diluted soap nut solution.The biggest source of pride for the eco-conscious gardener is watching her garden grow. When you plant your own food the natural way, you are making a big impact on the environment and you will be rewarded with safe food, she explains.Her one tip to fellow gardeners is to start with a zero-budget. Making your garden fancier is only an option."

It goes without saying that these harsh summer months call for a cooling diet, and while an array of foods like watermelon, mango, pineapple, cucumber and veggies from the gourd family, are great on the summer menu, it is important to expand our diet to some other foods of worth in this season  spices.Spices are typically synonymous with all things hot and fiery, which is why they may appear to be misfits on the summer menu. However, the fact is that many spices have been used traditionally in India to keep cool and prevent sunstrokes in the warmer months. The prominent among these are basil, amchur, mint, aniseed and kokum.Basil with tomatoes is a great combination not just for taste but also for its cooling power. Shred some basil leaves onto a tomato salad, a great preparation on the summer lunch menu. Tomato and basil can also be blended together to make a puree, which you can use as a sandwich spread, or on a roti that can be stuffed with a filling of your choice and rolled over. Another simple way of using this sauce is to add it to cooked brown rice, making it extremely flavourful.Amchur, which is powdered raw mango, has unique antioxidants, such as lupeol, which is not found in any other fruit or vegetable. In addition to its cooling effects, it offers tremendous health benefits, including protecting the liver cells against pollutants such as cadmium. Add this spice to salads, soups and chutneys.Mint is yet another cooling spice. Mint chutney is a popular preparation, but you can also boil some of its leaves for a favourful cup of mint tea. Iced tea with mint leaves is a popular summer favourite.Kokum, a tiny fruit found in south India, has the medicinal property of preventing sunstroke and dehydration. Needless to say, kokum is much-loved by the inhabitants of these hot, humid regions. Beverages made with dried kokum fruit are cooling and delicious.Aniseed is similar to fennel seeds and often gets confused for it, but it is more delicate and does not have an aftertaste. Add this spice to your dessert or to just about anything and stay hydrated in the summer.Besides the above spices, we know that onions help prevent heat strokes. Folklore suggests that simply carrying an onion in your pocket can protect you against the harmful effects of the heat. Onions contain compounds which when eaten can prevent many heat-related problems.Neelanjana SinghNutrition Therapist & Wellness Consultant"

But the agrarian discontent and the dissatisfaction among tribals is still simmering. These are among the two central poll issues for the region that voted completely saffron in 2014 polls.The BJP has five sitting MPs here, while one constituency, Nashik, is with the Shiv Sena. Beyond agrarian distress and drought that has affected all five districts here, caste calculations in individual seats, Maratha vs OBC vs Scheduled Tribes polarisation will also have an impact on the results. Aware of the potential losses from the region, the BJP has turned down candidature for two of its sitting MPs from the region, three-term MP from Dindori Harishchandra Chavan and two-term MP from Jalgaon AT Patil. But this has, in turn, led to internal factionalism in the BJP. The Congress-NCP has an opportunity to improve their tally here, but it remains to be seen whether these parties can actually make use of an opportunity. While the Congress could win back the tribal Nandurbar belt, party bastion where it had lost no election until 2014; the NCP could potentially win Dindori or even Nashik due to local demographics and internal rivalries.AGRARIAN DISTRESS AND DROUGHTDespite the loan waiver announced by the Fadnavis government after the farmers strike in 2017, a majority of farmers are dissatisfied with the ruling government. The goodwill of the loan waiver granted to as many as 30lakh-plus farmers is not seen on ground zero.And even those who got the benefit now stand at the threshold of debt, thanks to drought. The drought this year has aggravated the disquiet, with farmers failing to recover, in many cases, even the production cost of crops. This year, I couldnt even recover the production cost of planting tomatoes over my two acres. I dont have the money to sow in June, said Kailash Kandbahale, a farmer from Nashik district.Despite this, Kandbahale may vote for the Shiv Senas Nashik candidate Hemant Godse and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. No government is good for farmers. The previous government was full of thieves and this one is made up of bandits. But Modi is good for the countrys security. This is a urban constituency, which will anyway vote for the Sena, then why should I waste my vote, Kandbahale asked.He said that there was no Modi wave like in 2014, but the PM continued to have a favourable image and was a deciding factor in urban areas. His extended family in Dinodri, a largely rural constituency, however, will be backing Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidate Dhanraj Mahale.Political observers said that agrarian crisis continues to be one of the strongest poll issues that will go against the ruling government in rural areas. From Jalgaons cotton and banana cultivators to Nashiks onion, grape and vegetable farmers, there is no cultivator who is unaffected by the volatile market conditions and current drought. There is a clear urban-rural divide vis-a-vis class as well as caste, when it comes to BJP support and opposition. The middle class, also from upper castes based in cities, prefer Modi and the BJP. In rural areas, there is anger against the Modi government and this is most apparent among lower castes and farmers, said a senior editor with a local, vernacular newspaper.In Nashik, for instance, there are nearly 8 lakh urban voters, of which a majority may be tilted in favour of the Sena-BJP, while around 6 lakh voters are from the rural areas of the constituency. In Dindori, a largely rural constituency, the agrarian distress, would have a greater impact.THE TRIBAL BELTThe north Maharashtras tribal belt, across the reserved constituencies of Dindori, Nandurbar and parts of Nashik, is unhappy with the government over the processing of their Forest Rights Act claims. Last year, 30,000 tribal cultivators had marched from Mumbai to Nashik seeking justice and speedier disbursal of claims that will give them ownership rights over their land.Barring Surgana, where CPI (M) MLA JP Gavit followed up on the 12,000 claims, the government has totally failed to meet the promises made to the tribals. This is a serious issue, as is the ongoing agrarian unrest, said Ashok Dhawale, CPI (M) leader and head of the All India Kisan Sabha that played a central role in both the protests.Gavit, the MLA from Akkalkuwa is also the CPI (M) candidate in the Dindori seat, turning the poll table into a three-cornered fight. Gavit, the man who led the marching 30,000 farmers, is a popular tribal leader. But this advantage to the Opposition may be lost with Gavit contesting the Dindori seat. We had sought this seat from the NCP and they should have given it to us. They are after all the bigger party. We are contesting this seat to win, but there is a chance of the opposition votes being split between the NCP and us, said Dhawale.The other subtle narrative in the tribal areas against the ruling government is the latters extension of economic and social benefits of tribal development department to the Dhangar community (shepherd). The Dhangars have been agitating for reservation in the Scheduled Tribe category for long. As the government could not deliver on this, fearing a backlash from the community, a cabinet decision was taken just ahead of the code of conduct to make all tribal linked schemes available to the Dhangars.Congress MLA and candidate for Nandurbar, KC Padvis campaign takes up this issue and this could go against BJP candidate Heena Gavit. While Gavit is not very popular, BJP leaders say in Nandurbar city, support for Modi will lift her chances of winning the seat.CASTE POLARISATIONCaste calculations in each constituency will have an impact on the results as will the overall polarization between the Marathas versus the Other Backward Castes (OBC).The states 16% reservation to the Maratha community has not gone down well with the OBCs, who form a significant chunk of voters in North Maharashtra. In Nashik a direct caste-based poll battle is likely with NCPs Sameer Bhujbal, a Mali (OBC) being pitted against Senas Hemant Godse (Maratha). In Dhule, BJP union minister Subhash Bhamre, an OBC, will be pitted against Congress candidate and MLA Kunal Patil (Maratha).In the case of Dhule, minority votes will also make an impact as Malegaon that has significant Muslim votes, falls in this constituency. These votes will go to the Congress, but may even lead to counter polarization, as it has for so many years in favour of the BJP.Even in a reserved seat like Nandurbar, for instance, the Maratha vs OBC factor will get played out with Marathas in this case voting against Gavit and in favour of the Congress, while OBCs may vote in favour of the BJP.The advantage in the polls will go to the party where the alliances are working together and the party organisation is activated. The BJP seems to score better than the remaining three parties when it comes to keeping its election machinery well oiled. The decision over Jalgaon candidate, who was changed at the last minute is an indication that the BJP is not leaving much to chance. After minister Girish Mahajans close aide district Jalgaon chief Uday Waghs wife and MLC Smita Wagh was given a ticket, the party witnessed opposition from ground level cadre. A survey showed that Wagh was not popular and may not succeed against Deokar, which led to the change in the candidate.The BJP is responsive and this may save us from the loss of one seat. The change was also done to dilute the rebellion by the sitting MP AT Patil, said a senior BJP leader.The Congress, for a change, taking a leaf from the opponent also succeeded in stemming a rebellion from its nine-term MP Manikrao Gavit in Nandurbar. Gavit was upset as his son Bharat was not given the ticket and Bharat Gavit had threatened to contest polls as an independent. Central Congress leaders met Gavit and placated him after a half an hour meeting.First Published: Apr 04, 2019 23:56 IST"

Gardening can be the answer.Not An Old-World SkillIn these competitive times, parents tend to favour more contemporary skills, such as computing to gardening, which is seen as an old-world skill. However, gardening is more than just a cute hobby. It is about learning to observe interactions between soil, water, sun, shade, smells, bugs and humans. Your balcony can thus be a microcosm of nature, where your child can experiment, connect dots and develop what the psychologist Howard Gardner describes as naturalistic intelligence. Such direct engagement with nature has no classroom substitute as it makes children know things not just by heart but in their hearts.POSITIVE TRENDSThankfully, many progressive schools and parents are beginning to see gardening as part of education. Young parents are increasingly replacing traditional birthday party return favours with plants and grow-kits. Some are even introducing plants as first pets to their children, before they are ready for four-legged ones.HACKS TO HOOK THEMHooking your digitally native children to gardening can be challenging initially. But, there are hacks that work. Grow-kits are a great way to get your kids started, especially if they contain illustrated guides and fun props like name-tags. In the beginning, if action takes too long, childrens excitement can fizzle out. So try fast-growing plants like micro-greens, which go from seed to harvest within 10 days. Mixing colours like green cress, purple radish and red amaranth, makes it even more exciting. Children also like plants that keep the drama going, like flowering and fruiting ones. Again, colour is exciting, as in cherry tomatoes or multi-coloured zinnia flowers, which also attract butterflies and hummingbirds. The only caveat here is that most flowering and fruiting plants, if grown from seeds, need transplantation and more care than the simpler leafy plants. If parents are not gardening savvy, they might want to introduce these as level 2 plants or start directly with saplings. Once your child has some initial confidence, then it is a good idea to up the challenge, let them experiment and even fail.FEAR NO DIRTDespite the advantages of gardening, some parents are still wary of it because they fear dirt. But research shows that exposure to these microbes is essential for developing their immunity. For example, epidemiological evidence shows that kids growing up in a farm environment have a much lesser chance of developing diseases like asthma. According to microbiologist Marie-Claire Arrieta, it is okay to let children play in backyards and even eat some dirt!(The author is co-founder of greenopia.co)"

With growing number of heavy motor vehicles using the stretch to deliver vegetables, commuters and vendors are caught in a daily tussle.S. Deepalakshmi, a tomato vendor at Thayir Market, says that lorries delivering vegetables, especially those carrying tonnes of onion and garlic, arrive at the street all through the day. It is common to see at least 100 lorries delivering goods, from around 4 a.m. It is chaotic, she says.D. Veeralakshmi, a regular customer, recounts the time when the stretch was less crowded. She says that with the two-wheeler boom, East Marret Street remains permanently choked with hundreds of scooters and bikes. The lodges on the street do not have a dedicated parking space. Many employees and visitors also park their bikes here. No form of traffic control helps here, she says.The bus stop outside the Thayir Market also contributes to the stagnation of traffic on the street, commuters add. L. Jayaraj, a fish seller, says that the buses and trucks add to excessive pollution. He says that unless parking is streamlined, there will be little or no space to do business.K. Ammaiyappan, a functionary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and a vegetable vendor, however, says that the traffic is intrinsic to the street. The heavy inflow of these lorries means that trade continues to occur on a daily basis. Both these markets are central to Madurais history. It would be nice if they could clear the garbage here regularly instead of focusing on traffic, he says. He adds that the areas problems will be solved if two-wheeler parking is earmarked to avoid haphazard parking.A Madurai Corporation engineer says that earlier there were plans to shift both the markets out of the street. This could not be accomplished due to objection from the public."

In Delhi, its celebrated in a way that takes people back home, and a reminder that our city is a mish-mash of cultures. Since it signifies the beginning of the Telugu year, it is considered auspicious and people start new ventures on this day, says Santhi Kodeboyina, a Delhi-based IT professional and entrepreneur, who began her systems-integration company on the day in 2004.People wake up at dawn, bathe, make a rangoli at the entrance of their homes and decorate with flowers. Then theres the food. Its an important part of the festival, with Ugadi pachadi being a must in every household, says Kodeboyina.The pachadi is made of raw mango pieces, tender neem leaves/flowers, tamarind, jaggery, coconut, green chillies, and salt. It has basic flavours: sweet, sour, bitter, spice, pungent, and salt, the dish represents the diverse emotions we go through in life: joy, sorrow, fear, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear, she says.Pachadi, lemon rice and sakkarai pongal are the key offerings to the Gods, with pachadi given as prasad after the pooja. There may be non-vegetarian fare for lunch.Kodeboyina recollects how Ugadi was celebrated in her village Ramayapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Homes are thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed, we buy new clothes for, and new films released on Ugadi. She misses the sense of gaiety that was all-pervasive there, but says, We still try to recreate the magic. Heres what you can do on the day, whether you celebrate the festival or want a taste of it.Karnataka Food Centre in R.K. Puram will serve a special Ugadi thali. The food will be served on a banana leaf in a thali, says Usman Abdul Sharief, the manager. Starting with butter milk, it will include lemon rice, white rice, puri, a dry vegetable (beans), avial, rasam, sambar, kosambari, papad, pickle, curd chilly, dal vada, sweet pan, payasam (made of seviyan and sabu dana). The star of the thali is holige (puran poli), which is eaten with ghee and coconut milk. It is a sweet made of chana dal, coconut and jaggery, he says. Holige represents the local produce of this season: the end of winter and beginning of summer, adding that the coconut is for taste.(Rs. 300 lunch, 11 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.; dinner, 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.)Dakshin at Sheraton New Delhi is offering a variety of dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, in its lunch thali. Besides special starters, there are three preparations with raw mango as the main ingredient: mamadikai mudda pappu (includes lentil tempered with mustard and cumin), mamidikai annam (raw-mango-flavoured rice) and Ugadi pachadi. Raw mango is part of the seasons harvest and hence it finds a prime place in the preparations, explains Velu Murugan, the chef leading the preparations. Other items include vankai alasandala karam (brinjal and butter-eyed beans in onion tomato gravy), pala koora masala (seasonal greens), chikkudukai tomato korma (flat beans) and, aloo gadda (double beans korma) among others, all made from seasonal agricultural produce. Theres also chinta chiguru mamsam (mutton curry flavoured with tamarind leaf), natu kodi pulusu (Andhra-style country chicken), and royyala vepudu (prawns). For dessert, choose from korra biyyam paramannam (jaggery-foxtail millet pudding) and bobbattlu (steamed rice pancake with jaggery filling).(Rs. 1,650+ taxes for a vegetarian thali, Rs. 1,950+ taxes for a non-vegetarian one, lunch, 12.30 p.m. to 2.45 p.m.)Andhra Pradesh Bhavan Canteen , thronged by foodies and just those grabbling a meal, will also be celebrating. The regular thali will be given an Ugadi touch and we will include mango puliyodharai, Ugadi pachadi, poornam boore and gari (vada), says Satyanarayan Reddy, the manager. These, he said, will allow the guests to taste and enjoy special regional cuisine.(Rs. 140, lunch from 12 noon )Bagundi , the newly opened restaurant in Connaught Place will be decorated with mango and banana leaves and jasmine flowers. Besides regular Andhra cuisine, every guest will be offered Ugadi pachadi and sakkarai pongal complimentary, says Naveen Rawat, the executive chef.Tejeesh Behl, who runs an art start-up says, These celebrations are a treat for people like me, who are not from that region and dont celebrate Ugadi.

2019-04-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farm-mechanisation-tractors-equipments-when-the-field-is-level-5669445/,Farm mechanisation: When the field is level,"Dinesh Singh Saini has 16 bigha (3.33 acres; one acre=4.8 bigha), of which 2 bigha is dedicated to growing wheat only for self-consumption. On the remaining land, he cultivates vegetables, mainly cauliflower (10 bigha) and tomato (4 bigha).AdvertisingThis farmer, like many in Raghunathpur village in Hapur district and tehsil of western Uttar Pradesh, deploys a laser land leveler  computer manjha, in local parlance  on his field once every two years.Isse paani ki bachat hai aur paidavar bhi zyaada hai (it saves water and also boosts yields), says Saini about this machine that uses guided laser beam technology, as against conventional bullock/tractor-drawn iron scrappers or wooden planks, for smoothening and leveling of the soil surface prior to sowing.ALSO READ | Cane payment arrears could hurt the BJPs prospects in Maharashtra as much as in Uttar PradeshAdvertisingThe Spectra Precision manjha operating on his field basically comprises a laser emitter (fixed on a tripod stand just outside the field that is to be leveled), receiver (mounted on a mast attached to a tractor-drawn bucket with a scraper blade) and control box (fitted on the tractor). The emitter continuously sends out an infrared beam that can travel up to 600 meters radius in a perfectly straight line parallel to the required field plane. The receiver picks up the beam and converts it into an electrical signal for transmission to the control box. The control box, in turn, activates a valve that regulates the flow of oil from the tractors pump to the hydraulic cylinder to raise and lower the bucket/ scraper. The scraper guidance is automatic, with the raising and lowering of the blade (which cuts and fills the soil to achieve the desired leveling) simply following the laser beam.ALSO READ | Bonus for wheat could become major election campaign issue in Madhya PradeshWith manjha, the water reaches all parts of my field and I can irrigate 2 bigha in one hour, which otherwise (in unleveled land) takes 1.5 or even two hours. My gobi (cauliflower) yield, too, has doubled from 40-50 panni (polythene bags of 18 kg each) to 80-100 panni per bigha, while rising from 80-90 crates (of 25 kg each) to 100-150 crates per bigha for tamatar (tomato). This is due to more uniform distribution of water as well as placement of fertiliser and seed. The result is better germination and growth of plants, which are also of the same size in a leveled field, claims Saini, who sows his cauliflower and tomato nurseries in July, followed by transplanting in August. Cauliflower is harvested during November-December and tomato over November-February. He further sows lobiya (cowpea) in March-April for harvesting in May-June.Saini does not own the manjha, which does 3-4 bigha in an hour. He has hired the Spectra Precision laser leveler from Akash Sharma, who charges an hourly rate of Rs 650-700. The 20-year-old Sharma, a fresh commerce graduate from the nearby IMIT College in Hapur, is a farmer himself. His father Shivnath and he cultivate paddy-wheat on 20 out of their 35-bigha holding. On the balance 15 bigha, they take tomatoes and fodder maize (planted in March for harvesting in 60-70 days).We earn more from hiring of machinery than farming now, states Sharma, who bought the manjha for Rs 2.90 lakh a year ago. He has also invested Rs 22,000 in a cultivator (used for seedbed preparation) and Rs 1.06 lakh in a rotavator (for more heavy-duty tillage). All these equipment are powered by a 58-horsepower Sonalika tractor costing him Rs 7.22 lakh.My tractor runs for 1,000 hours in a year, of which only 100 hours is for our use and the rest on other farmers fields. The cultivator can cover roughly 14 bigha per hour and I charge a rate of Rs 100/bigha, with these at 8-9 bigha and Rs 160/bigha for the rotavator, explains Sharma.Sharmas laser leveler is operated for over 600 hours annually, much of it from end-February (just after harvesting of potato) to mid-July (before the monsoon rains). I do almost 500 hours during this period and another 100-125 hours from end-October to end-November (between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing). My income (at Rs 650-700/hour) comes to Rs 4-4.2 lakh, while the major expenses are on diesel (Rs 1.6 lakh for 4 litres/hour at Rs 66.5/litre) and labour (Rs 60,000, if hired for 150 days at Rs 400/day). Even after repair and maintenance, I make decent money, he adds.Manjeet Singh of Davinder Agriculture Works, a farm equipment dealer here, estimates that Hapur district alone has some 1,500 laser levelers. 70 per cent of farmers in Raghunathpur, which has 5,200 bigha of agricultural land, are using these in their fields. This village has two levelers (the other one belongs to Sharmas fathers brother Moolesh) and they cater to its entire requirement. Custom hiring has allowed even farmers with 10 bigha (2 acres) to level their lands once in two years. They are fully aware of the benefits from it, he points out.According to Rajan Aiyer, managing director of Trimble India Pvt. Ltd  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the California-based Trimble Inc, which sells Spectra Precision laser levelers  the market for precision agriculture equipment is expanding fast. We were the first to introduce land levelers in the country, for research trials in 2001-02 and commercial sales in 2004-05. There would be 1,00,000-1,25,000 levelers in Indian fields today, with a few hundreds of thousands acres of land being leveled every year, mostly in Punjab, Haryana and western UP, he notes.Apart from Spectra Precision, major laser leveler brands selling in India include Leica, Topcon, Moba and assorted Chinese makes."
2019-04-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farm-mechanisation-tractors-equipments-when-the-field-is-level-5669445/,Farm mechanisation: When the field is level,"Dinesh Singh Saini has 16 bigha (3.33 acres; one acre=4.8 bigha), of which 2 bigha is dedicated to growing wheat only for self-consumption. On the remaining land, he cultivates vegetables, mainly cauliflower (10 bigha) and tomato (4 bigha).AdvertisingThis farmer, like many in Raghunathpur village in Hapur district and tehsil of western Uttar Pradesh, deploys a laser land leveler  computer manjha, in local parlance  on his field once every two years.Isse paani ki bachat hai aur paidavar bhi zyaada hai (it saves water and also boosts yields), says Saini about this machine that uses guided laser beam technology, as against conventional bullock/tractor-drawn iron scrappers or wooden planks, for smoothening and leveling of the soil surface prior to sowing.ALSO READ | Cane payment arrears could hurt the BJPs prospects in Maharashtra as much as in Uttar PradeshAdvertisingThe Spectra Precision manjha operating on his field basically comprises a laser emitter (fixed on a tripod stand just outside the field that is to be leveled), receiver (mounted on a mast attached to a tractor-drawn bucket with a scraper blade) and control box (fitted on the tractor). The emitter continuously sends out an infrared beam that can travel up to 600 meters radius in a perfectly straight line parallel to the required field plane. The receiver picks up the beam and converts it into an electrical signal for transmission to the control box. The control box, in turn, activates a valve that regulates the flow of oil from the tractors pump to the hydraulic cylinder to raise and lower the bucket/ scraper. The scraper guidance is automatic, with the raising and lowering of the blade (which cuts and fills the soil to achieve the desired leveling) simply following the laser beam.ALSO READ | Bonus for wheat could become major election campaign issue in Madhya PradeshWith manjha, the water reaches all parts of my field and I can irrigate 2 bigha in one hour, which otherwise (in unleveled land) takes 1.5 or even two hours. My gobi (cauliflower) yield, too, has doubled from 40-50 panni (polythene bags of 18 kg each) to 80-100 panni per bigha, while rising from 80-90 crates (of 25 kg each) to 100-150 crates per bigha for tamatar (tomato). This is due to more uniform distribution of water as well as placement of fertiliser and seed. The result is better germination and growth of plants, which are also of the same size in a leveled field, claims Saini, who sows his cauliflower and tomato nurseries in July, followed by transplanting in August. Cauliflower is harvested during November-December and tomato over November-February. He further sows lobiya (cowpea) in March-April for harvesting in May-June.Saini does not own the manjha, which does 3-4 bigha in an hour. He has hired the Spectra Precision laser leveler from Akash Sharma, who charges an hourly rate of Rs 650-700. The 20-year-old Sharma, a fresh commerce graduate from the nearby IMIT College in Hapur, is a farmer himself. His father Shivnath and he cultivate paddy-wheat on 20 out of their 35-bigha holding. On the balance 15 bigha, they take tomatoes and fodder maize (planted in March for harvesting in 60-70 days).We earn more from hiring of machinery than farming now, states Sharma, who bought the manjha for Rs 2.90 lakh a year ago. He has also invested Rs 22,000 in a cultivator (used for seedbed preparation) and Rs 1.06 lakh in a rotavator (for more heavy-duty tillage). All these equipment are powered by a 58-horsepower Sonalika tractor costing him Rs 7.22 lakh.My tractor runs for 1,000 hours in a year, of which only 100 hours is for our use and the rest on other farmers fields. The cultivator can cover roughly 14 bigha per hour and I charge a rate of Rs 100/bigha, with these at 8-9 bigha and Rs 160/bigha for the rotavator, explains Sharma.Sharmas laser leveler is operated for over 600 hours annually, much of it from end-February (just after harvesting of potato) to mid-July (before the monsoon rains). I do almost 500 hours during this period and another 100-125 hours from end-October to end-November (between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing). My income (at Rs 650-700/hour) comes to Rs 4-4.2 lakh, while the major expenses are on diesel (Rs 1.6 lakh for 4 litres/hour at Rs 66.5/litre) and labour (Rs 60,000, if hired for 150 days at Rs 400/day). Even after repair and maintenance, I make decent money, he adds.Manjeet Singh of Davinder Agriculture Works, a farm equipment dealer here, estimates that Hapur district alone has some 1,500 laser levelers. 70 per cent of farmers in Raghunathpur, which has 5,200 bigha of agricultural land, are using these in their fields. This village has two levelers (the other one belongs to Sharmas fathers brother Moolesh) and they cater to its entire requirement. Custom hiring has allowed even farmers with 10 bigha (2 acres) to level their lands once in two years. They are fully aware of the benefits from it, he points out.According to Rajan Aiyer, managing director of Trimble India Pvt. Ltd  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the California-based Trimble Inc, which sells Spectra Precision laser levelers  the market for precision agriculture equipment is expanding fast.

Ranjith Kumar, co-founder of R&R Trading Company that makes these pencils, told The Hindu that these pencils had been produced in an attempt to spread the message of 100% voter turnout. These pencils come with four different slogans  two in English and two in Tamil. We have made 500 such pencils, he said.Mr. Kumar said the idea was to distribute these pencils to college students and government officials free of cost. We have already distributed to two colleges through our friends and we will reach out to more colleges. A pencil set was given to the Coimbatore post office. We will be meeting the District Collector soon with the pencils, he said.Launched in 2016 by Mr. Kumar and his friend A. Rajakamalesh, Farmcil pencils come with a seed capsule containing seeds of ten different varieties of plants, including vegetables such as tomato, ladies finger and brinjal and flowering plants such as sunflower, zinnia and balsam.The capsule part can be buried into the soil after the pencil has shortened with use.Although this product is targeted for schoolchildren, many college students are buying the pencils to do their part in creating awareness about planting trees. Even MNCs (multinational companies) are buying these pencils under their Corporate Social Responsibility programmes, Mr. Kumar said."

At the entrance of the memorial that was inaugurated in 1961, there is a gallery, full of words and photos on the massacre. The lines, Its a tragedy of national importance that cannot be allowed to be forgotten, are a stark reminder of how India freed itself from colonial brutality.For Mukherjee, secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, this is both home and office  his residence is a short flight upstairs.The 64-year-old with green eyes was born here, like his father Uttam Charan. The Mukherjees from the Hooghly district of West Bengal have been the caretakers of the Jallianwala memorial since its inception. Mukherjees grandfather Sashti Charan Mukherjee, a homeopath practising in Allahabad, was deputed by Congress leader Madan Mohan Malaviya to arrange a session in Amritsar in 1910. He never went back. Present at the bagh on the day of the 1919 massacre, Sashti Charan escaped death by hiding under the dais, and later moved a resolution for acquiring the site at the Congress session in Amritsar. This was followed by a nationwide appeal for fundraising by Mahatma Gandhi and a trust was set up with Malaviya as president and Sashti Charan as secretary. The British, it is said, wanted to obliterate the signs of the massacre by setting up a cloth market here but the Indians managed to acquire the land in 1920. Miffed, the authorities arrested Sashti Charan, who had the land deed, but he remained resolute.Ever since, the Mukherjees have been the caretakers of the memorial. Sukumar, the youngest of three brothers, quit his bank job to take on the mantle from his father Uttam Charan when he died in 1988. I was appointed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi, says Mukherjee. Most visitors treat it as a picnic spot, sometimes they dont even care to read its history, he rues.Although the Trust is headed by the Prime Minister, managing the memorial is no cakewalk, says Mukherjee. In 2011, he had goons following him when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered eviction of an illegal occupant from one of the Trust buildings.During militancy in Punjab in the 1980s, a group of youngsters with swords apparently threatened to kill his father, saying they had seen people smoking in the bagh. Papaji was very gutsy, he said, kill me and they left, Mukherjee recalls.Living with a piece of history has its challenges. Kakoli, Sukumars wife who came here as a young bride in the 1980s when militancy had gripped the state, remembers the siege during Operation Bluestar. We couldnt step out for over a week, thankfully papaji (Uttam Charan) had a habit of storing ration. It was due to the barter of onions and tomatoes that she came close to her neighbours during that period, Mukherjee says. My daughters worry about my health and tell me Papa, youve done enough sewa, come stay with us, but I want to see the memorial through its 100th anniversary. Then, I will see, Mukherjee says.First Published: Apr 13, 2019 07:36 IST"

In 2011, he had goons following him when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered eviction of an illegal occupant from one of the Trust buildings.During militancy in Punjab in the 1980s, a group of youngsters with swords apparently threatened to kill his father, saying they had seen people smoking in the bagh. Papaji was very gutsy, he said, kill me and they left, Mukherjee recalls.Living with a piece of history has its challenges. Kakoli, Sukumars wife who came here as a young bride in the 1980s when militancy had gripped the state, remembers the siege during Operation Bluestar. We couldnt step out for over a week, thankfully papaji (Uttam Charan) had a habit of storing ration. It was due to the barter of onions and tomatoes that she came close to her neighbours during that period, Mukherjee says. My daughters worry about my health and tell me Papa, youve done enough sewa, come stay with us, but I want to see the memorial through its 100th anniversary. Then, I will see, Mukherjee says.First Published: Apr 13, 2019 07:36 IST"

Just mention Assamese cuisine and some might even shudder a little or shy away because it has been made to sound so exotic or even intimidating. But it isnt. These are all myths that have been propagated to create TRPs for TV shows and social media. Some of these myths were busted for me by Kashmiri Barkakati Nath, exactly a year ago when she hosted her first Assamese pop-up in the city. Mumbaikars now have a chance to bust some myths about the States food too, with the self-taught proponent of Assamese cuisine, Nath coming from Guwahati with a host of traditional ingredients, her passion and a deep desire to showcase these gastronomical delights.The first thing Nath said to me when we met then was, I do not do tribal cuisine. She was visibly pained when talking about incorrect perceptions of Assamese cuisine. Momos, crickets worms. these are not representative of our food. I want to showcase regular Oxomiya (Assamese) food to the world. I remember identifying with her at the time. I was similarly upset when a popular TV show showcased kandalee or bichughaas (stinging nettle) as a sensational food in its episode on Garhwali cuisine. Yes, it is eaten and is quite tasty (it was a traditional foraged food used to supplement the diet), but only if found it by the wayside on the way home, is one inclined to risk being stung to harvest and cook it. Is it representative of vegetable preparations on the Gahrwali thali? Not by a long shot.While elements like insects, ferments, bhoot jholokia exist in Assamese food, they arent representative of the cuisine on the whole. These elements exist as part of tribal diets in Assam, but 80% of Assamese society is non-tribal. And just like every cuisine in the world, Assams food culture is a confluence of many factors and has many local regional variations.Assam is rich in local flora and fauna and has evolved its own signature flavour profile based on the climate and topography. Our diet is local and seasonal and has evolved to make the most of what we have available. We eat many traditional varieties of rice, as it is, or made into a variety of pithas accompanied but many subtly spiced curries, gravies and condiments, elaborates Nath. Predominantly rice based, Assamese cuisine is full of subtle flavours and delicate accents. Although perceived as meat centric, and associated strongly with pork, Assamese food is more nuanced. With rivers such as the Brahmaputra and its tributaries flowing through and almost every home boasting a pond, fish is much loved and eaten with relish. Being rich in local produce all year round, owing to abundant rain  vegetable dishes are cooked in a variety of ways to supplement meals. Pork has only became popular over the last 20 years or so. Meat is reserved for special occasions and festivals. Even though it is in India and the bhoot jholokia grows in Assam, our food is not spicy at all. We do not use many spices. Our dals and curries are mildly and delicately seasoned. We also use a lot of souring agents. Our hot and humid climate, has resulted in consumption of souring agents that have a cooling effect on the body. We also eat a lot of fermented foods, shares Nath.Local food, global twistNath has hosted Assamese food festivals and cooked for visiting dignitaries and celebrities. Shes also a permanent jury member for the Guwahati Food Awards while doubling up as a menu consultant for the Taj Group in Guwahati. Having been mentored by legendary cooks from tea estates, Nath has gained a deep understanding of the varied nuances of Assamese cuisine including the Ahom, South East Asian, and Colonial influences that blended with local techniques and ingredients to create Assamese cuisine.The Unsavoured Assam pop-up that Nath is hosting in the city currently showcases this. In honour of Rongali Bihu, a festival that marks the advent of the spring and is celebrated to welcome the Hindu New Year, Nath has included Bihu festive dishes as well as classic Assamese cuisine. Traditional ingredients and dishes are treated with delicacy and beautifully presented in more modern formats. Take the appetisers for example, Starters are Western concepts, Nath says, But I believe that a food must evolve and stay rooted in traditions at the same time. Its a process that has resulted in a thoughtful menu that caters to the vegetarian and non-vegetarian palate.Eat AssameseWhats on the menu, then? Theres Luchi, Guti Aloo and the flavourful Bilahi Ambol, ( an appetiser of s mall puffed puris topped with Assamese baby potatoes and sweet tomato chutney). Then theres the soul satisfying anguli pitha. Inspired by the traditional one-bowl dish of hand rolled rice flour dumplings, Naths version is rich in taste and texture, tossed in a piquant tomato sauce. Other unforgettable dishes included Maas Khorika Aru Kharoli (chunks of fish smoked and served with fermented mustard chutney), and the Haanh Kumura which is duck slow-simmered with ash gourd until its falling off the bone.Also included Bihu specials like Til Diya Chicken ( chicken in black sesame seed), the Pani Pitha Aru Bengena Pura , Jolphai Meetha Chutney (bite-sized rice flour pancakes with smoked eggplant and a sweet olive chutney), the Bhaat Kerala Bor Aamor Chutney (stuffed teasel gourd fritters with spicy sweet mango chutney). Desserts include Kola Bora Sawalor paiyox (black rice kheer) and Kumal Sawal, Doi and Gur (rice with yogurt and jaggery).An Assamese cooking class featuring dishes from the pop-up will take place at APB Cook Studio on April 17; call 42152799.

Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, said prices of all the green vegetables have shot up in the last few days. For instance, beans sells at Rs. 100 a kg in the wholesale market and bitter gourd at Rs. 30 a kg on Saturday. Carrot is sold at Rs. 50 a kg and ginger at Rs. 80 a kg, he added.Most of the vegetables come to Coimbatore from Karnataka all through the year. There is a drop in supply of some of the varieties because of summer and there is no rain in the cultivating areas. These vegetables cannot be stocked for long.The public do not feel the impact of the hike as prices of onions and potatoes are normal. Big onion, which comes from Maharashtra, is sold at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a kg, small onion at Rs. 22 a kg, tomato at Rs. 25 a kg, and potato at Rs. 22 a kg.However, prices of other vegetables are very high. The rain is expected only in June and the prices may go up further in the coming weeks, he said."

The sky-rocketing cost is attributed to the low yields since the first week of March.While the stocks reaching tomato traders at the Madanapalle market yard in the district, considered Asias largest, was 900 tonnes per day in April 2018, this year the figure has fallen to a mere 200 tonnes per day.The Madanapalle revenue division has about 20,000 tomato growers cultivating the produce in about 30,000 hectares. Half of them are members of the tomato market at Madanapalle.Tomato growers observed that during the last three years, climatic conditions are playing truant with them, against the backdrop of the failure of rains, depletion of groundwater tables, and moisture factors in the air and soil. Since the first week of April this year, temperatures have been increasing gradually, crossing 40 degrees Celsius. This has led to a sudden drop in the yield, and delays in the flowering and budding of the crop. In contrast, the temperatures were more clement last summer till April, allowing the first cutting of crop with good yields.Former chairman of the Market Committee, Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, told The Hindu that by April-end, the yields would improve. There is a tremendous delay in the crop pattern this season, he said.Two varietiesThe wholesale price of tomatoes stood at Rs. 312 per box (10 kg) for the first variety and Rs. 194 for the second variety. The first variety, despite low yield, is taken away by traders from Bengaluru and Chennai, and it is the second variety that has come to dominate the local markets at Rs. 50 a kg. But for a small quantum, exports completely fallen.With the sudden increase in the price of tomatoes, households across the district have begun substituting the staple with tamarind in the kitchen."
2019-04-18,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/the-story-that-repeats-itself-every-year/article26879528.ece,The story that repeats itself every year,"Walk into the Model Rythu Bazaar at Erragadda on any given day in summer, and the prices of vegetables never fail to surprise you. For, they have been changing since the past few weeks. A case in point: one kg of tomato which used to cost 12 in the third week of March has shot up to 35-40 a kg since April 15.Not just tomatoes, the prices of green or red chillies, cauliflower, capsicum and other vegetables have gone up too. And the prices are likely to increase further. Of all the vegetables sold at Rythu Bazaar, the highest price is of French beans, which is 85 per kg.When asked when were the prices low, a vendor waiting for customers scoffed, Prices were low in winter, the season when we faced losses and even threw away some vegetables as no one bought them,. She pointed at a farmer, Malugari Narasimha Reddy, who doubles up as a vendor at the Rythu Bazaar, suggesting that he has a fair idea on the reasons that lead to price rise.This is the trend every summer. Owing to water scarcity, our crop yield falls and thus the price rise. When we cultivate a crop in winters, lets say green chilli, the yield is only 70% and the remaining 30% goes waste. And in summers, the yield is 30% and the rest 70% goes waste, said Mr. Narasimha Reddy, who was selling chillies grown at his farm in Nawabpet mandal in Vikarabad.The chillies that used to cost around 16 per kg in winters, costs 50-65 per kg in April.Mr. Narasimha Reddy, a seasoned farmer who has been selling his produce at the Rythu Bazaar since the past 19 years, and others said they get low price for their produce for eight months in a year, which increases only for three months in summers.While attending to one of his regular customers, another farmer-cum-vendor Kamalakar Reddy said one kg of tomato costs 40 per kg. But he sells it at 35, 5 less than the price listed on Rythu Bazaar charts.Transport costThe prices got so low in the last winter that we sold tomato at 5 per kg, said Mr. Kamalakar, who sells vegetables grown at Chancharpet in Vikarabad district. He said besides paying 30 per crate to transport it from his village to the Rythu Bazaar, he has to pay 300 per worker if the load is more.Estate officer at Model Rythu Bazaar at Erragadda, P. Ramesh, said going by past experiences where farmers incurred losses by growing some vegetables as many farmers cultivated the same crop, they have avoided repeating the mistake this time. This year, a few have cultivated onion. But we get it from other places too and therefore, their price has not increased, said Mr. Ramesh said."
2019-04-18,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wilting-vegetables-leave-farmers-high-and-dry/article26879518.ece,Wilting vegetables leave farmers high and dry,"The rising temperatures coupled with depleting groundwater level have led to wilting of vegetables in gardens at Nallavelli and the surrounding villages in Dichpally mandal, resulting in huge losses to farmers.With many bore-wells going dry in the villages and insufficient rainfall this year, the farmers are staring at crop loss.Nomula Ram Reddy, a farmer, sowed ridge gourd, ladies finger and tomato in 1.5 acres of land, leaving another 1.5 acres barren owing to shortage of water sources. I did not go for paddy this year as two of my bore-wells went dry. Now, even my vegetables are dry, and I have not had the chance to sell some of it, he said. As farmers faced water scarcity, they decided to grow vegetables that can be grown with comparatively less water. On an average, each farmer has invested between 15,000 and 20,000 per acre. Bore-wells are so dry that they are not even able to supply water through drip pipes. Many farmers have already lost their money. As of now, there is no farm activities in the villages, said Mothe Rajeswar Reddy, another farmer. The farmers here feel the pinch much more as the prices of vegetables in the market have gone up. There is a huge gap between demand and supply, but the farmers here are rendered helpless."

2019-04-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2019/apr/18/hyderabads-heritage-served-daily-club-style-1965834.html,"Hyderabad’s heritage served daily, club-style","Kakoli Mukherjee ByExpress News ServiceHistory does not always lie frozen in the walls of heritage buildings or in memories of grandparents. Sometimes, it is found in the pages of a recipe book, in the instructions of a khansama training his apprentice. You might start appreciating culinary history a bit more when you realise that the Fruit Trifle you are tasting has remained unchanged in the last 100 years, or when you learn that the recipe of a biryani has been the same since the Nizams time.Hyderabad is steeped in history, and a few of the clubs here are over a century old. The Secunderabad Club, one of the five oldest clubs in India, was established in 1878. The Nizams Club was formed in 1884 and the Deccan Club in 1900.These clubs are not only housed in buildings that evoke the glory of the past, but also have recipes that have been with them since the time of their inception. For example, the Fruit Trifle in Secunderabad Club, has a cult following of its own. It was made a part of the clubs menu by the British officers who were stationed in Secunderabad (the club was formed by the British Army Garrisons). One spoonful into the the decadent yet understated dessert, and you know why this pudding is so revered. The dish, which has soft sponge cake as the base, a layer of luscious cream, and a topping of cherries and pineapples, is perfection itself.Talking about the other favourites, Krishna Reddy Pingle, house committee chairman, Secunderabad Club, says: We have a main club and a sailing club. We have 16 Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets at these two places. While Mediterranean cuisine is a hit in the main club, the sailing annexe has good pan-Asian fare. We are also known for our sandwiches, fried fish with tartar sauce and Angels on Horseback (sausages wrapped in bacon strips). Around 600 people visit the club every day, out of which 200 eat meals here.We have 30-40 chefs on our rolls. Giving more insights into the history and functioning of the kitchen, the clubs F&B manager, Gautam Dev, says: We have around 15-20 old, handwritten recipe books in our library, which we still follow. Our outlets include the Collonade (coffee bistro), 1878 Bar, Bridge Room, Fountain lawn, AC dining hall (buffets are served here) and others. We still follow the British rank system of bearers, stewards and supervisors.Throwing light on some of the special dishes, senior sous chef Manu Bauri says: Our club is also known for Hyderabadi delicacies like Sofiyani Biryani, which has a mildly sweet taste due to the use of cream. We also have Chicken Anarkali which is a rich Mughlai dish made with magaz seed paste, cashews and almonds. Our Mutton Chutney is also a favourite among the club patrons. In the sailing club, Chippe ka Gosht, which is mutton cooked in an earthen pot, is much sought-after.Nizam ClubNizam Clubs biryani is a part of the citys folklore. The high-ceilinged, white and cream dining hall with vintage chandeliers, transports you to a culinary haven where the Nizams dined. The biryani, you realise, is unlike anything you have tasted in restaurants, and is delightfully filling yet light on stomach.We still make our biryani on firewood and the recipe is passed down from one chef to another, remaining unchanged for over a century. Only Potla meat (meat from male sheep) is used to make the mutton biryani. We marinate the meat for 45 minutes and cook the biryani on dum for some 45 minutes. We make it in batches of 2 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg, and it takes nearly 1.5 hours to cook each batch, says Ghulam Mohammed Fayyaz, the clubs F & B manager.Another special dish is the Seene ka Dalcha, in which meat only from the breast of goat is used. The club has five main chefs and one assistant chef, and 400-500 patrons visit the club daily. Besides the main dining hall, food is served on the lawns and in banquet halls when there are family gatherings. Mohib Baig, the great grandson of the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad and a member of the club, says: The club sees a rise in footfall on Fridays when traditional Nizami delicacies like Mutton Chutney, Haleem, Paya and Zabaan are served.You wont find a single bone in our Haleem. Our Mutton Chutney and Mutton Shikampuri are big crowd pullers too. The Mutton Chutney is made after boiling the meat with tomatoes, chillies, garlic and other spices. Among vegetarians, Malai Kofta and Navratan Korma are the favourite dishes. Double ka Meetha and Apricot pudding are eternal favourites too, adds the F&B manager. In summer, Phalsa juice and Kairi Sharbat are among the most-ordered items.Deccan ClubFor the past 10 years, Mohammed Ayub has been helping his brother Mohammed Majeed in his kabab stall in Deccan Club. In the club, which has outsourced its kitchen to caterers, the kabab corner is a long-staying one. Our Chicken Zafrani and Chicken Kandahari kababs are bestsellers, says Md Ayub.The club has a south Indian kitchen too run by a catering company, and a Chinese kitchen run by Jacqueline Nicholas, who has an Anglo-Indian restaurant of her own. We used to have our own cooks earlier. We started outsourcing after our club started going into losses. Our patrons enjoy having snacks like Moong Dal Pakoda with drinks in the bar, or having meals on the lawns when there is a Tombola game, says Avinash Gupta, president of Deccan Club.

2019-04-19,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/at-coimbatores-haji-ali-fresh-fruit-juices/article26888173.ece,Fruit cream and fast service,"Its 8.40 pm and there was just one table left at Haji Ali Fresh Fruit Juices. We grabbed it and frowned over the menu. Given the variety on offer, it was difficult to decide but finally settled for Carronge (Carrot and Orange juice, though my husband made a face), Ganga Jamuna (Orange and Sweet Lime juice) and a plain musambi juice for the unadventurous man; a vegetable cheese pizza, pani puri, cheese pav bhaji and vegetable cheese grill sandwich.Mix the spice in the pani puri to your own tasteThe pani puri arrived first, each puri resting on a tiny glass of spicy mint water and the date-tamarind chutney in a separate bowl. This allowed us to fix the spice levels to suit our individual tastes and the explosion of flavours that resulted was incredible.Whats in a name In case anyone is wondering if this is the branch of the famous Mumbai outlet, Shiva Prakash, one of the owners (the others being Hajiali Noufal and Vimal Kumar), clarifies that this is a branch of the Kochi eatery with the same name.The men behind the eatery (from left) Shiva Prakash, Hajiali Noufal and Vimal KumarThe pizza, pav bhaji and sandwich were piping hot and came in quick succession. The pizza base was crisp and the cheese a melting blanket that covered the veggies. The sandwich had a nice minty flavour, which on investigation turned out to be the mint chutney smeared on the bread. The pav was soft and generously spread with butter, and the cheese took the edge of the bhajis bite. While the dishes were equally tasty, the highlight for me was the Carronge, with the sweetness of the carrot and orange chasing each other at each sip. The service was so quick that we are done in half an hour. The only downside was none of us felt up to coping with a dessert. As we left, my mother-in-law gave it her ultimate accolade, I am sure they used garlic but I never knew it.So I took a second trip, this time with my colleagues. We chose Sev Batatapuri, Chutney Cheese Grill sandwich, Vegetable Cheese Mix Roll and Mushroom Tava Pulao. The sev was fresh and crunchy and the potato mash tangy. The roll was neatly cut into manageable bite-sized pieces, which made it easier to share. Served with a sprinkling of grated cheese, both the roll and the sandwich were very tasty. The pulao, however, was a bit of a let down. Though hot, it didn't have any discernible flavour but was redeemed by the raita. Thick fresh curd, lightly seasoned and filled with chunks of cucumber and tomato, we requested for a second bowl to help us finish the rice.The highlight of this trip was the fruit with fresh cream. We ordered anjeer, mango and mixed fruit. The first two had the fruit pured along with the cream and topped with chopped bits, while the last had apple, banana, grape, kiwi, strawberry mixed with cream and served with a dash of cashew and raisins. As desserts go, all three were excellent. The sweetness came from the fruit and the cream was indeed fresh. There was no extra sugar to make the teeth tingle. Again the service was quick and efficient. We left barely 40 minutes after we entered.Food for thought Where: Haji Ali Fresh Fruit Juices, Uday Enclave, Venktachalam Street, off TV Samy Road West, RS PuramHits: Carronge, Cheese Pav Bhaji, Vegetable Cheese Sandwich, Mixed Fruit CreamMisses: Mushroom Tava PulaoCost for 2: Between 500 and 800 depending on your choicesContact: 0422-4371437A third visit was just for the the rose falooda was mildly sweet, fresh milk, vermicelli with rose syrup sticking to it... perfect for a hot summer evening.The Haji Ali special falooda: a meal in itselfSo if youre looking for a quick bite, tasty and filling but easy on the pocket, head to Haji Ali."
2019-04-19,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/such-a-simple-recipe-such-a-magical-result-kunal-vijayakar-on-mayonnaise/story-H99cePZ1DQ63s1kEaQudTN.html,Such a simple recipe; such a magical result: Kunal Vijayakar on mayonnaise,"Ive often extolled the virtues of eggs and the many-sidedness of this smooth and oval object. Talked about how the modest white and yolk, when artistically negotiated, can burgeon into a variety of dramatic forms, textures and tastes. One such gastronomic opera is performed when two seemingly straightforward and unassuming ingredients  vegetable oil and vinegar  have a bit of a skirmish with eggs in a bowl, to result in the most wondrous consequence: a luscious, bright, tangy and sweet emulsion called mayonnaise.Mayonnaise in a jar, off a shelf, was difficult to procure in the 70s, unless you had an uncle smuggling in foodstuff from abroad. So it was no big deal that my grandmother made mayo at home. It was just done. She would separate the yolks from the whites and drop them into a large Tupperware bowl. To that shed add a bit of vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard. Even mustard, in those days, was sold in powder form. The most popular being Colmans Dry Mustard Powder, and a local variant being Atlas Brand. Mustard powder is usually made of finely ground yellow, brown and black mustard seeds and needs to be mixed with cold water and set aside for the mustard to catalyse and erupt with that unmistakable kick. Of course that was then; today you can just inflict a few helpings of mustard straight out of a tube or a bottle.So with three or four egg yolks, vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar and mustard in a bowl, my grandmother would instruct me to hold the basin at an angle while she simultaneously did two things. With a hand mixer in her right hand, shed start blending the yolks and condiments, while with her left hand shed start dripping measured vegetable oil from a large cup slowly into the swirling recipe. Lo and behold, as she got to the end of the oil, the vigorous liquid ingredients would start getting stable as if by magic and turn into a calm creamy emulsion of golden yellow.The mayonnaise my grandmum made, and my mum after her, was unlike the white mildly sour mayo that you can buy ready-made in a jar or a bottle. This mayonnaise was bright yellow, translucent, sticky, gooey, and sweet, with a sharp slam of mustard. And with this sauce we made the most memorable chicken mayo sandwiches and rolls. A simple soft bread roll stuffed with boiled or roasted chicken, a crisp cold frond of lettuce tucked in sideways and dressed with this homemade mayonnaise that oozed out from the side of the bread and your mouth when you took a bite.Paradise Restaurant in Colaba used to make these chicken rolls best, but now that Paradise is lamentably lost, the iconic J Hearsch and Co at Hill Road, Bandra, makes unarguably the finest chicken rolls on both sides of the sea link. Theres no lettuce in their chicken rolls, but they are stunning. Soft bread generously filled with both chicken and mayo, moist and fresh. Fresh is important, because unlike the mayo you buy in a bottle, this mayo needs to be made fresh and consumed fresh. If you ask Melvin DSa, who runs the bakery, anything about his mayonnaise, he suddenly goes coy and silent. Then, with a sly smile, he admits that the recipe is a huge secret and their mayo is clandestinely prepared in his kitchen at home and then brought to the bakery, so that not even the staff know how it is made.Well, I dont really want to know how he makes the mayo, as long as he keeps making it the way they do. Just across from Hearsch is a 60-year-old hole in the wall. Its called A-1 Bakery. They too make chicken rolls and their mayo too is from a similar recipe. After youve stood in a sweaty queue, the man behind the counter freshly fills warm bread with chicken and mayo and serves it wrapped in butter paper, on order. A-1 Bakerys mayo packs a substantial punch. It has a sharp mustard taste that cuts the sweetness of the sauce and is a joy to bite into.But if you cant be bothered to make the mayo yourself, and getting Hearsch to divulge the recipe proves hopeless, Ratan Tata Institute (RTI, as it is popularly known) often sell a tub-full. You can make your own sandwiches or dress old-fashioned salads, like a Summer Salad (lettuce, cress, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, radishes, cucumber and mayo) or an old club-style Potato Salad (boiled potato, dill, celery, onion, mustard, pepper and mayonnaise) or a Russian Salad, also known as an Oliver Salad, originally invented by Lucien Olivier in Moscow in the 1860s (potato, carrot, boiled egg, French beans and peas in a mayonnaise dressing). Or just simply boil some eggs and smear them with mayonnaise! By the way, do you know what my favourite law is? Its Cole Slaw!First Published: Apr 19, 2019 16:22 IST"
2019-04-19,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/the-story-that-repeats-itself-every-year/article26883496.ece,The story that repeats itself every year,"Walk into the Model Rythu Bazaar at Erragadda on any given day in summer, and the prices of vegetables never fail to surprise you. For, they have been changing since the past few weeks. A case in point: one kg of tomato which used to cost Rs. 12 in the third week of March has shot up to Rs. 35-40 a kg since April 15.Not just tomatoes, the prices of green or red chillies, cauliflower, capsicum and other vegetables have gone up too. And the prices are likely to increase further. Of all the vegetables sold at Rythu Bazaar, the highest price is of French beans, which is Rs. 85 per kg.When asked when were the prices low, a vendor waiting for customers scoffed, Prices were low in winter, the season when we faced losses and even threw away some vegetables as no one bought them,. She pointed at a farmer, Malugari Narasimha Reddy, who doubles up as a vendor at the Rythu Bazaar, suggesting that he has a fair idea on the reasons that lead to price rise. This is the trend every summer. Owing to water scarcity, our crop yield falls and thus the price rise. When we cultivate a crop in winters, lets say green chilli, the yield is only 70% and the remaining 30% goes waste. And in summers, the yield is 30% and the rest 70% goes waste, said Mr. Narasimha Reddy, who was selling chillies grown at his farm in Nawabpet mandal in Vikarabad. The chillies that used to cost around Rs. 16 per kg in winters, costs Rs. 50-65 per kg in April.Mr. Narasimha Reddy, a seasoned farmer who has been selling his produce at the Rythu Bazaar since the past 19 years, and others said they get low price for their produce for eight months in a year, which increases only for three months in summers. While attending to one of his regular customers, another farmer-cum-vendor Kamalakar Reddy said one kg of tomato costs Rs. 40 per kg. But he sells it at Rs. 35, Rs. 5 less than the price listed on Rythu Bazaar charts.Transport costThe prices got so low in the last winter that we sold tomato at Rs. 5 per kg, said Mr. Kamalakar, who sells vegetables grown at Chancharpet in Vikarabad district.He said besides paying Rs. 30 per crate to transport it from his village to the Rythu Bazaar, he has to pay Rs. 300 per worker if the load is more.Estate officer at Model Rythu Bazaar at Erragadda, P. Ramesh, said going by past experiences where farmers incurred losses by growing some vegetables as many farmers cultivated the same crop, they have avoided repeating the mistake this time.This year, a few have cultivated onion. But we get it from other places too and therefore, their price has not increased, said Mr. Ramesh said."

I did not go for paddy this year as two of my bore-wells went dry. Now, even my vegetables are dry, and I have not had the chance to sell some of it, he said. As farmers faced water scarcity, they decided to grow vegetables that can be grown with comparatively less water. On an average, each farmer has invested between Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 20,000 per acre. Bore-wells are so dry that they are not even able to supply water through drip pipes. Many farmers have already lost their money. As of now, there is no farm activities in the villages, said Mothe Rajeswar Reddy, another farmer. The farmers here feel the pinch much more as the prices of vegetables in the market have gone up. There is a huge gap between demand and supply, but the farmers here are rendered helpless."

Traders procure the produce farm from the farmers and sell it at markets in Erode, Mettupalayam, Coimbatore and in Kerala.Poor monsoon, prevailing intense heat and shortage of water led to drop in the cultivation areas, said S. Manickam, president of theTalavadi Farmers Association. He said that traders purchase vegetables from farmers at cabbage (Rs. 12 to Rs. 14 a kg), tomato (Rs. 28 to Rs. 30 a kg) and beans (Rs. 50 to Rs. 55 a kg). Crops are cultivated in less than 500 acre now, he added.Cabbage is usually purchased for Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 a kg from the farmers. Later, they started cultivating alternative vegetables leading to drop in cabbage cultivation.Gurusamy of Gumatapuram, who owns two acre, said that currently 25,000 cabbage plants were cultivated in his field and there is a good demand for the produce. It is a 90-day crop and the climate is not conducive now.After harvesting the crop now, we will start cultivating cabbage only during rainy season that begins from August, he added.Another farmer said that in the absence of check dams, rain water from the hills enter Chikkahole Dam in Chamrajnagar district of Karnataka.Five to seven small check dams were constructed without storage facilities and water from Neithalapuram easily enters the dam, said V. Ramadurai of Susaipuram. He said that if rain water is stored, farming activities could be done throughout the year which will ensure the livelihood of farmers.The hill has been receiving good rainfall in the past three days and farmers expressed hope for a good harvest season."

With the exit of the Vasundhra Raje government, the absence of Gujjar leader Sachin Pilot in Chief Ministers seat, and the Ashok Gehlot government failing to deliver on the promised farm loan waiver, voters may be moving away from the Congress. Above all is the looming image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with the many stories swirling around him taking the proportion of an urban legend.Ajmer and Alwar constituencies are nearly 270 km apart from each other, yet the narrative in the both of them is similar. In January 2018, the Congress had won the Ajmer constituency by a margin of over 84,000 votes, and Alwar by a gap of 1.97 lakh votes, but the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is picking up pace in both these seats.The January 2018 by-polls, necessitated by the deaths of the respective Lok Sabha MPs, were the first expression of anger against the Vasundhra Raje government by the Rajasthan electorate.Feat like no otherShankar Das of the Badgaon village in Ajmer says that Mr. Modis photographs have been put up in the United States White House, a feat no other Prime Minister of India could achieve. Narendra Chhaudhary, who is sitting beside him, piped in, Pehle bachhe tyre chalate the, ab internet chalate hai. Paanch saal main Modi ne tehelka macha diya (Earlier, kids used to play with old tyres and now they are hooked to the Internet. In five years, Modi has made a splash.).In Madhogarh, about 25 km from Alwar, Sukhram Poswal has a long list of what Narendra Modi has done. He claims India is now ranked sixth, without explaining on which list or what terms. Modi-ji has stopped milk and tomato exports to Pakistan. Milk sells at 200 per kg and they have no tomatoes. He has also shut down water supply to Pakistan under the Indus water treaty and that water will be supplied to Rajasthan, Mr. Poswal said confidently.Among the BJPs supporters, discussions around elections ultimately distil down to the Balakot attack and the return of Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan.Unlike the BJP voter, the average Congress supporter is less articulate and doesnt wave a long list of reasons to support the party. I dont apply my mind so much. Traditionally, we have been voting for the Congress since the time of our great-grandparents, so I will just continue with it, said Gopal Bhati, a member of the Mali (Schedule Caste-SC) community in Baansali village near Pushkar.Modi supportersThey are often outnumbered by the more vocal BJP-backers. In Tilora near Pushkar, Gopi Singh finds himself alone in a crowd of over a dozen BJP supporters. His nephew, Gopal Singh holds forth on virtues of the Modi government. India has never seen a PM like Modi, the nephew claimed.In a quick repartee, his uncle Gopi Singh said, Yes, no other PM since independence has lied so much.But Gopi Singhs arguments are drowned in spontaneous chants of Modi, Modi....In the January 2018 by-polls and the Assembly polls in December of the same year, the Modi factor was not present, which many claim was the reason for the Congress victory.In Ajmer, instead of Raghu Sharma, who won in the by-polls, the Congress has fielded newcomer Riju Jhunjhunwala. He comes from the neighbouring town of Bhilwara and is considered an outsider. A wealthy industrialist and the son-in-law of former Rajasthan Minister Bina Kak, Mr. Jhunjhunwala is a largely unknown figure in the constituency. He is banking on Sachin Pilots popularity to see him through, while his opponent Bhagirath Chaudhary is a local businessman and the sitting legislator from the Kisangarh Assembly that falls under the Ajmer seat.Religious polarisationIn Alwar, the Congress position is complicated by the BJPs efforts at religious polarisation. Here Mahant Balak Nath is making his debut, taking on the scion of erstwhile rulers of Alwar, Jitendra Singh. Balak Naths prime qualification is that he is disciple of Mahant Chand Nath, who won in 2014.Congress is only for the Meos [Meo Muslims]. Whenever they come to power, they promote Meos, who once again start their spree of vehicle thefts, said Jagdish Gujjar, a local, at Natni ka Bara near Alwar said.The Bahujan Samaj Partys (BSP) Imran Khan, owner of a construction company, is also in the fray. On the ground, however, he is drawing little traction. Imran Khan is only standing to ensure that the Congress loses by chipping away at the Muslim and Scheduled Caste votes. But he wont be successful because everyone can see through his game, Mamrez Khan in Akbarpur, Alwar said.Anti-incumbencyWith a jehla jhoomar in gold weighing down his ears, Madan Lal Chaudhary, a Jat from Baandar Sandri, who voted for Congress in the 2018 by-poll says, Raghu Sharma [in Ajmer] won only because we wanted to teach Vasundhra Raje a lesson and we did.In Alwar, too, a similar sentiment echoes. We voted for Congress because that election was not about choosing the Prime Minister and we wanted to send out a message against Vasundhra Raje, says Jitender Chaudhary, Dharampura village in Alwar.The Gujjar community to which Mr. Sachin Pilot belongs to is vocal against the Congress for not anointing their leader as the CM of Rajasthan. I had wholeheartedly campaigned and voted for the Congress during the Assembly polls with the hope to see our leader as Chief Minister. But now, it seems pointless, says Soji Ram, a Gujjar from the Nauhriya village in Ajmer.This is a common refrain in the Gujjar community in Alwar, too. The government changed in Rajasthan only because of Sachin Pilot, and yet the Congress did not give him his due, said Mr. Jagdish at Natni ka Bara.Delayed loan waiverThe promise of a farm loan waiver may have brought the Congress votes in the Assembly polls but equally, not being able to implement it with alacrity, has left a bitter taste. Only small loans up to  50,000, largely of those who have not paid up a single instalment, have been waived off.Rahul Gandhi said that if the loan is not waived off in ten days, on the 11th day, he would change the Chief Minister. Neither has he changed the Chief Minister nor has the loan been repaid, said Budha Ram Jat, a farmer in Alwar."

With Jyotiraditya busy supervising election in Uttar Pradesh as general secretary incharge of UP west, Priyadarshini is holding Scindias forte in Guna.Priyadarshini, who figured in the Verve's Best dressed - 2008 hall of fame list as also in Feminas India's 50 most beautiful women"" list in 2012, Priyadarshini can be seen mingling with villagers in the dusty countryside of Shivpuri, Guna and Ashoknagar. Often driving with her chauffer sitting next to her, she is surrounded by the village women whenever she visits small hamlets. Priyadarshini often sits on the ground along with the women to discuss issues related to their area.She urges voters to vote again for Maharaj, as he is hardworking and easily accessible. Moving on from one village to another, she sips water from tubewells in the fields besides tasting freshly plucked green mangoes and tomatoes. Driving down on her SUV, she can be seen caressing a cow by the roadside.Though she seems to have mastered the tricks of the trade to woo voters, she is not keen on joining politics. She said, There is a wrong notion that I am not comfortable with the searing heat in the area. After all, I have to live here and I am used to it.But the BJP candidate KP Singh, who was earlier close to Scindia, is not impressed with Priyadarshinis claim. He said that people want to know why she comes out only during elections. My wife also campaigns for me, but she works throughout the year, he said.Priyadarshini hits back, I am neither a celebrity nor a politician like BJP leaders who call people first and then meet them. It seems BJP leaders have too much time to observe my movement. It would be better if they do their work and let me do mine."
2019-04-28,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/bitter-harvest-of-achchhe-din-in-maharashtra-s-food-bowl/cid/1689543,Bitter harvest of achchhe din in Maharashtra's food bowl,"Khand Jopale, 45, sold 28 quintals of onion he had brought to the vegetable mandi in Pimpalgaon, about 30km north of Nashik city.The farmer from Singde village under Dindori taluka of Nashik district got Rs 821 per quintal. Jopale had grown onion on one acre land of his own; he has another 100 quintals of onion at home. He is sure to get Rs 1.05 lakh this season from onion and make an earning of Rs 40,000 for the four-month crop.Jopale is happy that the price of onion for the April crop is way better than the price of Rs 300 per quintal his fellow onion growers got in December. Jopale did not grow onion in December, he had instead opted for tomato. The farmer sold 27 quintals of tomato at Re 1 per kg. He dumped about 30 quintals of tomato as transporting the produce 15km to the mandi would have cost him more.This year the onion gave a little bit of profit. But I lost Rs 20,000 on the tomato crop four months ago, he said.Dutta Bairagi, 50, from Dangsoundane village, also in Nashik, sold 60 quintals of onion at Rs 926 per quintal. His onion was of better quality than Jopales. Bairagi earned about Rs 50,000. But in December, he had dumped 15 quintals of onion because transporting and quality checking the produce would have cost him around the same money he stood to get from its sale.The quality of this (April) crop was good. The price is also okay. But if I count the loss of December, I made no profit from onion in the last two crop seasons, Bairagi said.Volatility in production and sale price, lack of minimum support price (MSP) for vegetable crops, absence of a mechanism to procure farm produce, poor sensitisation on cropping pattern and use of technology, import from other countries, and meagre institutional financial support have contributed to the ongoing agrarian distress in Maharashtra.Nearly 50,000 farmers marched from Dindori in Nashik to Mumbai  a distance of around 200km  last year to demand respectable MSP for all crops, waiver of farm loans and conservation and use of rainwater to address the water crisis.Opposition parties have made agrarian distress a major election issue across the country.There must be fair MSP for all the vegetable crops. It must be implemented. There has to be assurance of procurement and institutional support for funding and insurance. The BJP government did nothing, Jopale said.Bairagi agreed with his fellow farmer, but said he would still vote for Modi. Why? Modi is a strong leader. He did surgical strike on Pakistan. I will vote for him for national security, Bairagi said.Bairagi has not heard about subsidy on onion export that aims at helping farmers. The directorate general of foreign trade runs the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS). The Union cabinet doubled the export incentive from 5 per cent  started in July 2018  to 10 per cent so that the domestic price of the commodity rises.An exporter told The Telegraph that the market is overcrowded currently due to export subsidy. Indian exporters are buying from Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Satara onion mandis and transporting to destinations such as Dubai, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.A lot of people have become exporters after the government gave export subsidy. They are sending to Dubai because of availability of high number of vessels to Dubai compared to other destinations. But unregulated export may lead to over export followed by import at higher cost, said the exporter, who did not wish to be identified.Northern Maharashtra grows vegetables, and fruits such as grape and pomegranate. Sachin Sukadeo Gadekar, who grew grapes, said farmers are selling the fruit at around Rs 30 per kg. Grape is a risky crop as its production dwindles in case of heavy rain and hailstorms. Gadekar said farmers are often unaware of the market potential and cropping pattern. Most of the time, they do not diversify and grow one particular crop on huge land anticipating good price. It leads to over-production and low price.There is no agro-processing industry to further process and make durable products, he said. Besides, Gadekar said, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research should set up centres in Nashik district to popularise farming technology.Sunil Malusare, a leader of the farmers agitation, said farmers have no say in the price of their produce. The businessmen, exporters and other buyers have formed a cartel. They decide the sale price. The farmers have to sell at that price. In most developed nations, the government provides the market support apart from technology and finance.The Centre decides MSP for certain cereals, pulses and sugarcane. The formula they use to decide the MSP does not include family labour and rent on land. There is no MSP for vegetables and fruits. Farmers are left at the mercy of businessmen and exporters, Malusare said.Even if sugarcane is covered under MSP, that does not solve the farmers distress entirely.Suresh Shinde from Kurla village under Beed district has grown sugarcane over 26 acres of his own land. He has requested a sugar factory in his area to cut the crop and take it. The factory last month sent people who have cut the crop from 13 acres of land. The crop is still standing on another 13 acres of land.The sugarcane plants have now grown flowers. Once the plant flowers, its weight gets reduced by 30 to 40 per cent. Every day I am suffering loss. Who will compensate me? Shinde asked.While the MSP for sugarcane is Rs 2,750 per tonne, the factory gives Rs 2,000, he said. The crop maturing in 12 months has to be cut in time before it grows flowers. Sugarcane grown on an acre of land gives yield of 40 tonnes if cut at the right time.A farmer can earn Rs 50,000 per acre if the yield is good and cut in time, Shinde said. This year, he may not make any profit. If the plants are not cut in one week, he will have to burn them because they will be of no use for sugar production.Shinde said farmers are the worst sufferers in the Narendra Modi regime. Achchhe din (good days) never came for the farmers, he said.Almost like clockwork every year, drought hits the Marathwada region, comprising districts such as Nanded, Latur, Jalna, Beed, Parbhani and Osmanabad, and Vidharva region covering districts such as Chandrapur, Wardha, Yavatmal and Amaravati. Farmers in Nashik are opposing a central government project of diverting rainwater from Surgana and Peth area in Maharashtra to Ahmedabad.He said Maharashtra has nearly 1.1 crore farmers families. The banks have extended Rs 18,000 crore of crop loan to the farmers in the state. The entire money should be waived because of distress sale and lack of MSP of most crops, the farmers say.The ongoing agitation on these issues of water crisis and farmers distress  led by the All India Kishan Sabha, the farmers wing of the CPM  would continue after the elections, Malusare said.Professor S.S. Mantha, former chairman of All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), said over use of groundwater was the main reason for drought in Vidharva and Marathwada. The state government needs to create ponds and water bodies to save water and charge the groundwater. Besides, the top layer of the soil of farmland needs to be replaced with fertile soil to increase production.Drought is a regular phenomenon because within three to four months after rain, the water is finished. The groundwater level has gone own. The groundwater has to be replenished, he said.In some areas people are into jatropha cultivation which affects the top layer of the soil, he said.Nashik votes on April 29"

Once children start growing a plant, it is like owning a pet. They become responsible and care for it. It piques their curiosity. The activity improves their hand-eye coordination too.Faiz has already despatched over 300 such kits across India and also to schools in Dubai. Schools buy the kit as a summer camp activity for the kids. It helps cut down on the TV time of children. Its an activity-oriented kit. It comes with a sheet that has images of the seeds in various stages of germination. Children can colour the images. The herbarium sheet encourages them to press the leaves and note down its botanical name. There is another activity sheet to name the parts of a plant, he explains.In the pipeline Corporate farming kits that support greening and farming activities in offices. The activity encourages team building, improves communication, and fosters healthy competition.A programme called Eco-systems at Schools for students in Std VII, VIII and IX. In the activity called Little Farmer = DFT 2, the students set up a 200-300 sqft blue room at the school campus where they grow 25-30 different types of vegetables ranging from tomato and onions to bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumber and green chillies. All these can be harvested in 20-30 days. The students learn data collection and farming as well as technology where they measure moisture content and temperature. They get a lesson in trading too, as they can auction the produce at the school canteen or to their parents.They have to spend 20 minutes every day on the farm and record the growth of what they have planted. This entire activity is incorporated into the syllabus. These eco-systems are already functioning in Tiruchengode and ChennaiYousuff is awaiting patent for the Little Farmer activity kit, which is designed in-houseFor details, connect@littlefarmer.in or call: 96263-77677. You can also visit www.littlefarmer.inHe says children are curious about farming. Recently, at the Young Learners Fest in Chennai, while there were workshops on aeromodelling, art and craft, robotics, so many children in the age group between 14 and 16 attended our workshop on farming, which is a good sign.Faiz Yousuff of Little Farmer | Photo Credit: M. PeriasamyFaiz, who comes from an event management background, has conducted employment remuneration programmes for corporate companies. When he networked with people in the education field, it struck me that my father A Yousuf is fond of plants. My house is full of greenery. Why not teach farming to kids? Thats how the idea was born.He sourced the coir pith base from Pollachi, and pre-mixed the coco peat with nutrients to make it healthy for plants. It is sufficient for three yields of greens. Once the base was ready, we focussed on designing activities to get the child engrossed. Then came the recipe card on how to make a salad with the greens they grow. We also added a cover where the child can stick a selfie clicked with the plant, says Yousuff.All the child has to do is spend 15 to 20 minutes every day with the plant to make the connect with farming. Says Faiz, They just have to record the observations in an activity chart. When they see the seed sprouting, they know that their plant is healthy. At the end of the activity, they can proudly call themselves a young farmer. Other perks are that their reasoning skills improve greatly. They learn about healthy eating. It motivates them to set up a kitchen garden.Faiz says this may lead to the child thinking of an option in farming too. If one out of every 100 students turns into an organic farmer, its a big success for us. I wonder, as I watch my daughter making plans to grow carrots..."

And what better place than the Burma Burma chain of restaurants and their ongoing Thingyan Festival to relish this concept?I cant get over the Village Set they first place in before me. Its an assortment of traditional Burmese dishes arranged beautifully on a cane flat basket. The colours, the aroma, the delicacies and ornamentation of the whole platter...so much like the Indian thali.Start by peeling and munching the sunflower seeds, says Ankit Gupta, Founder of the vegetarian Burmese cuisine chain. He explains how guests in Burma are first served sunflower seeds till the main course arrives. Gupta, as a host, is gentle and warm, makes sure I savour my food like the Burmese do. As the cuisine is based on a specific country, it is impertinent on our part to celebrate its customs, traditions and the grand festival of Burma. The Thingyan Festival is a big festival in Burma as it welcomes the New Year. We travelled back to our roots, to explore and bring back new, authentic dishes and flavours to India.By now, Im tasting the Yangon tea shop favourite Quack Quack Palata  square pockets filled with a special mix of tangy and sour spices. Next, I dig into the traditional 999 noodles, flavourful, without any sauces. My companion choose the black sticky rice with eyed pea and pickled vegetables, its robust nutty flavour was a welcome change. It went well the sweet, tangy and thick eggplant-long bean-and-potato curry. Shan Khow Suey is my favourite  rice noodles in tomato relish, garnished with tofu, pickled mustard leaves, carrot and radish. Another favourite was the Tofu Steamed Buns with fried tofu, a soft-and-crispy combo with lettuce, onion, tomato and mayonnaise stuffing. But the star of my meal was the Lotus Stem Fritters  lotus stems sliced, fried and dusted with roasted paprika, rightly flavoured with curry leaves.Our village sets will serve two and four (people), and for the first time Burma Burma will also serve a small plate menu inspired by West Burma, informs Gupta. This includes an authentic Burmese dishes with names Kyan Tribe Rainbow Soup; Spicy Sour Tea Leaf and Avocado Salad, and Rangoon Ruby.Burma BurmaTill: May 5Timings: Lunch (12-4pm) and Dinner (6.30pm-11.30pm)Outlets at Select City Walk, Cyber Hub & DLF Mall of India, Noida"

It provides forecast on rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed and its direction three days in advance.Data was collected from 1,350 farmers across nine districts of high (over 1,200 mm), moderate (600 to 1,200 mm) and low rainfall (less than 600 mm) regions covering eight agro-climatic zones during 2016-17 in the State. It revealed that accuracy in weather forecast enabled reduction in cost of cultivation and post-harvest loss, improvements in crop yield, and net incomes.Accurate predictionThe study Economic impact evaluation of Varuna Mitra on agriculture conducted by A.V. Manjunatha, assistant professor, Centre for Ecological Economics and Natural Resources, ISEC, Bengaluru, said 63% of farmers had received accurate prediction of weather.Decrease in cost of cultivation was reported by 49% of farmers, 50% said they increased yield, 53% increased the net income, and 40% recorded post-harvest losses Yield improvements were highest in jowar (16%) followed by ragi (9%) and coffee (8%).Arecanut growers used most of the facility since incidence of rain during the harvest period could increase the moisture content in arecanut, thereby lowering quality and price, said the study.Weather information helped coffee growers to reduce the cost by Rs. 6,273 per acre followed by arecanut farmers (Rs. 2,571), tomato growers (Rs. 2,218) and mango growers ( Rs. 1,268). The decrease was mainly because farmers took up spraying of chemicals to control diseases based on the rainfall forecast. With a forecast, farmers could cancel irrigating the crop, thereby saving cost, Prof. Manjunatha said.The highest incremental net gain per acre was realised by arecanut growers (Rs. 12,727) and coffee growers (Rs. 11,118). Highest incremental yield was observed in tomato (1.59 quintal), jowar (1.28 quintal), and mango (1.2 quintal).At the State level, forecast information has led to an annual incremental gain of Rs. 495.3 crore for all area covered under Varuna Mitra.Owing to erratic monsoons, 84% of farmers from high rainfall districts, 50% from moderate rainfall districts and 39% from low rainfall districts indicated accuracy in information received from the agency on rainfall.During 2016-17, a total of 1.76 lakh people made 10.42 lakh calls. A majority of farmers sought information on agriculture (90%), followed by horticulture (9%), animal husbandry (0.4%), and sericulture (0.6%), the study said.In figuresRain forecast reduced cultivation cost by 49%Increased yield by 50%Yield improvement: Jowar ( 16% ), ragi ( 9% ) and coffee ( 8% )"

Buyers thronged different daily markets in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to stock up on vegetables, dry food and fruits. Though grocery items remained unchanged, price of potato, onion and other vegetables has been almost doubled. According to market sources, potato, which was being sold at Rs 12-a-kg few days back, is now charged Rs 22 to Rs 30 per kg while onion vanished from the retail shops in the periphery areas of the Capital.While tomato, brinjal and ladyfinger are priced at Rs 40 to 50 a kilo each, bitter gourd, pointed gourd and coriander leaves are sold at Rs 60, Rs 100 and Rs 200 a kg respectively. Retail vegetable markets and shopping malls like Big Bazaar and Reliance Fresh witnessed huge rush on Wednesday and Thursday as people made a beeline to buy commodities. Not only shops, long queues were also witnessed before the fuel stations. If the prediction of Met office is to be believed, Bhubaneswar will experience heavy rainfall. Thats why I have purchased essential commodities and dry food for at least a week. The traders have already hiked the price, which may increase further, said Indumati Sahani, a resident of Unit-IX. Traders attributed it to the rise in demand from the consumers, who procured commodities two to three times of their usual requirement in anticipation of the stocks vanishing.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said there is no reason to panic as required quantity of essential commodities has been stocked and green vegetables will arrive as usual if there is no damage to roads. There was scarcity of some commodities on Wednesday as labourers did not load and unload as it was Labour Day. Though we have been advising people to buy only the quantity required, they are in no mood to pay any heed. Markets witnessed heavy rush and people went for more tuber and dry foods besides vegetables, Panda said. Panda informed that potato and onion is priced at Rs 1,350 a quintal in the wholesale market.It is the retailers who are taking advantage of the situation to make some easy bucks, he added and demanded the administration to step in immediately. Meanwhile, the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department has directed district collectors to keep a close watch on price and availability of essential commodities in the market and ensure that food items are available at reasonable prices to the consumers. Since disruption of supply of different commodities like pulses, edible oil, sugar, potato, onion, flattened rice and jaggery is apprehended, an official communication warned that unscrupulous traders may resort to unfair practices like hoarding and profiteering leading to public discontentment. The market intelligence wing has been asked to keep close watch on hoarding by unscrupulous traders. Collectors have been instructed to deploy civil supply and market intelligence field staff for surprise checks and take action under provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1995 against illegal hoarders if warranted."

Sanitation is a major issue in this constituency. The condition in the unauthorised colonies is the worst. The improvement of drains and streets had started but is yet to be completed, he claimed.Neha Bisht, a resident of Subhash Park in Rohtash Nagar, said her neighbourhood was experiencing muddle-headedness. She added that she has made up her mind.There are many shopkeepers and traders in the area who have a very negative image of Mr. Modi because of GST and demonetisation. Because of Ms. Dikshits candidature, whom they have seen do a lot of work, they are supporting her, the young coaching institute professional said.But, the younger lot have praised the Prime Minister. I am one of them  but not because of issues like national security and Balakot but because he has one a lot of work especially in terms of road and highway, she added. Sachin Kumar, a resident of Sonia Vihar, said, Our roads are filled with garbage. Mr. Tiwari has not been here or done anything for the area in the last five years. But, the work Mr. Modi has done is enough for us to make a choice.Rina Kumari (name changed), a resident of the Timarpur village, pointed towards trash floating on an open, overflowing drain. Look at the conditions that we live in. It is worse than the animals cages. We know that the BJP is responsible for sanitation in our area. We will vote for AAP, she said. The main Karawal Nagar road is not motorable. Mounds of trash are lying on the side along with construction and sludge from the drainage. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said work is in process.The wind here is supposedly in the favour of the BJP and that is precisely why I will vote for Ms. Dikshit. We have had enough of the apathy that Mr. Tiwari treats us with. Only Sheilaji can do something for us, said Rahul Singh, a resident of the Karawal Village near Mustafabad.At the Mishra pan stall near Mukundpur village, Mr. Manoj Mishra (name changed) declares there is a one-sided vote for Modi in his area despite the fact that no one has seen Mr. Tiwari here in the last five years.If it comes to public connect, not many people know Dilip Pandey. Because Mr. Modi is right as far as decisions on a national scale are concerned, things are in his favour; even if you, an outsider, stand for the election on a BJP ticket, you will win from here. There is, simply, no other option, Mr. Mishra said."

The improvement of drains and streets had started but is yet to be completed, he claimed.Neha Bisht, a resident of Subhash Park in Rohtash Nagar, said her neighbourhood was experiencing muddle-headedness. She added that she has made up her mind.There are many shopkeepers and traders in the area who have a very negative image of Mr. Modi because of GST and demonetisation. Because of Ms. Dikshits candidature, whom they have seen do a lot of work, they are supporting her, the young coaching institute professional said.But, the younger lot have praised the Prime Minister. I am one of them  but not because of issues like national security and Balakot but because he has one a lot of work especially in terms of road and highway, she added. Sachin Kumar, a resident of Sonia Vihar, said, Our roads are filled with garbage. Mr. Tiwari has not been here or done anything for the area in the last five years. But, the work Mr. Modi has done is enough for us to make a choice.Rina Kumari (name changed), a resident of the Timarpur village, pointed towards trash floating on an open, overflowing drain. Look at the conditions that we live in. It is worse than the animals cages. We know that the BJP is responsible for sanitation in our area. We will vote for AAP, she said. The main Karawal Nagar road is not motorable. Mounds of trash are lying on the side along with construction and sludge from the drainage. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said work is in process.The wind here is supposedly in the favour of the BJP and that is precisely why I will vote for Ms. Dikshit. We have had enough of the apathy that Mr. Tiwari treats us with. Only Sheila ji can do something for us, said Rahul Singh, a resident of the Karawal Village near Mustafabad.At the Mishra pan stall near Mukundpur village, Mr. Manoj Mishra (name changed) declares there is a one-sided vote for Modi in his area despite the fact that no one has seen Mr. Tiwari here in the last five years.If it comes to public connect, not many people know Dilip Pandey. Because Mr. Modi is right as far as decisions on a national scale are concerned, things are in his favour; even if you, an outsider, stand for the election on a BJP ticket, you will win from here. There is, simply, no other option, Mr. Mishra said."

For Chef Monu Kumar, his judgement day has arrived. His culinary fate now lies in the hands of people who will sample his signatures  all 30 of them  as part of The Imperial Spices new menu, to testify his prudence. Never put all your eggs in the same basket, his mother used to tell him repeatedly in his growing years. With his new offering, he has done just the opposite. Ive entirely put myself out there.Everything there is to know about me has been displayed through the arrangement of ingredients in these preparations. Yes, putting all my assets (read cooking dexterity) in the same basket has made me vulnerable. What if people dont like it? By showing my best to them, I have honoured my position, says Kumar.One example is his proud display of vegetarian food in the special menu, otherwise known for its meat marvels. Theres Ghewar Chat, a new preparation inspired by this Rajasthani sweet, served as a chaat with tamarind and mint sauce, sweet curd, chhena bhala (another dessert), and garnished with homemade spices and pomegranate seeds.The Trio Idli Platter on a black marble slap with plain, kanjivaram, and masala idlis is served with gunpowder, coconut, tomato, and mint chutneys, and clarified butter. Soft and moist, they carry the aroma of the curry leaves scattered about them. Other innovations are the Mezze Platter and Chola Kulcha Tacos. Well-spiced cholas held securely inside taco shells with coriander and melted cheese makes for scrumptious bites.For non-vegetarians, Kumars Barbequed Tandoor Murgh Tikka is one of his best recipes. Hes mastered the marination process, the details of which, he shies away from sharing. A cook never shares his secret. Jatooni Jhinga sizzles out of the kitchen with a light pink coating, and tender and juicy inside. The Chukandari Ghost was a first for us, with its deep red spiced curry generously drowning in the top notes of cinnamon, coriander, and garlic.Unlike many senior chefs who take to managing kitchens instead of cooking, I belong to the school of thought where a chef cooks till his last day. I am hands-on and invested in my kitchen. And thats why I wanted to take it a nautch up with this new menu by showing you everything Ive got up my sleeve, says Kumar, with a slight smile."
2019-05-04,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tomato-price-more-than-doubles-in-a-week/article27031611.ece,Tomato price more than doubles in a week,"The price of tomato, which is used almost in every dish daily, has shot up hitting the common man. Tomatoes which used to cost about Rs. 20 a kg a week ago, are now sold at Rs. 50 a kg in wholesale markets, and at Rs. 36 in the Rythu Bazaars in the city. The local vendors are selling tomatoes at Rs. 60-65 a kg depending on the quality. The sudden surge in price has been attributed to a severe shortage due to meagre production.The local supply has almost dried up and the arrivals have taken a nosedive. The arrivals at the Rythu Bazaars across the State has come down this year compared to the previous year. As much as 63,949 quintals of tomatoes arrived in April 2018. This year, it slipped to 62,246 quintals.In 2017, the tomato arrivals were 67,840 quintals during April.The average price was Rs. 12 a kg at the Rythu Bazaars last year during April. The tomatoes are currently sold at Rs. 50 a kg at the Kaleswara Rao Market, up from Rs. 30 a kg barely two days ago.The Rythu Bazaar officials say that the supply from nearby places has fallen sharply. Now, the city relies on supplies from Mydukur. The tomatoes cost Rs. 42 a kg at the Rythu Bazaars in Guntur. It is a fact to be noted that the prices at Guntur Rythu Bazaars always are high compared to Vijayawada. As both Vijayawada and Guntur procure tomatoes, the price in Guntur should be less if the distance were to be counted. But, surprisingly, the tomatoes at Guntur Rythu Bazaars hover at Rs. 42 a kg, sources say.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else. Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase. What we used to purchase fortnight ago has come down to half. I am forced to purchase little quantities of tomatoes in view of the price, says G. Vani, a homemaker, who was seen arguing with the vendor at a Rythu Bazaar over the sudden rise in price.Rythu Bazaar officials say that the trend is expected to continue for another couple of weeks. If in the coming days, the temperature goes up as predicted, then the price might go up further, they say.Other vegetablesturn dearerIt is not just tomatoes. The prices of other vegetable have also gone northward in the last few days. Beans cost Rs. 116 a kg while ginger costs Rs. 124 a kg. Garlic is sold at Rs. 102 a kg at Rythu Bazaars.Officials say that supply from nearby places has fallen sharply"
2019-05-07,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2019/may/07/vegetable-prices-drop-post-fani-1973739.html,Vegetable prices drop post Fani,"By Express News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: Unusual it may seem. Post cyclone Fani, prices of essential commodities and vegetables are either normal or have been slashed at the main markets of the Capital. Vegetables are now priced half than the usual rates for this time of the year.According to sources in Unit-I market, potato which was priced at `22 to `30 on May 2 due to panic buying, is now being sold `18 to `20 a kilo. Onion is also priced almost the same. While the price of brinjal is `20 to `30 a kg, ladyfinger, tomato, carrot and pointed gourd are priced at `20 a kilo each. Similarly, drumstick is being sold at `30 a kilo and cauliflower `30 per piece.In an usual situation, price of essential commodities and perishable items including vegetables skyrocket after calamities as vehicular movement is disrupted and traders face a daunting task to meet the daily requirement. Fani has been a different experience for traders, who had stocked up on vegetables and essentials going by the forecast about the extremely severe cyclone. They are now forced to clear the stock at cheaper price to avoid huge losses. There is no power and water for the last four days. How can we stock the vegetables without power. We are forced to sell those commodities at half the usual price to clear the stock, said a wholesale vegetable trader Jagabandhu Khuntia.As the forecast was for heavy rain after the cyclone, I had stocked one quintal each of tomato and brinjal besides 50 kg each of pointed gourd and ladies finger. Almost 50 per cent of the stock has perished, said Saroj Samal, a vendor at the Unit-IX market. Meanwhile, as there is no issue of vehicular communication with the neighbouring States, vegetables are arriving regularly and suspecting black-marketing and hoarding, marketing inspectors are conducting surprise raids.The price of fruits is, however, soaring as the demand is more and supply is less. Make-shift shops of many fruit vendors have been damaged in the cyclone. While banana is being sold `80 to `100 a dozen, apple is priced `200 a kilo."
2019-05-07,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/communities-and-the-search-for-an-ideal-society/cid/1690042,Communities and the search for an ideal society,"After Arun Jaitley did not extend his term as governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 2016, Raghuram Rajan went back to his chair in Chicago and resumed teaching. He is a remarkably articulate economist; so it was quite a surprise that he was quiet for three years. And then came the 400-page book, The Third Pillar.In his view, society rests on three pillars: the State, the market and the community. The community is everywhere; presumably it emerged in the first human tribes, and is the oldest institution. The State emerged next: as communities expanded and coalesced, structures evolved to govern them. Markets came last: as people acquired animals, vehicles, boats and so on, they encountered other people who had different goods and began to exchange them for the goods they had. Societies spread and expanded, people came briefly in touch with others who governed or traded, and were no longer so close to them as members of a community used to be. That is how we ended up with loose-knit, populous societies whose people have new worries  for instance, what to do with migrants or refugees whose differing ways and tongues do not fit into their societies. Rajans solution is that they should return to the original structure and divide into small communities in which everyone knows and works with everyone else. He found it in a slum in his native Chicago, which a local idealist had turned into a thriving community.This is precisely the solution that M.K. Gandhi developed and implemented in the communities he founded. For a generation after he was murdered, Gandhi was turned into a saint. Then he was forgotten. Now, Hindutwits are trying to turn him into a villain who loved Muslims and allowed the creation of Pakistan. It is the fate of famous people to be turned into stereotypes once they have left the earth. Gandhi was most unhappy about the creation of Pakistan; it was Patel and Nehru who told him that it was impossible to live in the same country with Jinnah and Suhrawardy who went about inciting communal riots. And Patel did not want Partition; with the forces he had, he just could not cope with the riots, and accepted Partition as a way to end the killings. I met him in Bombay just two months before he died; my memory is of an extremely sad man.But for me, Gandhi is no stereotype. I was twelve when my father last went to see him in Sevagram. I used to play in and around his hut. I used to borrow his magnifying glass and burn holes. We children used to run ahead of him when he went for his walk in the evening. I used to admire Bhansalibhai who slept in the sun for an hour every midday, and wondered how he could be so fair whereas the sun made the rest of us dark. Bapu, as everyone called Gandhi, also slept after lunch, for exactly 20 minutes; I remember him waking up once and saying, Oh! I overslept. He counted every minute, for he had more to do than he had time for. No wonder, for even if I wrote him a letter, he would reply in his own hand  hands, rather, for he wrote with both hands whose handwriting differed.He was not the only one who was busy; it was the ashramite norm to be busy. We children were exempt, but all the work was done by the residents. In the morning, men cleared out the toilets, took the buckets to the fields, emptied them in pits and covered up the contents with earth; after some months, the pits were opened, and the manure was taken out and spread in the fields which grew food for the residents.There was some small crime: I did, once in a while, steal a tomato from the fields to eat. And there was drama. In the hut next to ours was Anand Hingorani, who was depressed because his wife had just died. Every evening after dinner, he used to close his door and commune silently in the dark with his wife. One night, I saw a snake enter his hut. I ran and told my father; we banged on Hingoranis door, shouted to warn him, and asked him to come out. He did not reply, and he did not come out. After an hour, he opened the door; the snake was found sitting peacefully behind him.Gandhi tried out communities that Rajan today idealizes  not once, but four times  in Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and in Sabarmati and Sevagram in India. His followers set up a number of ashrams  for instance, Vinoba Bhave in Paunar and Narayan Desai in Vedchhi. All of them survive to this day; but they are no longer live communities. There are half a million villages in India, but none of them has turned itself into a Gandhian community  at least, none has made a name as one, let alone won followers across the world.Why is this so? An economists answer would be that people prefer a market economy in which they can move around, take jobs that pay them most, buy goods at the lowest price and maximize their utility while producers maximize their profits. Rajans response might be that the market economy leaves a great many people in dire straits  earning too little or lacking jobs, being mistreated by employers, consuming too little or too much of wrong things, and so on. That was what Karl Marx also thought; his solution was to nationalize the producers and make everyone an employee of the State.Gandhis solution was to ration productivity-increasing technology so that there was enough work for everyone. He was not against all modern technology. He approved of railways, and used them a lot; he presumably had nothing against ships, on which he travelled to England. He was in favour of printing technology, which he used to propagate his opinions, although I do not think the typewriter found its way into the ashram. He did not express himself very clearly on what technology should be allowed, and who should decide it. He was against the British ruling India, but was not very explicit on how Indians should govern India. He did not object when his followers adopted British-style democracy; but I doubt if he approved of it.I think Rajan has enlightened us as little as Gandhi on what type of governance he favours. Since he argues for community rule, he must favour an extremely decentralized system. If he accepts nation states, then he must favour a hierarchical State with villages as its lowest rung. Gandhi wrote incessantly into his seventies, and we still do not know what type of rule he wanted. Rajan has still some time to go; let us hope that he will work out the ideal form of government before too long. If he gets it right, community after community will adopt his model. They will learn from one anothers experiments; the model will get better and better  until the world becomes a Raghu Ram Rajya."

They will coordinate with the authorities in Odisha in ensuring the food packets reach the needy.CFTRI has proposed to supply one lakh meals or 25 tonnes of food to the affected people in the coastal State. The second food consignment is expected to leave the CFTRI campus to Bengaluru on Monday night for shipping to Bhubaneswar.The relief food items include ready-to-eat chapathi and tomato chutney; reconstitutable poha upma and wheat upma; high protein biscuits and rusk.Broken wheat upma and poha upma can be eaten by pouring either hot or cold water into pouches containing the food ingredient. Both are ready to eat in 10 minutes if hot water is used and in 20 minutes if cold water is used. Water can be poured directly into the pouch thus reducing the need for cooking vessels. We are also planning to send pickles and jams as well, said CFTRI Director K.S.M.S. Raghavarao.The relief foods have a shelf life of 12 to 15 days, the director said, adding that a licensee of CFTRIs ready-to-eat chapathi technology based in Wayanad, Kerala, has come forward to supply 10,000 chapathis to CFTRI at a highly subsidised price for distribution in Odisha. The remaining foods had been prepared in-house at CFTRI.Around 800 people, including scientists drawn from all departments, scholars, students and other staff members have been working in different shifts since Friday to prepare foods at three pilot plants on the CFTRI premises.Our new innovation  ready-to-eat broken wheat upma  has been included in the relief foods. Our chapathis contain natural preservatives and tastes better, Mr. Raghavarao said and added that their food consignments were expected to cater to around 10 per cent of population displaced by Cyclone Fani.Last year, CFTRI had sent around 50,000 meals to flood-hit Kerala and also Kodagu, which was devastated by floods and landslips."
2019-05-10,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/the-kanjeevaram-saris-of-pavagada-taluk/article27084767.ece,The Kanjeevaram saris of Pavagada taluk,"Those who buy handloom silk saris in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, could possibly be buying the ones woven actually at Y.N. Hoskote, a few hundred kilometres from the famed temple town. The skilled weavers in this drought-hit village in Pavagada taluk of Tumakuru district have been weaving saris, without any identity or brand, that are sold as Kanjeevaram.This lesser known handloom weaving tradition, however, has been under stress over the decades because of poor working condition and wages, despite silk weavers getting higher wages than cotton handloom weavers.Declining numbersMany of the Y.N. Hoskote handloom weavers  whose numbers have declined from around 5,000 earlier to about 1,800 now  fell into debt traps and were forced to migrate to Bengaluru in search of better jobs after the price of raw silk went up steeply. The village has also witnessed the arrival of powerlooms like other weaving centres.There was a sudden hike in silk rates from 1,600-1,800 to 4,500-4,800 per kg of raw silk in 2008-09. Many who had bought raw materials at a higher rate suffered losses as they could not get good profit. Several others could not buy raw silk for weaving because of the price. They stopped weaving and went to cities to work in garment factories, says director of Thogataveera Nekarara Sangha B.N. Nagaraj. Those who migrated from Y.N. Hoskote work as security guards, construction workers, garments factories and also labourers in Bengaluru, he says.Interestingly, while many traditional weavers are migrating to cities, Y.N. Hoskote has had weavers from villages in Andhra Pradesh, a few kilometres away, coming here. Narendra, weaver from Perur Achchammanahalli of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh, says: Though we have 8 acres of land in which we used to grow groundnuts and tomatoes, we have left the land fallow owing to drought and I work as a weaver in Y.N. Hoskote. Narendra says since he cannot commute to his village, 20 km from Y.N. Hoskote daily, he goes there once in a week. When it rains, that occurs rarely, his wife Padmavathi works as an agricultural labourer too.However, many local weavers do not want their children to take up this profession. I have not taught my son weaving. He is studying commerce in Tumakuru. I want my son to be an auditor, says Anjaneyalu, a weaver. Twisting and winding of silk yarn is done by women labourers and many of them have developed health complications over the years. Parvathamma, a widow, said: I work at the centre from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and get 18 per hour. As I have to continuously stand while working, I have developed varicose veins and got operated six months back. Im back to work as this is the only means of livelihood, she said.Hoping for constant ratesTaluk panchayat member P.C. Nagaraj says the handloom industry will survive if silk rates remain steady. Now as the silk rate is constant, a few weavers who were working in Bengaluru are coming back to work once again as weavers, he says, hoping for the good run to last. Their best time is the marriage season, when people from Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Shivamogga and Mysuru come to buy saris in bulk directly from the weavers at prices less than 50% of those at showrooms.(This is the fifth in a series on the handloom sector in Karnataka.)"

You are probably getting ready to hit the gym and sweat it out. You might also be thinking where to go out on a beautiful Saturday night, which would include having fun with your friends as well as eating healthy.Mediterranean food is supposed to be one of the healthiest cuisines the world has ever known, thanks to its abundance of vegetables, legumes, olive oil and lean meat. Layla at The Den, Whitefield,offers Mediterranean cuisine along with a rooftop view from the 21st floor, overlooking the city skyline. Ten points to the restaurant for having an amazingly romantic ambiance, decked up with cabanas, candles on each table and huge space.Pretty impressed with the setting, my dining companion and I were comfortably seated inside with two glasses of red wine. After a short wait, the waitress brought over a large plate of Cold Mezze, which, in the Middle Eastern culture, is considered to be a meal of appetisers served to unite people around the table in a spirit of sharing.The first bowl had Msabbaha, a combination of hummus, tahini and warm chick peas. More like a salad, the hummus smoothly complemented the other ingredients. We figured out the taste of roasted eggplant with just a bite; it was soft and full of flavours of butter and pistachio. The healthy Tabbouleh cauliflower was finely grated, complete with herbs and garnished with almond oil. The chef tried to play up a little with the vegetable in Fried Zucchini, which was again cooked with tahini sauce and cumin. The Turkish Caprese is an amalgamation of cherry tomatoes, bocconcini and pomegranate molasses and will definitely be loved by tomato and cheese lovers. As much as the names sound exotic, the Cold Mezze has been an interesting take on the Mediterranean cuisine.From the Hot Mezze, we got some specific dishes curated by the chef, and out of them, the Shrimp Falafel and Chicken Pastel were our favourites. A heavy proportion of shrimp meat was doled in a ball of coated sesame seeds, along with hints of lemon sauce and cilantro, giving out a fresh aroma in every piece we took.Next, we tried Shallow-fried Sardines, which were medium-sized sardine is cooked in little oil, giving a succulent taste garnished with chopped vegetables. As fish lovers, we finished a piece each in a jiffy.The last of the menu (before desserts, of course) was the lamb kebab, which tasted much like properly-grilled sheekh kababs.In the desserts section, we tried the Levantine dessert called Kanefah, which is a cheesy, noodle-like pastry, the dough of which is made with semolina, tastes sweet and feels thick, and served hot. To discover new dishes from the faraway land is always a treat, and if its a dessert, its a double treat, for sure. The panna cotta is a must-try for all, where the thick goat milk and orange segments went too well with the dry nuts and basil. The taste was immensely diverse, and we enjoyed it thoroughly.We ended the night with a Layla-special Activated Charcoal cocktail with a Vodka base. In addition to making us happy-high, the drink was sweet and appealing to the taste buds. It felt more like a mocktail which kept us slightly buzzed, enough to go back home on a good note.Cost for two: `2,000 approx"

The restaurant has a variety of exotic salads on their menu, as well as options for people who are keen on niche food such as vegan or a keto diet.Soujanya stresses on the fact that some of her healthy preparations will change the misconception that salads are boring to eat. Thai Mango (with Totapuri mangoes and Thai Chilli dressing), Papaya as well as the Watermelon & Feta are some of the salads which she recommends for summer for their cooling effect on the body. Soups n Salads has recently introduced whole-grain bowls consisting of nuts, grains and organic vegetables. Another place which has opened barely a couple of months ago and has got a quick recognition for their quality of salads is Nuts Over Salads Cafe, located on Road No 36 Jubilee Hills. The restaurant chain, which has two outlets in Bangalore, serves a range of soups, appetisers, and main courses apart from some exclusive salads. Abhinav Singh, who owns this place, is very happy with the response, especially from the health-conscious, young IT professionals. Among his salad recommendations for the summer season is Zoodle Bowl, a light salad, rich is fresh greens like cucumber and zucchini as well as Zesty Millet Salad, with a cumin dressing. Fruit lovers can go for the seasonal fruit salads which include a lot of other fruits apart from the summer special mangoes.Greens and More delivers salads at your doorsteps. The organization, started by Preeti Sinha, has nutritionists in the team who help them balance the recipes. For summer, they have a daily special Summer Salad which incorporates summer special fruits like mango and ice apples as well as watermelon and grapes. The vegetables preferred for this salad are zucchini, broccoli, sprouts, tomato, and mushrooms, while dressings such as Tahini Yoghurt or Apple Cider are used.(Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in)"

Lifes like that!!Wang Tea:Jason, the charming young man welcomed us with a disarming smile. Proudly holding the legacy of a 130-year-old tea company Wang Tea (founded in 1890), this well-groomed new generation entrepreneur thinks everything chic, trendy, and novel: conducts the tea demo on a classic set of rosewood table and stools with beautifully carved cabriole legs. In an hour-long demo, he took us around, explaining the machinery for each stage of tea processing. A lady sat zen-like, removing stalks from the tiny tea buds. We joined her and worked briefly: it was so meditative and de-stressing!Later he gave us different teas to taste: each infusion had us more invigorated. When Jason picked a blob of nicotine and placed it on his palm, we all gasped, for we never saw the physical form of nicotine!Located in Dadao Chengs Old tea zone, Wang Tea in its long journey created a space to Interact with Tea. It is worth spending time to have a memorable tea experience here and buy different categories of tea to carry home. With period stuff all around, it is like a mini museum. I fell in love with the statue of a China man drinking tea: he had a priceless expression on his face!Din Tai FungThis chain of restaurants is famous for its Xian long bao-Taiwanese soup dumplings. We had an impressive dinner at their Taipei 101 branch that bustled with huge crowds waiting for a table. During this long wait, guests were kept busy with something like tombola: some of them winning and grinning before a table was vacated.As we entered the bustling restaurant we went past the busy team of what looked like surgeons in the midst of a serious operation, but from close it proved to be just an operation of making dumplings! Clad in shirts, aprons, caps and masks all in white, they looked like medical doctors. Hundreds of hand-made dumplings steamed in bamboo baskets find their way to the tables of loyal clients daily. It is as interesting to watch the process, as it is to eat the dumplings. But to come to the stage of tasting the dumplings, it was a slow process: after passing through delicately flavoured crisp pickled cucumbers, salad with thin strips of wakame (a thick sheet like seaweed), stir-fried amaranth greens served with sauteed garlic.Our pretty waitress revealed the protocol to eat the Xian long bao. We followed her instructions to a Tee:Put soy sauce and vinegar into the bowl with sliced ginger: one part soy sauce to three parts vinegar for best results.Take the soup dumpling and dip it into the sauce. Then put the dumpling into your spoon, and poke a hole in the wrapper of the dumpling to release the juices. And finally, eat, but eat it hot! Going through this unfamiliar process, mine became cold. But nevertheless, they tasted fine.The dessert was a disappointing steamed taro xiao long bao  a mildly sweetened version of the dumplings filled with sweet taro: an unacceptable cousin of our delicious Modak.Bubble TeaDuring our lunch at Chun Shui Tang (Original Store) in Taichung, I tasted the much talked about bubble tea (pearl milk tea). One thing special in Taichung is the teahouse culture, led by Chun Shui Tang Cultural Tea House who invented the beverage.Bringing Tang and Song Dynasty decoration back into the teahouse to represent culturally rich and sophisticated age, the place is elegantly decorated with a cherry blossom tree creating a pretty space.Tapioca balls (boba) are the prevailing chewy spheres in bubble tea, but a wide range of other options can be used to add similar texture to the drink. Boba is Cantonese slang for large breasts referring to the tapioca balls. I enjoyed the milkshake like Mango bubble tea, slurping the sabudana through the straw. Back home, we are quite used to eating the delicious sabudana kheer but I prefer to call the Taiwanese tapioca balls simply bubbles.Hot PotIn the Chinese cooking method, hot pot is prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table, containing a variety of vegetables or meats. At Takao 1972 Hot Pot in Taipei, we cooked our meal in a ready-made broth that was simmering in the tabletop stoves in front of us.I added a bit of everything that was kept in front of me. Inoki mushrooms, corn, napa cabbage, bok choy, seaweed, all went into the hot pot.We had a tough time finding salt, as the waitress could not understand English. Later, one of us came out with some condiments and it spiced up the meal slightly. Mine became a thick tomato sauce like soup, to which I added boiled rice to make a meal. Some of my friends at the other table had to slog over raw meats and learn to peel the shrimps with bare hands!In the adjacent Ice Papa Restaurant, the huge mango shaved ice cream with only ice and no cream resulted in fewer calories but chilling tough on the teeth with frozen mango chunks. Maybe thats how Taiwanese like it"
2019-05-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ban-restrictions-civilian-traffic-delay-food-trucks-hit-business-jammu-kashmir-srinagar-udhampur-highway-5723140/,"J-K: Truckers, traders irked as ban, restrictions on civilian traffic delay supply in Valley","Written by Hibah BhatAdvertisingAbh yahan ane ka dil nahi karta (I dont feel like coming here anymore), he says as he arrives at the Srinagars fruit mandi, ten days after he left Jalandhar with a truckload of tomatoes for the Valley. For five years, Kumar, a truck driver from Samba in Jammu, drove to the Valley with fruits and vegetables. But this could be his last trip.Restrictions on the movement of civilian traffic on Udhampur-Srinagar National Highway, coupled with frequent landslides, is triggering anger in the Valley, especially among the truckers. A 270-km journey that they used to cover in two to three days now takes more than a week. And this is not just a waste of time, but also harmful for the condition of the stock, which rot on the way.At Srinagars fruit and vegetable Mandi, Abdul Rehman is anxious. His driver had called him in the middle of the night. Sahab, Aage nahi chodh rahe hai, raat yahi guzaarni padegi (Sir, they are not allowing me to move forward. I will have to spend the night here), Rehman quotes his driver as saying.AdvertisingSince the highway ban, Rehman has been receiving many such calls at odd hours of night from the truck drivers stuck on Srinagar-Udhampur highway. After the militant attack in Pulwama this February, J&K government banned civilian traffic on the highway to just two days a week Wednesday and Sunday. Though the ban on Wednesdays has been revoked, the restrictions have not just hit the state economy but also the truck drivers from outside the state.When Kumar, 32, loaded his truck at Jalandhar, he didnt wait for a minute. He knew he has to be in Srinagar in next two days as tomatoes are highly perishable. In fact, he didnt make a halt till Jammu a 220 km from where he started.I reached Jammu in just five hours. It was already growing dark but I didnt stop, he says. It took me another two hours to reach Udhampur.As he drove close, Kumar could see the flickering of backlights of trucks. There were hundreds of them, stuck in front of his, all stopped because of the highway ban. What he thought to be a temporary halt lasted for two days.We have no option but to stay in our trucks on the roadside, he says. But even that becomes a problem at some point of time. We cant just park our trucks anywhere. It creates hindrances for the local people and they ask us to vacate.After spending two nights on the roadside at Udhampur, Kumar and his fellow truckers were allowed to move ahead. After driving for an hour, they were again stopped at Chenani and asked to take de-tour via Patnitop. Indias longest road tunnel was constructed at Chenani to bye-pass Patnitop, a high mountainous pass thus reducing the journey by 30 km and more than two hours.As Kumar talks about de-tour, one of his fellow trucker interjects. Few days back, police at Chenani broke the windshields of several trucks, he says. They blamed us for blocking the road and asked us to take a u-turn.As Kumar negotiated the tough terrain of Patnitop, he was asked to stop again  this time at Batote. Yaha se aagey nahi ja sakte (You cant go any further from here), thundered a policeman, he says.The halt at Batote was for another two days. At Batote, every passing hour perturbed him. I was no longer at peace, he says. I was getting regular calls from the vendor. He was worried. I understood his concern. My truck was loaded with tomatoes worth rupees three to four lakhs. I knew if I dont reach well in time, all this will rot.The fruit and vegetable dealers in Srinagar say they have no problem with the highway ban order but only want that the movement of civilian traffic to be organised. We are not against the ban. The government might have valid security reasons for the same, says Bashir Ahmad, an executive member of New J&K Fruit Association. All we want is a proper implementation of the order in all aspects.The truckers say that they are not only stopped on Sundays when the highway is closed for civilian traffic. Every time there is movement of (security) convoys, we are asked to stop, says another truck driver. The unnecessary halts delay our journey. Also on most of the days, traffic is allowed only on one side of the highway and there are frequent landslides disrupting the movement.The delay in transporting food from outside Kashmir results in a shortage of supply and a consequent rise in prices.The ban has led to a loss of approximately Rs 500 crore to us, says Bashir Ahmad Bashir, President of the Fruit Association.AdvertisingBefore the ban, Kumar says he would make five to ten trips on the Jammu-Srinagar stretch a month. Now I can hardly make two to three trips, he says. If I truck from Delhi to other states, I would earn less than what I used to earn here before. But at least, I would be able to pay my debts. Less profit is always better than loss."
2019-05-12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/as-temperatures-rise-so-do-vegetable-prices/article27105471.ece,"As temperatures rise, so do vegetable prices","Come summer, the short supply and increased demand for vegetables tend to send prices soaring. Prices of tomatoes, carrots, beans, avarakkai, chowchow, coriander and pudhina have all gone up since last week.Kilpauk resident S. Sharmila said tomatoes, pudhina and coriander were absolutely necessary for daily cooking and she had noted that the prices of these had gone up. In a non-vegetarian item, there is no replacement for tomatoes like how you can use tamarind in a rasam. When you spend so much on the meat, the other ingredients meant for the masala too need to be just right, she said, adding that for those who cannot afford, such rates would be an issue.R. Ganesan of Sri Ganesh Vegetable store said first-quality beans at his store were priced at 90. I do both wholesale and retail. With the increase in prices, I have not been able to supply to companies at the old rates. I am just about managing now. Hopefully, the supplies will get regularised soon, bringing the demand and prices down, he said.Low yieldKoyambedus Periyar Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association president S. Chandran said every year during summer, with low water availability, the yield automatically came down. Wholesale prices of certain vegetables have gone up by 5-10 a kilo. For instance, take the case of shallots (sambar vengayam). We are not getting supplies from Cuddapah and Kurnool, but from Erode, Salem and Oddanchatram, and the quantity is only 20 tonnes a day, in place of the usual 50-60 tonnes, he said.However, prices of all vegetables have not gone up. Prices of onions and potatoes remain the same. In fact, due to increase in the availability of onions and yam (chenaikizhangu), they are being sold at very low prices. Yam from Andhra Pradesh sells at 15 a kilo and that from Tamil Nadu at 10-12 a kilo."
2019-05-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/first-challenge-for-next-govt-food-inflation-set-to-return-5724369/,First challenge for next govt: Food inflation set to return,"THE BJP-LED NDA governments tenure has been marked by benign food prices. Consumer food inflation has ruled below general retail inflation for 31 months running, from September 2016 to March 2019, while averaging a mere 1.3 per cent year-on-year during this period, as against 3.6 per cent for the latter.AdvertisingBut food inflation could well be the next governments first challenge, regardless of who heads it. The past couple of months have seen prices of a host of farm commodities surge, mainly on the back of drought in large parts of western and southern India, coupled with an early and harsher-than-usual summer.On Friday, the average traded price of maize at Davangere (Karnataka) was Rs 2,010 per quintal, compared to Rs 1,120 a year ago. Jowar and bajra were, likewise, selling for Rs 2,750 per quintal (Rs 1,600) at Jalgaon (Maharashtra) and Rs 1,900 per quintal (Rs 1,100) at Chomu (Rajasthan), respectively.A lower crop  31.5 million bales in 2018-19, down from 36.5 million bales last year  has led to kapas (raw un-ginned cotton), too, quoting at Rs 5,800 per quintal in Rajkot (Gujarat), from Rs 5,250 at this time last year.AdvertisingExplained Good for farmers, not consumers This election, unlike previous ones, has not been fought on inflation. The central government, if at all, has faced flak not for high, but low prices of farm produce during its term. It makes the return of food inflation  bad for consumers, but good for farmers  that much trickier for the next government to handle.However, it isnt only coarse cereals and fibres.According to Vipul Mittal, head (fruits & vegetables) at the online grocery bigbasket.com, the average cost price of horticultural produce has gone up 13-15 per cent year-on-year since March. Thus, tomato prices at Karnatakas Kolar market are currently averaging Rs 2,000 per quintal, from Rs 580 a year ago, while increasing from Rs 655 to Rs 850 for onion at Lasalgaon (Maharashtra). Even summer season vegetables such as okra, bottle gourd and bitter gourd are wholesaling 36-39 per cent higher than last year; so is radish.The real problems, though, are in milk. Most cattlefeed ingredients are costing much more now relative to last year. That includes not just maize, but also de-oiled rice bran (up from about Rs 8,950 to Rs 14,350 a tonne), fine rice polish (Rs 16,750 to Rs 20,350), molasses (Rs 3,950 to Rs 7,200) and guar churi/meal (Rs 20,200 to Rs 23,650).Cottonseed oilcake prices have also risen from Rs 19,000-22,000 to Rs 27,500 per tonne since November-January.Its only a matter of time before all this cost push translates into higher milk prices for consumers, says R S Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation. The cooperative, better known by its Amul brand, had registered a jump in average milk procurement from 176.5 lakh litres per day (LLPD) in 2016-17 to 204.3 LLPD in 2017-18 and 223 LLPD in 2018-19.In this financial year, procurement has so far been 3 per cent lower year-on-year, despite our members union hiking prices from Rs 570-580 per kg of fat in December-January to Rs 630-650 now. Even in North India, procurement prices of buffalo milk with 6.5 per cent fat has soared from Rs 32-33 to Rs 40 per litre in this period, says Sodhi.While drought-induced fodder and feed shortages are a major cause of cost push and drop in milk procurement, R G Chandramogan, managing director, Hatsun Agro Product Ltd, Indias largest private sector dairy, also attributes it to sustained low prices over the last four years or more. Not getting good prices for milk has shaken the confidence of farmers. They have been underfeeding their animals or reducing herd sizes, which is bound to affect supply at some point, he says.Dairies were forced to slash procurement prices, especially after exports of skimmed milk powder (SMP) from the country collapsed from 129,868 tonnes in 2013-14 to 34,490 tonnes in 2014-15 and 11,476 tonnes in 2017-18. In 2018-19, they recovered slightly to around 45,000 tonnes. The resultant depletion of stocks has, in turn, helped prop up domestic SMP rates from Rs 135-140 per kg to Rs 210 levels in the last six months.Another commodity that has witnessed improved price sentiment, of late, is sugar. The key driver has been drought in Maharashtra. The state is expected to record 40 per cent lower cane area for the 2019-20 crushing season from October, with farmers  particularly in the Marathwada region and surrounding areas of Solapur, Ahmednagar and Nashik  reducing or not taking up plantings of the pre-seasonal (September-October) and suru (December-January) crops.My mill in Osmanabad had roughly 15,000 hectares of cane area last season. For the next season, this may not touch 1,000 hectares. Even the standing crop is being diverted by farmers for fodder, claims B B Thombre, chairman, Latur-based Natural Sugar and Allied Industries. He predicts that only 6-7 out of Marathwadas 47 sugar mills will have enough cane to operate in the coming season.For now, the main ray of hope is the southwest monsoon. The Met Department has forecast aggregate rainfall during June-September to be 96 per cent of its long period average, making it a near normal season. But Chandramogan feels that even if the monsoon turns out good and prices are finally looking up, farmers will not be able to step up production overnight, as agriculture isnt like switching on or turning off lights.Mittal sees the current uptick in food prices as a healthy and necessary correction. It may look inflationary, but the fact is that before March-April, the year-on-year cost increases in fruits and vegetables was in the low single digits or even negative. Farmers, then, couldnt recover their cultivation costs, which is not sustainable, he says.AdvertisingWhen the NDA government took over in May 2014, annual consumer food inflation was in near double-digits. By end-2016, that was brought down to low single digits by end-2016. Given the associated farm stress caused, it is unlikely that if food inflation returns, the next government  even if headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi  would be inclined to adopt an overly hawkish approach."
2019-05-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/food-pries-inflation-lok-sabha-elections-5725933/,If food prices rise,"For 32 months running (from September 2016 to April 2019), consumer food inflation has been trailing general retail inflation. To understand its significance, rewind to the preceding 32 months (from January 2014 to August 2019), when in as many as 25 months the annual increase in food prices exceeded overall consumer inflation. Simply put, food prices arent pinching as before and have also not been a hot-button issue in the current Lok Sabha elections  unlike in 2014, when they were one of the key reasons for the then Congress-led ruling alliances rout. Bringing down retail food inflation from near double-digit to low single digit levels  even negative in many months  has, indeed, been a signal achievement of the Narendra Modi government. However, it hasnt been an unmixed blessing. While consumers have benefitted, the same cannot be said about farmers, for whom flat or falling prices of food and other agri produce have spelled disaster. Whether and how much that would cost the Modi-led BJP  in terms of rural votes  will be known on May 23, the day of counting.AdvertisingMeanwhile, there are also signs of a trend reversal. The last couple of months have seen prices of a host of farm commodities  from coarse grains, cattlefeed ingredients and cotton to tomatoes and seasonal vegetables  going up significantly. Even milk and sugar are beginning to shake off a prolonged bear phase. The immediate trigger for this seems to be drought in large parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. But there could be structural reasons as well. It is not difficult to believe that sustained low produce realisations have broken the backs of many farmers, leading them to cut down crop acreages or underfeed their cattle. These are bound to impact yields and supply at some point. In that case, a normal monsoon alone, as forecast by the Met Department, may not be enough. Farmers arent going to ramp up output overnight, just as insufficiently nourished bovines will take time to calve and produce close to their genetic potential. If structural supply constraints combine with a not-so-great monsoon, the result may well be a return of food inflation.That, on the face of it, may not be good news for the next government. The mistake it should avoid is to clamp the usual restrictions on exports, internal trade and stocking, even while allowing unlimited imports at zero duty. On the contrary, this is the time to scrap the Essential Commodities Act and laws allowing agricultural produce trade only in government-controlled wholesale mandis. The current food inflation, if at all, is a necessary price correction that will help restore farmer confidence. Improved price realisations would also create an environment to phase out wasteful government spending, whether through market-distorting minimum support price procurement operations or under-pricing of fertilisers, water and electricity. Farmers deserve remunerative prices, not handouts."

Prices of tomatoes, carrots, beans, avarakkai , chowchow, coriander and pudhina have all gone up since last week.Kilpauk resident S. Sharmila said tomatoes, pudhina and coriander were absolutely necessary for daily cooking and she had noted that the prices of these had gone up.No replacementIn a non-vegetarian item, there is no replacement for tomatoes like how you can use tamarind in a rasam.When you spend so much on the meat, the other ingredients meant for the masala too need to be just right, she said, adding that for those who cannot afford, such rates would be an issue.R. Ganesan of Sri Ganesh Vegetable store said first-quality beans at his store were priced at Rs. 90. I do both wholesale and retail. With the increase in prices, I have not been able to supply to companies at the old rates. I am just about managing now. Hopefully, the supplies will get regularised soon, bringing the demand and prices down, he said.Koyambedus Periyar Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association president S. Chandran said every year during summer, with low water availability, the yield automatically came down. Wholesale prices of certain vegetables have gone up by Rs. 5-10 a kilo. For instance, take the case of shallots ( sambar vengayam ). We are not getting supplies from Cuddapah and Kurnool, but from Erode, Salem and Oddanchatram, and the quantity is only 20 tonnes a day, in place of the usual 50-60 tonnes, he said.However, prices of all vegetables have not gone up. Prices of onions and potatoes remain the same.In fact, due to increase in the availability of onions and yam ( chenaikizhangu ), they are being sold at very low prices.Yam from Andhra Pradesh sells at Rs. 15 a kilo and that from Tamil Nadu at Rs. 10-12 a kilo.Every year during summer, with low water availability, the yield automatically comes down"

Over the next 10 minutes a huge crowd makes a beeline for the tiffin room, waiting for the doors to open.Landmark sweets Chandrahaara: Want to know how the famous MTR sweet Chandrahaara got its name? As a tribute to 1948's Kannada blockbuster Chandrahara, the Maiya family created this sweet, a blend of flour, sugar and thickened milk, spiced with ghee and cloves.Spoilt for choice: Ghee Masala dose with Aalu Palya; Rice Idli with chutney and Rava Idli with Aalu Saagu; Kharabaath; Bisibelebath; Chandrahaara; Mysore pak, Dumroot halwa, Payasa; badami haalu; grape juice.Survival challenge: During the Emergency when the restaurant had closed down, MTR created instant food mixes and had their workers busy. The timing was perfect as ready-to-eat sector, with sambar, rasam, and chutney powders, instant idli, dosa, and other mixes took off.In the limelight: Amongst the thousands of bureaucrats, businessmen, politicians, actors and directors Raj Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Rajkumar, politicians Farooq and Sheikh Abdullah, industrialist Narayana Murthy and his wife, writer Sudha Murthy, poet DV Gundappa, and painter MF Hussain have enjoyed MTR food.For a group of villagers from Tumkur, 40 kilometres away, it is a day to relax after their vegetables have been dropped off at the nearby City Market much before dawn. It has been three years now since I visited MTR , and we cant wait to enjoy a hot MTR Rava Idli with alugadde (potato), and pack some for home too, says an excited Siddappa, a tomato grower from Gowripura. At 6.20 am, vendors selling jasmine and golden champak gather outside the restaurant. People buy flowers only after they are done with breakfast and coffee, they say.From 3 am onwards, the kitchen at MTR bustles with a dozen people. They are getting the mornings dishes ready. Idli and dosa batter is prepared a day before to ferment it. Vegetables are cut in the morning and noon, milk is boiled three times a day, only the vada batter is prepared fresh as that way the crispies emerge golden brown from the oil, says Hemamalini Maiya, daughter of Harishchandra Maiya, who took over from his uncle, Yagnarayana, who was one of the founders of MTR in 1924.Proficient cooks and brothers, Parameshwara Maiya with Ganappayya and Yagnanarayana had left Kota, a hamlet near Udupi to reach Bengaluru where one of their employers had encouraged Parameshwara to start a small hotel in 1924 to serve coffee and idli. That was the beginning of Brahmin Coffee Club. Later Yagnanarayana thought the word club sounded elitist, so changed the name to Mavalli Tiffin Room, named after the locality where it is situated.MTR has a couple of head cooks with nearly two dozen assistants, and a dozen more helpers. Each one has a specific role with their tasks cut out. It is like an assembly line, says Hemamalini, walking through an aisle where almonds are being crushed in a mixer for badam milk; coconut, chilli and coriander are in the blender for the famous MTR chutney, potatoes are being boiled in their skin for the saagu for poori and masala for dosa, fruits are being cut for fruit salad, and grapes are boiled and filtered for juice.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARThe din of plates and spoons are heard even as a mound of diced onions keeps growing. It may seem robotic, but this routine has been followed for decades, says Hemamalini, one of the siblings who with Vikram and Arvind took over the mantle of running this popular place after the death of Harishchandra Maiya in 1999.MTR thrives on loyal customers who have been dining here for generations. The weekends overflow with people. It is humbling to see serpentine queues with poets, actors and businessmen, she says. There are nearly 2,500 walk-ins each day during the weekends, apart from around 1,500 others who drop by just for coffee. Public holidays and Sundays see MTR serving nearly 1,000 masala dosas, 800 plates of rava idli, 800 plates of poori, with about 300 litres of milk used. Nearly 200 litres of onion sambar, and vegetable sambar are prepared each weekend.We get nearly 400 kilograms of vegetables and fruits. Provisions are sourced from long-established vendors who have been supplying us since our grandfathers time, says Hemamalini adding, Nothing much has changed.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARIn 1997, Harishchandra Maiya introduced thali meals as he felt, Dishes savoured at special party hall lunches at MTR should reach every customer. He introduced a huge platter with nearly 30 items for  50 and saw nearly 1,000 thalis sell out between 12.30 pm and 5 pm! We have now brought it down to two dozen items as we notice that people dont prefer some of the sweets and side dishes. After 22 years it now costs 270, says Hemamalini.So, what is their secret? It lies in the preparation that results in dosas that are soft and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside, says Hemamalini, adding that red rice and dollops of ghee lends to their signature taste. Rava idli, she says, is yet another signature dish from MTR. In South Canara, where the family hails from, there was a similar variant generations ago. During World War II, when rice was in short supply, my grandfather, Yagnanarayana , introduced rava idli mixed with curd and a seasoning of dal, cashew and curry leaves. This was paired with alugadde saagu and coriander chutney. The speciality is the rava is sauted to perfection. We train our cooks from scratch, none of them are well known before they join us, she says.Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR), Lalbagh Road, in Bengaluru on May 03, 2019. | Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMARDespite the no-frills dcor or conspicuously missing menu card, MTR retains its cultural stature, and is under the heritage list of INTACH. The food is wholesome with an abundance of ghee. Perhaps Keto dieters will subscribe to it! adds Hemamalini, and this is what her father wanted to maintain, and not bother with expansion plans. He always wanted peoples choice to decide the course of MTR! she says as we check out the 6,000 square feet of space with 14 rooms. We have basic tables and plastic chairs, and we still have the silver tumblers my grandfather introduced 75 years ago. He was captivated by them during his trip to England. Right now we have only about 100 sets left that we serve only during special meals!Apart from Lalbagh Road, MTR has branches at Indiranagar, Malleswaram, Gandhinagar, Whitefield, St. Marks Road, JP Nagar, Kammanahalli and Kanakapura Main Road; and in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai.A column where we experience the lives of people and places in the city"

But thats when the Social Media Influencer is out and about. The chic, summery-yet-fresh minimalist vibe at Quick Brown Fox (QBF) is an automatic draw for the Influencer, who, along with her photographer friend has been shooting with a tall glass of coffee in one hand and one beauty product in the other.A view of the cafes interiors | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMany such people ask us if they can use our area for their shoots, says Vaibhav Bindal, coffee roaster and founder-owner of the cafe. But we limit this to between 10 a.m. and noon. This is testament QBFs quaintness, no doubt. But nestled in one of the side-alleys at Delhis new left-of-cool and almost-too-far Dhan Mill Compound, its only a reward for those who live nearby or can brave peak hour South Delhi traffic.Enter, and the light filtering through its bay windows, the brightly cool pops of colour in the interiors, and the on-loop chill-hop playlists will put you at ease immediately. The cafes appeal though  both food and coffee, which make it dififerent from the bigger, more prominent Cafe Dori in the compound  isnt far from the likes of the more-established Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, already in six locations across the city.If youre picky, however, QBF offers both short black and a long black, and not just a generic espresso. Interestingly, they mention a piccolo latte on the menu (and not a cortado, like most places, including Blue Tokai, do). Currently, all their espresso-based beverages are using only a medium roast from the Badnekhan Estate in Chikmaglur, Karnataka. This is only one of five roasts their menu offers, but Bindal says a change-up is underway.His roasting practices are heavily inspired by Japanese roasteries, so it feels very consistent that the cafes food has its fair share of these influences too. The Scampi Benedict and the Japanese salad are examples, with their creative use of ponzu sauce. The large shrimp in the first is just delicately cooked, comes with an eggs benedict flecked with a hot Nepali chutney, sauteed spinach, a base toast layered generously with cooked and spiced tomatoes. But the highlight really is the ponzu hollandaise: tart, creamy, and just right. The portion is generous, and the presentation, eye-catching.The Japanese salad is a perfect summer dish, with pear, cucumber and snake melon: lightly sweet, tangy, and refreshing. Ponzu here comes in a more watery avatar, layered with handfuls of puffed rice. If youre averse to performing a certain bovine-like masticating action that salads usually demand, this is the perfect alternative: cold soup and fresh fruit rolled into one.Their ricotta (in the very regular ricotta and fig open toast, with rosemary and drizzled honey), is house-made. QBF re-uses the cow milk that is steamed for their coffee beverages, to make this cheese, upcycling within their kitchen.QBF is apleasant experience overall. In terms of a coffee roastery, theres not much it seems to do differently from the handful of roasteries of the third wave of coffee in India; and as a cafe, theres nothing to especially distinguish its appeal, unless you count Bindals prized Probat coffee roaster, standing prominently in a glass-doored alcove.23A, Dhan Mill Compound, 100 Feet Road, Chhattarpur; 1,000 for two"

I grew inquisitive and decided to have an early dinner. The menu is not very elaborate, but quite varied and focusses equally on regional Indian and global delicacies. We began with the Pumpkin and Coconut Puree soup along with the Karela salad. The soup, with its very delicate flavour profile, was soul food and prepped us for the meal ahead. On the other hand, I was moved by the sheer ingenuity in preparation of the Karela salad  crispy rings of bitter gourd tossed in a tangy raw mango relish with few tomatoes and shallots. Simple yet brilliant!For appetisers, I tried the Dhakai Chaat, Spinach and Rosemary Brioche, Dimsum Basket of Edamame & Truffle in Cream Cheese, and a portion of Siya Mirch Tikka. Prepared by Chef Richa Johri, she ensures that all the dishes flirt with your taste buds without leaving you overwhelmed with the uni-dimensional flavours. For example, the Dhakai Chaat, a crunchy paapdi with softer fried arbi, was balanced by yoghurt, date and jaggery chutney. On the contrary, the spinach dish felt wholesome with garlic cream cheese and onion marmalade, and a shot of mushroom tea. Mirch Tikka was a unique take on Chicken Tikka. After marinating with pipli (long peppers), morsels of well-cooked chicken are rolled in crushed papads and served. Personally, Id want the marination to have amalgamated better with the meat, and the outer coating of papads to be more crunchy and spicy.For the mains, we requested for Hyderabadi Khatti Dal, Achaari Kathal Tikka Masala, Kaju Sukkhe with a portion of Chicken Elettaria. The dal stole the show. Tempered with tamarind and curry leaves, it felt homely, and it is one preparation that will make me visit The Finch over and over again. The Elettarias thick and sumptuous curry with strong green cardamom flavour and aroma, was another winner. Served with crisp garlic naan, it can satiate strong carb and curry cravings. The Achaari Kathal and the Mangalorean preparation of Kaju Sukkhe with neer dosa hit the spot. We wrapped up meal with some Kheer Gil-e-Firdaus and a portion of tender coconut and lychee cream with crumbles. Between the two, my vote would go to the kheer made from bottle gourd and rice, laced with saffron.A knowledgeable staff and efficient service are other high points. Spread over three floors, the restaurant has live music on the topmost floor on select days. The fully stocked bar makes it a good spot for an after-work drink and a quick snack. I am yet to try the Rendang curry, mutton pepper fry and Tabak Maas, and hope to do so on my next visit!In a nutshellThe menu is not very elaborate, but quite varied and focusses equally on regional Indian and global delicacies.

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Imagine being able to grow your own veggies, and eat them, too. Fresh and free of pesticides, plucked right off the plant. But how is that possible in a city, you ask? Right through your own balcony or terrace, says Chennai resident Rahul Dhoka.With an interest in organic farming, Rahuls curiosity was piqued when he stumbled upon hydroponics . The possibility of improving our food security and the fact that plants could be controlled in such an intricate manner caught my attention, he begins.He explains hydroponics as the most efficient practice of agriculture. It is a soil-less form of cultivation, where the roots are fed with nutrient-rich water to grow. The popular media which replace soil are cocopeat, hydrotons, perlite, vermiculite, sponge, etc. He adds, In hydroponics, plants can be grown vertically, allowing us to grow many crops in a confined area. For example, as many as 240 plants can be grown in 6sq ft. area.He elucidates that faster yields up to 50 per cent has been achieved using this method. Hydroponics, he thinks, is suited for small spaces like balconies, terraces, indoor rooms, etc, thus making it ideal for Chennaiites living in apartments and shared spaces. When I started growing my own plants and my family started eating fresh vegetables and greens, we got hooked onto it. I decided to build bigger systems and started selling fresh produce like Italian Basil, mint, spinach, kale, pak choi, etc, to a few select retail outlets. The biggest consumers were my relatives who got hooked on to the fresh veggies. This made me assemble small kits as hydroponic systems and now I sell them across India, says Rahul, who has started his own organisation.So, how practical is it to do this in a place like Chennai, which is already facing shortage of water, in addition to intense humid climate? Though factors such as temperature, light, humidity, etc, need to be controlled while cultivating on a large scale, hydroponics is very much possible in Chennai, asserts Rahul. One need not worry about water consumption for plants as hydroponics uses 90 percent less water than soil cultivation. For example, a lettuce or basil plant would take just three litres of water in comparison to 50 to 60 litres in soil per harvest.He advises growing seasonal crops which thrive in tropical humid weather. The plants that would thrive here in Chennai through hydroponics would be all leafy greens like amaranthus, spinach, kale, pak choi, the local keerai varieties like sirrukerai, arrekerai, valarakerai herbs like basil, mint, thyme, chives, pepper varieties, lemongrass, tubers, cucumbers, brinjal, okra, and so on. Growing off-season crops like lettuce and broccoli would be possible only after controlling natural elements like temperature, light and humidity, he says.After amassing knowledge on hydroponics and its implementation, about a few thousand plants grow in 100sq ft of space on Rahuls terrace. They are vertical systems of seven layers at a height of 8ft. Although it isnt practical to cramp so many plants, I use these systems as my research and development unit and grow veggies for my family and relatives. I grow spinach, kale, pakchoi, mint, a few basil varieties, lemongrass, and some varieties of microgreens, says the entrepreneur.According to him, this method is a one-time investment and the only recurring cost is nutrients, which is not a major expense. In terms of management, only a little time is required as it doesnt need soil, tilling, weeding and watering. So, spending around 30 minutes a week should be enough to maintain a system of 500 plants, he avers.Having gained years of experience in the method, his advice for people who are interested in this is to start in a smaller scale. Learn everything about it and then invest big. The picture of you being prosperous in commercial hydroponics is only a myth if the growth is not organic. People usually begin with greenhouse they cannot handle and end up burning a big hole in their pocket. I would suggest people to begin with small systems and upgrade once you are able to grow the produce and sell it.Rahul says that hydroponics can be practised by anybody, from children to the aged  his oldest customer is an 81-year-old. We encourage schools to include hydroponics in their curriculum as an extra activity to spread the awareness to children. If parents could educate their children on how plants and greens are grown, they will appreciate their food and it will no longer be something that magically appears on their plates. The use of several pesticides and oxytocin in vegetables to increase its yield is the root cause of cancers and major ailments. All these can be avoided by growing your own food which is free from harmful chemicals. Restaurants and cafs providing fresh grown greens and herbs are very popular abroad, in places like Bangkok, London and New York, but the concept of farm to table is yet to pick up in India.About the awareness about hydroponics in Chennai , Rahul says, Although it is not an all-new technology, it is a new market here. People are yet to trust this technology completely. We do spread awareness of hydroponics through social media and conduct training sessions so people can learn the technology practically. We participate in exhibitions and also rely on word of mouth. In the recent past, people have been showing interest and trying out hydroponics in small ways, by buying small systems and doing their own experiments. Of late, people who have existing rooftop or those who are interested in gardening are coming forward to purchase the systems.Namma Maddy grows his own food! Yes, the actor has set up a terrace garden in his apartment in Mumbai, and one of the techniques he uses, is hydroponics. In an interview to us earlier, he said, Ive always wanted to take this up, and my decision was driven by a few solid facts. Today, to get the same amount of nutrition that you derived from an apple back in the 40s, its believed that you need to consume 41 of them. Everything is GM (genetically modified) and most of the organic vegetables have almost phased out. So, I decided to grow my own veggies in the most natural way possible. I was working on a script and used to stay back home a lot. So, I used this time to read up on organic farming and it has been rewarding. My terrace garden takes care of almost 70 per cent of my seasonal vegetables requirements. I use just about 1/20th of water that is usually needed through drip irrigation. Especially at times like this, when there is a drought in the state, this is a great way to sustain yourself.Hes also dead against using pesticides. A fruit or vegetable that a worm cant eat, how can you? Birds and insects are part of the ecosystem and help in pollination. I dont see any problem in having fruits and vegetables that birds want to eat, as opposed to the perfect shaped tomato that only you can eat, and which, by the way, could also be cancerous. If you still want to control the insects and worms, spray a mixture of neem oil and water over the plants. It will become too bitter for them to eat, he had said."

Potatoes and tomatoes are selling at Rs 30 and Rs 40 per kg, respectively, at a rate Rs 10 higher than before. The sharp increase has led to a decrease in sales for vendors.We have been selling tomatoes and potatoes at reasonable rates , but we cannot help but increase the prices to keep with the trend. The demand for vegetables has therefore gone down and customers have not been enthusiastic about their purchase, one vendor Salman Kudus said.Our sales have definitely decreased as a result and we do not see as many customers as we earlier did, another vendor K F Naik said.They said that the dayto-day supply of vegetables from neighbouring states has not drastically altered, but the demand certainly has, which means the perishable items remain on their shelves.Despite their desire to make a bountiful purchase, the fluctuating prices have taken a toll on the pockets of consumers, with the lower and middle-class consumers being the most affected.Even though the increasing prices do not affect our ability to buy the vegetables, but our monthly expenditure does increase, and we end up buying smaller quantities of vegetables, consumer Sarla Katariya said.Basic kitchen ingredients like chillies are being sold at Rs 60 per kg against Rs 40 a few weeks ago, while onions are being sold at Rs 20 per kg as opposed to Rs 16 earlier.There is nothing we can do besides cutting out on the costlier vegetables. The government should do something to standardise rates so that people can afford nutritious vegetables, another consumer said."

The treatment plant collects sewage water discharged from toilets and those from handwash. The biogas balloon would be used to store gas.The official said biogas from the sewage treatment plant would be used for power generation through the biogas generator. Power thus generated would be utilised for lighting and for pumps at the treatment plant thereby making it self-sustainable without having to draw from the electricity grid at present.This would save electricity which would otherwise had to be drawn from the grid, the official added.The project also aims to recycle sewage water using phyto-remediation and anaerobic digestion systems. The treated water would be used for the organic garden established on an area of nearly 1,000 square feet inside the workshop where vegetables such as brinjal, tomato and ladies finger were being raised.Flower gardenIn addition to this, the treated water would also be utilised for flower garden inside. The plan was to use 50,000 litres of treated water, the official said.Vegetables raised within the campus were being given to the local community and plans were afoot to use them in the canteen. The project is expected to be set in motion soon once the biogas generator was procured, the official said.The workshop overhauls over 100 diesel locomotives and more than 1,000 passenger coaches every year. Besides this, it also overhauls locomotives used in the Nilgiri Mountain Railway and manufactures container wagons.The upcoming project was another eco-related initiative to be put in place at the workshop where an artificial pond has been created to store rain water. It harness solar power for office purpose and uses it for pumping water. Besides this it has a vermicompost shed."

Those prices were almost half last week. Similarly, ginger is being sold at `140 a kg and garlic at `120.This has been attributed to the crop damage in Puri and Khurda districts that supply local varieties of fresh vegetables to Bhubaneswar. general secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said since large tracts of vegetable fields in Puri have been damaged, the City market is now dependent on supply from Barabati in Jajpur district. The demand and supply gap is likely to prevail till the arrival of monsoon crops, he said.The farmers of Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara are the worst sufferers along with those in Jajpur, Dhenkanal, Bhadrak, Ganjam, Mayurbhanj, Nayagarh and Balasore districts. According to preliminary estimate, 13,698 hectare (ha) of vegetable crop and 24,779 ha of fruit including 6,625 ha of coconut plantation and 1,650 ha of standing banana crop have been damaged in the cyclone.The storm has also badly affected paddy straw mushroom cultivation. Odisha is the largest producer of paddy straw mushroom in the country. More than 5,000 mushroom growers and as many betel leaf farmers in Puri, Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Cuttack districts have been affected.Director of Horticulture Bijay Ketan Upadhyaya said coconut, betel vines, banana and vegetables are the main sources of income for farmers in the coastal districts and Fani has dealt a death blow to them. The farmers who took pains to grow crops like exotic flowers and vegetables under protected conditions like inside greenhouses and shade-net houses have suffered massive losses. A large number of structures erected in departmental farms and nurseries have also been severely damaged, he said.Around 2.16 lakh sq metre of protected structures have been damaged. The farmers are in a quandary as they had availed huge loans to erect those structures and grow high value-based horticultural crops. The department has sought `85 crore assistance for input subsidy and repair of farms and nurseries."

But before he donned this hat full time, he created a low-cost garden on his terrace at Dammaiguda to study how vegetables are grown.Instead of going for the regular cement or earthen pots, he got a few defective plastic bottles from a manufacturing unit and turned those into pots. I filled the bottles with different layers to increase the water retention and nutrient level. I generally grow plants from the legume family. In my garden, the cost comes to Rs 100 per container, whereas with cement or earthen pots go up to Rs 300. My main agenda is to grow food, Srinath says.His garden consists of multiple plants including tomatoes, drumsticks, Indian and Jamaican roselle, cluster beans, cucumbers etc. I have put 20 containers as a pilot project. I also grow marigold flowers which keeps the pests away, he says.Apart from the terrace garden, he has another garden around his house. He comes from a family of farmers and his mother is a gardener too. In the other garden, we have flowering plants like hibiscus and fruit trees like coconuts and pomegranates. We also grow coriander and mint leaves.Explaining that the whole process is organic, Srinath says, We make compost from kitchen waste. I also collect dry leaves and use them as mulch. We dont use any chemical pesticide. If needed, we use natural pesticides like sour buttermilk, neem oil and soap nut water. If there are pests, I like to handpick them, or leave them for the natural predators like lizards and beetles.The gardener says, Since vegetables have shallow roots, they need regular watering. So I water them twice a day. I collected the seeds from farmers who I met at seed festivals. Now I have 70-80 varieties. The farmer has completed a couple of permaculture courses and is also pursuing a course from Water and Land Management Training Institute."

Consequently, their price has gone up.Gandhi Ganj, a major vegetable market where 120-140 licenced vendors sell vegetables, has been wearing a deserted look with customers avoiding buying vegetables. Compared to the last year, the prices of some of the vegetables have doubled affecting our business, said Warangal Venkanna, a retail vendor.The prices have skyrocketed even in the local market at Ankapur where vegetables are grown abundantly and supplied to other markets. One kilogram of locally-grown tomato costs 50 and you can imagine how much it would cost elsewhere, said Bojanna, a farmer at Ankapur.Green chilli is sold at 80 per kg, brinjal at 40 per kg, ridge gourd - 60-80, ladies finger - 60, little finger 50, and bitter gourd at 60 per kg. The price of leafy vegetables has increased too.On normal days, two trucks loaded with green chilli used to come to the market every day from Nagpur, which has now reduced to only one truck. Also, vegetables in about four trucks from Maharashtra and Hyderabad used to arrive here, which has gone down to only two now.Carrots, which were sold earlier at 30 per kg, cost 50 now. Wholesale traders are no longer auctioning vegetables which the retailers used to buy, and are later selling them at whatever price they deem fit, said Venkanna, a vendor.The sowing area of vegetables in summer goes down by 70% due to water scarcity. As against the normal sowing area of 3,000 acres in the district, vegetables are cultivated in only 1,000 acres leading to abnormal price rise, said S. Narsing Das, District Horticulture Officer.New crop would only start arriving at the market after 20 to 30 days and till then, the prices of the vegetables would rise, he said."

2019-05-18,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/may/18/a-delectable-mix-1978289.html,A delectable mix,"Swetha Kadiyala ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: The Konkan belt boasts of a coastline that stretches for 720 kms. Hence, the culture is unique, as it traverses the four coastal states but perhaps what is even more significant is the cuisine of the Konkanis. The Konkan food festival currently underway in the All Spice restaurant at Four Points by Sheraton, promises to render an ample introduction to the food of the region.It is curated by Chef Deepu Mohan whose expertise in Konkan cuisine comes from working for over five years at The Taj in Mumbai. Chef Mohan is a reticent person but his demeanour changes immediately when asked about his favourite dish in the spread. He talks animatedly about a non-vegetarian starter he modified to work beautifully with a locally-found pink perch fish. The fresh fish is dressed heavily in Mangalorean and North Kerala spices and then fried. The result is a surprisingly mild-flavoured starter which is both crispy and soft at the same time.The lunch menu, which has been specifically introduced for the ongoing festival, comes with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thali options. ""We have taken into account five major regional influences along the Konkan railway track including Maharashtrian, Malvani, Goan, Mangalorean and Malabari to design the dishes and every day we change the menu entirely to add new dishes. Apart from the accompaniments, there are about 18 items in each thali,"" Chef Mohan says.The thalis come with a sweeping array of curries, of which the taut gassi is particularly impressive. Made with Madras curry cucumber, it is equally tangy and spicy, and a generous tomato puree adds to the zest. Its non-vegetarian counterpart called kori gassi is made with chicken and is stronger in flavour.Escorting the kori gassi in the non-vegetarian thali is the familiar Malabar meen curry with its rich coconut milk infusion and mustard tempering. The truly Konkani verieli vengi (stuffed brinjal in tomato and spice gravy) hits your palette with incredible relish, it looks just like the taut gassi but is tender and sweet. The only lentil dish is mixed ussal which is a twist on the traditional dal and made with six different pulses. It glides pleasantly down the throat and leaves you wanting for more.The exhaustive range of accompaniments has been curated with equal care. The sanna (Goan steamed rice and urad dal cake) goes well with either taut gassi or kori gassi while puli inji (sweet and sour ginger curry) adds a spectacular pungency. The feast ends with a delectable ada pradhaman and neatly brings the entire meal together."
2019-05-18,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/travel/maxed-out-in-milan/cid/1690761,Maxed out in Milan,"Milano, or Milan, is a major fashion capital and we often hear about it in the world of designers, models and glitterati. It is an international business hub and a destination usually skipped by tourists who prefer to head to the triangle of Rome, Florence and Venice. Trust me, there is so much more to this city than you think!I was last in Milan and its surrounding areas way back in 2005 when I was a young graduate, learning the ropes of the world of gelato and totally fascinated by it. The mornings were all about mixing milk, sugar and fruits to get the gelato display ready for the day and the latter half of the day was about being a tourist.Being back in this glamorous city recently was so nostalgic for me. However, it has changed tremendously and is buzzing with energy. Very modern and trendy, with a young international vibe, there was so much to take in  the chic architecture, the gourmet food scene, cute little boutiques, the characteristic bars and the beautiful primavera or spring weather.Heres my personal guide to exploring Milan and its neighbour, Bergamo, in 48 hours, going very local and avoiding the tourist traps!The 14th centurys Sforza Castle built by duke of Milan Francesco Sforza Picture: Natasha CelmiPiazza Vecchia in Bergamo, which is a hidden gem close to Milan Picture: Natasha CelmiDay 1: Central Milan and the Brera DistrictStart your day bright and early with a cappuccino and cornetto (croissants with various fillings) at a cafe and head to the centro or city centre. Il Duomo is the iconic cathedral and an absolute masterpiece. Head inside if you are keen or enjoy the view from the piazza. Alternatively, move on to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II next door. Another gorgeous piece of architectural brilliance, this is Italys oldest active shopping mall and a great place for glam people-watching. In the same visit, I spotted two modelling shoots in progress!When in Milan do as the Milanese do. Stop for a caffe or espresso shot. Enjoy your coffee with a romantic top view of the Duomo  from the rooftop cafe of the Rinascente department store. There are lovely terrace cafes and mini restaurants offering contemporary cuisines. Ladies, this is the famous fashion district, so if you want to squeeze in a spot of retail therapy, be it window shopping or serious business, stroll through Via Montenapoleone, Via Della Spiga and Via Vittoria Emanuelle.Indulge in a hearty long lunch tasting the specialities of the Lombardy region  Risotto alla Milanese, Cottoletta alla Milanese, Polenta and Osso Buco. The traditional cuisine here has some German influence and focuses on meat, rice, stews and strong cheeses. It is rich and hearty to help combat the cold and damp climate compared to southern Italy, where pasta and tomatoes take centre stage in the cuisine.Today, however, you will find restaurants specialising in cuisines from every part of the country. I was surprised by the plethora of sushi bars, ramen restaurants and dim sum places. Asian cuisine seems to have taken the city by storm. The latest gastronomy trend is the fusion of Italian and Japanese flavours and I loved every bit of it!Digest all that food with a walk through the Brera area, the hub of art and design. The Brera Design District is interesting for those who have an eye for creativity. If you are into art appreciation, stop by the Pinacoteca di Brera, known for its collection of priceless Italian art from centuries. Alternatively, stroll through Via Brera, checking out the quaint little boutiques. Via Fiori Chiari is a little cobblestone street lined with chic cafes and restaurants.In the Brera district, Via Fiori Chiari is a little cobblestone street that is lined with loads of chic cafes and other eateries Picture: Natasha CelmiA must-do in Italy is to stop for a gelato at one of the numerous gelaterias Picture: Natasha CelmiFinally, make your way to the charming Castello Sforzesco, or Sforza Castle and be transported back to the 14th century. This was built by Francesco Sforza, the then Duke of Milan, a character that features in the Netflix series Medici. Having watched this show recently, I was excited to identify the place with the character!Sometime in between, stop for a gelato at one of the many gelaterias you would pass by. Going out for a gelato is a ritual in Italy. It is not just about eating an ice cream, it is an experience. You really cannot go wrong with gelato in Italy and in all my time that I have spent in this country, I have never been disappointed with my gelato.By 6pm, it is aperitivo time! This is a ritual in Milan where the whole city hits the bars after work, drinking Spritz, a cocktail made of Campari and Prosecco, and nibbling on the elaborate spread of tapas offered. I recommend fitting in at least two stops before settling down to a late dinner.Some bars and restaurants we tried and recommend include:Nombre the vin, a unique wine bar located in a basement wine cellar; andRadetzky, an old establishment which is very popular with designers and artists.There are loads of good choices along Corso Garibaldi and further up on Corso Como, another buzzing area for people-watching. Cross piazza Gae Laurenti, taking in the lively atmosphere and modern architecture and finally settle down to dinner at Ratana. The Risotto alla Milanese made with saffron is famous. It has a relaxed ambience and if you have kids, there is a lovely park outside for them to play in.Osteria di Brunello in the same area is a chic restaurant we dined at. Highly recommended for a romantic indulgent dinner.My personal tip: Skip dessert at the restaurant and enjoy a gelato while taking a stroll, or passeggiata, something Italians love to do.The plates of food at the Casual Ristorante in Bergamo are works of art Picture: Natasha CelmiA tapas spread Picture: Natasha CelmiSpritz, a Campari and Prosecco cocktail thats very popular in Milan Picture: Natasha CelmiDay 2: Bergamo and the Navigli districtBergamo is a hidden gem just 45 minutes by train from Milan. The Upper Town (known as Citta Alta) is an old fortified town surrounded by 16th century Venetian walls. Today, it is a Unesco World Heritage Site and the architecture has been preserved from when it was built during the Renaissance.Get the train from Milano Centrale (the central station) and spend half a day there, indulging in a nice lunch. Once you reach Bergamo station, which is in Citta Bassa (the new town), take the bus to Citta Alta. Walk around the old piazzas, visit the glorious cathedral and stroll down narrow cobblestone streets taking in the architecture and relaxed pace of life. Upscale boutiques and delis as well as centuries-old trattorias and wine bars line the streets.Take the funicular train further up to the castle for breathtaking views. We really appreciated the sound of silence interspersed with the chirping of birds. Believe me, you will be transformed back to the medieval ages or feel like you are in one of those old movies! If you are a history buff, there is plenty of information and things to explore.Some of my restaurant recommendations are:Casual. Dont be misled by the name! Its a one Michelin-star creation by top Italian chef Enrico Bartolini. Lunch here was a treat and a very inspiring experience. Every dish is a work of art!Taverna Colleoni dellAngelo is at a beautiful location in the Piazza Vecchia and serves excellent food.Make your way back down slowly on foot, stopping to click Instagrammable pictures on the way, or take the bus back to the station and get onto the next hourly train back to Milan.Get some rest as you will need energy to enjoy the evening life of Navigli, a district built around canals in South Milan. Head to the Naviglio Grande area (you can take the metro) by 6pm to enjoy the sunset with an aperitivo at one of the many lively bars. This area is also an art lovers delight with many art galleries showcasing works by young talents.We tried the Ugo Cocktail Bar, Il Barcone and La Vinera, but the choices are endless and it depends where you get a table. Sip a Negroni, a classic Milanese cocktail, or a glass of Prosecco while you enjoy the gorgeous ambience.My Personal Tip: Skip dinner and fill up with the delicious aperitivo spread that each place has to offer.A must-visit for foodies is the grand Eataly, a mecca of gourmet Italian food featuring a huge supermarket, delis, cafe and gourmet restaurants. I went crazy picking up olive oils, aged balsamic and cheeses and pasta of every type. For a stylish meal, book a table at Alice, a one Michelin-star restaurant on the top floor.Folks, if you are heading to Italy this summer, do try and make Milan part of your itinerary. For those who have no plans, I hope this article inspires you and you save the information for the future. There is lots more of Italian adventures this summer. Stay tuned for news from Sicily next month.Buon Viaggio!Calcutta girl Natasha Celmi is a culinary specialist and food stylist based in Bangalore.

As there was scarce rainfall during Kharif, SK Siddarama, a middle-aged farmer in Santhakudulu, who owns those 40 acres of land, left half of it fallow and cultivated cotton in the rest.But, the drought that had gripped the village in Adoni mandal for nearly one decade now, continued to cast its effect and there was not enough rain or water to save the crop. I have invested nearly Rs 1.7 lakh on the crop, expecting Rs 5 to Rs 6 lakh income. But in just a few weeks, the crop withered for want of water and yet again I suffered loss, he told TNIE.Not losing heart and with a hope to recoup his loss, Siddarama sowed bengal gram in Rabi season in 20 acres and the second crop also withered due to lack of sufficient moisture in the soil. His losses have only accumulated further. With interest, my debts have increased to Rs 10 lakh. I dont know how to clear my debts. To cut my losses, I have decided not to raise crop in the ensuing Kharif, he said.Adoni is one of the worst drought affected mandals in Kurnool district. In Kharif 2018, 50 of the total 54 mandals in the district were declared drought-hit. In Rabi, the number of drought affected mandals was 33. The drought had not only hit the agriculture production, but also had a telling effect on the lives of farmers.Boya Badai Ramudu alias LIC (nickname), who owns 10 acres of land in Santhakudulu village had migrated to Bengaluru. He lamented that even though he was the owner of 10 acres of land he was unable to celebrate Seemantham of his only daughter. He said all the family members, including his two sons and their wives migrated to Bengaluru in search of work and there was nobody in the house to take care of the family function. Now, my pregnant daughter has no other option, but to deliver at her in-laws place, he rued.It is not just Siddarama and Ramudu, but most of the farmers in the village are facing a similar situation. Some were forced to sell their livestock to support the families during hard times. The village with 2,000 families, has less than half of them now as most of them migrated to other places like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Guntur in search of livelihood. About 5,000 acres of land around the village, in which different crops used to be cultivated, now looks barren as most of the crops withered in both Kharif and Rabi.The same situation prevails in most of the drought-affected mandals in the district. Due to continuous dry spell for the past 10 years, in most of the villages, groundwater table got depleted and borewells stopped yielding water.Village and mandal level teams formed for enumeration of loss due to drought had recorded more than 60 per cent crop loss in 6.53 lakh hectares in 50 of the total 54 mandals in Kharif.P Dastagiri of Bapanadoddi village in Krishnagiri Mandal said that he raised cotton, groundnut, red gram, onion and tomato crops in an extent of 15 acres, 10 acres his own and the other 5 acres taken on lease for `10,000 per acre. Cotton was raised in 6 acres, groundnut in 3 acres, tomato and onions in 4 acres and red gram in 2 acres by investing Rs 5 lakh on all the crops.In the initial stage, all the crops were fine, but in course of time, the crops slowly started withering due to water scarcity. Groundnut, cotton, tomato and onion needs a good amount of water at regular intervals, he said.To save his crop, K Ramanjaneyulu of Kothiralla in Pattikonda Mandal borrowed water from a borewell owner with a promise to pay some amount. He wanted water for 4-5 wettings to save his groundnut crop in 5 acres. However, with the depletion of groundwater, the borewell owner expressed his helplessness to supply water and Ramanjaneyulu crop withered.Now, I have a total debt burden of Rs 3 lakh. How am I supposed to clear the debts and how can I support my family, he narrated his helplessness, with tears in his eyes. His sorry tale reflects the plight of most of the farmers in the drought-affected villages of Kurnool.District Collector S Satyanarayana said that they submitted details of drought to the government. The Central team also visited the district to assess the drought. Crops in an extent of 5.17 lakh hectares, including 4,02 lakh hectares in Kharif and 1.15 lakh hectares in Rabi were damaged. The estimated crop loss in both Kharif and Rabi was Rs 649.41 crore, he said and hoped that the government would release financial assistance to the drought affected farmers soon.Bleak scenario54 Total mandals50 Drought hit mandals in Kharif (2018)33 Drought hit mandals in Rabi40.53 lakhTotal population asper 2011 census6 lakh Total farmers4,75,458Drought affected farmers in Kharif1,36,201Drought hit farmersin Rabi6.53 lakh hectares Crop acreage in Kharif3.4 lakh hectares Crop acreage in Rabi4,02,509hectares Crop damage in Kharif1,15,335 hectares Crop damage in Rabi"

He created his own murder story to scare his friends who quarrelled with him over possession of a smartphone.The 23-year-old youth has been identified as Parashuram, a mason and resident of Yellamma Nagar 12th Cross in the city.The drama unfolded when a photo of dead body lying in a pool of blood went viral social media. The people of the city were scared to see the photo as the city has witnessed three murders in the last few days. The fourth murder had literally sent a shiver down the spines of the residents.The police said that Parashuram had quarrelled with his friends over a smartphone they had accidentally discovered. Parashurams friends were demanding that he handover the smartphone to them. A reluctant Parashuram was also scared that his friends would beat him up. Wanting to keep the smartphone for himself but afraid of his friends at the same time, Parashuram decided to create an act of his own murder and scare his friends.To create the scene, Parashuram had poured tomato ketchup and kumkuma water on him and clicked a photo of him lying in the 'pool of blood'. He then sent the photo to his parents. The scared parents approached Extension police station and filed a missing complaint on Saturday. The police launched a search for the body. With the help of the mobile tower signal, police traced the body of Parashuram who was found very well alive and unharmed.The cops arrested him for this bizarre act.PSI Veerabasappa told The New Indian Express that Parashuram framed this plot to fool his friends and to create panic. Parashuram must have watched some Kannada movies to come up with a story plot like this. This is a mischievous and wrong thing to do. The police department staff searched the whole day for him with wholehearted efforts. Such incidents will not be entertained anymore. As his parents are poor and were crying in front of the station we have warned him and let him off, Veerabasappa added.Veerabasappa said that after investigating the reason for his mischief, the police closed the case."

On a recent morning following rain, Daasi woke up to find her tiny 3-acre farm drenched. She was happy. For she had struggled several years to grow crops on her dry land.Daasi is not your average farmer. A mother of 10, she is from a tribal community and is illiterate. Yet, in the last four years or so, she has shown that will, determination and untiring efforts can bring cheering results. She has not only gained necessary agricultural skills, but is discovering herself as a decision maker. Today, she is enjoying the fruits of her labour.Drought and lack of farming knowledge did not deter Daasi or other tribal woman farmers from pursuing their goal. They did not quit their lands or migrate to cities in times of adversity. Facing hardships and challenges with equanimity, Daasi is today recognised as a super farmer at the district level. In the last six months, she has posted earnings of Rs 4.5 lakh; a remarkable achievement in the face of erratic monsoons and rising debts. Although her son helps her now, even today at the age of 60, she is out to monitor her crops or rear her sheep.I wake up at the crack of dawn and go to my small farm. I work till dusk and then return home. This has been my routine for several years, she says smilingly. Daasi grew tomatoes on half acre, chilli in two acres, long beans in half acre and green brinjal in another half acre. Now she is busy preparing for millets on two acres and vegetables on one acre. She has been recognised as a progressive farmer by the agriculture department and felicitated by many.Daasis journey was not smooth. She is part of a group of 60 Jenu Kurubas. She and her fellow tribals were living in Nagarahole forest and sustaining themselves by selling minor forest produce. She decided to move out when the state government offered a voluntary relocation package. Along with 60 other families, she left the national park in 2007.The forest department provided Daasi and others with a resettlement package of Rs 1 lakh per family that comprised Rs 1,000 in cash, a house and three acres of land. However, when she stepped out of the forest that had been her home all her life to a new area, life turned topsy turvy. She had lost her husband and had 10 young children to look after. Daasis knowledge about farming was a big zero.For about seven years, she and the others could do little on their farm as it was dry land. With no irrigation facilities, they started growing ragi but unfortunately elephants destroyed all the crops. Then they sowed cotton, which is dependent on rain. That was a gamble they had to take. The crop did not yield much but they managed to survive on free rations and working as farm labourers. Opportunity knocked in the form of contractors from Kerala when they hired lands of a few farmers for 10 months for ginger farming in exchange for providing power, borewell, motor and pipes. So, today, 10 out of 60 farmers have borewells.Although Daasi was not in favour of such a scheme, she says she benefited by getting water and has been growing a mix of millets and fruits-vegetables.All this did not come easy as they had no farm skills. In stepped Wildlife Conservation Society, India, to support these new farmers and teach them about farming and its practices, taking them to krishi and organic melas, helping them at every step to know how to grow different crops, adopt a mixed method and use less chemicals, help them to hire tractors and locate markets for their produce, etc. Arun Balamatti of JSS Krishi Vignana Kendra has played a big role in motivating and bringing awareness about mixed cropping and other farm practices. Availability of small carrier vans to transport their produce to nearby markets of Gundlupet, Mysuru and Kerala has helped.Sollepura Field assistant Govindappa has been actively involved in the resettlement project for the last 5 years. He is at the Samudaya office from 9am to 3 pm to provide all help.He says, Be it farm awareness programmes, sheep rearing, organic farming, getting tractors on hire or usage of manure, getting benefits under tribal welfare schemes, taking them for krishi melas, training at GKVK, Suttur, etc, it has been our endeavour to make the programme a success. We help them to get the best price for their produce in different markets. It is after the re-settlement that they need help as they have to start from scratch having never done any kind of farming earlier. Apart from this, tailoring, beauty classes, soap making, food preparation, and other training is imparted to them.It has been more than a decade and Daasi has seen many ups and downs but she has fought to achieve success and so advises farmers not to become disheartened due to failure of monsoon. She says, Just as we took help and learned the best methods to practise farming despite being forest dwellers, one should not quit ones land in times of adversity.The gutsy, diminutive lady says, We should learn to earn and eat, then sell the remaining. When we have got so much from the government in the form of schemes and help from NGOs, why shouldnt one strive and work hard?RELOCATIONIn 2007, 60 tribal families were relocated from Nagarhole National Park to Sollepura degraded reserve forests. Each family was allotted 3 acres of land, house and `1,000 cash. Out of 60 families, only 10 have borewells. Presently, 15 families have applied for borewell facilities.WCS SUPPORTWildlife Conservation Society, India, has been involved in motivating and supporting tribal families in various ways after the state forest department relocated them from Nagarhole. For the past 5 years, WCS field assistant Govindappa has been their mentor, adviser and facilitator in getting benefits from government schemes, growing and selling their farm produce, providing seeds, taking them to farm educational workshops and awareness programmes and imparting a host of other training activities.CHIA QUEENPrema, tribal farmer, has been experimenting with chia, a super food millet from South America. Receiving encouragement from JSS Krishi Vignana Kendra and Organic Krishi Kendra, she has grown 5 quintals of chia seeds in one acre and got Rs 16,000 per quintal.She says, It is so popular that organic retail outlets from Bengaluru have been coming to our doorsteps to buy the crop. It is direct marketing for me with no transportation charges. Out of 30 farmers who had adopted chia farming, only 6 tribals, including 52-year-old Prema succeeded. She used the transplantation technique to grow chia successfully.The super food is usually sown during September-October and does not need much water. Just like ragi, it needs the benefit of retreating monsoons. It takes 40 days for flowering and needs some 2-3 rounds of watering."

Consequently, their price has gone up.Gandhi Ganj, a major vegetable market where 120-140 licenced vendors sell vegetables, has been wearing a deserted look with customers avoiding buying vegetables. Compared to the last year, the prices of some of the vegetables have doubled affecting our business, said Warangal Venkanna, a retail vendor.The prices have skyrocketed even in the local market at Ankapur where vegetables are grown abundantly and supplied to other markets. One kilogram of locally-grown tomato costs Rs. 50 and you can imagine how much it would cost elsewhere, said Bojanna, a farmer at Ankapur.Green chilli is sold at Rs. 80 per kg, brinjal at Rs. 40 per kg, ridge gourd - Rs. 60-Rs. 80, ladies finger - Rs. 60, little finger Rs. 50, and bitter gourd at Rs. 60 per kg. The price of leafy vegetables has increased too.On normal days, two trucks loaded with green chilli used to come to the market every day from Nagpur, which has now reduced to only one truck. Also, vegetables in about four trucks from Maharashtra and Hyderabad used to arrive here, which has gone down to only two now.Carrots, which were sold earlier at Rs. 30 per kg, cost Rs. 50 now. Wholesale traders are no longer auctioning vegetables which the retailers used to buy, and are later selling them at whatever price they deem fit, said Venkanna, a vendor.The sowing area of vegetables in summer goes down by 70% due to water scarcity. As against the normal sowing area of 3,000 acres in the district, vegetables are cultivated in only 1,000 acres leading to abnormal price rise, said S. Narsing Das, District Horticulture Officer.New crop would only start arriving at the market after 20 to 30 days and till then, the prices of the vegetables would rise, he said.Carrots, which were sold earlier at Rs. 30 per kg, cost Rs. 50 now. Wholesale traders are no longer auctioning vegetables; they are selling at whatever price they deem fit.Venkanna,A vegetable vendor"

The tomato production took a sudden dip from April, with arrivals of stocks at just 200 metric tonnes or even below per day at Madanapalle market.While the first grade tomato is priced at 40 a kg at the wholesale market, the second grade is tagged at 20 a kg, which is selling at 30 in the open market. A big solace to consumers is that the price of onions continues to be between 20 and 30 since May first week.Coming to the other prime vegetables, the price of several varieties is causing concern to consumers. Ladies finger is sold at 50 to 60 a kg, while brinjal is sold at 60 a kg. Cabbage, beetroot, cauliflower, drumsticks and almost all varieties have witnessed sudden jump in their prices since a fortnight. The quality and size of the vegetables remains low. The reason of stunted levels in production is attributed to lack of moisture in soil and air.Ginger is commanding a price of 200 a kg, as against 80-100 in March.Greens affordableAnother big solace to consumers is that greens of various kinds are sold at cheaper rates compared to vegetables. Women are seen showing keen interest in adjusting with greens at their disposal at 5 to 10 per bunch.Rama Naidu, a farmer at Punganur, said that the summer had adversely impacted the economy of vegetable farming, with production hit by low yields and poor quality. It is felt that the condition would continue till June-end. Even if the arrival of monsoon is early, we have to wait for a fortnight to see signs of change in the fields, he said."

A kg of tomato was sold between Rs. 45-50 in the retail shops at Gandhi Market on Saturday. It was quoted between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 a kg in most of the grocery shops.In the wholesale market, it was quoted at Rs. 40 a kg. The price of tomato, one of the essential cooking items in households, ranged between Rs. 10 and Rs. 15 till a month ago.From Rs. 8 a kgThere were months when the price of tomato plummeted to Rs. 8 a kg in the retail market in the third quarter of 2018.The upward trend began during the last week of April. It went up to Rs. 30 a kg during the first week of May and further rose up to Rs. 40 in the second week. It is now quoted between Rs. 45 and Rs. 50 a kg.Traders attribute the price rise to a mismatch in supply and demand.As against the normal arrival of 20 loads of tomato a day, the Tiruchi market now receives just five loads, they said. I receive just one fourth of the requirement. Five traders share one load of tomato due to short supply. We could not meet the requirement of consumers. It has caused sharp increase in price, said M.K. Kamalakannan, president, Gandhi Market Traders Development Association."

The stunted size of the produce only worsened the situation for them.Contrastingly, in May 2018, the average arrival of stocks per day into the market stood at 1,600 tonnes, and the wholesale price of the first variety was Rs. 270 to Rs. 300 per box. The retail price of the second variety in various local markets across the district stood at Rs. 40 on Sunday. The juice variety, considered scrap in market parlance, was sold for Rs. 50 per 3 kg. The first variety is purely meant for exports to supermarkets and the hotel industry in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.DroughtThe prime reasons for the dismal state of affairs in Chittoor district is attributed to early summer this year, and failure of rains since last three years.Madanapalle division, known for its cooler climates (temperature used to hover over 35-37 Celsius till a few years ago), is experiencing scorching heat for the last three years with the mercury breaching the 39 C-mark.The division, where the crop is grown in an extent of about 10,000 hectares, has been witnessing deficit to absolutely no rainfall since 2016.Coming as an exception, the division saw rains in February and March in 2018, helping the tomato farmers to harvest bumper crops.However, drought condition has returned to the region this year.Tomato trade expert and former chairman of the Madanapalle tomato market Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said the prospects of farmers turned dismal this year.Usually, the trade picks up immediately after Sankranti. This year, rains have totally evaded the region. A small number of farmers could withstand the climatic stress. Compared to May last year, when 1,620 tonnes arrived, the arrivals this year slumped to just 200 tonnes, or even below, he said.Mr. Naidu observed that at least one spell of rain was direly needed, else the gloomy condition would escalate further in the coming months.The farmers are now totally depending on the monsoon, with most bore-wells going bone dry, he said."

Ibrahim, a wholesale trader, says that a box of fine quality tomatoes are auctioned anywhere between Rs. 500 and Rs. 550, which is later sold at a retail price of Rs. 600 to Rs. 700. Due to severe drought, farmers in Talavadi have stopped cultivating tomatoes. The market now gets tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The ongoing wedding season is one of the reasons for rise in price, as there is a huge demand for the vegetable, he says.Though the three-month crop needs normal watering, it cannot withstand severe heat. Hence there is drop in production. Earlier, about 10,000 boxes arrived at the wholesale market and it has now dropped to less than 4,000 boxes, says P.P.K. Palanisamy, president of the market. Price fluctuation is a major problem with tomatoes as it is sold at Rs. 1 per kg during peak season and at Rs. 80 per kg during summer, he adds.Traders say that the price will come down after three months, as farmers will take up cultivation of tomatoes only after monsoon sets in. Th retail price of tomato continues to remain between Rs. 45 and Rs. 50 per kg in the last one-and-a-half months and they expect it to increase further.P. Kuppusamy, a trader from Solar, says that since tomatoes cannot withstand heat and wastage is more, he has significantly reduced purchasing tomatoes in the past two months."

Mango production this year witnessed a slump by over 80%, with poor prospects for the labourers. Similarly, sugarcane crop, which gives succour to a large number of workers in two spells in a year, had gone dry in several areas. After the closure of the two cooperative sugar factories, sugarcane cultivation took a sudden dip in half of the district.The failure of rains since three and half years had its adverse impact on sugarcane fields, as the farmers either abandoned cultivation or shifted to other alternative crops. Workers found no patrons to activities such as sugarcane cutting and loading them into tractors meant for sugar factories. The cultivation is limited to below 20,000 hectares this year as against the usual two lakh hectares a decade ago.The slump in agriculture economy has also impacted the construction activity. Further, the depletion of groundwater table has forced many to postpone construction activities.With absolutely no work, a large number of daily workers have started depending on Bengaluru, Chennai and other cities in the neighboring States for work.The NREGA workers too have started showing interest in migrating to the neighboring States, particularly Karnataka. Several workers opined that the daily wage of Rs. 250, including the additional 30% wage for summer, was not a match to the minimum of Rs. 500 paid in cities like Bengaluru.For instance, from Kuppam railway station, a workforce of more than 5,000, of various skills, travel between Chennai and Bengaluru daily, depending on three express trains. The workers are from the mandals of Ramakuppam, Kuppam, Gudipla and Shantipuram of Kuppam Assembly constituency.District Water Management Authority (DWMA) project director Nagaraju told The Hindu that while there were more than 4 lakh NREGA job cardholders in Chittoor district, the regular workers at present were around 1.2 lakh."
2019-05-30,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/tomato-goes-dearer-as-supply-growing-area-decline-5755490/,"Pune: Tomato goes dearer as supply, growing area decline","The wholesale and retail prices of tomatoes have doubled across the state in the last 30 days, in a development which sellers attribute to a decline in the supply of the vegetable from major producing zones.AdvertisingTraders also felt this trend of price rise was likely to continue for the next few months.In the wholesale market of Junnar, the average traded price of tomatoes is currently Rs 20-25 per kg. Last month, it was priced at Rs 10-15 per kg. Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar taluka tomato growers association, said the price rise was mainly due to a dip in supply of the vegetable. There has also been a similar rise in price at retail markets. Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri market, stated that the vegetable was trading at Rs 40 per kg.Last month, tomatoes were sold at Rs 20 per kg, he said, adding the vegetable has seen the highest price escalation in the last month.AdvertisingA key reason for this rise in price is due to the dip in the total area for growing tomatoes. Against the targeted area of 44,000 hectares, Maharashtra had reported just 31,423.46 hectares for the year. The dip is more prominent in the case of the rabi tomato, which is grown mostly in Junnar taluka of Pune and some parts of Marathwada. Almost all tomato-growing areas in the state have reported a dip in acreage due to water scarcity. Also, the alarmingly low levels in dams have almost made it impossible to water the standing crop, leading to the price pressure. At Pimpris market, Salve said the market is now getting only 18-20 tonnes of tomato per day, as opposed to the norm of 40 tonnes daily.Bhise and other growers are awaiting the new crop of tomatoes  farmers in Nashik mostly grow the kharif crop which hits the market post August. The crop normally requires around Rs 1-1.5 lakh per acre as an investment in seed and other inputs. Growers normally sell their produce at an average price of Rs 10-15 per kg to book profit.However, last year, most growers including the ones from Junnar were compelled to sell their crop at Rs 5-6 per kg, resulting in losses for them. Most had blamed the stoppage of road trade via the Punjab border to Pakistan for the low prices."

Or watching a Pakistan game nibbling on Peshawari Fish Tikka? Or cheering for Sri Lanka eating Kandy Chicken?Laxmi Ratan Shukla, former cricketer and state minister for sports and youth services, came down to Eco Parks Cafe Ajante on the first day of the Cricket World Cup and inaugurated a food festival celebrating the spirit of the tournament.After Kapil Dev and M.S. Dhoni, we all want Virat Kohli to bring home the World Cup but the pressure at that stage is tremendous, said Shukla. This is not the IPL. Simply donning the India jersey is a huge responsibility. But I wish the team luck and am sure cricket fans will enjoy watching the games while eating the World Cup-themed food here.Also present was Debashis Sen, chairman cum managing director of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), who is offering a vent to all the fans who think they know just how India can win the Cup. Weve put up a big message board outside Cafe Ajante for you to write your advice, comments and suggestions for Kohlis men. Every time the board fills up we shall click it and send the picture to the official Team India email.Besides the message board, a selfie zone with a Virat Kohli statue has been installed outside Cafe Ajante, that itself is next to the Eiffel Tower replica. The food festival, however, is also on at Cafe Ekante, in the Eco Park island and at Biswa Bangla Gate.Biswa Bangla Gate, in fact, is doing the best, said Snehasis Sinha, general manager of the three outlets. Its going house full with or without big World Cup games. The best-selling item would be the Lancashire Grilled Prawn, that is grilled in olive oil with herbs. It costs Rs 446.The prawn dish is a tribute to England and similarly, the festival features food from other World Cup-playing nations. From Pakistan are delicacies like Mutton Chapli Kebab, a spicy, shallow-fried take on steak. From West Indies is Caribbean Jerk Chicken Salad, a spicy chicken dish with herbs like cumin, oregano, thyme and coriander.The Sri Lankan representative is Kandy Chicken (Rs 373), a coconut milk-based dish that uses tomato and kokum, a sour tamarind-like fruit. And for a sweet finish, try the Pavlova, a dessert from down under. This cake is meringue-based, meaning it is made of beaten egg-white. The dish is popular in both Australia and New Zealand, although we are adding sliced kiwis as garnish on top as a tribute to New Zealand, said Sinha.The festival will continue till the final match of the World Cup on July 14."

And cultivation in about 2.3 lakh hectares is likely to go down.Joint Director of Agriculture (Chittoor) Vijay Kumar said the deficit rain of minus 76 was alarming. We have asked farmers to wait till the third and fourth week of June for sowing. We have received 25,000 of the required 75,000 quintals of groundnut seeds for distribution. The price of seeds and subsidy is yet to be finalised, he said.Apart from seeds, he added, farmers would receive gypsum as well. We are going to encourage intercropping of red gram and millets this season along with the main crop of groundnut in 1.2 lakh hectares, Mr. Kumar said."

In this market, names of all vegetables are written in Sanskrit on tiny placards.The mundane Aloo or potato is known as 'Alookam' and tomato is 'raktphalam'. Bitter gourd or karela is known as ""karvelah' and carrots are 'gunjanakkam' while garlic is 'lashuman'. Onions are known as 'Palanduh' and ginger is 'adrakam'.Sonu, a vegetable seller, explained this unique experiment and said: ""We thought of popularising Sanskrit and though none of us is familiar with the language, we decided to go ahead. We got a local Sanskrit teacher to help us and when we put up the Sanskrit names of all vegetables, the customers were amused.""Slowly the customers are also learning the Sanskrit names of vegetables and some of them even ask for 'allookam' or 'raktphalam'. Some of the local shopkeepers, however, have termed the initiative as a publicity stunt.""The vegetable sellers themselves cannot understand or read or speak a word of Sanskrit but this is being done to get free publicity. It is not good for the market and we have decided to dissuade the practice which makes a mockery of Sanskrit,"" said Asharam Agarwal, a general merchant store owner.He said that the vegetable sellers had removed the placards when they found no takers. The vegetable sellers said that they had to remove the placards because vegetables need a constant sprinkling of water in this heat and the cards would get wet.Ravindra Sharma a regular buyer at the vegetable market, however, lauded the initiative and said: ""It is a great effort to popularise the language which is a part of our history. I have learnt the Sanskrit names of a few vegetables too."" The shopkeepers, however, do not insist on customers using Sanskrit to converse.""We do not know how to speak Sanskrit either and we are also learning the names of various vegetables and fruits right now,"" said Sonu and added, ""We know that 'Haritkani' are leaf vegetables, 'kandmulani' refers o root vegetables, 'shakvat' is a vegetable garden and 'shakras' is vegetable juice."

Wrong. A nice, satisfying dinner is all it takes to make one forget the experience, and that is exactly what we felt on Wednesday evening at SodaBottleOpenerWala on Lavelle Road.What better way to cool down than savour something that have mangoes in it? In addition to this, luckily for us, the restaurant was screening Indias first big game in this seasons World Cup tournament and we couldnt have asked for more.The Mango Pop-up menu looked colourful and utterly delicious (no, it wasnt Amul!) and since it is in place exclusively for summer, the King of Fruits held a prominent position in all the food items, including the cocktails/mocktails. We tried the Raw Mango & Berry LIIT, sans the alcohol, and the first sip made us feel relaxed on our seat. The flavour of raw mango with a little jaljeera masala stood out. The drink sat pretty on the table with three differently-coloured layers and a flower adorning it on top.Next, we aimed to try a little from each of the main-course dishes but ended up having more than 70 per cent portions. Its mango-flavoured and tasted absolutely delicious, we just couldnt resist! We had Raw Mango & Papaya Salad, with a tangy Kolah vinegar dressing topped with a lot of peanuts. Thinly sliced Keri  mango is called Keri in Parsi  and raw papaya along with nicely chopped tomatoes summed up for a very healthy yet tasty salad.The Keri Chicken is the star dish on the menu. A combination as beautiful as chicken and ripe mango is rare, and it was an eye-opener for our taste buds. The chicken is cooked in Parsi style, along with loads of ripe mangoes, and served with pav and Keri kachumbar salad. The strong flavour of mango was enough to keep us going till the last bite.The last one was Keri Kanda Par Eedu, which is a spicy mixture of onion and ripe mangoes, baked with an egg on top. Those love egg and mango will simply love this, though the flavour of mango here is not as strong as it was in the chicken. The poached egg gives a twist to the dish and when eaten with a pav, brings out the richness in it.Keeping an eye on the dessert section, we ordered all three from the mango menu and werent disappointed at all. The Mawa Sundae was just the perfect kind of summer dessert, with vanilla ice-cream topped with cubed mangoes, cream and fresh mango puree. We, of course, had it all. The Mango cheesecake was, likewise, a sweet dessert and needless to say, it was soft, flavourful and topped with chopped mangoes. To balance the sweetness, the menu had Keri nu Samosa, which is a thin, crispy pastry stuffed with mango mixture. Quite satisfied and removing the bad beginning to the evening from our memory, we bid goodbye.The mango Pop-Up menu is on till June 30 and cost for two is `1,500 (approx)."

Potted plants, ceramic-tiled tables, metal bistro chairs, little signboards marked with names of provinces in Italy such as Piazza Galuppi give a leisurely vibe to the cafe. The overall green colour scheme adds a distinct Mediterranean feel. The caf is structured vertically which gives it a street-side feel that has been additionally accentuated with faux European white windows and wooden house doors on the adjacent walls. Creepers on one of the walls and a bookshelf on the other make the ambience even quainter.The menu here is short and sweet- an All Day Breakfast section followed by soups, salads, appetisers and waffles for that essential sweet finish in case youre done for the day. Otherwise one can move on to sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, pastas and so on before settling in for the main course.We opted for the Saffron Flavoured Prawn Bisque (`395) along with Manhattan Crab Cakes (`395) and Butter Garlic Prawns (`395) from the appetisers and the food is served even before we could soak in the dcor and the intriguing faux mezzanine floor. The Prawn Bisque served with a slice of bread is the smoothest seafood soup weve ever tasted and we polish it off till the last drop. The Manhattan Crab Cakes garnished with micro-greens are a mouthful and absolutely delicious but the quantity is a dampener- too less. This would make for a perfect pre-drinking finger food item. Pity, the caf doesnt serve any liquor yet. The Butter Garlic Prawns are served with a side of lettuce, arugula, cherry tomatoes and olives. The prawns coupled with the sauce generously poured over them is a spicy explosion in our mouth, having us reach out to water quite often.From the mains, the Grilled Pork Chops (`575) arrive in just under 10 minutes and are flawless.The presentation and timing at the caf is spot on. The meat was well-cooked and served with Ratatouille, Mashed Potato and Kalamata Olive Tapenade. They could have done without the ratatouille (French stewed vegetables) but the succulent loin cut with the glaze of the restaurant-prepared sauce was finger licking-ly good. The last item of our meal was something we knew that wed feel guilty after ordering but couldnt resist it.The Brick n Bean Signature Pasta (spaghetti, bacon and mascarpone,`455) can easily be every non vegetarians comfort food. Creamy and indulgent, we struggled to finish this decadent dish but couldnt stop taking bite-after-bite of it which was drizzled with large amounts of bacon. Once again, they could have easily done without the bread but with our hearts and tummies full, we had little to complain. Will we return here? Si, si! Just as one does while strolling through sidewalks and settling in for that welcoming little table and indulgent food."
2019-06-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/fruit-production-triples-in-13-years-in-haryana-5776114/,Fruit production triples in 13 years in Haryana,"The area under horticulture has doubled in 13 years in Haryana while the production of fruits has gone up by three times in the same period. The production of vegetables too has more than doubled in the same period in the state.AdvertisingSeeking to give a boost to the horticulture activities, the state government has increased its budget for the sector for the 2019-20 fiscal year to Rs 523 crore, more than double of Rs 210 crore in 2014-15. The government is aiming to double the area under horticulture by 2030 while increasing the production to thrice that of the current figure.Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Om Prakash Dhankar told The Indian Express that they were working on multiple strategies to increase the production of fruits and vegetables with introduction of more excellence centres in horticulture sector and Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana (BBY) scheme for vegetables.Dhankar said that they were developing 340 horticulture villages and 140 clusters, which will offer all facilities to the farmers including facility to sell farm produce. Director General, Haryana Horticulture Department, Arjun Singh Saini said they have trained farmers for protected cultivation of vegetables and fruits in the state. Now, we will focus more on increase in production, said Saini.AdvertisingIn 2004-05, the area under horticulture was just 4.04 per cent of the total geographical area of the state. It increased to 8.17 per cent in 2017-18. The production of fruits was 7.93 lakh metric tonne in 2017, a major jump from 2.32 lakh metric tonne in 2004-05. The production of vegetables increased to 71.40 lakh metric tonne in 2017-18 compared to 29.80 lakh metric tonne 13 years back.In fact, the state government is keen on implementing the Beijing model to provide fruits, milk and vegetables to Delhi just like the Chinas capital that developed a peri-urban agriculture zone on its periphery. Dhankar, who had visited China in 2015 to study the Beijing model, believes that it was easier to provide fruits, vegetables and milk to Delhi from Haryana than to the far flung areas of the country. Dhankar has been stating that an annual turnover of Rs 3,600 crore takes place in the International Mandi of Delhi and the farmers of Haryana can reap its benefit by selling their produce there.Aiming to safeguard the interests of vegetable farmers, the Haryana government in 2018 had launched BBY as an MSP scheme for four crops  tomato, onion, potato and cabbage. The MSP in this case, unlike for other crops, is meant to cover only input costs and not provide any margin. By enabling farmers to recover basic production cost, the scheme intends to prevent them from throwing their produce on roads in the event of a price crash.Dhankar says that the scope of compensation for these vegetables will be increased by Re one each per kilogram. In case of potatoes and tomatoes, it will be increased to Rs 5 per kg while offering Rs 6 per kg for cabbage and onion. He said that in the first year of BBY, 10,579 acre land was covered under the scheme and 4,435 farmers were registered, who were compensated with about Rs 12 lakh. In the second year, 20,346 farmers had registered 66,250 acres and they were compensated with about Rs 9.40 crore. Under this scheme, provision of budget amounting to Rs 25 crore has been made for ongoing financial year."
2019-06-13,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/13/staple-experiments-1989572.html,Staple experiments,"Romaa Sharad ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Give me one ingredient and I can make 10 different dishes with it, says Chetna Sudhirkumar Shah. Called Chetna ben lovingly by friends and family, her love affair with food began when she was just nine years old. My mother told me to go out of the kitchen every time I wanted to cook, but I never listened to her, she says. The first dish she made was bhakri no ladvo, laddoos made with bhakri, a thick roti made of wheat, which is a Gujarati staple. The 58-year-old prepares it every Monday to remind herself of when her journey began.Her skills came in handy when her mother fell sick. There were 20 people in my family so the pre-preparation like chopping vegetables and soaking dal would already be done, after which I used to cook for all of them, adds the cook, who has been in the business of preparing traditional Gujarati food for almost 20 years now.However, she likes to take things up a notch. From tomato-flavoured dhoklas to chutneys made of kairi (raw mango) and doodhi (bottle gourd) peels, Chetna loves creating new dishes. I look at the ingredients I have and think of how I can combine all of them to create a new dish. I may not be educated, but I am very innovative when it comes to cooking, says the self-taught cook, who has the ability to create varieties of the same dish by changing a few core ingredients.In her take on the classic puran poli, a flatbread that is made with a dal, sugar and cardamom stuffing, Chetna stuffs the dough with a sweet potato masala or a mixture of peanuts and coconuts. She also prepares different varieties of buttermilk that include orange buttermilk, lemon buttermilk and onion buttermilk. Depending on the type of buttermilk you are making, add a small piece of orange, lemon or onion to the curd with other masalas and blend it before adding water. It is that simple, she shares.However, her not-so-simple twist on the traditional Gujarati snack, bhakarwadi, is one that makes jaws drop. I use hariboot (green garbanzo beans) to fill the bhakarwadis instead of a mixture of coconut, sesame seeds and poppy seeds, she says.When asked if she uses any secret ingredient in her recipes, she shakes her head furiously saying, I do not see what one could possibly do by keeping the ingredients a secret. If one possesses knowledge that can help another person grow, why not share it? Chetna keeps good thoughts in mind while cooking. Agar bhagwan nu naam laine rasoi kare, toh badi vastu sari bane (When you chant gods name while cooking, everything will turn out well), she says."

Karunanidhi inaugurated Tamil Nadus first uzhavar sandhai or farmers market. The concept, which was replicated across the State in 104 locations, continues to be widely successful in Madurai. This landmark in Anna Nagar draws at least 6,000 customers on weekends, claim farmers and officials of the Agriculture department.Agricultural Officer S. Suresh says that farmers arrive from Nayakkanpatti, Karadikkal, Melur and hilly areas like Mannavanur and Pallangi to sell a variety of vegetables here. Farmers leave at about 4.30 a.m. in buses and goods carriers from their respective villages to reach the market. Most of them have been with us for over 10 years. The essence of the place is unchanged, he says.Despite patronage from customers and sizeable endowments from the State government, MLAs and NGOs, facilities at the market could still get a face lift.At least 100 farmers sell their produce at the market on a weekend and between 75 and 80 during a weekday, says Mr. Suresh. However, the issue of inadequate toilets torments farmers. The market has only four toilets for men and three for women. They are in disrepair with their doors cracked and broken. The stench of urine permeates the air and there are hardly any lights.K. K. Kalyani, chairman of Kariapatti Farmers Producers Company, says, With a large number of farmers making their way to the market in the morning, there is a need for better toilet facilities. G. Valliamma, a vendor from Chekkanoorani who sells tomatoes, agrees. Mr. Kalyani says that it is particularly difficult for women to use the toilet in the morning as there is not enough lighting. These toilets, which were built 20 years ago, were last renovated 15 years back, says an official from the Agriculture department. No improvements have taken place so far, he confirms.Apart from the toilets, the ground surrounding the market, which has clay, becomes sludgy in the rain. When it rains, the market gets inundated. Customers find it difficult to walk through the sludge, says an employee.V. Murugan, another farmer, says that the place is in dire need of proper drinking water facility. Both customers and farmers face problems, particularly during summer.We shell out money to buy 10 water cans from private companies everyday, he says.Mr. Kalyani says that frequent power cuts add to the woes of farmers. We are unable to use the electronic weighing machines and instead use physical balance which maybe inaccurate, he says.A senior official from the Agriculture department says that they provide 60 weighing machines, along with 20 weighing scales as a back up, to farmers.It will be useful if more weighing machines are allocated, he says.Although no official proposal has been made to revamp the model, the market is being maintained with funds made available to the department each month, confirms the official. We hope the department makes this a model market, he says."

Papaya is a biennial crop, and affliction by PRSV is a commonly reported problem in South Karnataka. Thimakapura averred that the formulation he has come up with is non-toxic, and can help control the spread of virus in other crops such as beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, orchids among others.President of the University of Mysore Old Students Association, and director of the technical wing of Green Lifescience Technologies, Thimakapura was determined to come up with a remedy for PRSV, a pestilent menace that is found across the world.For Thimakapura, the greatest reward for his work has been the results that farmers have reported after using his formulation for the past two years. It has already been tested by farmers across India. This is besides many of the in-house trials that we have conducted, said the scientist What sets the formulation  Thimakapura has named it PowerPlus  apart is that it helps prevent the onslaught by the virus, and can help cure those plants blighted by it. Unaffected papaya plants in his plot growing beside those affected by PSRV, Thimakapura said, attested to the efficacy of his formulation. The virus has the potential to trigger an epidemic. As of now, there is no variety of papaya that is resistant to the virus, nor is there a foolproof mechanism that can help protect them from its threat. So, I hope that my product will serve as a boon for farmers, he said.Consequences of virus infectionStunted growth, and lack of fruit-breaking ability are two of the most disastrous consequences of affliction by the Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PSRV) in papaya plants. Fruits borne by plants infected by the virus often exhibit clear signs of the disease: These include a discernible change in its taste, bumps and characteristic ring-shaped spots on the skin. PSRV spreads through an insect vector at an exponential rate, and all it takes for an entire plot to grow infested is a small clutch of PSRV-blighted plants. Farmers dread it because it is impossible to contain its spread, Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura said."

Any guesses? Ask a Bengali and he/she will promptly tell you, Of course! Its the gondhoraj lebu (lime) thats missing!Over centuries, gondhoraj lebu has been a welcome guest in Bengali households and even today, it is considered as a dear relative of all types of dal and in some cases, fish and chicken curries cooked in the kitchen.Known to be a cousin of kaffir lime and having no such English word in the dictionary, gondhoraj keeps its head held high as the ultimate king of aromas, the essence of which can be felt even from a few metres away. Oh! Calcutta in Church Street is hosting the Gondhoraj Cocktail and Mocktail fest, and true to its spirit, we went Oh! Gondhoraj after the meal.To beat the heat, we were offered Gondhoraj Lychee Cooler, which was simply aromatic, fruity and soothing. The lime and its leaves did the magic of accentuating the magical aroma and lychees in the drink put in more flavour, turning the mocktail into an absolute delight. My dining companion had the Gondhoraj Lychee Caipiroshka, a vodka-based cocktail infused with flavours of the East. The vodka-mixed lychees gathered at the bottom of the glass gave a nice kick to the start of a sumptuous Bengali dinner ahead.Oh! Calcuttas fortnight-long summer food festival, Grishher Khabar, includes innovative yet traditional recipes, keeping in mind the ingredients that are essential to the summer cuisine. For starters, we had Sosha Diye Bhapa Maach, which is steamed boneless fish with cucumber and mustard. Soft bhetki fish topped with slices of cucumber melted in our mouth, with the right amount of spices and mustard that left our Bengali taste buds wanting some more.Coming to the course that is fit for a king, we were served rice along with Jhinge Pabda Aam Jhol, Lau Chingri, Doi Moricher Mangsho, Kancha Aam Diye Maacher Paturi and Enchorer Dalna. Only a Bong will understand the feeling of maa er haater ranna, (moms cooking), especially when he/she is living outside Bengal, and the main course reminded us of just that.The Jhinge Pabda dish, which is butterfish cooked with green mango and ridge gourd, is known for its amazing health benefits. Although the fish was not too fresh, the flavour came out really well, as anything that has hints of raw mango gives a tantalising taste to it.Lau Chingri, or bottle gourd cooked with prawns, is again a common dish prepared back home. With the right amount of ginger, tempered with dry red chillies and cumin, we loved this dish with rice.Chicken or mutton, when cooked with yoghurt, gives a creamy scrumptious flavour to the meat, and Doi Moricher Mangsho was no exception. The mutton, stewed in a clay pot, was cooked with yoghurt and black pepper and its richness got to us quite well.The Maacher Paturi, which is steamed fish marinated with mustard paste and wrapped in banana leaf, was marinated with green mango and stood out as our favourite. It was as soft as it could get, and the spices helped amp up the flavour. The jackfruit cooked in onion and tomato gravy (Enchorer Dalna) was wholesome, which we relished till the end of the course.Lastly, we ordered Nolen Gurer ice-cream, which is date palm jaggery added to the dessert, and ended our dinner on a sweet note. The summer food festival is on till June 25 and cost for two is Rs 1,700 (approx)."

The woman, serving a life-term for killing her husband, is one of five to be shifted from a closed prison to Indias first semi-open one for women at Delhis Tihar Jail a few months ago. And like her, many women are recalling things they had long forgotten behind bars.AdvertisingThe semi-open prison for women is being inaugurated on June 20, Tihar Jail Director General Ajay Kashyap told The Indian Express. We did a soft-launch last October and five female inmates have been lodged there since. On Friday, I directed that five more women inmates be lodged there, after I interviewed them and evaluated the recommendations of the Selection Committee, he said. Of the five women set to join, three have been sentenced for murder and two for dowry deaths.The premises are a four-minute drive from Jail No. 6 where, as of Monday, 375 women inmates are lodged. Located near the residential buildings of Tihar Jail personnel inside the main complex, it is a duplex surrounded by a tiny garden, with tomatoes and chillies growing on a patch of land. On the first floor is a work station, where the five women make sewiyan. Upstairs is their dormitory, comprising 10 wooden beds and thick mattresses, two coolers, a television set, a new refrigerator and an open kitchen.They all work in the jail complex and get paid for it, and use the money to buy supplies. They do their own budgeting, decide what they want to eat, when and where we dont interfere at all, said Sarita Sabharwal, the womens jail superintendent.AdvertisingSemi-open and open prisons for men have been functioning at Tihar Jail for a while now. In open prisons, inmates can go around the city to work, meet their family, and then return. The selection criteria is that inmates should have spent two years in semi-open prisons, and have an exemplary record. Female inmates will be applicable for this in two years, said Kashyap.Sabharwal said that the female inmates selected to occupy the semi-open jails have to submit Rs 10,000 as security. Their families are more than happy to do that, she said.Preparing tea, a 50-year-old inmate said: We dont miss anyone at the closed prison. We wake up and do yoga, water the plants, clean the house, decide the menu and cook, before starting work so we can earn. The group requests Sabharwal for a mixer grinder, and tells her their Monday menu  porridge for breakfast, ladyfinger and lentils for lunch, and arbi for dinner.Sabharwal said that at least two female inmates refused to shift to the semi-open jail even after they were selected because they said theyll miss their friends at the closed jail.Unlike closed prisons where inmates dont have access to cash, inmates at semi-open prisons are allowed to keep Rs 1,000 each. I had forgotten what money looked like, its texture and smell now I remember. This shift is training us for life outside, you see. I am re-learning how to maintain a house, said the woman.Kashyap said the criteria for selection for semi-open prisons, as per the Delhi Prison Rules 2018, is that the convict should have completed at least two-third of her total punishment in a closed jail, including remission; she should have maintained excellent conduct inside the prison and performed labour, if allotted to her, with devotion.Apart from this, nothing adverse should have been noticed during the inmates parole or furlough; and there should be no pending cases against her. After Sabharwal recommends inmates on the basis of their record, the Selection Committee forwards a list to Kashyap, who then interviews them.I try to understand their resolve, aspirations, future plans, when they will leave, and take a call. Foreign nationals who are convicts, members of organised crime groups and terrorists are not applicable basically people with a high flight risk, said Kashyap."

The inflation rate is at 5.46% for vegetables, 1.24% for cereals and products , 8.01% for health products, and 8.12% for meat and fish. Core CPI declined to a 22-month low of 4.21% in May. According to an SBI note, going forward, core CPI will go down and the headline CPI will increase, leading to convergence in coming months. June CPI inflation is tracking 3.2% on elevated vegetable inflation. High real lending rates continue to hurt growth, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a note.HEADLINE, CORE INFLATIONSimply put, inflation is the rise in prices of all goods and services you consume. Headline inflation considers the overall inflation in the economy. It factors essential goods. Core inflation, on the other hand, ignores the food and fuel components, which are extremely volatile in nature.It reflects the underlying inflation trend by focusing on services such as transportation. If there is a downward movement in core inflation, it indicates that overall inflation is likely to come down. If there is an upward movement in headline inflation, global crude oil prices will be keenly watched.THE IMPACTIn Mumbai, the prices of tomatoes and other vegetables were up in May. If the prices of vegetable and fruits go up further, you will see the impact on headline inflation and your daily expenses. Price rise in essential goods over a long period hits those in lower income groups the hardest. However, the current CPI numbers are at the target level.The CPI inflation, as in the previous months has remained comfortably within the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) target level of 4% for about 10 months now. We expect FY20 CPI to average at 3.5%, said SBI in a note.First Published: Jun 17, 2019 10:43 IST"

The Konkan variety of jamun from Goa and northern parts of Maharashtra, which reached the soil of Madanapalle, said to be one and half a decade ago, has come to bolster the happy moments among the health-conscious public, not only in Chittoor district, but also elsewhere in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.Limited pockets in Madanapalle region towards Karnataka border produce about 300 tonnes of this hybrid variety jamun in about one hundred hectares, between May and August. Interestingly, this breed has proven to be more agile in Madanapalle region ever since its inception than in the region of its innovation. A decade ago, this fruit found its way into the busy markets all the way from Maharashtra in limited quantity. Now, its available aplenty everywhere in Chittoor district.Priced at 130 to 150 a kg, the jamun sells like hot cakes thanks to the growing incidence of diabetes. As and when a diabetic sees these alluring and gleaming fruit on pushcarts, they would not simply resist the temptation.Harvested fruit from the small plantations would reach the fruit mundies (trading centres) at Tirupati, Chittoor and Madanapalle, and in turn would spread all over the district. A limited quantum would reach Chennai and Bengaluru, where the price would zoom close to 200-250 a kg. This difference in price is attributed to transportation costs and poor shelf life of the fruit.During the last five years, the Forest Department has embarked on supplying the jamun saplings to the farmers meant to be raised along field borders and to empower farmers with additional income, though the prime objective is to increase the green cover. Compared to eastern parts of Chittoor, the Madanapalle belt proved to be a bumper hit.AP Micro Irrigation Project Director Y. Vidya Shankar, also a horticulture expert, said that the Konkan breed jamun has come to stay in Chittoor, bringing high yields to the farmers. The price of the fruit is costly, because of the harvesting of fruit is very expensive. The tender fruit would get instantly damaged the moment it touches the ground. Scientifically, its also proved that the jamun has wonderful medicinal faculties in diabetic care and also for kidney ailments, he said.The official said that due to the short life of the fruit after harvesting, the farmers are forced to dispose the stocks immediately, which otherwise would fetch them even more profits.Meanwhile, the jamun also has its negative impact on the diabetic care. Undoubtedly, it is widely accepted as a miracle fruit for diabetics. But, there is a danger that it might build up overconfidence among the patients, particularly those with high blood sugar levels.Senior medical officer and a diabetes specialist P. Ravi Raju clarified that the jamun fruit has the power to reduce the blood sugar levels only negligibly, say at the maximum 10 mgdl."
2019-06-19,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/19/do-you-know-to-eat-1992039.html,Do you know to eat?,"KV Navya ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: You can make more of the food you eat simply by thoroughly chewing it. Wondering how? Our obsession with what we eat has taken over some of the most important aspects of healthy eating. CE spoke to Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician with the Tamil Nadu Government Multi-Specialty Hospital on how to eat your food. You need to chew every bite of your meal in order to nourish your body. Only then the nutrients get digested, absorbed and utilised by the system for nourishment. Chewing synchronises with the release of several digestive enzymes. Skipping this step means inadequate digestion thereby leading to inadequate nutrient absorption. The simple act of chewing can reduce your calorie intake. It works by increasing the satisfaction you get from meals. Eating quickly may not give the intricate hormonal (Leptin) cross-talk system enough time to work effectively towards satiety. Eating quickly is associated with a higher body mass index (BMI). Chewing insufficiency is also associated with increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome. Blood glucose control or glycemic control is dependent on chew count. This simple lifestyle modification of thorough mastication can be a preventive measure against diabetes in people with a strong family history and other risk factors for diabetes who have not yet developed diabetes or are pre-diabetes. The lower the glycemic index and load of the meal, the higher the chew count. The glycemic index of a meal will vary depending on whether the food is coarsely ground, roasted, fried or finely ground. For example, if ragi is consumed in the form of porridge, one takes lesser time to chew and if it is prepared as adai/dosai the chew count is more, making it a healthier option. We spend more time chewing fibre-rich food. For example, between rice and chapati we spend more time on chewing chapati. As per National Institute of Nutrition, at least 20 grams of fibre (inclusive of soluble and insoluble) must be added per 1,000 calories consumed (by a healthy individual). Per day, it is recommended to take five whole servings or a handful each of fruit, vegetable, greens and whole grams. Even onion and tomato which are added into sambar or curry count as vegetables. In a plate, quarter of it must be whole grain cereal and the remaining must consist whole grams/pulses, vegetables and greens. In one of the studies we did, we controlled water intake to 200 ml within the meal. We observed that there was a dip of 25-30 milligrams in postprandial or post meal blood sugar. So, limit the intake of water during the meals. If one has a strong family history of diabetes or obesity, always prefer having fruit in between meals and never along with the meal. If you are a diabetic, never replace your meal with a fruit. For dinner, only eat until you are 50-75 per cent full, so that there is enough time for digestion. Eat at least two hours before you sleep.For all health queries, write to healthexpresschn@gmail.com"

Brinjal and ladies finger are sold at 60 a kg. Homemakers are shocked at the prices of coriander leaves and ginger which are commanding 50 a bundle (as against 20 last week), and 250 a kg (as against 160 last week). The price of green chilli has doubled at 200 a kg.To make things worse, the price of garlic has also shown an increase this week, selling at 150 a kg (fine variety) as against 100.Going by the present market trend, the catering dynamics have changed phenomenally at not only star hotels in Tirupati and Nellore, but also with all the catering units attached to marriage halls.At a star hotel in Tirupati, the cost of a single plate has been hiked from 450 to 525. The middle class families performing the betrothal and marriage functions are forced to cut down the quantum of vegetables in cooking and serving to the guests.Strange, we are cooking as per the dictates of our customers. Cutting down the quantum of vegetables will result in poor taste of stuff such as sambhar, kurma and vegetable rice and curries. We are helpless, though we know the guests would feel it bad as they search for vegetables in their plates, Mani, an experienced hand in catering business in Chittoor said.Villain of the pieceAdding that one particular thing  coriander leaves  is playing the villain. It has the capacity to supplant any defect in catering, but our customers are not listening to us.Apart from functions, the hotel industry is dampening the mood of customers, by cutting down the quantity of vegetables in the servings. Instead of two or three curries, the serving is limited to one in most restaurants.Homemakers complain that though they took a hard decision to adjust things with the greens twice a week, they were disappointed as greens too had jumped their price tag of last week. Some vendors are dishonestly splitting a bundle of greens into two to make a fast buck."

On Thursday evening, the elephants were sighted close to a water body at a gorge in the Somala forest, close to Pedda Upparapalle village.Ever since the jumbo trio left the sanctuary and on the rampage along the forest fringe villages, fear grips hundreds of farmers in both Madanapalle and Punganur ranges. Taking shelter in the forests in the morning, the elephants are raiding crops when the sun goes down, according to the forest officials.Forest Range Officer (Punganur) P. Govindarajan told The Hindu that at present, the elephants were just ten km away from the sanctuary. We are doing everything possible to drive the elephants in the direction of the sanctuary. In a couple of days, the wild animals are expected to cross into Keelapatla beat and re-enter the sanctuary, he said.Pat for villagersThe official said that the farmers were very cooperative to the department, by staying away from creating panic among the herd. In spite of the crop losses, the farmers are remaining clam. The department has assured them of crop compensation suitably, he said.Meanwhile, some villagers, mostly youth, are keeping night vigils , beating drums and firing crackers to prevent the wild elephants from entering the human habitations at Pedda Upparapalle village of Somala mandal in the range."

But if you are MasterChef Australia contestant Sandeep Pandit, thats exactly what youd do. With ancestral roots in Kashmir, this Bengaluru boy wowed the judges with his preparation of lemon rice, lemon pepper chicken and raita, much to the delight of south Indians. Who knew that the classic lemon rice would earn him the perfect score (30/30) and an immunity pin.Taste of two statesSandeeps difficult childhood had a big role to play in his cooking. He was forced to move from Kashmir to Bengaluru in 1990. Sandeep says his childhood ended abruptly when he turned nine. We migrated from Kashmir to Jammu at the peak of militancy in early 1990. My mother was employed with HMT and was given a job at Bengaluru. My parents, my sister and I went to Bengaluru and the rest of the extended family stayed at Jammu.I still remember that truck journey and watching the last of the melting snow as we were going away, leaving the mountain passes of Kashmir. It was a rough phase, with no money, very limited resources but a strong will to survive. We were encouraged to remember our Kashmiri roots and language, and were also asked to respect the local south Indian culture, he shares. What started as a necessary chore to help his mother at the age of nine, turned into his happy place.Sandeep has featured both Kashmiri and south Indian dishes on MasterChef. He prepared a Kashmiri thali during his auditions. Kashmiri cooking has different nuances, depending upon the communities in Kashmir. The uniqueness of the Kashmiri Pandit communitys food is the absence of onions, garlic or tomatoes in the dishes. As surprising as it may sound, even the meat dishes do not have onions, garlic or tomatoes. For example, the traditional rogan josh is made with a blend of spices, curd etc.The other unique aspects are the garam masala  which is cumin based  and the fact, that we do not traditionally use coriander seeds (powder) in our spice blend; fennel seeds powder (saunf) are used instead. This gives the dishes an additional aniseed flavour dimension and makes it unique, he says.But trolls have slammed Sandeep saying that he cooks only curry. The man of the moment, however, is unperturbed by such criticism. His focus to showcase the versatility of Indian cooking, which he understood when he had his first idli-sambar in Bengaluru, is unwavered. Everyone has the right to criticise. Our cuisine is too broad and complex to be subjected to one word  curry. I am trying to cook on the basis of the brief given to us. I am just fortunate that my motherlands cuisine is so versatile that in most of the briefs I can create a dish from the Indian cuisine, he says.One with his artFor Sandeep, cooking is spiritual. His eyes welled up and he folded his hands when his lachcha paratha won over celebrity chef Rick Stein. My family has always taught us to respect food (Ma Annapurna). Food, to me, is not just nourishment, its spiritual. I have always been a fan of Rick Stein and have watched most of his shows. Stein came to my bench and lovingly tasted the food. I was moved by the joy on his face, as he watched me cook Indian cuisine with an Italian Mystery Box.When they selected me for the tasting, I saw that joy again on the faces of the judges and Rick Stein. I was moved to tears. That entire experience had a spiritual notion to it, because I had just created something taught by my mother to give happiness to another person, and in this case, someone I revered as a Guru, he shares.From not having a fridge at home to cooking with the choicest ingredients in the MasterChef kitchen, life has come a full circle for Sandeep. He wishes to be associated with food, through cooking or any other engagement. The world is my oyster now.Follow Sandep on Instagram: @sandeep_cooksKeeping in touch with foodFrom not having a fridge at home to cooking with the choicest ingredients in the MasterChef kitchen, life has come a full circle for Sandeep.

These are probably the words that come to your mind to describe Kashmiri cuisine. It was evident from the interior decor at Navaratna restaurant in Le Royal Meridien to the delicacies they served. Small portions of Kashmiri spices are on display. Cushion chairs, copper cutlery and paintings of sceneries in Kashmir make us feel cosy and comfortable.Chef ShivaMeat expectationsWe start our meal with nadur monji  a starter made of lotus stem and rice flour. The lotus stem is ground along with flour and spices into a coarse mixture and made into a tikki. While we let the flavours burst in our mouth, we are served juicy cubes of paneer tandoor marinated. The appetisers are served with a dip made of caramelised onions and raddish.Chef Shiva, the brain behind this menu, tells us, Earlier, I worked in New Delhi. My familiarity with north Indian cuisine got better when I decided to visit Kashmir two years back. The Valley is known for its home-style cooking. The neighbours were amiable and let me inside their houses to get a glimpse of their native practices. Ive picked a few of my favourites.Touch of nativityAfter a brief pause, were served breads accompanied with ghushtab  minced ball curry with mild flavours. The base of the curry is tomato and Kashmiri red chilli. The chilli is roasted, boiled and blanched to lessen the spice and add colour to the gravy. The second important ingredient is saffron. Its roasted, boiled, filtered and the liquid is added to induce the scent. Saffron and Kashmiri red chilli form the essence of authentic Kashmiri cuisine.Lamb and chicken are the common preference in the hills. People grind their ingredients in traditional equipment and store them for months. It doesnt get spoilt because of the temperature. All it requires is marinating the meat with pepper and salt and grilling it in a tandoor. Longer the process, better the taste, shares Shiva.Bringing a sweet closure to this flavourful meal is phirni. With a moderate consistency and sweetness, a final coating of saffron made it visually appealing and gave it a traditional wrap.The Kashmiri festival at Navaratna will conclude on June 30."

Not only do they create their own compost, but they also use it to maintain lush gardens, thick groves of trees and several vegetable patches which deliver a sizeable harvest every Friday, of three types of vegetables and one fruit, enough to be distributed across 65 houses.There are enough vegetablesgrown to distribute across 65houses | ExpressWith no Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike support in clearing garbage, residents of Good Earth Malhar Footprints, decided in 2017 that they needed a better solution to deal with their waste. We tied up with Hasiru Dala, a private waste management company, for our dry waste. There was still a lot of waste that could be composted and we decided to do it ourselves,  says Ashwini Ram Bhagwat, a resident of the community, who traces her roots to Nittur.The residents then decided to buy a shredder, which cost them around Rs 75,000 and started shredding leaves and other garden waste before putting them in compost pits.We created three pits within the premises. While two were reserved for leaf composting, one pit was dedicated to vermicomposting, Ashwini explains. More than a year later, the community now gets around 3 tonnes of compost from the vermicompost pit and around 600 to 700 kilograms of compost from each batch of leaves they put into the other two pits. We get up to 10-12 batches per year, Ashwini says.Additionally, another method, called Shivansh, which uses cow dung, is also used by the residents to deal with raw materials which are high in fibre content or large tree branches.Most of the compost generated is used within the premises, making the soil fertile and ensuring that all plant life thrives. We also create fertilizers like Panchagavya or Jeevamrutha, Ashwini explains.Every Friday, volunteers meet up at the vegetable gardens or trees across the 7 acres of land for the weeks harvest. We mostly grow leafy vegetables, tomatoes, chilly, carrots, radish and fruits. They are all organic and after the harvest, we distribute the same for free among the 65 houses, explained Alphonse James, another volunteer. It is a collective effort and we enjoy sharing, she adds with a touch of pride.According to Shankar Bhat, Secretary of the Good Earth Malhar Footprints Owners Association, composting in such large quantities does not lead to an overpowering stench, as most people tend to believe. We use cow dung, water, worms and eggshells to aid the composting but we have had no issues with smell, he says.Each house also composts its own wet waste individually and uses it for their own gardens. We also have various fruit-bearing trees and residents get jackfruits, blueberries, coconuts, water apples and gooseberries delivered to their doorstep every time we harvest, Bhat says."

Owing to short supply, coriander leaves costs 70 a bunch even in the wholesale market.An entire bunch of coriander usually costs not more than 20. But when I handed over 10, the shopkeeper gave me exactly three stalks, said Chandramathi, a resident of Banashankari.Other vegetables too have become expensive, more so beans and brinjal. A kilogram of beans costs in the range of 90 to 120, and brinjal 100 to 110 per kg. Most of the gourds too are trading at the higher end.The only saving grace has been the relatively low prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes  staple items in most homes. However, garlic, another widely consumed vegetable, has also turned dear at 130/kilo. In the case of lemons, each one costs 5 to 8.Though the monsoon has set in in the State, farmers are yet to take to sowing. The rains that the State is receiving now will take another month or so to have an impact, said G. Srinivasan, member, HOPCOMS.A punishing summer, high temperatures and a severe drought over the past three months have caused stress on the production of vegetables and greens.Most borewells have dried up. Water scarcity is so acute that most farmers have been watering the farms with tanker water. This has only shot up the input cost, said G. Muniswamy Gowda, a vegetable farmer in Devanahalli.Also what has hit vegetable supply in the city is the drought in Tamil Nadu.We get a bulk of the coriander from the Hosur region. We also get Lady Fingers and other vegetables from Tamil Nadu, which is reeling under water shortage, cutting off most supply and pushing the prices upwards, said a senior procurement official from a prominent retail chain in the city.But there is hope. The onset of monsoon and the upcoming Ashaada month, considered inauspicious for holding any programme, is expected to bring down prices over the next three weeks."

Nizamuddin, who has been working for almost a year now, has almost saved around Rs 36,000.Doctors at the mental hospital had diagnosed the 32-year-old with psychosis after police had found him wandering on the streets. Pictures taken at the time show he was heavily bearded with several strings of beads strung around his neck, while medical records had labelled him as abusive, aggressive and non-cooperative. Counsellors think he might be from West Bengal or Bangladesh.AdvertisingWhen medications calmed him down, we asked if he was interested in farming, Shubham Tandekar, who monitors patients on field, tells The Indian Express. Farming seemed to come easy to him. In fact, counsellors found that his family was engaged in rice cultivation. Soon, Nizamuddin started  first with digging holes, and then sowing and watering plants.I feel like spending the entire day here. This work makes me feel productive, Nizamuddin says.According to hospital superintendent Dr Madhuri Thorat, while medication helps calm a patient, it is the scope of employment or a productive life beyond the hospital walls that keeps them motivated.In 2016, along with Tata Trusts, the hospital decided to explore farming as a part of skill training after it realised most patients were from a rural background. Expert agricultural institutions helped with the training and an automated watering system was introduced.Farming was identified as a viable source of employment and income generation, primarily because being out in the open, in the midst of nature, has an therapeutic effect, Tasneem Raja, who leads mental health at Tata Trusts, says.Working away from others, Pankaj Lambsonge, another patient, is focused on plucking weeds. He thinks he is four years old, his medical record says the 30-year-old is schizophrenic. His father and brother, also schizophrenic, had run away from their house.Admitted in March 2019, after he had set a neighbours house on fire in Yavatmal, Lambsonges file states he poses risk of harm to others and himself. But on the field, in his blue uniform, he quietly goes about trimming leaves and weeding. He works well, with keen interest, Tandekar says.Lambsonge says he feels light while working. I like the sun. In the ward, my body gets stiff doing nothing.The banana plantation is spread on seven acres in the 52-acre hospital property, while papaya is grown on one acre and vegetables, like coriander, brinjal and fenugreek, on the remaining land. Last year, the hospital sold 2,795-kg vegetables cultivated on its land for Rs 1.32 lakh, and 1,476-kg bananas for Rs 1.21 lakh.Dr Sadhana Tayade, joint director of Maharashtra Public Health Department, says a plan to deposit 30 per cent of profits in patients accounts is underway.Across four mental hospitals in Maharashtra, which house 3,050 mentally ill patients, usually occupational therapy is limited to indoor activities like yoga, singing, jewellery-making, stitching and embroidery work. In 2017, the new Mental Healthcare Act made rehabilitation a major component in management of mentally ill patients. Farming, officials say, is a step in that direction.Lakshmi Narasimhan, attached with NGO The Banyan which works to rehabilitate such patients, says in India, most mental institutions have vocational training, but access for patients remains low at 10-15 per cent. What is important for mentally ill patients is to keep them involved in some activity, like file-keeping, house-keeping work or handicrafts. If they get training for a job that translates into income, rehabilitation gets better, she adds.Tata Trusts Tasneem Raja believes with agriculture training, rate of frequent re-admissions for a mentally ill patient will slowly decline. We are in process of measuring this data.AdvertisingMost patients admitted in Maharashtra mental hospitals live there for over 10 years with no family to go to and zero employment source. Psychosis patient Ganesh Misar (42), admitted since June this year, knows this and expresses worry over his permanent hospitalisation. This is his third admission. He suffers from hallucinations, insomnia, often mutters to himself and even pelts stones, says his report. My family may abandon me if I keep getting angry. That is why I come here on field every day. The soil soothes me, Misar, a cotton farmer, says. As he walks past the tomato plantation at Nagpur Regional Mental Hospital, he says, the anger in him subsides while at work. Soon Ill return home to look after my fields during monsoon."
2019-06-27,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/drought-teaches-people-the-value-of-water/article28190615.ece,Drought teaches people the value of water,"Twelve years ago, I asked the then Agriculture Secretary of Tamil Nadu whether his department was undertaking any programme to promote the concept of water conservation without compromising on yield. I had just returned from the U.S. where I had seen people conserve water in different ways. I told the officer that in Minnesota, the place of origin of the Mississippi river, farmers were taking to sprinkler irrigation in a big way.The officer clearly did not like my question, nor did he like the U.S. example. He curtly replied that his department was doing everything it could. The implication was that he did not need a lecture on water conservation.The officers attitude was not an isolated case. Around the same time, I went to Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district in Tamil Nadu and asked a relative whether he would be receptive to the idea of water conservation, even while maintaining the same level of yield. The relative, a post-graduate and a resourceful farmer, shrugged off the question. We are used to utilising water in a particular way, whether there is enough water in the Cauvery or not. This is how society has been treating water for thousands of years, he replied. Would people be willing to change their ways even after experiencing droughts and trying times, I wondered.Thankfully, changes do happen. Over the last couple of weeks, I have been in touch with farmers from different regions in Tamil Nadu. The State is now facing a severe water crisis. I broached the subject of water conservation with them, just like I did with the State Agriculture Secretary and my relative more than a decade ago.I was in for a pleasant surprise with the relative. The tables had turned. This time he gave me a lecture on how to save water while raising paddy. He is an avid practitioner of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a method of cultivation involving less water and seeds. The spell of drought that the Cauvery delta had faced seven years ago had convinced him of the idea of using water efficiently. He realised that he could no longer rely on the traditional practice of using more water than what was required.R. Muthukumar, a young farmer of Tiruvannamalai district, which is not known to be a water surplus area, said he could not spot anyone who was interested in concepts such as SRI six or seven years ago, despite the groundwater in their lands going down steeply. But this has changed, he said. Now the people in his village are interested in knowing about the various ways in which water can be conserved. Drought teaches people the value of water.Micro-irrigation is gaining currency in several parts of Tamil Nadu due to a host of factors including the support from the State government. Sugarcane, banana, coconut, and vegetables like brinjal and tomato are being raised through this method. Drip irrigation for sugarcane is becoming popular in many parts of the State.This is not to say that the problem has been solved. There continues to be enormous scope for efficient utilisation of water. But in a moment of crisis such as this, the silver lining is that no one now, whether a farmer or an officer, scoffs at the idea of water conservation.People are waking up to reality now, and hopefully its not too late."
2019-06-28,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-many-chillies-can-you-name-join-kunal-vijayakar-on-a-spicy-trail/story-P2z4JuJwrnvuS6ajwo0ICM.html,How many chillies can you name? Join Kunal Vijayakar on a spicy trail,"Very often in life, the effects of small things prove to be inversely proportional to their size. I dont mean to get mysterious or philosophical. But take for example the chilli. I often gawk in awe at this tender, slender little fruit, and marvel at its huge gustatory impact on food.When it comes to Indian food, there is hardly any cuisine that doesnt use chilli or at least chilli powder. Could you imagine cooking without fresh green chillies? I dont think so. We have so embraced their flavour and piquancy, that weve quite forgotten that they are not native to India. Until 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed here, India used no chilli in its food. I cannot imagine what pizza without capsicum tasted like in the Vedic period oops, just kidding.There are now many different varieties grown in India. All chillies contain a biologically active ingredient called capsaicin, which is the cause of their heat and which stimulates the palate and increases our blood circulation. Thats why some believe that chillies are good for low blood pressure, the heart and our respiratory system.Chillies also make you sweat, which in turn has a cooling effect, which is why they are so popular in tropical regions like ours. That seems a bit warped to me; I hate to sweat. But Im guessing its true. Each type of chilli has its own profile and heat level, and while some are used for heat, others are used for their complexity of flavour.Green chillies are unripe or fresh, hot if eaten with the seeds, and are used for their acidity and raw grassy flavour. I love slitting a long green chilli and adding it to scrambled eggs. It adds dimension and elevates the flavour of the creamy eggs. Chopped green chillies ground to a paste with coriander and mint is a chutney that can be used as a marinade, a base or just by itself.When tempered with ginger, garlic, onion, tomato and masalas, the same chutney makes a great green chicken or mutton curry. A simple green chilli paste is a key ingredient in most Mughlai cooking. It makes the flavours more complex. I cannot imagine a Qorma or Biryani without green chilli paste. When you add salt and lemon to green chilli paste, it can be stored and used in many vegetarian dishes, like Vatana na Ghughra, Khatta Dhokla and Doodhi Muthia.We Indians also use a large variety of dried red chillies. In fact, there are different ones, used differently, in different parts of the country.The Reshampatti from Gujarat are short, broad and dark red. They are medium in pungency and used in powdered form or stuffed as pickles. They add a vibrant red colour to food.The Kashmiri Chilli is known to everyone for its flaming colour and for being non-spicy. Its what makes a Rogan Josh that bright, brilliant red without heat.The Mundu chilli is round and button-like and native to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Its only slightly spicy but has a unique flavour that makes it indispensable to the cuisine, when tempered with curry leaves, mustard and methi seeds and added, for instance, to curd rice.The Byadagi chilli is grown in Karnataka and no Karwari Fish Curry is complete without this dry, long, crinkly fellow. The chilli is pungent and imparts a bright red colour to curries and gravies. The Byadagi chilli really comes into its own when combined with coconut.The reason Andhra food roars with spice is because of the Guntur Sannam chilli. This one can in fact be deadly and that is why, though India grows a lot of it, very little is exported to the West. Demand for the Guntur chilli comes mainly from other Asian countries. Andhra uses the Guntur with passion and fervour. No Natu Kodi Kura (spicy Andhra chicken curry with coconut) or Guntur Kodi Vepudu (spicy chicken fry) or the Mamsam Pulusu (spicy mutton) would taste the same without Guntur chilli.Mathania chillies, named after a town in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, have a powerful aroma and flavour but are not that spicy. This is the chilli that brings the laal to Laal Maas.The Sankeshwari mirchi from Kolhapur is used in combination with other chillies to make chilli powder. Its a bright orange and is also used in a lot of central Maharashtrian cuisine.Little known outside Goa, the Titimiti is a bright orange, inch-long thing that is the reason a true Goan Prawn Curry looks and tastes the way it does.And then finally there is the Naga Bhut Jolokia, or Ghost Chilli. It is one of the worlds hottest, is used both fresh and dried, and is the key spice in a Naga Smoked Pork.These are just a few of the chillies we use in India. Overall this fruit is so adored that the Lavangi Mirchi is not only a bright red, spicy, detonative chilli from Kolhapur, but also a term used to describe a sensual, smouldering woman. Hows that for spice?First Published: Jun 28, 2019 20:10 IST"
2019-06-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bringing-up-baby-gudiya-baghpat-uttar-pradesh-5806835/,Bringing up baby,"HOLDING an arm and index finger out, pointing towards a gate, Gudiya coaxes the caretaker of a government-run child care home in west Uttar Pradesh to take her to her favourite person, the home guard posted there.AdvertisingSeeing the woman dressed in a khaki uniform, the toddler jumps into her lap.A month ago, it was another woman in a similar uniform who had taken care of her for nine days, after Gudiya was found in a sugarcane field in Baghpat, wounded and bleeding. A search revealed the decomposed body of a woman a few metres away.While the woman is unidentified still, and the case remains stuck, police believe she was the mother of the child. With little to go on, including the childs name, they estimate her age to be around two, and have christened her Gudiya, or doll.AdvertisingAt the childrens home, it is not hard to see why. With her long, curled eyelashes and wavy brown hair, Gudiya looks like one, though her face and head still bear the scars and wounds of the violence she survived.It was early morning on a Friday, May 17, that a group of villagers visiting a dargah for prayers were startled by the faint wail of a child. They looked around the sugarcane field nearby, situated close to the road that leads to the main Baghpat city, and discovered Gudiya. Just 50 metres away lay a woman with her face decomposed beyond recognition and bearing wounds similar to that of the child.READ | Lost in Baghpat field for 4 days, a 1-year-old survives hunger, woundsThe villagers visiting the shrine called for an ambulance and the village head informed the police. But the horrors of what Gudiya may have gone through kept unfolding over the next 24 hours, as doctors at the Aastha Multi-Speciality Hospital in Baghpat, where she was taken, estimated that her wounds may have been inflicted four days ago.Gudiya was found to have been attacked with a sharp object on the head and side of her face, her wounds deep enough to have impacted her skull. The woman next to her had stab injuries. Police concluded that the attack had taken place somewhere else and the two had been dumped in the field. The assaulters perhaps never expected the toddler to survive her injuries.Gudiya would prove them wrong  as she continues to do again and again since.Doctors believe Gudiya remained unconscious for most of the time she lay in the field, possibly due to a heat stroke from temperatures hovering around 40 degrees Celsius at the time. Then came the rain, and consequently maggots. The worms are believed to have infested the dead womans open wounds, leading to the decomposition, and attacked the bleeding flesh on Gudiyas face as well as the skin close to her pelvis.Gudiya fought on, including against four days of hunger and thirst.Dr Ajay Garg of Aastha Multi-Speciality Hospital says, It appears that she woke up at some point and began crawling. It is possible she was dehydrated and wanted water.He adds that the timing of when she was found was propitious too. The wounds had begun to rot and any delay could have been fatal. The child has good immunity which helped her survive without food and water for so many days, especially under such circumstances.In the register maintained at the home, Gudiyas date of birth was put down as June 28, 2017  the date that she was brought to the centre by Child Welfare Committee officials, the year from two years ago.***At the hospital, Gudiya was attached to intravenous drips feeding her water and iodine. Lying on the mattress, she slept for hours as hospital staff made a beeline for the first-floor ward to catch a glimpse of the miracle child. She woke up only the next day  with Rekha Nagar next to her.As it opened investigation into the case, police assigned the constable belonging to the Baraut Police Station to take care of Gudiya. Within days, Nagar and Gudiya were inseparable.When Gudiya woke up, a nurse offered her a small bottle of water. She drank it all up as she was so thirsty. She did the same with a bottle of milk. But when nurses came to change her diaper or clothes, she resisted. She appeared to be in trauma and have issues trusting people. I started sleeping next to her on the same bed and patted her slowly to convey she was safe, says Nagar.A mother of a five-year-old, Nagar says she didnt mind spending up to 12 hours a day with Gudiya. The little girl felt like her own child, she adds.A month on, Gudiya is more friendly than most children her age. She clings on to anyone who picks her up at the centre.The childrens home starts stirring to life around 7 am. Sharing a room with 10 girls between the ages of 15 days and three years  including two premature babies  and a 15-day-old baby boy, Gudiya wakes up rubbing her eyes. In no time, she is in the lap of one of the two caretakers, who bathes and feeds her, and is by her side almost at all times.The woman is hearing impaired, and Gudiya hasnt started talking, which is a niggling worry for officials. Despite it or maybe because of it, the two have become close.The other caretaker adds that the trauma Gudiya went through has left few unmoved at the centre, just like at the hospital. So, from everyone, she gets that little extra attention, the caretaker says.Apart from the 15 toddlers, spread over two rooms (separate for boys and girls), the centre has 36 other children, till the age of 10. The 51 children are looked after by two caretakers at all times in shifts of eight hours each. A home guard sits at the gate and a nurse carries out periodic checks. A cook comes in at 7 am and makes breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner.The older children too are distributed across two rooms. All rooms have coolers and fans, but on a hot afternoon, the children are sprawled out on the cool marble floor.Adjacent to the sleeping area is the entertainment room where children spend most of their time. Common toilets, a kitchen and dining area and two classrooms make up the rest of the ground floor, in the middle of which a courtyard is used for playing cricket. On the first floor are 10 other rooms, in two of which the caretakers live.***Soon, it is time for breakfast, where children are served an egg and a glass of milk each. While infants are fed milk from a bottle, the toddlers waddle into the dining room supervised by the older children.The eldest five, each 10 years old, make sure the toddlers are the first ones to be fed. Since they can fall off the high benches, they are seated on the floor. The older children eat at the table.Gudiya is a newcomer, but children make friends easily at the home. And consensus is uniform, among caretakers as well as the children, that Gudiya, despite not speaking, knows how to get her way. However, she barely smiles or laughs, even as children around her play or watch TV.She comes and sits next to me for hours sometimes. There is a mango tree in the yard and this is the time when unripe mangoes fall to the ground. They are neither too sour nor very sweet. She loves them. I try to make her laugh, tell her stories, but never has she broken into a smile. She is usually lost in her own world. Maybe it is a sad one. With the trauma she has undergone, I am not surprised, the home guard says.The 47-year-old says she has two children of own, a daughter who is married and a son who is studying. As she picks up Gudiya who is seeking to be lifted, she corrects that. My daughter recently had a child. I am a grandmother now.The child care home is located next to an intermediate college (up to Class 12), and only recently a wall came up between the two. The home guard has to constantly ensure that the gate in the wall is bolted, so that the older children at the centre dont run away.***While Gudiyas case has caught the attention of everybody, tragedies like hers are not new to the centre. A few weeks before Gudiya arrived, a six-month-old girl had been brought to the centre by Sambhal police. She was found next to the bodies of her mother and older brother. The father, the accused, is now in police custody.But unlike the infants case, Gudiyas is no closer to a breakthrough. The heat, rains, maggots, all contributed to the destruction of any leads police may have lifted from the site where she was found. With little to go on, they are banking on a picture of her presumed mothers decomposed face, the greenish suit she was wearing, and Gudiya.No ID was found on either the woman or the child. The post-mortem report says the body was found a week after the woman died. This rules out a lot of biological information we could have retrieved. I have personally visited the gram pradhans of every Baghpat village and shown them Gudiyas picture for possible identification, but to no avail, says Dharmendra Sandhu, the initial investigating officer (IO) in the case. Since he was made the Station House Officer of another police station, a new IO, Jahid Khan, has been appointed. We have put up posters on social media and on walls. We have even extended our search to the NCR region, but no clue has been obtained, says Rakesh Kumar Singh, SHO, Baraut.Police say they could not conduct a DNA test on the woman to determine if she was related to Gudiya as her body was too decomposed. So she was cremated within 72 hours of being found.Sandhu says police are looking at all angles. There is a possibility the two lived in a different region and were dumped here. People in Baghpat district have been questioned extensively. We increased our investigation radius to 150 km but nothing turned up. Another problem is that there is no missing persons complaint at the regions police stations that matches the description of the two, the SHO says.Gudiya is polices strongest lead. But no one has come forward to claim her so far.***At the childrens home, as the clock strikes noon, the cook, an elderly woman referred to by everyone as Cook Aunty, is putting the final touches on a meal of rice, daal and sambhar, with lots of vegetables.Gudiya is hungry and, like everyone at the centre attests, makes her wishes clear. She screeches and kicks till she is led to the dining room. The cook lifts her up and puts her on the counter, besides the vessels holding food for the 51 children and the staff members.The cook selects a thaali with raised edges and places a small heap of rice on it. As Gudiya looks on, she pours a ladle of daal over the rice and places slices of cucumber and tomatoes besides it. Gudiya sits down to eat, with a red tumbler holding water next to her. While a small herd of goats outside the window briefly distracts her, she has no interest in the TV that is on, unlike the other children.When she arrived at the centre, Gudiya weighed 8.5 kg, 3.5 kg below the median weight for a two-year-old, as per WHO parametres. Her current weight will soon be taken as part of the monthly check for weight and height.The antibiotics that the doctors started her on in the hospital were continued for only about a week at the centre. Now, apart from ointments for her scars, Gudiya is given only multi-vitamins and calcium.None of the children at the centre goes to school, but two teachers come and teach them. We arent sure if sending the kids out to study is safe. We dont have any means of transport, says the director, who has been posted at the centre for three years.Referring to Gudiya, he says, She has been with us for a month and is healthy. She is active and is making friends. Also using the word miracle to describe her story, he adds, It just proves that if God doesnt want you to die, no one can harm you.***Miracles, few contest, are rare at the centre, which houses children either orphaned or abandoned by their parents, and who spend years waiting to find a forever family. The home is an adoption centre registered with the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), a unified umbrella for adoption process in the country.The director has markers and souvenirs of successful adoption stories at the centre under a glass top on his work table. A note below a photograph reads Mom, Dad and your brother. It was sent by a seven-year old, from Spain, where he now lives with his adoptive family.So far, eight children under my tenure here since 2016 have been adopted by families abroad. America, Spain, France, parents have come to us from different parts of the world. It is these families who adopt differently abled children and those older than three years. In our country, everyone wants a fair and young child, he says.At the centre, 24 parents are in the waiting list for adoption (centrally, the number of applicants is higher compared to the children up for adoption). Most of them want a girl child, though under the age of three. We have 15 children under that age, he says.The oldest child ever adopted from the home was an eight-year-old boy, who also lives in Spain now.For Gudiya, the possibility of adoption opens up after two months. Now that she is better, the government has put out advertisements in national newspapers looking for a family member to claim her. If there is no response in 60 days, Gudiya will be put up for adoption.We dont disclose the identity or the case background of children to prospective parents, but even without her back story, Gudiya will be adopted very soon I think. She has an angelic face, the director says.As the sun sets slowly, a cool breeze rolls in, providing relief from the humidity. One by one, the children emerge for their scheduled play-time, and take over the three swings and an open space, while preparations begin for a cricket match. Two children lie in the shade of the mango tree, munching on the fallen mangoes.Still struggling to rouse herself from her afternoon siesta, Gudiya is not among the children. But soon she is standing close to the gate, ignoring the children who are calling out her name, looking around for the home guard.Could the miracle child see perhaps another miracle? Communicating with gestures, Gudiyas caretaker says she doesnt like milk and keeps asking for water. Gudiya also keeps repeating one word the only word they have heard her speak at the centre  Maa.Advertising(The Sunday Express is not revealing the location of the child, or of the officials part of her story, to protect her privacy)"
2019-06-30,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/as-sowing-drops-by-97-per-cent-in-maharashtra-concerns-about-rising-prices-of-vegetables-and-other-commodities-5808194/,"As sowing drops by 97 per cent in Maharashtra, concerns about rising prices of vegetables and other commodities","The dismal situation for most farmers in Maharashtra continues as, even days after the arrival of monsoon, the rainfall is inadequate and farmers have little to cheer about. Sustained absence of rains has resulted in little or no sowing activity.AdvertisingUrban consumers can feel the brunt of the delayed monsoon and sporadic rains as the steep rise in prices of vegetables like tomatoes and onions, and the high prices of tur and chana daal, have hit them. At the same time, almost all dairies in the state have increased the retail price of milk in plastic pouches by Rs 2 per litre. This has stoked fear about the return of food inflation. But all of it is not bad news. Once monsoon rain finally finds its momentum in the next few weeks, sowing activities are expected to pick up. The prices of vegetables and milk, however, may take some time to drop to normal levels.The impact on sowing activityData released by the state Agriculture Department has revealed that there has been a 97 per cent dip in sowing this year, when compared to the sowing activity in this period last year.As on June 18, only 39,176 hectares of farmland have reported sowing of any kind. Last year, on June 22, sowing had been completed on as much as 12.04 lakh hectares in the state. Due to lack of moisture in the soil, farmers had put on hold the sowing of pulses, soyabean, sugarcane, cotton, paddy and some vegetables. Some portions of Konkan and southern Maharashtra have seen nursery plantation of paddy and some millets, but most farmers are yet to begin their operations.AdvertisingThe silver lining is that in the last 72 hours, there has been a good spell of rain and if the rainfall remains consistent, sowing activity will pick up in the coming days, but farmers may decide not to cultivate some short-duration crops.The crops affectedThe main crops which may have missed their sowing window are pulses like moong and urad. Grown within a period of 90-100 days, the sowing window of both pulses ends by mid-June. If sown later than usual, there is a possibility of rain at the time of harvest and subsequent crop loss. Usually, Maharashtra has nearly 8 lakh hectares of area for both crops, with farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha predominantly cultivating the crop. While reduction in the area of cultivation in Maharashtra may not have much of an effect on the national basket, as produce from Rajasthan and Telangana would compensate for any shortfall, this may lead to a slight rise in the prices of moong and urad daal.Once the sowing window gets over, farmers prefer to opt for long-duration crops like tur, soyabean and cotton. Soyabean is the sturdiest of the lot and is resilient towards the many vagaries of nature.Maharashtra reports around 37-38 lakh hectares of land under oilseed and this year, the acreage is expected to go up by 10 per cent. Throughout the last season, the oilseed had traded above its government-specified minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,399 per quintal, giving farmers an incentive to opt for the crop.Another crop that may see more cultivation is cotton, given the better realisation farmers have received in wholesale markets. But farmers are also wary of yield loss due to delayed sowing.Delayed sowing can cause up to 20-30 per cent less yield as rains, during the crucial picking time, can harm the produce. Maharashtra reports around 40 lakh hectares of cotton area, which is likely to see a slight dip due to delayed rains.The prices of pulses, which had earlier been on the higher side, have corrected themselves in the last few weeks. Several steps, such as the Centres approval for an additional quota for import, directions to NAFED to offload its stock and a veiled attack on black-marketers and hoarders have led to a correction in prices, both in wholesale and retail prices. Tur daal, which was retailing in Laturs wholesale markets for Rs 85-86 per kg, has since then settled at Rs 81-83 per kg. Similarly, the retail price of daal in Pune, which had crossed Rs 120 per kg, has since then dropped to Rs 95-100 per kg.Rising pricesOf immediate concern for urban consumers, however, is the higher prices of vegetables and milk. In Punes retail markets, the price of tomatoes (Rs 50-60 per kg), onion (Rs 20-25 per kg) and beans (Rs 120 per kg) have caused much concern for retail consumers. The price rise ia a result of the falling production of summer vegetables, due to the water scarcity. The present trend may continue as the delayed monsoon will take a toll on the arrival of the new crop. As of now, the new crop of vegetables is expected to arrive by the end of July and prices are expected to fall only after that. Similarly, it will take some time before the price of milk, which have seen a Rs 2 per litre increase, corrects itself."
2019-07-01,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/centre-of-excellence-telangana-explores-vertical-farming-to-step-up-production-of-leafy-vegetables/article28248647.ece,Want chemical-free vegetables? Vertical farming might be the answer,"The Telangana State Centre of Excellence (TSCoE) in Jeedimetla feels like an oasis, in contrast to the barren highway that leads to the area and the humble residential colony in its vicinity. The 10.35-acre facility managed by the department of horticulture is a hub of experiments for cultivation of vegetables and flowers.In one of the poly houses covered by a UV-stabilising film, more than 800 PVC pipes have been converted into vertical farming towers. Each of these pipes have been filled with a mix of coco peat, red soil, neem cake, vermicompost and micronutrients that help plant growth. Each pipe has more than 20 slots from which small branch-like extensions emanate, it is in these that green leafy vegetables are grown.The CoE designed and tested such prototypes in December 2018, approved by the department of horticulture authorities and a technical committee of agriculture experts; it has so far grown coriander, amaranthus, bacchali (Malabar spinach) and palak (spinach). At the moment, the 800-plus towers grow spinach, some of them ready to harvest.A retail counter near the entrance of the premises sells fresh greens and vegetables grown at the centre and its a big hit with the neighbourhood. Palak is sold at 40 per kg, double the price of wholesale market, but there are many takers since these greens are free of chemical pesticides. There have been days when the centre sold 400 to 600 bunches of leafy greens.Around the world Singapore: The vertical urban farm called Sky Greens, located in Lim Chu Kang, harvests 500kg of green leafy produce every day. According to a Straits Times report, the yield in this farm is 10 times that of traditional farms, as it uses tiered metal towers up to nine metres tall. The rotation of these towers in glass buildings allows all the plants to get uniform sunlight.San Francisco: Tigris, a hydroponic vertical farm in San Francisco, is a futuristic project focusing on growing leafy greens. The new farm reportedly can grow one million plants at a given time.While vertical ornamental gardens add aesthetics to premises, vertical farming is more utilitarian. CoE intends to encourage residential colonies in urban areas and farmers at the district and zilla parishad levels to grow more greens using vertical farming.The CoE feels that having several small crop colonies in urban pockets and rural areas might help meet some of the growing demand for vegetables in the state. Leafy greens, tomatoes, brinjals, chillies and okra, for instance, can be cultivated in balconies and terrace gardens to meet individual home needs.In addition, enterprising farmers in both urban and rural areas can do vertical farming to grow greens that meet the needs of their neighbourhoods, believes the CoE. Green vegetables are the need of the hour. They perish easily and dont withstand long-distance transport. A lot of greens available in the market are also laced with chemical pesticides. Theres an increasing awareness today about safe food. Growing your own greens will ensure safe food and reduce food miles, says K Latha, assistant director of horticulture, CoE.Traditional farmers can use vertical farming towers to step up the yield. In flat-surface farms, its tough to harvest green leaves during monsoon. Leafy vegetables can be harvested every 25 to 30 days, so ideally you can aim for 12 harvests a year. In flat cultivation farmers only manage eight or nine harvests. Using these towers and a poly film roof, greens can be grown all round the year, she says.K Latha, additional director of horticulture, COE, with agriculture engineering students at the vertical farming polyhouse | Photo Credit: K V S GiriThe coco peat and nutrient mixture in these towers can be replenished after three or four harvests to get quality produce. To counter weeding, the CoE uses a weeding mat on the ground. Small outflow pipes from each of the towers drain excess water.To make vertical farming economical, the CoE uses non-ISI mark PVC pipes that cost 400 to 500 each, as opposed to ISI-certified ones that cost around 5000. However, the non-ISI pipes stand the risk of damage when exposed to prolonged heat. The UV-stabilising poly film roof counters this problem.Latha points out that there are several smart vertical farming methods worldwide, including those that use hydroponics and aeroponics. There are various designs of vertical farming towers too, across the world. The indigenous technology we developed is one of the methods, she says, signing off.Planet Healers celebrates eco-conscious initiatives.

2019-07-02,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-provide-all-the-help-farmers-need-pramila-bisoyi/story-4Yb6ctXVAa5g8rHUHcVXaL.html,'Will provide all the help farmers need': Aska MP Pramila Bisoyi,"It has been just over a month since Pramila Bisoyis life, well into its seventh decade, turned on its head. The resident of Chermaria village in Ganjam district of Odisha who won the Aska parliamentary seat on a Biju Janata Dal (BJD) ticket, is in New Delhi  her first visit to the nations capital  to attend the Budget session of the 17th Lok Sabha. Its the longest she has been away from home, but its not her family that she misses the most.Up until she was given the party ticket in April, Bisoyi, a petite farmer with four grown children, managed the mid-day meal scheme in her villages anganwadi. Young children from nearby villages study there too, and it was Bisoyis task to ensure that they got nutritious food. I would do more than just oversee the meals. Once I finished cooking with others, I would clean the vessels. I helped children cross the road. I would clean their mouths after they had eaten, she said in Odiya. Her personal assistant appointed by the BJD, Nilamani Patnaik, translated for her.She tears up recounting how some children wondered if Pari ma  as she is called in her village  had died, because they had seen a photo of Bisoyi wearing garlands, quite likely taken while she was on the campaign trail. The anganwadi workers told the children that I had gone to get more food for them. They miss me, and I really miss them, she said.Agent of ChangeBisoyi has a reputation as an agent of change. About 200km from Bhubaneswar, Chermaria village is like most nondescript rural habitations in Odisha. Cows and heifers roam the narrow streets lined by pucca houses alongside asbestos-roofed hutments. The stifling summer heat is worsened by an erratic power supply. Not too far from the village is Pakidi hill, parts of which were fallow but are now covered with massive trees and frequented by peacocks thanks to Bisoyi and the women in self-help groups (SHG). For her efforts, Bisoyi was felicitated by the Odisha state government, and received the Prakriti Mitra award in 2007.It is her role in initiating SHGs that Bisoyi is most widely known for. The state has over 600,000 womens SHGs, with an estimated 7 million members. Bisoyi is credited for starting at least 100. Her first foray started at the turn of the millennium, when Gram Vikas, a non-governmental organisation, began to work in her district on issues of sanitation and water with the government.An SHG typically comprises between 10-20 members, and works as an informal credit system. The members pool in their money and deposit it in the bank. Members can borrow from this pool, and they are required to pay it back with interest within a specific time period. They can also borrow from banks and avail of several microfinance schemes.The state government often extends support to these SHGs. For instance, just before the assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Odisha this April, chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced financial assistance of Rs 3,000 to each SHG in the state. Last November, the state launched a scheme to fund 300,000 new groups with seed money of Rs 15,000 each, and the CM announced his intention to distribute smart phones to all members. The government even has a department to look after the needs of womens SHGs, called Mission Shakti, which has been operational since 2001.To convince women [to save money as part of the SHG], we would say, instead of spending money on gutka or paan, save it, and it will be of use later, Bisoyi said.Soon, the SHGs began to operate their own bank accounts, with each member putting a small amount. They charged an interest of Rs 20 for every Rs 1,000 crossed, and each member was entitled to take the money for whatever her needs may be  the group had veto power  but she was asked to repay it within six months. They still follow this model. We have never said no to anyone who has asked for money. Whatever we can afford, we give. If they struggle to pay it back, they reach out to their sons for help, she said.Of women, for womenMigration is endemic in this region. In colonial times, Aska is said to have had the first and the biggest sugar factory in Asia, and still remains a predominant sugarcane producer. But unsold sugar and unpaid dues have forced mass migrations from the region to the spinning mills of Gujarat. Bisoyis two sons, Dilip (48) and Ranjan (46), migrated 20 years ago to work in Surat. We are forced to stay in the most pathetic conditions in Gujarat. But what sort of work can you do here? There are no major industries in the area to provide jobs to youths, said Ranjan.Now back in their village, Dilip and Ranjan earn a living running a tea stall and a two-wheeler repair shop respectively. Bisyois daughters, Sulata Jena and Runu Swain, are married. Her husband, Banchhanidhi (80), is a retired peon from state water resources department.Situated on the banks of Rushikulya and Badanadi rivers, Aska has also been a victim of floods. Cyclone Phailin in 2013, which affected a large part of the constituency, adversely impacted livelihood. If we get good harvest in one season, the next one is ruined by floods, said farmer Surendra Sahu of Nuagaon village. Bisoyis farm, where she grows eggplant, tomatoes and chilli, was affected too.Bisoyi said that SHGs helped families tide over the bad times. When we are able to give the money in times of a bad crop, or a calamity, its like a second income for the family, she said. R Minati Reddy, an anganwadi worker, who is part of an SHG started by Bisoyi, said the women are now taken more seriously at home due to the money they bring in. We are now valued at home, she said.Patnaiks encouragement of SHGs has empowered women such as Bisoyi. However, the groups also serve as a ready vote bank. During her campaign, Bisoyi asked for votes, especially from women, in the name of Naveen Patnaik, who recently began his fifth term in office. Earlier, when women wouldnt work, but stay indoors, they wouldnt be so aware. Now, with more women coming out of homes, working, they are more aware.Farm to parliamentThis April, Bisoyi was all set to go to her one-acre farmland to harvest black gram when a vehicle from Bhubaneswar stopped in front of her home. Bisoyis husband thought his wife was being taken to Bhubaneswar to be awarded for her work. In Bhubaneswar, she was driven to the BJDs office where she was told she would be the partys candidate from Aska Lok Sabha constituency, a seat that was once represented by Naveen Patnaik and former CM Biju Patnaik. Her assistant shows HT a video of her on the campaign trail  a diminutive Bisoyi surrounded by a sea of women. This was how it was all the time, he said.The BJD also reserved 33% party tickets in the Lok Sabha polls for women. Of the 12 seats the party won, seven were won by women. The party did not reserve any of the 147 assembly seats for women in the state polls.On June 17, Bisoyi took the oath as a member of Parliament, in Odia. She will return to her village once the session is over. Her plans for the constituency will depend on what the party decides, her assistant said. But Bisoyi said her priorities are better schools, roads, sanitation, water facilities.Whatever help farmers need for their cultivation, I will provide.First Published: Jul 02, 2019 07:05 IST"

She is a freelance cookery expert who started the garden around three-and-a-half years ago. She grows all her fruits and vegetables here and sees no need to buy any of it from the market. She was inspired by her father who grew roses and hibiscus flowers. Attending a one-day gardening workshop about organic farming changed her life. Through Facebook, she met numerous friends from across the world who shared seeds with her.Adiga likes to puts her plants in paint drums rather than pots because they are more sustainable and dont get damaged during bad weather. She grows around eight varieties of sweet potatoes, 10 varieties of brinjal, and a few varieties of chilli, melons, turmeric, tomatoes and beans.My plants are like kids to me. Every morning, the first thing I do is just touch the plants and be with them; they can understand and I think they are very sensitive. I can see the number of harvest I get regularly. Every two-three days, I harvest because I am blessed by nature, Prathima says about her daily ritual with her plants.She is a part of a composter group whose main intention is in composting the garbage. If people can start composting and growing their own food, it will make a lot of difference. She recycles her kitchen waste in a khamba, which is a composter. When asked about how people can be more conscious about the diminishing green cover, Prathima says, Lately, people have started realising the value of trees and plants. I request each and everyone to not chop them off as they are a gift from nature. Start growing trees on your own terraces.Like Prathima says, our motivation should be, start growing what you eat and eat what you grow."

The liberal use of quinoa, and vegetables like lotus stems and sweet potatoes to recreate common dishes have paid off richly. The food is not only light and nutritious, but agrees with the taste buds too. One of the unique features of the menu is that they use jackfruit flour instead of the regular all-purpose flour and wheat flour. Jackfruit seed flour is packed with nutrients and is gluten free. So, if you are having Chicken Momos there, you will notice that the dough covering, made from jackfruit flour and root starches, is thicker and has more texture. It is served with an amazing spinach and garlic dip. The Shakarkandi Tarbooz Salad turned out to be a meal in itself.The dish has roasted sweet potato cubes drenched in a citrus dressing, juicy water melon pieces and a handful of pumpkin seeds. The Jhalmuri Salad is the ideal snack mixture which you can gobble up without counting the calories. The mixture has puffed quinoa, makhana, peanuts, onion, tomato and coriander coming together in a citrus dressing. The papdis in the Tri-grain Papdi Chaat Medley, which are made of kuttu, jowar and bajra, were crispier and denser than the normal ones. The Spicy Sprout Filled Golgappas, which came with pomegranate, pineapple and mint water, touched the right spicy and sweet notes.In the main course, Kathal Quinoa Biryani and Six Grain Paranthas were served with Chicken Chettinad curry. In this city of Biryanis, the quinoa Biryani might take some time to find fans. However, the paranthas, made from whole wheat, gram, soyabean, oats and ragi, were delicious and had zero oil. The Chettinad curry was flavourful without being too spicy.Apart from a wide range of creatively done dishes, they have an impressive number of beverages. Their Kokum Coconut coolant is a treat for coconut lovers. The restaurant, which also offers cold coffees and vegan shakes, has a kids menu too. The dessert section has Caramelised Banana Cake, Fruit Payasam and others. The Fruit Payasam seems to be inspired by Elaneer Payasam, with tender coconut being replaced by fresh fruits. They also have two varieties of artisan ice cream  Berry Ice Cream and Coconut Caramel Ice Cream.The interiors of the restaurant is earthy and full of light.

The meat is not cut and weighed in front of customers, there is hardly any clanking of pots and pans, the noise of onions and tomatoes being chopped on wooden cutting boards is missing and theres barely any smoke emanating from the rows of burning embers.Britains strict cooking norms have reduced the spectacle of baltia style of cooking in Pakistan and India using high heat on a steel kadhai, not unlike a stir fryto a mere in-house experience. Mohammed Aftab isnt happy that traditions like sheekhs and katakata stir fried or bhuna dish that gets its name from the rhythmic clanking of iron spatulas mincing meat on flat pansthat need an open fire had to be shelved or modified in keeping with the law.READ | Miracles can happen - Sarfaraz Ahmed on the possibility of beating Bangladesh by 316 runsAdils, a restaurant that opened in 1977 and is considered the pioneer of balti cooking in Britain, has tried to keep the experience as authentic as possible, which is why here, the balti is served in the same wok used to cook it.Zulfi, the head chef at Adils for 15 years now, gets to work once the slip makes it to the pass. With deft hands, he chops the tomatoes, pours the vegetable oil (instead of desi ghee, another British compromise) and lets the chicken simmer in it before cranking up the gas. Everything is measured out in time: when to add the garam masala, the turmeric, the kashmiri laal mirch, the whole spices, chillies and the final garnish. Its done in 10 minutes. Zulfi gets back to checking on his inventory. Its a slow day at Adils; four customers sipping on wine and praising the curry even though its making them sweat on a chilly evening.File photo of cooked dish. ( Getty )It was not always like this, says Aftab, the manager. Earlier we used to be open for lunch and dinners. Now its only dinners. We still do brisk business on weekends but weekdays can be pretty slow. When I think of those days, it feels pretty unbelievable that once we had a footfall of 55,000 in a month.READ | Virat Kohli crashes KL Rahuls interview on Chahal TV  WatchAftab is talking of a time when Indian food was the only option apart from the local pubs and fish and chip shops. Those were the heydays of balti cooking, when a slew of Indian and Pakistani restaurants used to make up the popular Balti Triangle of Birmingham, attracting locals, touring cricketers and even former prime minister David Cameron.Big names often came here. Imran Khan, Inzamam, Shoaib Mohammad. Tab to mehfil hota tha yahaan (It used to be a soiree here). Dinners used to continue till late at night, remembers Aftab. Siyasat (politics) and cricket, dinner conversations used to be incomplete without them.Cricket is integral to life around these parts of Birmingham. Not very far from Stoney Lane grew up Moeen Ali, still remembered as that wiry chap who could bat very well and went on to become the beard thats feared. Ali studied at Nelson Mandela Primary School, situated adjacent to a huge field lining Stoney Lane that hosts community cricket matches every Sunday. Some teams in fact, are sponsored by the balti restaurants as a way of supporting the game and the youth of Birmingham. Like Al Faisals, established in 1982, a stones throw from Adils and their biggest competitor. This restaurant too is steeped in cricket. Among the most liked photos on their social media handle is one that has Mohammad Ajaib, the restaurants founder, with Javed Miandad during Pakistans 1986 tour. Qasim, the sprightly 22-year-old manager, tells how they had sponsored Pakistans team bus during the 2017 Champions Trophy.Getting players to visit the restaurant has become difficult over the years. Locals at Stoney Lane feel increased security and fear of being approached by bookies have made players apprehensive. Still there are the odd calls requesting balti shops to deliver baltis, biryani, korma and the massive table naans to team hotels. The players connect isnt as real time as it used to be, says Mohammad, one of the oldest hands in Adil. Still, the community around Stoney Lane breathes cricket. Often its the only distraction from the tough immigrant life. Accha lagta hai cricket dekh kar, says Mohammad. He had come to Birmingham when he was eight, worked for 30 years before deciding to head home to Mirpur, in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir in 2018. It was an emotional decision, one he would regret quickly. Life back home is difficult. Every day we dont have electricity for hours. Generators cost a lot. At least here you have insurance, health care, he says. Better sense prevailed and he returned six months back.Wapas kab jaoge?Pata nahi. Its better here.Living far from home, cricket becomes an emotional connect to the land left behind. This year has been good. Pakistan toured England just before the World Cup. It all got heady the day Pakistan beat New Zealand in a World Cup thriller, right here in Birmingham. It sparked off celebrations that went on all night.Those are the best days to be in the food business, says the young manager, Qasim. Surviving in the Balti Triangle for a balti joint isnt easy anymore, with Chinese, Lebanese, Turkish and Ethiopian food making inroads. So when Pakistan plays here, and especially when they win, the happy countrymen, generous orders, and lavish tips go a long way. The loss to India hurt. But there is still hope against hope.Arent Pakistan coming back to Birmingham for the semi-finals? asks Mohammad. Better to leave the answer unsaid.First Published: Jul 04, 2019 23:35 IST"

Not too far from work, my colleague and I reach there at 2.30 pm (feverishly thinking about alternatives if the place is shut). But no! The doors are wide open and a beaming Lakshmi T Priya welcomes us in and seats us at a table (I sit on a stone bench that runs along the wall).The meals room is a no-nonsense affair and brightly lit and focussed only on the business of serving food to its customers. Just outside is the menu of the day written in chalk. We must have looked starved; before the banana leaf is placed in front of us, two cups of steaming hot wheat and coconut milk paaysam is served to us.Lakshmi started the all-vegetarian Kongunad style restaurant only recently. It is possible to get a lot of our non vegetarian dishes perhaps, but the equally impressive list of vegetarian cuisine is hardly out there, she says. As a vegetarian I am delighted and the happiness only grows as wholesome, vegetable-filled, non-paneer dishes are served one by one. A kothavarangai poriyal smells tantalisingly familiar, and oh so fragrant. That is because EVERY spice is hand pounded every day,says Lakshmi.Info you can use Sree Vidhya Meals Room is on Kalingarayar Road, (opp Bank of Baroda), Ram NagarOpen only for lunch (12.00 noon to 3.30 pm)A meal is priced at 100Call 0422-2238444 or 8220010913 for detailsIt began, like all good food stories do, with Lakshmis grandmothers. Alamelu Ammayi was a queen of thokkus, pickles and non-vegetarian fare and while Rajalakshmi Ammal cooked vegetarian delicacies like none other. I grew up watching both of them cook. They were affectionate, says Lakshmi, but strict, and tolerated no short cuts or laziness in the kitchen. Nothing made them happier than cooking for near and dear ones. It is that generosity of spirit and giving that inspired Lakshmi to open this Meals Room.I want to revive country recipes and produce and bring alive my grandmothers recipes. They only used local and seasonal fare and I am doing just the same. She is a farmer first, says Lakshmi, and nothing pleases her more than cooking from what grows on her farm including the native oils that are milled there. Farm to table is a philosophy that I subscribe to completely.Lakshmi and Mani are the only cooks. I have watched him cook for 45 years! We both cook from our heart and soul. She brushes aside our awe that just the two of them handle the cooking and says, it takes no more than what it takes to turn out a meal at home. Just requires a bit of planning, that is all.The Meals Room serves a different menu each day of the week. So be prepared to be pleasantly surprised when vegetables like pirandai, thoodhuvalai, ponnangani keerai and thandu kovakkai appear on your plate. We enjoy an exemplary pachadi that we try hard to decode. Lakshmi takes pity on us and reveals that it is a kovakkai pachchadi! We are not inventing anything; just reviving old recipes and I follow my grandmothers recipe to the last word, she says, plonking down two beautiful, glistening urundais onto our elai. The kadalai podi urundai is a peanut and red chilly powder fashioned into balls that Lakshmi encourages us to eat with hot rice and gingelly oil. Someone had a brilliant idea when they told her to patent it!Lakshmi wears her love for her grandmothers on her sleeve. I am dedicating this restaurant to them. I learnt about integrity, passion and the importance of keeping my kitchen and surroundings scrupulously clean. They taught me that food tastes good only when one cooks from the heart and, even today if I am upset about something, I wait till I have resolved the matter before I enter the kitchen1The sambar follows. You must come again and taste Alamelu Ammayis vengaya thokku. And the arisi paruppu sadham, kollu rasam, pirandai chutney, surakkai thattai payiru kulambu and pachai payiru kadaisal, Lakshmi tells us. And throws in a mention of adhirasam as a possible dessert too!We assure Lakshmi we will be back for more and stagger out, after calming down our protesting stomachs with comforting jeeragam and karuvapillai rasam.Recipe for arisi paruppu sadamServes 4200 gm ponni rice200 gm toor dalSmall onions peeled 100 gmRed chillies 6Tomato 50 gmSesame oil 100 gmMustard 1/2 tspJeera 1/4 tspSambar powder 10 gmTurneric powder 1/2 tspCurry leavesSalt to tasteWater 750 mlMethod: Soak rice and dal together in water for half an hour.

Residents of Anchorage and other south-central cities completed a fifth week of above-normal temperatures, including a record high 90 degrees (32.22 Celsius) on Thursday in the states largest city.AdvertisingOn Friday, as temperatures dipped just slightly, Anchorage resident Lucy Davidson sought relief with her grandchildren at a beach at Goose Lake. She said she picked up a portable air conditioner at a garage sale six years ago. It had not been used some summers, but its getting a workout lately.That thing has been a blessing, Davidson said. It stays on non-stop.The temperature Thursday in Anchorage hit 90 degrees (32.22 Celsius) at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 5 degrees higher than the citys previous recorded high of 85 degrees (29.44 Celsius).AdvertisingThree other Alaska locations, Kenai, Palmer and King Salmon, set or tied all-time high temperature records on Thursday.A high pressure ridge over much of south-central Alaska is strengthening and responsible for the record temperatures, National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Clay said. Anchorages average high temperature for July 4 is 75 degrees (23.89 Celsius), Clay said.Temperatures have been in the 70s for all but one day since June 23, National Weather Service meteorologist Michelle McAuley said.Anchorage experienced its wettest May ever but was warmer than normal every day in June, she said. The high pressure system is expected at least through Monday, she said.Anchorage gardeners who cant grow a tomato without a greenhouse are loving the high temperatures. Others are experiencing flashbacks to where they used to live.My home doesnt have AC like most homes here in Anchorage, and its pretty miserable, said Manny Acuna, who moved north nine years ago with the Air Force. Thats a lot coming from me because Im originally from Las Vegas.Shawn King has lived his entire 31 years in Anchorage and has never seen a stretch of similar hot weather, he said. He used the occasion to take his 4-year-old daughter, Tessa, fishing for the first time on the dock of Jewel Lake. She insisted on going barefoot.Its too hot for shoes, Tessa said.Visitors bracing for cooler temperatures were surprised to find out they would not need parkas.We didnt pack clothes for this, Judy Zickmund, who arrived in Anchorage after stepping off a cruise ship Friday morning in Seward with her husband, David. We had gone on the internet, and they said it usually runs about 65, 70 (degrees). But this has been wonderful, coming to Anchorage. The whole cruise was warmer than normal.Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, said the record high is both a weather story and part of the ongoing changing environment story.These kinds of extreme weather events become much more likely in a warming world, Thoman said.High ocean temperatures have played a role in keeping Alaska warm, he said.Surface temperatures are above normal everywhere around Alaska, Thoman said. The entire Gulf of Alaska, in the Bering Sea, in the Chukchi Sea south of the ice edge, exceptionally warm waters, warmest on record, and of course record-low sea ice extent for this time of year off the north and northwest coasts of the state.Even with her air conditioner running full blast, Davidson said, she cant get the temperature inside her home below 82 degrees.AdvertisingIf it wasnt so expensive, Id buy one of those big outdoor pools, she said."
2019-07-06,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/meet-zero-budget-vidarbha-farmer-who-was-mentioned-in-budget-speech-5818991/,Meet ‘zero budget’ Vidarbha farmer who was mentioned in Budget speech,"THE ECONOMIC Survey on Thursday mentioned Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) along with Vedic Farming, Homa Farming and Cow Farming  and how these climate friendly agricultural practices can enable elimination of chemical pesticides and restoration of soil organic matter and fertility.AdvertisingBut an even bigger push for ZBNF and the 70-year-old behind it  Subhash Palekar  came in the Union Budget speech of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, where she talked of the need to go back to basics and replicate this innovative model (that) can help in doubling our farmers income in time for our 75th year of Independence.The Survey said ZBNF is being practiced by 1,63,034 farmers. Palekar estimates the number to much higher  over 50 lakh.According to the zero budget concept, farmers wont have to spend any money on fertilisers and other agricultural inputs. While over 98% of the nutrients that crops require  carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water, solar energy  are already present in nature, the remaining 1.5-2% are taken from the soil, after microorganisms convert them from non-available to available forms, for intake by the roots.AdvertisingThis is where the special package of practices which, Palekar says he perfected during the 1990s at his 36-acre farm in Belura village of Amravati district in Maharashtras drought-prone Vidarbha region, comes in.The four wheels of ZBNF are Jiwamrita, Bijamrita, Mulching and Waaphasa, says Palekar, a Padma Shri awardee.Jiwamrita is a fermented mixture of cow dung and urine (of desi breeds), jaggery, pulses flour, water and soil from the farm bund. This isnt a fertiliser, but just a source of some 500 crore micro-organisms that can convert all the necessary non-available nutrients into available form.Bijamrita is a mix of desi cow dung and urine, water, bund soil and lime that is used as a seed treatment solution prior to sowing.Mulching, or covering the plants with a layer of dried straw or fallen leaves, is meant to conserve soil moisture and keep the temperature around the roots at 25-32 degrees Celsius, which allows the microorganisms to do their job.Waaphasa, or providing water to maintain the required moisture-air balance, also achieves the same objective.Palekar also advocates the use of special Agniastra, Bramhastra and Neemastra concoctions  again based on desi cow urine and dung, plus pulp from leaves of neem, white datura, papaya, guava and pomegranates  for controlling pest and disease attacks.Asked if this isnt just organic farming, Palekar says: No. There, they use farmyard manure or vermicompost mostly produced from Eisenia fedita, a species imported from Europe and Canada. These foreign earthworms accumulate heavy metals like lead, arsenic and cadmium, which get transferred into their castings that, far from being manure, are actually toxic to the soil. So, the soil fertility, instead of improving, only reduces. He says that in ZBNF, the work of making nutrients available to plants is done exclusively by microorganisms from Jiwamrita and local earthworms.However, not all farmers are convinced about ZBNF.He says his technique is zero-budget. But what about the cost of labour for collection of dung and urine, apart from the other inputs used in preparation of Jiwamrita, Neemastra or Bramhastra? Keeping cows is also a cost that has to be accounted for. How many farmers can afford to keep desi cows that yield very little milk, says Deepak Bhise, a tomato grower from Yedgaon village in Pune districts Junnar taluka.He points out that if ZBNF is practiced in isolation, the crop grown would be vulnerable to attacks by insects and pests which may move there from fields where chemical pesticides are being sprayed.Lalit Patil Bahale, leader of farmers organisation Shetkari Sanghatana, is even more dismissive: These so-called techniques are being promoted only for denying farmers cutting-edge technology, including genetic modification. They are a cruel joke being played on Indian agriculture.But Palekar is not deterred. Many state governments, including Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka have openly supported ZBNF after studying its efficacy, he says.AdvertisingThe ultimate recognition, though, may have come from the latest Union Budget."

The assistance will be to the tune of Rs 20,000 per hectare under TOP scheme of the Centre.The scheme will be piloted in Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts with a cluster approach in the Rabi season to encourage farmers to take up tomato farming in a commercial scale, said sources in the Horticulture Directorate.Tribal-dominated Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj have been selected for Government intervention as these two districts are the top producers of tomato due to suitable soil and prolonged cold climatic conditions during winter. However, farmers, mostly tribals, failed to recover the cost due to lack of storage facility and proper marketing linkage.With the bumper harvest of tomato last year but lack of demand, farmers of Keonjhar resorted to dumping the highly perishable vegetable on roads to register their protest against Government apathy towards their interest.Though the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has operationalised Operation Green, a scheme to stabilise the price of tomato, onion and potato, from last year, Odisha has not taken advantage of it.The scheme, if properly implemented, will lead to enhancement in income of farmers growing tomato, onion and potato, capacity building of farmer producer organisations (FPOs), reduction in post-harvest losses, creation of processing infrastructure, provision of agri-logistics for supply chain and reduction in price volatility of TOP for consumers, the sources added.The State has identified five districts for the development of agro-processing clusters of fruits and vegetables under the Centrally-sponsored Kisan Sampad Yojana (KSY). Apart from Keonjhar and Mayurbhnaj, the three other districts which are major producer of tomato and other vegetables are Balangir, Ganjam and Sundargarh. Balangir is one of the major producers of onion in western Odisha."

Quickly, the chef spills the cut vegetables and meat onto the metal, making a hissing sound. Sauces and seasoning powders are added shortly thereafter, filling the room with the flavourful aroma of stir-fry.Chap Chay, an Asian restaurant located at The Raintree, St Marys Road, will re-launch their stir-fry and a la carte menu today. The newly curated menu includes a variety of dishes across the Eastern half of the globe for customers.We decided to incorporate Thai and Chinese dishes into the new menu, but we also wanted to bring in an additional twist to the menu by adding Indonesian cuisine as well. We did this because there are a few similarities between Indian and Indonesian cuisines such as the roti, but Indonesian cuisine uses different spices and vegetables, and we think this will settle well with our clientele, said senior sous chef Suraj Rana.One of the Chinese appetisers in the menu is Cheung Fun Xia prawn made with a gluten-free rice flour wrapper around well-steamed prawn and topped with black and white sesame seeds, topped with a sprig of coriander and presented with a rice vinegar sauce. This dish, according to Rana, is a more obscure yet crowd-favourite dish found in China.The soft rice flour wrapper, coupled with the bite of prawn and sesame seeds, is cleaned up beautifully with the coriander. Other appetisers feature the tofu moon pirai, a soft tofu and basil dish which leaves a tang in the mouth, a crispy spinach salad as well as a spicy artichoke dish called the Kafir Lime Spiked Artichoke. The main course dishes are easily the best from the selection. The roti chanai ghulai Ayan or Indonesian black chicken served with roti, is made with homemade ghulai sauce, which is a spicy curry. When coupled with the soft roti, the chickens natural flavour dominates.The pineapple curry khai tastes similar to a Thai red curry, but offers a respite from the spice with chunks of pineapples, grapes and cherry tomatoes. The fried rice is firm yet flavourful, with bits of soft scrambled eggs hidden between the grains like a treasure.We hope that our customers, who have really supported us, will be able to come in and order a few dishes from the a la carte menu as well as the stir-fry menu to truly enjoy the whole experience. Stir-fry is a healthy and evergreen food that has been received well by the public so far, and I hope that they continue to visit us, said Rana.The meal ended with a banana split and vanilla ice-cream, which posed to be a textural delight for the palate.A set menu (consisting of a soup, salad, appetiser, dim sum, main course and dessert) and a stir-fry will cost `1,499 including taxes.

How else will you see a pizza dripping with sweet, syrupy jalebi or small pieces of gulab jamuns?! There is no stopping chefs inventing their own medley of toppings while purists squirm in their seats. But isnt food all about letting your imagination loose?Fondue sauce as dip (Molecule Air Bar)Undoubtedly! Pizza in current times is like a painters canvas on which chefs are creating unimaginable combinations and variants.""Indian diners are eagerly digging into silces of Chettinad Chicken, Amritsari Meat and more. says Rohit Narang, Founder and Chef at Tossin Pizza.He seasons his pizzas with the Rajasthani delicacy Laal Maas, which he calls the Indian version of Lamb Bolognese, as well as international dishes like spicy chicken satay and peri peri chicken.Among other stranger things being passed off as pizza are those that have generous dollops of curries and sauces that are not even remotely Italian.For instance Plum By Bent Chair serves Green Curry Pizza besides using various dips. Corporate chef Sagar Bajaj protectively markets the melange, The pizza today is travelling and changing with evolving palates. A good rolled dough can be sauced with any flavour from barbeque, chunky tomato to chipotle, and Indian gravies. From pizzas with Asian toppings with edamame, soy and tobiko to butter chicken, falafel, zatar and hummus.Also on the bandwagon of makeover are dips as condiments. At Molecule Air Bar in Gurugram, they serve pizza with a fondue cheese sauce, which is served as a dip along with the pizza. Some healthy versions are also flying out of the oven at Greenr Cafe.They have Manali Super Hemproot Pizza that has beetroot, hemp seeds, roasted eggplant, Thai red chilli, rocket leaves, feta shroomballs and truffle oil. Shroomballs is our signature plant protein, which is a combination of over a dozen ingredients to create a vegan version of a meatball.Our approach is to recreate all layers of the dish with wholesome ingredients while preserving both the taste and integrity of the food, says Nitin Dixit, one of the founders.The award for the most bizarre combination, meanwhile, goes to dessert pizzas at Friction, The Drinkery, with Tossins sweet-savoury creation following close on its heels.The former has introduced Jalebi Pizza that the restaurant claims is a hot seller. The dish has a layer of jalebi spread on the pizza, and gets ordered both as main course and dessert option.Tossin, on the other hand, makes pizza with peanut butter base topped with peri peri and drizzle of honey and sesame seeds. Needless to say, to connoisseurs of Italian cuisine, these experiments will always be sacrilege."

A large bundle that sold for Rs 20-25 now retails for Rs 100-120. Traders blame erratic rainfall for this escalation.""Vegetable vendors have stopped selling the assorted ten-rupee masala which includes coriander, chillies, ginger and curry leaves. They want us to buy an individual bunch of coriander for Rs 40 which is very expensive. Some greengrocers have simply stopped stocking coriander altogether,"" said housewife Vinny Maru, who shops at Four Bungalows market in Andheri.In neighbouring Lokhandwala Complex, a small fistful of coriander came to cost Rs 20 last week, and a medium size bundle sold for Rs 40 on Tuesday. Vendors refused to break up these bunches for customers who required less quantity. Vendors in Khar Market, Bandra Pali Market, Borivli and Vikhroli were charging Rs 20-40 also, citing spoilage during the heavy rains of last week.APMC trader Shankar Pingle said the wholesale price of a large bundle of coriander has risen to Rs 40-50 while a small bunch costs Rs 20-30. ""Mumbai gets its coriander from Nashik and Pune, and there is a shortfall since the crop withered during the dry spell in June. Afterwards, a robust spell of rain in July has caused fresh leaves to spoil. The situation will remain precarious for one month.""Hotels, restaurants and bhelwallahs are also minimising consumption. Vegetable dishes and rice preparations now arrive without the customary garnish while bhel sellers are adding bits of raw mango to offset the absence of coriander.Other vegetables like tomato (Rs 40 per kilo up from Rs 20), green peas and french beans (Rs 160/kg versus normal Rs 100-120), cluster beans or gavar (Rs 120 up from Rs 80-100) and lady finger (Rs 80 over average of Rs 60), have also soared this season. A lemon now costs Rs 5 apiece as against Rs 2.50 or Rs 3."

While the restaurant exudes a classic look with its minimalistic decor, its Chef Murenus curated menu titled Flavours of Sardinia that really wins you over.Murenu, 41, who recently joined the property and is still getting accustomed to Delhis heat, grew up on a 250-acre farm eating farm-to-table meals with his large family. This shaped his opinion on food, and these dishes are thus inspired by the time he spent on the farm.With a warm smile, he introduced us to Zuppa Dorzo Ai Frutti Di Mare  barley soup with onion, carrots, celery, garlic croutons and bits of seafood mixed in it. The first thing you are bound to remember on taking a sip is home. The soup was hot, lighter on spices with a dash of pepper, while the shrimp and the crab were perfectly cooked.Next, we tried the Pizza Ali Carcioffie Caciotta Affumicata. I have always enjoyed the extra cheese with extra toppings, but this one challenged my choices. Thin crust pizza with mozzarella, tomato and smoked caciotta cheese, topped with artichoke  its mild flavour doesnt overpower the overall taste, and certainly adds texture. Its best if you dont add any chillies or oregano. Taste it in its true form.Pancia Di Maiale Arrosto E Vernaccia is one of Chef Murenos own favourites. The roasted pork belly, especially when you mix it with the sweet wine sauce and the vegetables... you are sure to forget the rest and completely concentrate on your plate. In between, the chef tells us how his father was a chef in North Italy but when his grandfather became sick, he returned home to be a farmer.He always regretted not being able to continue his passion. So, when my brother and I grew up, I continued in the agriculture sector and my brother cooking. Suddenly, we decided to switch our professions. And there was no looking back. With a farming background and the love for cooking in his blood, Murenu worked in England for years, from hotels to casinos. After 16 years in London, he joined Marriott and went to Jordan for three years. Then an opportunity cropped up in the land of spices and now hes here.His signature dish, the one he had already warned us to keep space for was Seadas Con Miele Di Acacia  Seadas stuffed with sweet cheese and acacia honey. Of all the unique Sardinian dishes, this is probably the best on the rest of the Italian Peninsula, shared Chef Murenu.Seadas are one of the best-known dishes from the region served at the end of every Sardinian meal, which uses simple ingredients like cheese and fresh acacia honey to turn it into something delicious. This Sardinian dessert, famous across the world, pairs divinely the sweetness of the honey with the saltiness of the Pecorino cheese (Since the authentic Pecorino cheese isnt available here, the chef mixed mozzarella cheese and cow cheese to achieve a similar taste) resulting in an intriguing and intense flavour.Though, it took us more than hour to reach the venue, we left happy and satisfied.What: Flavours of SardiniaWhere: Prego, The Westin GurgaonWhen: Till July 15Time: Noon to 3:00 pm, and for dinner from 6:00pm till midnightReservations+91 9871226953Seadas Con Miele Di Acacia recipeIngredients:  For the dough (12 pieces approx)  500 gms durum wheat flour  50 gms lard or extra virgin olive oil  240 ml warm water  Pinch of salt  For the stuffing (12 pieces approx)  500 gms of fresh Pecorino cheese  Olive oil/vegetable oil for fryingMethod:  Make a dough by combining the flour and salt with water bit by bit till you have a silky, elastic consistency. Add the lard (or olive oil) and knead until well incorporated.  Let the dough rest about 30 minutes, covered.  Roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Cut circles and put the fresh Pecorino cheese on it. Cover with another circle of dough closing it well and press the edges well with fingers or with the tines of a fork.  Then fry the Seadas by immersion on the hot vegetable oil, till is a golden colour.  Remove from pan and place on the kitchen paper till they are dry (keep warm).  Gently warm the honey then pour over the Seadas. Best consumed when freshly made and piping hot, and the cheese still oozing.  Serve with a dust of icing sugar.Recipe courtesy: Chef Marco Murenu"

To experience the world full of monsters, superpowers and magic, the limited menu has combinations and flavours that denote the Upside Down, which is the primary theme of the series.As CE soaked in the surrounding, our eyes immediately caught the Mind Flayer LIIT, a cocktail based on the giant monster in Season 3. With an IPA syrup that has been carefully tended to, the dark rum with walnut falernum, fresh lime juice and soda was a good, tall start to the evening.While Socials outlets in Bengaluru are well-known for their LIITs, this one was more on the sweeter side and would be a good pick for someone who doesnt prefer hard drinks. The Spice Bomb was a pleasant savoury chaat consisting of yogurt, tomatoes, onions and a lot more. We finished it in a jiffy, no surprise there. Next came the Crunchy Upma and Upside Down-nuts. According to the menu, the former is crunchy on the outside, soft inside, just like Hopper, the famous police officer from the show who unfortunately dies in the last episode (or, does he?). Its a plate worthy of just the right amount of everything that a vegetarian might love. The latter is doughnuts filled with well-cooked ghee roast mutton and the menu goes on to say, Youll be on it just like Eleven on Eggos (a Stranger Things reference). Served with green chutney, the doughnuts were a delight and not at all heavy on the appetite.Meanwhile, our Strange, Sweet Death arrived with a combination of gin, cherry and hibiscus syrup, balsamic vinegar, earl grey tea, egg white and jaggery syrup. Sounds strange, but our taste buds loved it. Once the Kebab Paella came, we couldnt stop hogging at the delicious risotto rice, garnished with onions and coriander leaves and topped with quite a few creamy chicken kebabs that melted in our mouth.We encountered something strange with Biscuits and Gravy. Although we understand biscuits paired with tea, we didnt realise that the simple Parle-G would taste so unique with classic dal. Add to that, the biscuits were butter-fried, which would be loved by children and also makes for a perfect snack while playing Dungeons & Dragons.To finish it up, we were served the Mirchi ka Halwa, which in true sense, was not spicy at all, as the name suggests, but was more of butter mixed with hints of chilli served on crunchy breads. Quite strange, eh?The Stranger Things menu is on till July 14 and cost for two is `1,300 (approx)."

His journey opened up a new spice route from Europe to India. Before reaching Calicut, Goa, Daman and Diu, Vasco da Gama sailed through the Oceans of Atlantic  from Lisbon, Africa and Madagascar to Cochin and Goa.On Friday, the festival anchored itself along the coastline of Africa. Replete with food mats, it depicted the voyagers route from the Eurpoean shores to India. With its own interiors that resemble a ship, the stage was set for an unforgettable journey of discovering unknown spices and flavours.Jellof riceFor any chef, the biggest challenge is always to find the right ingredients, said Chef Babu, Chef de Cuisine at Vascos. We have sourced ingredients locally and have picked dishes that require ingredients that are easily available. With African cuisine, we did not face too much trouble in this regard as it is similar to Indian dishes. For something like bunny chow, you dont need anything from South Africa because it is an Indian-origin dish. Even the chakalaka consists beans that are found easily here.The refreshing sweet potato and coconut salad served as a the perfect sweet and tangy start to the meal. What followed was the must-try Chicken Sosaties, which was a unique blend of char-grilled apricots and onion with juicy and tender chicken chunks. The combination is exotic and a real treat. The bunny chow was nothing short of a dream with lamb cooked to perfection in a mouthwatering sauce and topped with red and yellow bell peppers to balance the flavour and add a dash of tartness. The beef babotie will leave you craving for more as it is blends spice, salt and all things nice for a hearty and lip-smacking dish.If you think there is nothing much for vegetarians, youll be in for many surprises. The menu has been curated keeping in mind that there should be more than an ample number of dishes available for vegetarians. The jellof rice and the chakalaka will please the vegetarian palate. The flavoured rice provides a great accompaniment to the dozens of other dishes on offer. For anyone who loves egg, the egg bunny chow is a must-try. The curried eggs are a great spin on a classic egg and bread combination and one you cannot go wrong with!No meal is complete without something sweet and the pampoenkoekies, which is pumpkin fritters, caramelised with some cinnamon is not only a different but delightful way to end the meal!The festival is on till July 20.

Tomatoes, shallots, garlic, beans and ginger have seen a considerable hike in rates during the past two weeks.A major reason is poor production owing to the bad weather in Tamil Nadu and tin the state. ""Against an order for 30 sacks, we get only around 10 these days, said Rajan, a retailer in the Palayam market. The price of tomatoes saw a threefold rise during the past couple of weeks. It doubled from I20 to I40 last week, and increased by I20 this week, pushing it to I60 per kilo. Shallot rates also increased from I30 to I70 in the past week.Ginger sales appear to be in jeopardy due to the sudden hike in price from I150 to I200 a week ago and peaking at I240 on Friday. Due to the hike, no one wants to buy ginger, says Nandu, a street vendor at Palayam market. Another item which showed a similar rise is coriander leaves, which went up from I35 in February to I210 last week.Other vegetables which saw a similar price hike in the past two weeks include beans from I50 to I60 per kg and cabbage from I20 to I50.Fruit prices have also increased due to their scarcity during the off-season. 'Rasakadali' bananas are priced at I90 per kilo, and is likely to increase in the coming days.The price of apples increased by I40 in two weeks to I200 per kilo.

Buyers in Bandra's Pali Market Andheri West and Ghatkopar were shocked to pay Rs 60 per kg for the essential item.Traders blame heavy rainfall in the state for a ""shortage"" of crop. APMC tomato wholesaler Mangal Gupta said, ""The recent heavy rains in Maharashtra have put a spanner in the works. Flowering of local tomato has been adversely affected. So most of the fruit is coming from dry locations of Bangalore and Gujarat. High prices will persist for one month.""Shrikant Jaiswal of Pappu Vegetables in Bandra's Pali Market said, ""Until Friday, the rate was Rs 40 but on Saturday the cost rose to Rs 60. Some of our buyers do complain but we explain to them. In any case prices do peak once a year. I have seen that customers grin and bear it till the rate climbs to Rs 80 per kg. Once it crosses that mark then we see the situation becoming difficult.""Housewives however, point out that firm red tomatoes are available in robust quantities, with no sign of spoilage or shortfall. Bandra resident Valerie Soans said, ""I hope this price rise is not the work of a cartel that causes artificial inflation a couple of times a year. Irrespective of the government that comes to power, there seems to be no mechanism to deal with high food prices. How can we pay Rs 60 for an item as basic as tomato that is required in most vegetarian and non-vegetarian recipes? Even those who do not eat onion and garlic must have tomato.""Other vegetables are also selling for 25-30% more than the average retail rate. Already coriander is off the table at Rs 20-40 per bunch. French beans are at Rs 160, green peas Rs 160-200, cauliflower Rs 80-100 and gavar or cluster beans are selling for Rs 100. Yam, brinjal, and other common beans have become costlier too."

It will be possible to make a choice only after all this confusion is tackled.BJP president Amit Shah: Trying to come across as a veteran Telegraph file picturePlay the long gameThe president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Amit Shah, may be a first-time member of the Lok Sabha and also a first-time Union minister, but he is trying to come across as a veteran. Unlike most ministers in the Union cabinet, Shah keeps himself out of conventionally important duties that a senior minister is expected to discharge in Parliament.For example, a number of bills listed for introduction in the House are introduced by his deputies. He is believed to have carefully hand-picked his two junior ministers, Kishan Reddy from Telangana and Nityanand Rai from Bihar. These two deputies not only introduce bills in the House but also counter the Oppositions arguments on those bills.So far, Shah has only spoken on the Jammu & Kashmir issue in the Lok Sabha while seeking an extension of presidents rule in the troubled state. The Kashmir issue is widely believed to be important to Shahs political plans, and he wants to use it to carve out a certain image for himself: that of a leader with an iron fist.The decision to promote juniors by giving them more opportunities to speak in Parliament is seen to be part of a long-term strategy. Party insiders feel that Shah is training a fresh breed of young party leaders with an eye on turning them into his loyalists. After all, everyone in the BJP knows that Shah, who is just 54 years old, has set his sights high.Imminent fightThe electronic voting machine ghost refuses to be exorcized. Opposition parties have decided to back non-governmental organizations and activists on building a movement on EVMs instead of just jumping into the fray straightaway. There is a group of NGOs which firmly believes that EVMs can be manipulated, and some meetings have already taken place in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore.Another meeting is scheduled in Delhi today, during which all such NGOs plan to form a coordination committee that will draw up plans to create awareness and organize agitations across the country.One senior Opposition leader said, The top leadership of the Congress believes gathering evidence to support the claim was necessary. The good news is that most of the leaders are now convinced about EVM fraud. Some of us are working silently, asking technocrats to produce evidence. In the meantime, these NGOs approached us and we extended our support to them.There may be a stage when we all will come to the front.

2019-07-15,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jumbo-problem-for-vengamaripalle-farmers/article28430450.ece,Jumbo problem for Vengamaripalle farmers,"Vengamaripalle of Baireddipalle mandal at the tri-State T.N.-A.P.-Karnataka elephant corridor has become a care of address for wild elephants during the last five years, virtually turning several hapless farmers into migrant workers, who are unable to cope with the jumbo problem, losing their crops each year.The village surrounded by the forests of Koundinya wildlife sanctuary has about 200 families, mostly depending on vegetable farming and agriculture labour. Though the problem of crop raiding elephants is common to the tri-State junction, Vengamaripalle has assumed notoriety as the favourite haunt of the wild elephants since six months. Since June 30, as many as three different herds, each numbering 2, 7 and 13, had played havoc with the fields here for more than a dozen times till July 14. The frequency of the wild elephants striking their crops has made the farmers abandon their fields and rush to the officials of the Forest and Agriculture departments, demanding protection and compensation.Water problemWith fodder and water crisis, gripping the Koundinya sanctuary since March this year, the incidence of wild elephants straying into agriculture lands in Kuppam, Palamaner and Punganur forest ranges kept growing. The intensity of the water problem is such that a three-member herd had altogether abandoned the sanctuary a month ago and strayed into Madanapalle range, 50 km away, and made a retreat only a few days ago, after destroying crops elsewhere in the western villages.No compensationFarmers of Vengamaripalle deplore that during the last three years, they had not been provided with any compensation for the crop losses. When we approach the forest officials, we are told to take photographs of the damaged crops and take them to the Agriculture Department officials, who in turn direct us back to the Forest Department. Three years had gone by this way, the farmers said.The oppressive summer heat this year had made the wild elephants target Vengamaripalle along the corridor. Several small landholdings with standing crops of tomato and cabbage were damaged since three months. To make things worse, the elephants had trampled the drip irrigation equipment.Vasaraiah Gowd, a farmer, had harvested the tomato crop on Friday last, and the loaded boxes were ready for transport the next day. In the early hours, a 13-member herd of elephants had struck the stocks, devouring the tomatoes and trampling the boxes. My entire sweat and labour was gone. I dont know whom should I approach for help this time, he said.Rajagopal, another farmer, deplored that his cabbage crop was finished in the tuskers raid since a week. We are telling the truth. In 15 days, the elephants had raided our fields a dozen times. All our night vigils would be of no avail with the ferocious and hungry beasts at night, he said.The farmers maintained that the long-term impact of the crop raiders has turned several small farmers into migrant workers at neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The youth were unwilling to venture into the fields, thinking that they could better switch to earn something for the families in neighbouring States.Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor) G. Srinivasulu told The Hindu that it was true that the elephants were frequently raiding crops at Vengamaripalle. Three herds are moving along the inter-State corridor close to this village. We will inspect the stretch and take proper steps to put an end to the menace. We will also look into the aspect of compensation to the farmers who had lost their crops, he said."

Sadashiva of the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has been honoured by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) with the prestigious Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Award for Outstanding Research in Agricultural Sciences.The national award, which carries a cash prize of 5 lakh, was conferred on the veteran scientist by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi on Tuesday, at a programme marking ICARs foundation day.Dr. Sadashiva is the first horticultural scientist, and the third scientist of any kind, from Karnataka to get this award, which was instituted in 1956 to recognise outstanding research in agricultural and allied sciences. Dr. Sadashiva shot to fame after a research team headed by him came out with three high-yielding elite varieties of tomato  Arka Rakshak, Arka Samrat, and Arka Abhed.Arka Rakshak has created a demand for itself not just in India, but also in several other countries as it yields up to 19 kg a plant in open field cultivation. According to a socio-economic impact assessment, Arka Rakshak and Arka Samrat, which are being cultivated on 50,000 acres of land across the country, have helped farmers earn revenues to the tune of 50,000 crore.Dr. Sadashiva also headed the research team that recently came out with Arka Apeksha and Arka Vishesh varieties of tomato that are suitable for processing.Dr. Sadashiva was not selected as Vice-Chancellor for any of the agricultural and horticultural universities even though his name figured in the panel of three names shortlisted by various search committees for two universities."

Unmindful of the weather, sitting comfortably on a rope swing hanging from a branch of a banyan tree is Surya Chiluvuri. His wife Sandhya is seated next to him on a chair. They are both overseeing the work at  Vanee Farms at Kompally. After an erratic rain spell, most of the work  apart from sowing seeds  involves clearing weeds. Looks like the weeds want to take over the coriander patch. Coriander seeds were sowed in summer and we had given up hope. To our surprise, they began to germinate soon after the rain. However they are far from ready to be harvested, says Sandhya.Squatted nearby, farm workers are clearing the ground of weeds uprooting them with the tip of a sickle and shaking off the soil from the roots. The seed bed is soft from the previous nights rain, walking on it feels like walking on a soft carpet. On one patch of the six acre field, the gourd trenches are up and flowering. So are the various bean shrubs.Surya and Sandhya consciously decided to move away from the city and settle on the outskirts just to be able to start the retired life of their dreams  living and working in a farm.Back to rootsAfter spending close to 20 years in the IT industry abroad and then a few years in Hyderabad, I was looking forward to leading the life of a farmer. This was fuelled by the urge to be able to consume chemical-free produce. I grew up in Ananthapur in Rayalaseema so I was eager to get back to my roots. Thankfully for me, Sandhya felt the same way, says Surya.After returning from the US Sandhya went back to college to pursue a degree in Fine Arts. I specialised in craft and material study, she shares.It took the duo more than three years to get the farm up and running and Sandhya who is an artist is looking to open a studio as well. I am no expert in farming, my husband is. When he suggested we move closer to the farm I was more than happy  think of the luxury of being surrounded by so much greenery. Ours is a vegetable farm, it took a few months to get people to come and buy our produce. We grow chemical-free vegetables but we are not certified organic yet, explains Sandhya.At Vanee Farm one can find staples such as ivy gourd, tomatoes, a variety of beans, gourds, papaya and leafy greens. The mango sapling will take some time to fruit and the duo is not in a hurry. The whole idea of a chemical free farm is to let Nature take its time. Unless one is passionate and connected to the soil, they will not look at farming as something beyond a business, adds Surya.The farm has been a trend setter of sorts; they sell their fresh produce on Wednesdays and Saturdays on the premises, to locals. They do not sell anywhere else. Fortunately for us, we are never left with excess unsold stock. Keeping in mind sustainable farming and living we limit our produce. That way we use water wisely. We have a cow, mainly for the manure, adds Surya.Customers turn friendsWhen they first opened their gates to sell vegetables, buyers walked in out of sheer curiosity. Soon they had repeat visitors and the couple has found many good friends among their customers. Sandhya recalls that in the beginning they felt very guilty when they provided plastic covers to buyers. It didnt cost us much in terms of money, but each plastic cover costs a lot to the environment. I decided to put my foot down and instead of plastic covers I brought a stack of newspapers from home and suggested that customers use these to pack their purchase. Surprisingly, no one complained or whined. They only spoke of the challenges of carrying vegetables with tomatoes and beans wrapped in paper.Thereafter, Sandhya took it upon herself to stitch some cloth bags and offered them to the customers instead. She also put out a a few lines on the noticeboard about bringing ones own cloth bag to avoid plastic. I leave no room for bargain on this issue. Apart from taking from the environment we should be able to give something back as well, she smiles.Now, the residents in and around Vanee Farms have stopped buying fresh produce from supermarkets.

The record June heatwave which smashed all-time temperature records in France may have passed - for now - but there has also been little rainfall in recent weeks to alleviate water shortages.In Spain, grape and tomato farmers who depend on water from winter rains that are stored in the soil have seen their crops wilt.In Germany, low water levels forced authorities to cut back on boat travel on the Elbe and Oder rivers. And across the border in France, water restrictions around the country saw families cut back as supplies dwindled.While water shortages are nothing new in countries like France, the ferocious heatwave that hit Europe last month has aggravated the problem. ""At least 10 countries, from the Netherlands to Slovakia, sweltered in the hottest June since records began,"" Meteo France weather forecaster Etienne Kapikian said on Twitter.In France, 61 of the country's 96 mainland regions, or ""departments"", saw water restrictions on Tuesday, according to the state-run water restrictions website Propluvia. People in some areas were told not to wash their car or water plants, with restrictions elsewhere calling for a total cutback on all but essential use, such as drinking water. The measure particularly hit French farmers, with a string of ""crisis"" alerts banning water for agricultural purposes.In the central Cher department, where authorities have issued such alerts in several areas, farmers were trying to adapt to extreme temperatures. ""We try our best to manage (our water consumption) early in spring and change the kind of crops we grow,"" Arnaud Lespagnol, president of the FDSEA farmers union in Cher, told French TV channel BFM.But ""making small changes to the way we work won't be enough. We need to be asking the right questions on a regional scale."" Spanish farmers suffered too, with the country roasting in the third driest year this century.Agriculture Minister Luis Planas said the government was ""aware"" of the ""worrying situation"" facing livestock and crop farmers. He said the government would ""adopt the necessary measures depending on how the situation evolves"".Unusually high temperatures in Spain are expected to continue into August and September, national weather agency AEMET said. In the Baltic state of Lithuania, the government declared an emergency earlier this month as a severe drought threatened to slash this year's harvest by up to half.Environment Minister Kestutis Mazeika told AFP that ""nobody has any doubt"" that climate change is behind the prolonged and more intense dry spells and heatwaves in recent years. The drought has also taken its toll on wildlife. In the eastern French region of Vosges, famed for its mountains and lakes, foresters have been forced to cut down wilting fir trees which are dying of thirst.Around Europe, parasites attracted to dying trees have infested between 60 to 80 million of them. ""We believe we're seeing the start of this phenomenon rather than the middle,"" said Cedric Ficht, a local chief of the French national forests office (ONF).Several governments have blamed global warming for the extreme temperatures. In March, Spain's weather agency AEMET said around two-thirds of the country's population, around 32 million people, are having to deal with longer summers and higher temperatures as a result of climate change.A single degree of warming since the industrial revolution has already boosted the frequency and intensity of heat waves and droughts."

The street leading to the cafe ends at a small black gate, which opens up to a colourful complex with outdoor seating, a reception counter that is the replica of a truck hood, and miniature trucks carefully placed in the nooks and corners to give you a feeling of an actual nukkad (street corner). Not to forget how water is served in small ketlis (kettles). Nukkad is beyond a caf and bar. It takes you to the old nostalgic times, and also serves an experience one cherishes forever, shares Kanishk Tuteja, owner of the quirky caf has youngsters frequenting the place for a taste of homefood or to celebrate birthdays  exactly what was going on when I entered.The quirkiness is not limited only to the interiors; the menu too mirrors the same. I started with a glass of Bomb Liit from the Long Island Ice Tea section, which was a combination of vodka, gin, tequila, rum, Triple sec and Red Bull. The taste sweet enough to mellow the bitterness of alcohol.Nukkad is trying out some new innovations and if you are up for some experiments, you can always try the Matka liit which has a twist of masala along with alcohol.For appetisers, I tried the Chicken Tikka Chaat, which was traditional tikka with a tangy flavour of chaat. The perfectly cooked chicken with onion and tomatoes lived up to the theme of the place. Next was the Mushroom Galouti, of small naans accompanying each piece of Galouti. Though Im a huge fan of mushrooms, the dish itself wasnt the best version of itself. It lacked flavour.For the main course, I went with the Rara Gosht, a combination of mutton pieces and mutton kheema. The mutton was well-cooked and went perfectly with the naan. Next, I tried The Asian Market Bowl, full of vegetables, sauce, noodles and rice to choose from. I opted for mix veggies with Spicy Thai sauce and Hakka noodles. The thick Thai sauce, rich in butter and coconut is a must if you enjoy Thai cuisine.For a sweet ending, I had Gulab Jamun with ice cream.Those who want to visit this monsoon, try their special Nukkad Bhelpuri, Vada Pav, Samosas, Pakodas and Railway cutlets.The rain might make the service slow but sitting outside with a glass of your favourite drink will make you forget about these things.As for me, I left with a happy stomach and nostalgic memories, guarded by my umbrella against the rain."

Retail markets took the hit immediately and sellers hiked the prices quoting a dip in the supplies.Vilas Bhujbal, president of Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association, Pune, told TOI that farmers were waiting for the rain. However, it rained so heavily and with such intensity that the tomato fields were waterlogged which destroyed the crop. Among other farm produce, tomatoes have been badly affected, with supplies falling to half of what they were a few days ago, he said.Earlier, there was a drought-like situation in many parts of the state, which had reduced vegetable production. The hard rain also caused some produce to rot and get infected with worms and disease. Around 30-40% of the tomato produce coming into the market is rotten on a daily basis nowadays, he said.An APMC official said the per kg price of tomatoes had dipped to Rs 20 in the wholesale market, but the shortage of produce now has increased prices to Rs 35 per kg in the wholesale market.Vitthal Hanamaghar, a vegetable vendor on NIBM Road, said,  The tomato produce comes other from districts to Pune especially after the rain here since June-end destroyed the crop.

Floods in these places has led to a fall in supply and a rise in prices, a vendor at Six Mile in Guwahati said.In most retail vegetable markets in Guwahati, tomato, brinjal and carrot prices have more than doubled.Brinjal, which cost Rs 30-35/kg earlier, now costs around Rs 60-80. Prices have gone up by Rs 30 to 40 in just 10 days, a vendor in Jalukbari said.Gauhati University student Tanbeer Choudhury said, The high prices are affecting common people like us.In Goalpara district, nearly 80 per cent vegetables come from sar areas like Baladmari, Pakhiura and Ujirersar. However, the supply lines have collapsed during the floods fuelling price rise as vegetables are being brought mostly from neighbouring Meghalaya.Except the flood-free Dhupdhara, Rongjuli and Dudhnoi markets, the other ones in Goalpara town, Bhalukdubi, Lakhipur, Jaleswar, Gaurnagar, Boguan Ambari, Matia, Dolgoma and Sidhabari have seen a rise in price of most vegetables.The recent wave of floods has seriously affected the supply of local vegetables in Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts of Barak Valley, which are now mainly dependent on vegetables brought from Meghalaya.In Upper Assam, 300 vegetable vendors at Mangalbaria Bazar at Doomdooma in Tinsukia district are in despair as buyers are refraining from buying much owing to the exorbitant prices.Dhemaji and Dibrugarh in Assam and East Siang in Arunachal Pradesh get their supply of vegetables and diary products from Kabochapori, Berachapori and Jampani. The devastation caused by floods in those areas has created a shortage of supplies and fluctuation in prices, a source said.Restaurants and sweetmeat shops in Dhemaji and Dibrugarh districts are unable to manufacture quality products as flooding in the sandbars, where the people rear cows and buffalos, has led to a fall in milk production. The dairy farmers had to shift their livestock to higher land where there is a lack of feeding areas.Additional reporting by Vinod Kumar Singh in Dhemaji, Manoj Kumar Ojha in Doomdooma, Satananda Bhattacharjee in Hailakandi and Rokibuz Zaman in Guwahati"

The restaurant also has a private dining area in the basement and a couple of alfresco dining tables under a canopy of lights that is ideal for date nights. The basement also hosts live music gigs, especially for Sunday brunch. We choose a table overlooking the ECR and settle down for a relaxed lunch. Since it is a week day, the crowd is sparse and the music mellow.The menu offers a wide variety: theres quite a selection of Continental and Pan Asian fare to choose from. Given the balmy weather, I skip soup and settle instead for the Zen Garden. A concoction of gin, cucumber and lemon, its a refreshing day-time drink, the kind that you wouldnt mind requesting seconds of.For appetisers, theres prawn tempura, chicken satay and BBQ pork ribs. The prawn tempura wins hands down and is a great dish to pair with my cocktail. Fried in a batter that seems as light as air, the prawns are cooked to perfection and the sweet chilli sauce lends it that extra zing.The BBQ pork ribs arent far behind in the popularity contest with generous layers of lard and lashings of BBQ sauce. A side of grilled veggies is a sensible way to cleanse the palate after all that fat. Of the trio, its the satay that fails to impress with its lacklustre flavour and chewy texture; even the accompanying peanut sauce falls short of expectations. Fortunately chicken suimai makes up for this. Mildly spiced chicken in a tender dimsum wrapping, the suimai are generous and satisfying.As we await the main course, a group of college kids makes its way in and heads straight to the basement; theres a private party on.Fortunately, none of the banter reaches the dining section, nestled on the first floor. Just then the wait staff arrives with bowls of steaming nasi goreng, Thai red curry with prawns and sticky rice, stir-fried lamb in oyster sauce and a spaghetti lamb bolognese.A little overwhelmed by the variety on offer, I reach for the pasta first. The bolognese is redolent with the appealing, fused flavours of lamb and tomato. The nasi goreng though is nothing to write home about. Without the bold flavours of the kecap manis and shrimp paste that usually go into the dish, this feels like just another fried rice.A portion of the stir-fried lamb though helps elevate the nasi goreng a bit. The lamb is succulent and lightly coated in a batter that has soaked up the goodness of oyster sauce.However, Thai red curry with prawns, is the unparalleled star of the meal. Silky coconut milk curry with juicy prawns pairs very well with the sticky rice, but its also the kind that one wouldnt mind eating spoonfuls of by itself.By this time Im rather stuffed, but theres dessert to be had. And I firmly believe that allowances can always be made for something sweet. The first dessert is sticky rice with mango ice cream; usually a winner when paired with mangoes, this one is served with ice cream since the fruit is now out of season and hence doesnt win any favours with us. But then the grand finisher is dark chocolate mousse. Smooth and ever so slightly bitter, its a crowd pleaser. And by the end of this meal, Im feeling rather zen like the laughing Buddha fresco."

Reason: The Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission (KAPC) has advised the farmers to stop growing tomatoes and go in for potatoes or onions instead. The suggestion comes in the wake of the worsening water crisis and depleting groundwater levels in the region. The Commission has written to the state and central governments to change the crop cultivation area.The tomato-growing season is from May to August. Tomatoes are supplied to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, New Delhi, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.Of the total 33,000 hectares under horticultural crop cultivation, 8,000 ha are under tomato cultivation in Kolar. According to horticulture department, on an average, 4 lakh tonnes of tomato per year are cultivated.Farmers in Kolar have to go up to 2,000 feet to get groundwater to grow tomatoes. The commercial crop is high in demand, but farmers are suffering, T N Prakash Kammardi, Chairman, KAPC, told TNIE.Farmers in Kolar have to go up to 2,000 feet to get groundwater to grow tomatoes. The commercial crop is high in demand, but farmers are suffering. So we have suggested that Kolar is no more ideal to grow tomatoes. It has also been suggested that the government look into the issue at the earliest as this plays a vital role in crop pricing, T N Prakash Kammardi, Chairman, KAPC, told TNIE.CR Srinath, CMR Tomato Mandi, APMC Yard, Kolar, said that the proposal was good. Farmers spend around Rs 1 lakh per acre to cultivate tomatoes. This high investment pays off because tomato is a commercial crop. Of late, the farmers are facing many problems. Kolar farmer favour cultivating tomatoes because of the soil and climate. But now the groundwater is contaminated with fluoride and pesticides are being used indiscriminately. Earlier, farmers used to grow potatoes. But they turned to tomatoes as this was more profitable. It looks like now the farmers will have to go back to growing potatoes.The Commission has also suggested that farmers in the Mumbai-Karnataka region drop sugarcane cultivation due to the water crisis. Since sugarcane is a water-intensive crop, the Commission suggested cultivating onion and jowar. Shivashankar Reddy, outgoing agriculture minister, had agreed in principle to these proposals. Now after the fall of the coalition government, the proposals have to wait for the new governments clearance."

But do we know which food is processed or ultra-processed? Is it good or bad for your health? What should one look for when we buy packaged food? Food has to go through some processing before it reaches our plate. For example, the white rice from the paddy field has to be harvested, de-husked and milled before it is ready for consumption. But this is a low or no processed food as this has not undergone any industrial process for it to be processed.But imagine the transformation of a potato from a field to the bag of potato chips or of tomato to a tomato sauce or ketchup. This food has to undergo several industrial processes, such as hydrogenation, hydrolysis, extrusion, frying pretreatment and the addition of different substances  dyes, emulsifiers, texturants, sweeteners and various additives to increase colour, taste, texture, shelf life etc. Ultra-processed food contains five or more ingredients and has a very high sugar or salt content.Common foods we are likely to consume:Breakfast cereal: A 30 gm serving of a popular breakfast cereal for children has 11 gm of sugar in one serving. The list on their package reads: Wheat solids, wheat flour, refined wheat flour, added colour, added salt, artificial cream, added flavour, etc.Granola and cereal bars: A 40-50 gm serving of granola and cereal bar has an added sugar content of 27 gm (equivalent to approximately five teaspoons of sugar) in most packs. The list of ingredients, includes added sugar, oil, honey, salt, molasses, emulsifier, lecithin either from soy of sunflower, raising agent, flavouring agents and sodium bicarbonate.Ready-to-eat food: If you are a person who likes eating hot cooked food, there are many ready to eat (RTE) items in the supermarket. But are they healthy? You may be surprised to know that a RTE item like pongal has 7.5 gm of sugar and 1,800 mg of sodium in a 100 gm serving. Why add sugar in a breakfast item like pongal? World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting salt intake to 5 gm/day which is 2,000 mg sodium. If your RTE convenience food is loaded with salt (1,800 mg no less) it is definitely bad for health.Let us look at some healthy snacksBiscuits: A normal biscuit serving of 23-25 gm (four biscuits) has 30 gm (6 teaspoons) of sugar. Advertisements also recommend it as a healthy breakfast option for children. The list of ingredients has the following: Malt extract, milk solids, liquid glucose, leavening agent, invert syrup, emulsifiers, artificial flavours etc.Dried cranberries (or any dried fruit that is packed): Many believe that dried fruits are good for health, definitely so. Beware if it is packed and marketed as a healthy snack. It is loaded with sugars (73 gm for a 100 gm serving). It contains added sugar and also many added agents to increase shelf life and preservatives."

Definitely a must-try food item at the restaurant.Next we tried the Edamame dim sum, an ingredient that is popular in the East Asian cuisine. Along with a savoury dip, this creamy soybean filling is a great choice for vegetarians. The asparagus and water chestnut crystal dumplings, on the other hand, will be a healthy pick for health-conscious people. Complete with a slight tangy flavour, the triangular dumpling is on the bland side, and will be liked by people who like their food steamed up.Coming to the appetizers, we loved the Crispy Fish Salad in Spicy Sauce, a unique dish topped with onions, coriander leaves, French beans, spring onions, tomatoes and cashews. Like the name says, the fish had been minced, tossed with bread crumbs and deep fried in order to make it thoroughly crisp. The sauce enhanced the flavour, and the dish gets itself placed on one of the must-haves here.In order to make lunch hours faster and easier for working professionals in and around Whitefield, the restaurant has introduced a Make your own bowl concept for this monsoon season. From a variety of noodles to sauces and choice of toppings, the Asian bowl will be rightly put together according to your preference. We chose Pad Thai noodles with chicken and prawns, seasoned with onions, tomatoes, cabbage and spring onions in chilli garlic sauce. We kept it simple and voila, we didnt make a nasty choice of ingredients after all.To end an Asian culinary experience, we took Sang Kaya Ob. It is baked coconut caramel custard and the taste lingers in our taste buds till date.

At first, Meza thought they wanted to be her friends. But her brother clarified: Using Spanish, which she had yet to learn, they were humiliating her, chanting a slur for indigenous Mexicans that rang as strong as the ""n"" word in English.The silver-haired, 72-year-old remembers quizzing her brother in her native Kumiai, now one of the dozens of rapidly disappearing indigenous languages in Latin America.""I asked him what that word, 'indio,' meant,"" the indigenous activist said of how she had not known the term used by some Mexicans to refer to her people, similar to the English ""Indian."" ""But when I started to speak more Spanish and talk with them, I understood the mockery,"" Meza said.These experiences were among the reasons the Kumiai people and other indigenous groups the length of Latin America started teaching their native languages to their children less - to avoid discrimination.Decades later, the racism evident in ""pinche indio"" remains widespread in the region, combining with globalization and technology to threaten with extinction some 170 languages, including the 381-speaker Kumiai, which remains at risk despite efforts by governments and civil society organizations since the mid-20th century.Though language extinction is a ""natural process"" due to the constant transformation of cultures, it comes with a price, said Frdric Vacheron, representative of UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in Mexico.""It is not only words that disappear, it is a perspective, a wealth of cultural practices, a worldview,"" Vacheron said.UNESCO named 2019 the International Year of Indigenous Languages, committing to working with governments and native peoples to rescue endangered and threatened tongues among the 600-some surviving indigenous tongues in the region.Preserving indigenous languages has become a race against the clock. It may be too late.Brazil, the region's most linguistically diverse country, runs the risk of losing a third of its 180-plus languages by 2030. In Mexico, almost two thirds of its 68 languages are on the brink of disappearance. This trend repeats in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Central America.""OUR LANGUAGES ARE MURDERED""In the past decades, some Latin American governments have made efforts to preserve indigenous languages from a decline that has been in process since the arrival of Spanish and Portuguese colonizers five centuries ago.In some cases, government efforts have proven effective. Paraguayan Guarani, one of the two official languages of Paraguay, is still spoken by some 12 million people in South America and nine out of 10 Paraguayans.In 2016, Peru's state broadcaster launched its first program in Quechua, which is spoken by over 10 million people in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. The broadcaster called the Quechuan program ""Nuqanchik"" - the language's word for ""us."" Programs in the languages of Aymara and Ashaninca soon followed.But across the Americas, indigenous activists say the policy shifts are too little, too late. They say it remains impossible to navigate most countries using indigenous languages, and a number blame governments.""Our languages don't die, they are murdered. The Mexican state has erased them,"" said Yasnaya Aguilar, who speaks Mixe, the mother tongue of some 90,000 people in southwest Mexico.Aguilar spoke in Mixe to the Mexican Congress in February, blaming discriminatory education, health and justice systems for the loss.NO WORD FOR ""COMPUTER""Gasoda Surui, an anthropologist from the Suru-Pater tribe in the jungles of Brazil, said technology was a challenge for his language, the almost-extinct Tupi-Monde. It has about 200 speakers - and no term for internet, telephone, computer or car.""We feel the threat from all sides: cultural, environmental, territorial and linguistic,"" Gasoda said. He confessed that in his village people sometimes forget crucial words in Tupi-Monde, and everyone is bilingual with Portuguese.In the past five centuries, more than 1,000 languages disappeared in Brazil. The government only recognized the right of indigenous people to use their native languages in 1988.Elsewhere, even widely spoken tongues like Quechua face problems when it comes to the language of technology.Former Peruvian congressman Jose Linares was contracted to implement new technologies in 12 schools back in 1996. But while one of the schools spoke majority Quechua, the programming language he was meant to teach, Logo, was only in Spanish.At the time, an indignant Linares pulled a team together to translate the Logo program into Quechua. Members of his teaching institute have done the same with its successor, Scratch. But Linares thinks Quechua needs more than translation - to develop science and technology terms that do not currently exist - so he created a Quechua dictionary with the new vocabulary.""We have to improve Quechua so that its speakers can really live in it,"" the 76-year-old Linares said.Like Quechua, Nahuatl was a dominant language in the Americas. It had been the lingua franca across Mesoamerica from the 5th century until the arrival of the Spaniards, and continued to be spoken and studied after colonization.Unlike Meza's beloved Kumiai, Nahuatl is still written and spoken extensively, and is not at imminent risk of disappearing. Spanish has taken at least 200 words from the Nahuatl vocabulary. Some, like ""tomatl,"" meaning tomato, and ""chocolatl,"" or chocolate, have left their mark on English.But although it still has 1.5 million speakers, it once had many more.""My parents taught me a little, but I never mastered it,"" said Miguel Escobar, a student in his final year at a high school in Ecatepec, a municipality near Mexico City. ""I wish I had learned more; I don't understand my own grandparents.""(Reporting by Diego Ore and Lizbeth Diaz; additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Luis Jaime Acosta in Bogota, Mara Cervantes and Marco Aquino in Lima, Mariel Cristaldo in Asuncion and Nelson Rentera in San Salvador; writing by Rebekah F Ward; Editing by Leslie Adler)This story has not been edited by The Times of India and is autogenerated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.(This story has not been edited by timesofindia.com and is autogenerated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)"
2019-07-28,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wild-elephants-under-stress-in-koundinya-sanctuary-in-chittoor/article28740091.ece,Wild elephants under stress in Koundinya sanctuary in Chittoor,"The death of three wild elephants in a couple of months in Koundinya wildlife sanctuary zone in Kuppam and Palamaner forest ranges is viewed as a clear indication that the pachyderms are facing stressful conditions, believed to be due to fodder and water crisis and gradual loss of their habitat, as the 500 sq km of the sanctuary is facing threat of encroachments and denudation.Ever since the appearance of the Asian elephant species at tri-State Kuppam junction in early 1980s, the forests of Kuppam and Palamaner ranges have turned into a haven for the jumbos, which kept once again criss-crossing their traditional inter-State corridor in Kuppam flanked by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.According to forest officials, three different herds had emerged into the tri-State junction, breaking away from the forests of north-western TN bordering Karnataka. While one herd had entered the Seshachalam biosphere through Piler division, the second one became permanent residents of Koundinya forests (which later became a sanctuary) and the third one became migrant dwellers along the corridor.At present, it is estimated that as many as 42 wild elephants, including half-a-dozen animals below the age of 10 years, residing at the sanctuary. Since two decades, the menace of elephants getting electrocuted has surfaced in the two ranges, particularly in Ramakuppam, V.Kota and Baireddipalle mandals. After a series of awareness camps, the menace of arranging live electric wires in the fields to prevent the pachyderms had come down, but the cables dangling across the fields at low heights still continues, becoming the prime cause for jumbo deaths.There are also allegations that the Forest Department had not executed the elephant proof trenches and solar fencing scientifically leaving porous stretches at the forest fringe villages, making the elephants to make an easy intrusion into human habitations. The summer heat of 2019, considered to be the worst in Chittoor district in four decades, had forced a number elephants to stray away from the sanctuary and resort to trampling of fields in search of fodder and water. Four months ago, two elephants had left the sanctuary and travelled as far as Kallur close to Seshachalam biosphere, though made a retreat later, but throwing the farmers in several villages in panic. A three-member herd too had left the sanctuary and lingered at the neighbouring Madanapalle and Punganur ranges for over a month recently.Of the three jumbos killed in June and July, the forest officials confirmed that two had occurred due to infighting among herds inside the sanctuary which borders with T.N. While some officials attribute the cause of infighting due to shortage of fodder, others say it is due to fighting to win a female.Staff shortageLack of staff at the beat and sector levels has become a major problem in monitoring the movement of jumbos along the forest fringe villages. The project of insulating the sanctuary with trenches and fences continues to be delayed even after a decade of its launch.Avoid traditional cropsThe Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West), Sunil Kumar Reddy, who took charge a couple of weeks ago, had sought the farmers to desist from traditional crops of sugarcane, paddy and tomatoes, which proved a big lure for wild elephants, and replace them with others like mulberry and chilli plantations, for the time being. It would help keep the pachyderms at bay and over a period of time the menace of crop invasion would come down, the official felt, further adding that the works pertaining to trenches and fencing around the sanctuary would be given top priority."
2019-07-29,https://www.thehindu.com/society/this-deaf-training-centre-in-santhome-is-in-need-of-better-care/article28747715.ece,This deaf training centre in Santhome is in need of better care,"The group of men and women at the Training Centre for the Adult Deaf in Santhome has broken into a flurry of signs and urgent motioning. You can sense that inside jokes are being cracked. This is in response to the question, Who is the best cook here? and no one believes he/she deserves the title.The centre is home to 10 men, between the ages of 18 and 25, from cities such as Salem, Erode, Coimbatore and Tirupur.We have come here because this city can give us a platform to show our talents, signs Manikandan, a 20-year-old from Thirupur, whos been here for the past one year. The centres PRO, Chitra Devi, acts as our translator for the day. She also acts as a guardian for the four women students of the centre, and stays with them at a rented house nearby.The men and women here are trained in different areas such as computer operations (data entry), sports including chess, badminton, and athletics, designing and graphics, and on the weekends, photography and dance, by volunteers. However its USP: the two-year fitter course for the deaf and dumb, is the one that gets the maximum placements.Dilapidated roomsEven though the building was turned into a training centre only in 1970, it had been operational as a school under Madras Association of the Deaf since 1944. Earlier, there would only be school-level education here. Then this training centre for adults was opened to ensure that the education also translated into jobs, signs G Sridharan, treasurer for the centre and member of Madras Association of the Deaf.Inside the centre, the walls betray the buildings age. Artworks by students hanging in the front room provide the only pop of colour in an otherwise drab space. Sunlight streaming in from multiple windows illuminates the building in spots where the house pets, a cat and a dog, lie. The classroom however, is well lit  a board outside declares it is a fitter class, and inside are lathe and cutting machines used to teach skills like sawing, cutting and putting minor industrial equipment together.This classroom currently also doubles up as a place for the students to sleep. Technically, the building has two floors  the upper floor is supposed to be their bedroom. However, in the absence of a fan, the students have taken to sleeping in either the front room, or the classroom, leaving the upper floor, and the cracked staircase that leads up to it, as a storage space alone.We are looking for more funds to come in, signs Meenakshi Sundaram, Vice President of Madras Association of the Deaf. We need to improve the condition of the walls, and pay a higher salary to the faculty and other staff like the watchman.Both Meenakshi and Sridharan were students here themselves, in the 1976-78 and 1977-79 batches. They fondly remember their former teacher, Venugopalan, an ex-IT engineer. He taught 25 of us in one class, signs Meenakshi. Adds Chitra, Since the past eight years or so, the admissions are down to less than 10 students in one year. Out of those 10, about eight get placed.No dearth of talentNineteen-year-old Sudhish proudly pushes forward a heavy bunch of certificates he has received over the years for his athletic achievements. I love dancing as well, signs Sudhish. This August, adds Chitra, Sudhish and his team will be performing at the finals of Chennai Got Talent. She shows a video of him, dancing to the Mersal song in perfect rhythm. Bhoomi Trust, an NGO, comes to teach them every Sunday, says Chitra.Manikandan, who has just played at the State-level Chess Championship for the Deaf, claims he wants to be a photographer. Every weekend morning, the men head to the beaches to practise their photography skills. Srivatsan Sankaran, founder of Madras Photo Bloggers is acting as their voluntary trainer. I want to help make the process of mainstreaming deaf communities easier, says Srivatsan, who himself has a hearing impairment. The students seem to have taken quite a liking to him  around his presence, each claims to want to be a photographer.Meanwhile, as the students prepare their evening tea, the debate over who is the best chef has come to a rest. Manikandan makes the best khichdi, but Lakshmi makes the best tomato rice, they decide unanimously.Training Centre for the Adult Deaf can be reached at 24641035."
2019-07-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/these-greens-veggies-are-slow-poison-5862118/,"These greens, veggies are ‘slow poison’","For those who love their leafy greens and farm fresh vegetables, heres some bad news. If youve been consuming the vegetables grown along the banks of Buddha Nullah, you better rush to a doctor for a medical check-up. Chances are you might be suffering from at least one disease caused by heavy metals.AdvertisingSounds ominous? This is what a research study by a PhD scholar and an associate professor at the Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, has found.The study  Bioaccumulation of heavy metals and biochemical changes induced in vegetables irrigated by waste water at Buddha Nullah agricultural sites (Punjab)  has found heavy metal contamination in the vegetables irrigated with waste water from Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana.At least 60 per cent of 200 persons who have been consuming these veggies and were surveyed, were found suffering from at least one disease  kidney failure, premature births, skin allergies, breast and gastrointestinal cancer, heart diseases and mental disorder  caused by heavy metals.AdvertisingJagdev Singh, PhD scholar in botany who along with Dr Anand Mohan, Associate Professor, department of biosciences and bioengineering, LPU, conducted the study, said, The heavy metal concentration in vegetable grown along Buddha Nullah was found at least 10 times more than permissible limits. Also, more persons consuming these vegetables (irrigated with waste water from nullah) were found suffering from related diseases than those consuming vegetables grown in normal fields irrigated with normal bore water.The study concluded that the regular consumption of vegetables grown near Buddha Nullah can cause detrimental effects to the human population. The consumption of leafy and root vegetables from the fields near Buddha Nullah should be restricted and continuous monitoring of vegetables from these sites should be done.Jagdev Singh said that over a period of two years, random samples of four vegetables  radish (root), tomato (fruit), caulifower (stem) and spinach (leafy)  were taken from the fields on Buddha Nullah road (near Mota Singh Nagar where at least 45 farmers grow vegetables).The heavy metal content in the samples was compared to vegetables irrigated with normal water. Also, two groups of 200 persons  one consuming the vegetables irrigated with Buddha Nullah water and the other with normal water  were surveyed. To have one controlled sample, I also cultivated a field along the Nullah and irrigated it with polluted water, he added.At least 60 per cent of 200 persons, which included families of some farmers, were found suffering from at least one disease whereas prevalence of diseases was much lower (20 per cent) among population consuming veggies grown away from Buddha Nullah, he said. Also, the heavy metal content in veggies grown away from Buddha Nullah was found below than permissible limits, he added.The study found 11.80 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) of cadmium, 29.6 mg/kg of chromium and 7.10 mg/kg of lead in radish grown near the Nullah. The cauliflowers grown near the nullah were found having 6.80 mg/kg cadmium, 7.2 mg/kg chromium and 2.5 mg/kg lead. The tomatoes had 6 mg/kg cadmium, 6.8 mg/kg chromium and 2.3 mg/kg lead. The spinach leaves grown near nullah had the highest 12.5 mg/kg cadmium, 16 mg/kg chromium and 4.5 mg/kg lead.This is way higher than the permissible limits of 0.10 mg/kg cadmium, 0.50 mg/kg chromium and 0.50 mg/kg lead, as specified by the World Health Organization (WHO).The heavy metal concentration in the waste waters of Buddha Nullah which is used for irrigating these veggies, was: Arsenic 0.08 milligram/litre (mg/l), Cadmium : 0.98 mg/l, Chromium: 3.02 mg/l and Lead : 0.3 mg/l whereas the permissible levels are Arsenic : 0.01 mg/l, Cadmium : 0.03 mg/l, Chromium : 0.05mg/l and Lead : 0.01 mg/l. (as per WHO).The black waters of 14-kilometer heavily polluted stream, carrying untreated industrial effluents, domestic sewage waste and solid waste, passing from Ludhiana city, mix with clean waters of river Sutlej at village Walipur Kalan.Reality-check: A dirty stream and an unfulfilled promiseThe 14-km stream running through the industrial city Ludhiana, carries waste from dyeing units, domestic sewage waste and garbage dumped by people. This further pollutes river Sutlej, which even farmers from Rajasthan have objected to.Further, most projects announced to clean it have remained on paper. The latest attempts include the Special Task Force (STF) formed by Captain Amarinder Singh under Namdhari sect head Thakur Uday Singh along with roping in of the Tata group by Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu. However, on the ground, all that Ludhiana Municipal Corporation is doing is the annual de-silting to clear choked stream during monsoons for which just Rs 1 crore is kept in annual MC budget. Finance Minister Manpreet Badal also announced sum of Rs 4.38 crore in 2019-20 budget to clean it but superintending engineer, MC, Ravinder Garg said, We have not received any funds other than annual de-silting budget.AdvertisingThe National Green tribunal (NGT) monitoring committee, formed in April 2019 to monitor pollution in Sutlej and Beas, is expected to start real-time quality check soon, as told by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to Punjab and Haryana High Court."
2019-07-31,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/from-staples-to-high-value-produce-promoting-crop-diversification-for-doubling-farmers-income-5867717/,From staples to high-value produce: Promoting crop diversification for doubling farmers’ income,"Ramkishan, till two years ago, grew paddy and wheat on his one-acre land. This farmer, from Selawan village in Bindki tehsil of Uttar Pradeshs Fatehpur district, has no smart-phone or bank credit access. With an annual household earning below Rs 50,000 (until recently), he represents the millions of smallholders in India, stuck in traditional cultivation methods due to inability to avail knowledge and institutional credit.AdvertisingPrime Minister Narendra Modi, in early 2016, called for doubling farmers incomes by 2022. Meeting that goal requires improving farm productivity and price realisations, especially of smallholders, through dissemination of information relating to agronomic practices as well as marketing. Unfortunately, there is an acute dearth of extension workers to bridge this vital lab-to-land gap. UP alone has a mere 7,500 extension workers for 2.33 crore farmers, translating into a ratio of 1:3,000, as against a recommended 1:750. Moreover, roughly three-fourths of rural Indian households have no smart-phones or internet access. They are practically unaware of prevailing market trends or good agricultural practices and, hence, forced to continue growing low-value staples. Any plan for doubling farmers incomes must rely on massively intensifying last-mile extension work.Agriculture technology dissemination has drawn significant investor interest in recent years. A host of agritech start-ups today employ the farming-as-a-service model to provide custom hiring of equipment, crop protection and marketing services. But these are mostly tech-based innovations that do not reach three-fourths of our rural masses. Contract farming, too, helps predominantly large growers, who can make continuous supplies to food processing companies. The same goes for microcredit; the strong 30% plus growth rates posted by the industry co-relates very little with increased agricultural productivity.Farming is ultimately a business that is prone to both weather and market price risk. The higher risk involved, therefore, makes private sector investors seek much greater returns compared to other sectors. What we need is strong non-profit or hybrid structures that prioritise returns beyond profit through provision of efficient microcredit and continuous knowledge-sharing, particularly targeting smallholder farmers.AdvertisingSwayam Farmer Foundation is a non-profit organisation that provides end-to-end training and agri-input financing to smallholders, to enable crop diversification and sustainable cultivation practices, resulting in higher incomes. Our approach has been to get farmers to grow horticultural crops, by training them on proper sowing, irrigation, nutrient management, plant protection and harvesting methods  including through weekly visits and monitoring by field officers  and making available quality inputs on credit. We have been able to establish that with access to knowledge and credit for quality inputs, farmers can cultivate higher-value crops and increase their incomes by not just two, but 4-5 times.Ramkishan previously spent around Rs 10,000 on seed, fertiliser, water and labour for growing wheat on one acre. Even with 2 tonnes yield and Rs 18/kg realisation, his net return wasnt more than Rs 26,000. But by planting cauliflower, entailing an expenditure of Rs 25,000, hes now producing 8-10 tonnes from the same land  and earning up to Rs 1.5 lakh by selling this crop at Rs 16-18/kg. Moreover, the cultivation cycle for most vegetables is 3-4 months, whereas the wheat season is 4-5 months. Recently, Ramkishan also grew bitter gourd on half-an-acre, incurring costs of Rs 12,000 and harvesting 4 tonnes produce that he sold for Rs 18-20/kg, netting about Rs 64,000.For smallholders like Ramkishan, the growing consumer demand for fruits and vegetables, as opposed to cereals, presents an opportunity for more than doubling their incomes. That, however, requires the right kind of interventions. Under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, the government extends 90% subsidy on micro-irrigation for small and marginal farmers. But drip irrigation systems costs Rs 60,000 or so per acre. How many farmers can invest this money upfront, even if reimbursed within a month? Swayam provides short-term finance to farmers to purchase and install these systems, which can deliver about 70 per cent water savings (vis--vis traditional flood irrigation) and also boost crop yields through localised application and reduced leaching of nutrients.An integrated model of training and financing can go a long way in enhancing the agricultural productivity of smallholders. Such a strategy can be effectively deployed to grow crops that command better prices and meet changing food consumption demands. But there is also the issue of price fluctuations, more so in fruits and vegetables, which needs addressing. Crop prices in India tend to follow a cobweb model: If tomato prices are high this season, large numbers of farmers will grow it the next season. That results in a production glut and crash in prices, which, then, induces farmers to plant less and causing rates to spiral again.The above herd mentality is what farmers need to be warned against. The risks of production gluts can be significantly moderated if farmers continuously diversify their cropping patterns from season to season. With availability of real-time data on prices across mandis and also sale of seeds, it would be possible to ascertain the likely acreage under a particular crop. A crop recommendation service can be provided accordingly, thereby mitigating herd behaviour and enabling farmers to make more informed sowing choices.Swayam is currently working with 250 farmer families in Fatehpur and they have experienced 4x income increases. We believe our model of promoting crop diversification  which also leads to improved soil fertility, more efficient water and nutrient usage, and lower insect, weed and disease pressure  is replicable across Indias 115 aspirational districts (that includes Fatehpur). Our target is to reach one lakh farmers by 2023.Such targeted interventions, however, need active government support. The least that can be done is to make it easier for non-profit organisations to work in agriculture: Registering a non-profit with necessary compliances today takes at least 10 times longer than in the case of a for-profit organisation. We need a grassroots movement to build strong last-mile information connectivity with farmers, who, even with smart-phones and internet, require customisation and direct handholding for effectively utilising tech tools. If the likes of Ramkishan are to have a real chance to grow out of poverty, it calls for a far more robust collaboration of government, private sector and civil society.The writer is founder and CEO of Swayam Farmer Foundation"

If the likes of Ramkishan are to have a real chance to grow out of poverty, it calls for a far more robust collaboration of government, private sector and civil society.The writer is founder and CEO of Swayam Farmer Foundation"

Sarjapura Curries was all about the distribution of plants such as native tomato, brinjal and beans varieties, six types of sessile joyweed, Malabar spinach, hounds berry and more, to the women of Volagerakallahalli village and people who showed up from the city. The event started at 1pm and went on till 7pm as people kept coming to get their saplings. Kumar wants more people to start having kitchen gardens as he feels that a lot of the natural vegetation is perishing because of rising infrastructure. He says one can cultivate vegetables at home instead.Sarjapura has witnessed a lot of corporate and residential infrastructural development, which has taken up a lot of farming land, he says. He has been working with the Janani Abhiruddhi Sva Sahaya Sangha, a womens collective from Volegerakallahalli, in growing green leafy vegetables. We are 14 women. We grow green leafy vegetables at home as these plants are good for our health. A person learns by looking at the actions of another and this way, I hope many people will grow plants in their own house after getting inspired from us, says Ashwathamma, president of the Sangha.Kumar feels gardening and composting is a great way to bring people together. From the past few months, he worked towards setting up a nursery near the village and has given seeds and plants to anyone who comes by. Manasa, a woman from the village who is also a gardener, adds,We grow carrots, radish and drumstick leaves at home, apart from the normal greens, and these are good for our health. Kumar says he will be involved in this project for the next year and has plans to start planting trees near the village lake as well."

The tribal village under Saptasajya panchayat with a population of around 300 used to supply vegetables to Dhenkanal town, Athagarh and Bhubaneswar. But after the project went defunct, a large part of population is now involved in daily wage labour for livelihood.The people are forced to walk five km to catch bus or auto-rickshaw and then travel rest five km to reach district headquarters town to earn wages, said 60-year-old Sundar Barsha of the village.Sources said in 1986-87, the soil conservation wing of Agriculture department had set up a watershed project over a natural stream flowing from Saptasajya hills to irrigate around 300 acre land in the village. A bund was also constructed to store stream water for the purpose.With the help and support of a voluntary organisation Samajika Seva Sadan, villagers were encouraged to start vegetable cultivation round the year. Within a few years, the village became popular for supply of fresh vegetables like tomato, brinjal, potato, ladies finger and greens to urban markets. Even vendors and vegetable wholesalers were directly procuring their produce from the farm fields.While the reservoir has lost its water retention capacity because of accumulated silt, water failed to reach tail-end due to non-renovation of canals and pipeline, forcing farmers to stop cultivation in 2015, said farmers.Another farmer Bhanja Tudu said their economic condition has started deteriorating due to non-functioning of the watershed project. The piped-water supply system has been damaged and its regulators are not functioning at several places. Despite several requests to the Sadar Block Development Officer (BDO) and irrigation officials, no step has been taken to restore the project, he added.Sources said the district administration has sufficient funds under the Modified Area Development Agency (MADA) which can be utilised to renovate the project but to no avail.District Welfare Officer (DWO) M R Mishra said, We are not aware about the plight of the farmers. The project will be revived soon with the help of a self-help group.Dhenkanal Sub-Collector S M Pradhan said he is not aware of MADA fund. However, he assured to look into the matter."

2019-08-04,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/who-is-mustafa/article28813236.ece,Friendship Day special | Decoding AR Rahman's hit song 'Mustafa Mustafa',"Its been 23 years, but this Tamil song still occupies a place of pride as the most iconic friendship song of our times. No school/ college farewell, reunion party, why, or even a random family gathering is complete without the track playing at some point. And today, on Friendship Day, the lyrics and music echo not just in Tamil Nadu, but all over the country!Also read: How kothavaranga evolved into Mustafa MustafaWe are talking about Mustafa Mustafa of course: a song unparalleled in its popularity two decades since its inception, a staple Rahman favourite at any concert and one that echoes his astonishing arrival onto the Indian music scene in the 90s.With lyrics by Vaali, the song appears in the Kadhal Desam soundtrack that also featured other hits like Kalluri Salai and O Vennila. The film was directed by Kathir, and starred Vineeth, Abbas and Tabu in the lead roles and earned them massive fandom in Tamil Nadu.However, Mustafa Mustafa still remains one of the best memories from the film, for a variety of reasons: Rahmans lilting vocals (that listeners were still discovering and falling in love with) and music; Vaalis intense yet easy-to-latch onto lyrics that struck a chord with the youth; the incredible chemistry between Abbas and Vineeth (yes, why cant there be chemistry in bromance?) throughout the song  lets admit it, we all wanted to smash tomatoes and eggs on each others faces and light up candles before a concert stage; and the beautifully-crafted visuals by director Kathir which had everyone nostalgic over their old, new or forgotten friendships.This Friendship Day, we talk to those associated with filming this gem that has transcended across generations. Here is Mustafa Mustafa decoded:A.R. Rahman, composer and singer:Who is Mustafa? (laughs) Usually, I use a dummy lyric when I compose and used the word Mustafa for the opening tune. Lyricist Vaali liked it, and said that we could retain it. In fact, for the July Pirakum, Juniorukum Seniorukum lines, I used the dummy words kothavaranga kothavaranga while in the basic tune stage!A.R RahmanI have many Mustafas in my life I have a friend called Aslam Mustafa, whom Ive known for 35 years. Theres another Mustafa, a friend based in Singapore. Mustafa is a very common name I thought of while doing this number; theres actually a Queen song titled Mustapha as well.Also read: 'MeToo has to happen. Everyone has a mother, sister or a daughter,' says A.R. RahmanKathir, director:Friendship is present in every human relationship, and I wanted to make an entire film revolving around that. Kadhal Desam was essentially the story of three friends  Vineeth, Abbas and Tabu  and I wanted it to have a friendship anthem.A.R. Rahman was very inspired by the idea, and we travelled extensively for the making of the song, before freezing on Mustafa Mustafa. This songs filming was unique as well  I did not separately reserve a few days exclusively for it and shoot it. Instead, because Mustafa Mustafa was always on my mind, whenever I was filming my talkie sequences and spotted something unique, Id get the actors to change their dress and shoot them having casual banter. Except the candlelight farewell day sequence, every shot in Mustafa Mustafa was separately done wherever we filmed the movie.Vineeth, actor:The credit goes completely to Rahman sir for making the song magical and Kathir sirs filmmaking which makes it relevant even today. Everyone who watched the song could relate to it so much; thats what makes it a favourite after two decades also.Theres a strange incident I remember about shooting the song: all of us were at Presidency College to shoot the farewell scene in Mustafa One of the supporting dancers got into an argument with a small kid from the nearby slum who had wandered onto the shooting premises. Within minutes, the kid brought a whole gang of people from the slum who were threatening to wreck the area! Abbas and I had to be whisked off secretly lest we get injured, and the shoot had to be postponed to another day.However, looking back at it now, guess all that trouble was worth it! The song is truly unforgettable."

After entering the Chowdepalle mandal, the herd had slowly moved into Somala mandal, reaching as far as Pedda Upparapalle and borders of Irala mandal, 60 km from the sanctuary belt.A three-member herd had left the sanctuary in early June and after playing havoc in the fields had retreated after a month. In May, two elephants had left the Koundinya and went as far as Pakala mandal, 70 km away from the sanctuary, but retreating without creating any difficulty to the Forest Department.A farmer of Avulapalle panchayat deplored that the elephants had destroyed his standing crop of tomato in over 15 acres, causing a loss of several lakhs of rupees. Over 20 farmers of the adjoining villages came out with woes of losing their crops. The menace of wild elephants moving close to the human habitations is posing a threat to the free movement of farmers in the fields and the schoolchildren as well, the villagers said.When the big herd struck the region, it was earlier thought that they were from the Seshachalam forests and might have used the path of Rangampeta-Mangalampeta road. However, clarity emerged among the forest officials that the herd was from the Koundinya sanctuary of the western belt.Precautionary measuresForest Range Officer (Punganur), Govinda Rajulu, told The Hindu that farmers had been complaining of the crop losses since 10 days. We are taking precautionary measures to prevent the herd from moving into human habitations. We are waiting for the herd to retreat into the sanctuary, but we have deployed watchers and trackers to divert the animals back into their habitats, he said."

Imports from Pakistan declined by 92 per cent to $2.84 million in March this year compared to $34.61 million in March 2018, according to the commerce ministry data.India imported goods such as cotton, fresh fruits, cement, petroleum products and mineral ore from Pakistan.

The country has repealed a security exception clause of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to withdraw this status. Both the countries are members of this body.India can also restrict trade of certain goods and impose port-related restrictions on Pakistani goods. India had granted the MFN status to Pakistan way back in 1996, but the neighbouring country had not reciprocated.Under the MFN pact, a WTO member country is obliged to treat the other trading nation in a non-discriminatory manner, especially with regard to customs duty and other levies."
2019-08-08,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/this-them-restaurant-lets-you-eat-and-swear-like-a-pirate/article28896806.ece,This theme restaurant in Chennai lets you eat and swear like a pirate,"For me, Talk Like A Pirate Day has arrived earlier than usual this year  just so you know, the day is celebrated on September 19. I am aboard The Black Pearl, a pirate-themed buffet restaurant at Sholinganallur junction on Old Mahabalipuram Road. With pirate caps on sale and an ongoing selfie contest, the restaurant intends to get its guests to participate in the theme.So, blimey! Why am I still talkin like a landlubber, and not like the true-blue sea dog that I am?I am just settlin in and the mobile beeps. Shiver me timbers, its a WhatsApp video call from my brood. I ignore it, thanks to the wisdom of the seas. As my two kids love role-playing games, I am not showing them where I am, and risking a cold reception later at home.With what looks like a labouriously-crafted decor offering vignettes of life aboard a pirate ship and statues and busts of characters from Pirates of the Caribbean, The Black Pearl creates a world of make-believe and role-playing that should naturally appeal to children. The evidence is not far to be seen: At the next table, the excitement on a childs face proves it.As I travel on The Black Pearl on a Monday, there is piped music, with the selection expectedly restricted to English songs (a live band plays on other days). The sounds are a tad too loud for my comfort. It can be an irritant while I am trying to catch up on scuttlebutt (gossip in my seafarers parlance) with my fellow liquor-guzzling buccaneers.Aaarrrggghhh! Now, the Pirate Tavern is a let-down. It presents a sight that a sailor of my stripes can never appreciate. Mocktails flow freely where liquor should. Joel Rajadurai, manager of the restaurant, explains, The liquor licence is expected to come, tentatively, before the end of August. Until then, it will be only mocktails.Now, the food is marked by variety, but sticks to the tried and tested, largely staying in Indian waters. In the main vegetarian section, the paneer Kolhapuri and pineapple sadam have been interestingly made and the results match the efforts. Paneer Kolhapuri is spicy without being hard on the oesophagus and stomach  and that comes from someone who battles GERD (a gastroesophageal issue). I learn that freshly-ground cashewnut paste takes the edge off the spices, which include Kashmiri chilli powder.Pineapple sadam, said to be a new addition to the menu, seems set to run for many weeks. Besides pineapple slices, peanuts and roasted channa dal are significant flavours apparent in the dish that is garnished with curry leaves.In the non-vegetarian main course, kozhi varutha curry packs a punch. Marinated chicken is sauted with onion and tomato sauce along with Indian spices. Mustard fish curry is bland in a nice way: catla fish is fried in mustard oil, and the gravy prepared with mustard sauce. The egg masala, though, can be improved upon: it comes with a gravy that is right for rice, but too thick for rotis.One gets a sense of a large spread, at the very beginning with the starters, which alone are served.For those choosing non-vegetarian fare, there is an on-table barbecue grill, with its offerings to choose from. The appetizers, small-eats and desserts section seems to beat the rest, in terms of items. There are dedicated counters for chaats and pizzas.The desserts section, with its sugar-overloaded shakarpara, jalebi with rabri and paan ice cream, closes the dining experience with a taste that is likely to linger on."

This is expected to go up once the formal trade ban is effected.ALSO READ| India's illegal move to revoke Article 370 will destroy regional peace, says Pakistan PM Imran KhanDespite tension between the two nations, total trade between the neighbours had risen by 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 to USD 2.56 billion, with India selling USD 2.07 billion worth of goods to its neighbour and Pakistan selling about USD 495 million worth of goods to India.The trade ban will have a marginal impact partly as trade would be pushed through Dubai and partly as the volume of trade is very low. However, border trade through Wagah in farm commodities such as tomatoes and onions will be left out in the cold as they cannot be transported through third countries, said Prof Biswajit Dhar of JNU.The major exports sent from India to Pakistan include raw cotton, cotton yarn, chemicals, plastics, manmade yarn and dyes.

We supply seven lakh litres milk to Mumbai and three lakh to Pune. This has come to standstill as the roads from Kolhapur are all closed, said D V Ghanekar, managing director, the Kolhapur Zilla Dudh Utpadak Sangha or Gokul, one of the major suppliers for Mumbai. Currently, milk available in Mumbai has come from Karnataka and Gujarat.Prices of vegetables and fruits have also been hiked. For example, a kg of tomato, priced at 50 on Tuesday is now 80; a kg of green peas now costs 160 as against 100; a kg of pomegranates costs 120 from 100; and a kg of brinjal is 80 as against 60. According to Sanjay Pansare, former director, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), the number of trucks transporting vegetables and fruits to APMC has dropped considerably.

Now, even that is set to stop after Pakistan announced the suspension of bilateral trade.Meanwhile, a question mark remains over the Samjhauta Express train which was stopped on Thursday by Pakistan on their side of the border. Pakistan, however, has not intimated India about the suspension of the service.""Trade with Pakistan across the Attari-Wagah border had been reduced to a trickle, especially after the post-Pulwama levy of 200 per cent trade tariff on goods by India. The present developments in Kashmir will further vitiate business sentiment for cross border trade. Empty godowns, stray dogs and unemployed contract labour define the border outposts as of now, says Gunbir Singh, ex-Chairman, CII Punjab and President, Dilbir Foundation.Commissioner of Customs at Amritsar, Deepak Gupta said, ""Trade between India and Pakistan is normal as of now. Goods from Afghanistan also came at the Integrated Check Post (ICP).""Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association President Anil Mehra said, ""India is not going to be impacted by the suspension of bilateral trade. It is Pakistan which is going to be hit. Pakistan imports vegetables like tomatoes, spices like ginger and other items from India through the Attari-Wagah route whenever they face shortages. Now, with the decision to suspend trade ties, it will be difficult to meet their demand for vegetables.""He said the import of dry dates and other dry fruits from Afghanistan would be impacted.""Traders in India only import cement, gypsum and rock salt which is already available here. So we are not going to be adversely impacted by Pakistan's move,' he said.Chairman of PHD Chamber of Commerce (Punjab) RS Sachdeva said, ""Trade has come at a standstill. Hardly anything is being imported or exported. If the same situation continues, traders will face huge losses. Despite tensions, both governments should keep the trade momentum going.The Samjhauta Express between Delhi and Lahore with 117 passengers (41 Pakistani nationals and 76 Indians) on board reached Delhi early on Friday morning five hours behind schedule. The train was standing on the Wagah side of the intentional border as Pakistan refused to take it inside Indian territory citing security reasons. It was brought by an Indian engine from the zero line to Attari.The train runs between both countries on Monday and Thursday. ""We do not know if the train will come from Pakistan on Monday or not. As of now, it is expected to come as Pakistan has not officially intimated that it has suspended the train service, said a senior railway officer.Officials also said there were no passengers on the Amritsar-Nankana Sahib bus on Friday. Usually, there are five to ten passengers but due to the prevailing tensions, the bus went empty."

Meanwhile, drinking water bottles, originally priced between Rs 15 and Rs 20, are fetching as much as Rs 50 here.Other kitchen staples have also become pricier. In the heart of the city, tomatoes and green chillies are being sold for Rs 200 and Rs 400 per kg respectively. A week ago, these vegetables were sold for less than Rs 50 per kg. The flood situation is going to stay for another week. Who is going to control these prices? Nobody is keeping an eye on this exploitation, said Viraj Shinde, a businessman from the Vakarbagh area of Sangli.However, even people who have the means to pay the premium rates are struggling as swiping machines are not being used for these transactions, and cash is in short supply. ATMs are not functioning and the brick and mortar banks have remained closed over the past four days in Sangli city. Even telecom services have been hampered and Internet network is very patchy.Many shopkeepers and restauranteurs, particularly those operating from Kupwad, parts of Miraj and villages along the national highway 4 (NH4), are overcharging for the essentials, said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named. The short supply and high demand for these items, especially among the residents of the flood-affected areas are the reasons. Moreover, all taluka, district administration and police personnel are currently engaged in rescue and relief operations and there is no agency to mitigate this situation, the officer told TOI.The ATMs here have run out of cash. Swiping machines are not being used for transactions. How can we buy the necessary items? The district administration is providing relief to the flood-affected people, but life across the district has been disturbed, said Abhay Karnale, a resident of Hirabagh.Thousands of flood-hit people who shifted to hotels and lodges are also feeling the brunt. Because of the high demand, hoteliers and lodge owners have increased the accommodation charges. They are charging double the room rent. These businessmen must help the needy citizens, added Shinde, who had to move to lodge after his house got submerged.Vendors: Transporters charging extra Some of the wholesale vendors from places that were not affected by the flood said they have got supplies  but at a heftier cost  from the neighbouring districts like Satara, Solapur and Pune.The city is completely cut off and vehicles carrying the provisions are stranded on the highway. Also, due to the excessive rainfall across the state, the overall vegetable supply is short. There is a huge mismatch in demand and supply. As a result, prices of essential items are high, said a grocer who refused to give his name.The transporters had to take a longer route as the highway is closed. That is why they are charging extra. There is less supply of grocery, vegetables and other items in the wholesale market and the demand is high in the cities, said a wholesaler from Sangli.Meanwhile, thousands still remain stranded in isolated areas such as Haripur and Sanglewadi, which are a few kilometres from the main town.Volunteers on the Panchmukhi road have been distributing tea, biscuits, fruits and food packets to rescued people, army and police personnel."

The nine contestants who made it to the finals upped their game by bringing a wide range of dishes to the table.Despite their different professional backgrounds, all the participants showed great gusto in carefully curating their plates with a dash of personality to present to the judges. The contestants faced a few challenging situations but eventually improvised and presented their effort successfully. The culinary affair saw men making traditional vegetarian Indian dishes, desserts, International cuisine, and some well-known non-vegetarian specials.Apart from the enticing smell of all the ingredients in the air, the presentation played a big role in everyones counters. While some brought carved tomatoes and carrots, some brought carefully designed watermelons and candles, making it a tough call for the judges to decide their candidature. A few men decided to stick to their strengths and made comfort food, which theyre familiar with, while some men went on to experiment with new textures and ingredients making the event a cultural and a culinary mix.Prasanta Sahoo, an IT professional in the city, brought a tinge of Odisha to the event. He made Tarana and Goti Bhendi which are authentic dishes from his hometown. We often cook this food at home. Im from Odisha and Its important for me to bring my home food to the table. We make Tarana only once a year. My wife and mother prepare Goti Bhendi every time I go back home. I learned how to make it from them, he says.Sai Swaroop, who eventually won the competition made Xacuti, a complex Goan dish. Swaroop experimented with international flavours with an elaborate presentation in his first round. His live cooking station this time was bustling with rose petals, fruit carvings, and candles which definitely added to the ambiance. The name (xacuti) sounded so different and I explored it. I want to be different from others. There is strong competition this time. I can see it on everyones tables, Swaroop says.Vasudevan Gnana Gandhi, Padma Shri awardee at The Hindu Cookery King Contest | Photo Credit: Varun Kumar MukhiaVasudevan Gnana Gandhi, who was awarded the Padma Shri for his work as a scientist in the past, was one of the participants in the competition. He made Idiyappam kothu curry, a traditional dish from Kerala made of rice with a side of mutton stew. His other dish, Brinjal Golden Ring, is curated and perfected by him for the judges to taste. Apart from my professional work, I love to cook. I help my wife every morning with breakfast. I believe that its a combined effort. She used to cut, I used to cook. Im very curious about experimenting with new things, thats how the brinjal dish came about. And since I lived in Kerala for many years, Idiyappam is a must, he adds.The five judges asserted that they recognise the value of how home-cookedcan do wonders. This is great exposure for me as a chef. We only judge professional chefs but something like this is so encouraging, says chef Deepak from Mercure hotels.Chef Majumdar from Greek Park hotel says that he was impressed with the variety that the contestants brought to the table in the preliminary round and is waiting to see what they have made today. Im looking forward to seeing how differently they have presented their dishes this time, adds Majumdar.Last time the variety we saw was great but some of them definitely stood out. We gave the contestants a few suggestions too. Many came up with new and innovative dishes and its a great learning experience for us as chefs. Also, hygiene plays a big part in understanding how well someone is doing. The stakes are a bit higher this time, confirms chef Sambhav from LemonTree hotels. Chef Prabhakar from Siesta Hi-Tech asserts the importance of authenticity to the food everyone plates.The Hindu Cookery King 2019 contest | Photo Credit: Varun Kumar MukhiaAbinash Nayak, the first runner up, says, Im feeling great right now. Its an amazing initiative. Men do cook well and its a great platform for them.Shalab Sharma, Senior Marketing Manager, Freedom Health Cooking Oil was happy that the participants are not just innovating but also adopting healthy cooking methods, which is commendable.Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga with the winners at The Hindu Cookery King Contest 2019 | Photo Credit: Varun Kumar MukhiaFilm director Sandeep Reddy Vanga was the events chief guest. A man of few words, he shares, I have never been to a competition like this. Its nice to see that men are also interested in cooking . I have never cooked much in my life but looking at these guys, its very evident that its not the case with them. Maybe one small reason will make a winner different from the rest, I dont know what it is, he says, adding that a platform like this can take such talents of young men from various backgrounds forward."

During the 2018-19 financial year, over 1 lakh tonne of tomatoes were sent to Pakistan, mostly via the road route.Last year, the suspension of trade had led to prices crashing in the summer months. But this year, the lingering effect of last years drought has affected both production and supply of tomatoes, and ensured that prices remained on the higher side throughout rabi season.AdvertisingSuspension of trade with Pakistan will not have much effect on prices, said Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, adding, Rain has affected the produce in Nashik and overall supply will be low.The price of tomatoes will rise in wholesale and retail markets, said Gadhave. Heavy rain has led to a 10-15 per cent loss in production, and this will affect prices too, he saidGrowers from Junnar region supply tomatoes during the summer, after which growers from Nashik take over the supply. Nashik has nearly 1.5 lakh acres of tomato farms, most of them in the talukas of Kalvan, Niphad, Satana and Sinnar.Over the last seven days, prices in the Narayangaon market have dropped to Rs 25-30 per kg as incessant rains have taken a toll on the quality of the produce. Tomatoes from Nashik are expected to reach the market later in August."

So firm is her belief that her street  Vivekanandar Street, KK Nagar, wears posters depicting the importance of a terrace garden.A resident of Chennai, Muthulakshmi started her terrace garden eight years back. Now, there are more than 60 varieties of vegetable and fruit-bearing plants and several flowers, the sight of which pleases all who pass by. I always wanted a space for a garden in my house, however, living in a city proved it impossible. However, my dreams came true in the form of a terrace garden, says Muthulakshmi. She takes pride in her garden for its ability to bear home-grown fruits and vegetables, which she converts into scrumptious and filling meals.She spends her mornings tending to her plants. Since my father was a farmer, I learnt everything about gardening from him. He has put in a lot of effort to help maintain my garden. He often waters the plants when Im not around, says Muthulakshmi.Her garden houses eggplants, 12 varieties of spinach, chillies, tomatoes, beans, cabbage, carrots and more  all neatly arranged in rows of pots and containers. Trees like pomegranate, plantain, guava and papaya add colour to her garden, along with her collection of 25 varieties of medicinal plants, some of which contain anti-diabetic qualities. A wide array of containers show off the flowers she painstakingly grew like lilies, powder puff, koli kondai, krishna kamalam, vada malli, avaram, and more.Her secret is simple  timely watering of plants every day and avoiding use of pesticides. Instead, spray a mixture of ginger, garlic and chilli to keep away pests. She uses goats droppings and vegetable waste as fertiliser.Building a garden is a one-time investment and can be cost-effective if you plan wisely, she says. Muthulakshmi also runs a nursery, Brindavanam Gardens, where she sells saplings and seeds of various medicinal and flowering plants at prices varying from `25 to `150. She says she helps her neighbours with all their gardening concerns."

But what happens after the event is over? An ugly sight of strewn plastic.This struck 29-year-old Renuka Shah so hard that she decided to start her own business involving seed-paper national flags. The interior-designer-cum-businesswoman started off her venture in 2015 by manufacturing seed paper notebooks. We were overwhelmed by the phenomenal response that we got when we launched it on a global shopping website and that was when we decided that we should take it further, she says.Today, she offers a variety of eco-friendly products. So much so that she even named it Eco-friendly Jalebi.How did the idea pop up? It all started as an activity for school kids that involve colouring the national flag and taking it home, but now it has reached every almost every household and corporate, explains Renuka.The size of the tricolour flag ranges from 2x3 to 4x6 and are priced at a very nominal rate of Rs 4-5. Since the size of the flags is small, they can be easily planted and grown into a plant. Although the bigger flags can be used for activities, they cant be torn in order to plant as it is against the rule.When asked her if it is legal to bury the tricolor flags, she immediately expresses a resounding, Yes, of course. Since the flag is a symbol of pride and dignity, it should be buried without folding or tearing. The rules are mentioned in the Flag Code of India, 2002. she adds. According to the rule, the national flag can be buried or burned. The damaged flags must be placed inside a wooden box and buried in the earth. It can be burned in a safe place in the centre of flames.From marigold, basil, tomato, chilli, carrot to dill, the seeds are embedded into the paper in specific quantities so that it can grow into five to six plants at a time. Interestingly, the seed paper is made from textile waste, which is made into pulp and then handmade into paper.Talking about the choice of seeds, she says, Our country embraces a tropical climate and that must be taken into consideration while manufacturing the seed paper. The seeds we offer thrives in the temperature that is suitable for India.Even now people ask me does the paper actually have seeds in it? Does it really grow?. But from there, weve grown to supplying corporate giants such as Tata, Godrej, Kalpa Druma, Mahindra and even Microsoft who have expressed their satisfaction with the plants that grow.Renuka and her team have shipped close to 15,000 flags to states and cities including Odisha, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai, on this Independence Day alone. We cannot imagine a life without plastic. Everyone is aware of that fact, but to go a step further and start incorporating eco-friendly products in our everyday life is the need of the hour. Zero-waste is the future if we have to save planet earth, she says."

The app is being developed to explore scientific expertise in the agriculture domain and its capabilities, which can effectively be combined to enhance and transform agriculture extension services.The mobile app is under pilot testing at four test beds (villages)  Vallapuram, Thallapusalapalle, Nandivaddeman and Cherlabuthkur  and orientation was given to 200 farmers, 50 each from four villages. The baseline survey and farmers data was collected with the help of scientists of three Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) at Wyra, Malyal and Palem and one District Agricultural Advisory and Transfer of Technology Centre (DAATCC) at Karimnagar.Besides, help is also being taken from Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) of Agriculture Department and Change Gurus (Representatives of Riverbridge Ventures) by using the interview schedule. It is also planned to test the app at one of the Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) in Veldanda mandal of Nagarkurnool district with the help of Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP). The crop husbandry data of paddy, maize, groundnut, cotton, castor, redgram, chilli, tomato, ladies finger, brinjal and others were uploaded on the app for the benefit of farmers. A farmer-wise crop calendar is being created in the app along with pest/disease pictures, weather updates, market price forecasting of major crops and a toll-free phone number for the benefit of farmers to raise their queries.The university officials stated that the pilot testing was being done in the selected villages and data collected from farmers would be analysed with the help of WSU-Australia during the visit. The visit would enable the scientists to explore the possibilities of refinement and up-scaling the GyanKisan app.PJTSAU Vice-Chancellor V.

And soon, weather officials sent out a warning saying the deluge is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. While this would substantially reduce the citys current monsoon deficit of 44%, it has also brought cheer to hilsa lovers who have not been able to indulge in their favourite fish as much this season. Thanks to a dismal spell of rain, the supply of hilsa has remained largely affected this season. But with the current weather, theres no stopping Bengali foodies, who are all geared up for khichuri and ilish maachh bhaja for their Sunday lunch.I just bought a stock of 1,000 kg of ilish. Finally, I have some good stuff here, said Ratikanta Bar, a wholesale fish seller in Howrahs Kalibabur Bajar, on Saturday morning. So, after months of small, inferior catches, at last good-quality ilish has just started to come in. However, with the depression that set in on Bengal in the last two days, the fishermen boats are stationed in the harbours. There is a weather alert and no boat can go fishing now. It is a government instruction. If anyone disobeys, he has to pay a fine. But this is temporary. Since good fish has started coming in, I presume all the markets in Bengal will be stocked up with quality ilish in a weeks time, he added.Talking about the price of ilish here, he added, Any catch between 700-800 gm is available at around `800 per kg. We are selling one-kilo ilish at `1,200 per kg. Fish weighing 1.2 kilo to 1.5 kilo is available for about `1,500 per kg. There is absolutely no fish coming from Bangladesh. However, given the trend, now we are getting pretty big-size catches too.According to an official from the state fisheries department, until Friday, the amount of rainfall received here was rather low. So, the fishermen havent been able to get a good catch this season. But they expect the situation to improve by month-end. The current downpour that Kolkata is experiencing is a result of a cyclonic circulation over south Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh. We are hoping that the situation will improve by the end of August. With more rain, the supply of hilsa is expected to normalise. However, in between, small amounts of hilsa have been caught from the coasts of Digha and Diamond Harbour , said Chandra Nath Sinha, the West Bengal minister for fisheries. Actor Ritwick Chakraborty, who loves to gorge on ilish, said, ""While my father is from Dhaka, my mom is epar Banglar. So, ilish dishes at home have always been influenced by both the sides. I love the patla jhol of ilish or even bhapa. Even fried ilish along with steamed rice, mixed with the bhaja tel, is so appetising!""When do you say your ilish has gone bad? It is never when the curry is too jhaal or nunpora. Ask Bengalis and they will tell you that ilish goes bad only when it is not served in plenty.Way before the silver harvest started pinching a deeper hole in our pockets, a middle-class Bengali familys monsoon feast would include three to four varieties of the fish  ilish maach bhaja with ilish bhaja tel, begun diye kalo jeere-knachalonkar jhol and ilish maach bhaapa or shorshe ilish. Be it jora ilish on Saraswati Puja and special items on Jamai Sashthi, what the queen of fishes enjoys in Bengali households is pure love.While certain dishes of ilish, including shorshe bata, paturi, bhaja and bhape, are Bengalis staples, there are several other items that are as delish but do not enjoy the same popularity for their region of origin.In the eternal cultural fistfight between Ghoti and Bangal, ilish is one of the biggest stakeholders. While Bangals claim they can cook more than 400 different items, some unique dishes, including ilish maacher tok and posto ilish, were introduced by Ghotis. Santanu Bhattacharya  a Kolkata-based HR professional, who hails from East Midnapore  said ilish maacher tok is cooked regularly in his household. Besides shorshe bata ilish, my father prepares this chutney with tamarind pulp and ilish maacher matha. We have it with rice or on its own, he told us.Not just in Midnapore, in 24 Parganas too, the chutney is popular. Kakoli Bhattacharya, who hails from Bakhrahat, South 24 Parganas, said, I remember my mother making this chutney in our childhood. But none of our siblings were fond of it and, hence, she stopped making it. Instead, they lapped up a curry that had panch phoron (a mix of fenugreek seed, nigella seed, cumin seed, black mustard seed and fennel seed in equal parts). My mother used to make ilisher jhol with alu-begun and dhonebata (potato, aubergine and coriander seed paste). She would add a dash of mustard paste and after the jhol was done, she would temper it with paanch phoron. She would also make pui shak (Malabar spinach) with ilisher matha, Kakoli told us. The fishermen community of South 24 Parganas has a unique recipe for their time of sailing. Bimal Bera, owner of a couple of ilish-catching mechanised boats near Sagar, said, Our trawlers travel for over 18 hours at the average speed of 15 kmph. We travel almost 300 km from the harbour. There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Meanwhile, several households in other parts of Bengal use locally available ingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacing mustard with posto (poppy seed). We prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is common in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Ilish became hilsa in the kitchens of our colonial past. Not all British households in India could debone ilish with fork and knife and, hence, the khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire. British rulers are gone more than seven decades ago. However, smoked hilsa remains popular. Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later. It is seasonally available at some traditional restaurants in the Park Street area.While a lot of areas in Bengal have their own version of ilish preparations, many items have a strong Bangal influence too. Sandhya Roy , whose family hails from Barisal and is settled in the colony area of Garia, said their cooking involves garlic. We take a heavy-bottom pan with a lid. We lay about two banana leaves. On the top of the leaves we arrange the fish with garlic and kochu shak with mustard oil. We close the lid and put it on low flame. We often replace kochu shaak with mustard paste, Sandhya told us. The influence of Bangal recipes is visible in North Bengal, where nona ilish is common. Sayantan Sarkar, a businessman from Cooch Behar , claimed that his early memory of ilish mach is all about nona ilish  ilish dried with salt. We are from Mathabhanga and fresh ilish was not widely available in my childhood due to lack of proper roads and transportation. I remember my mother and grandmother preparing nona ilish with onion and garlic. I think the dried fish used to come from Assam. Now, we get a lot of fresh fish and, hence, the supply of nona ilish has gone down. Our staple fresh ilish preparation is with potol, jhinge and danta (pointed gourd, ridge gourd and drumstick)  an obvious influence of Purbo Bongo, he said. The post-Partition settlement in North Bengal has influenced the local peoples diet a lot. Mandabi Bhattacharyya, a city-based NGO worker, who hails from Jalpaiguri, said, Earlier, there used to be days in the festival season when people used to buy fish from the other side of the border at a cheap price. My father and uncles used to go there. Ilish maach is usually prepared with kalo-jeere (black cumin seeds) and aubergine. We temper it with fenugreek seeds and add diced pumpkin.The way she movesAccording to food writer Amitabha Malakar, every province has its own story of ilish. Take Sylhet and Noakhali for example. Ilisher shnutki is popular in both these places. In Sylhet, people make shnutki because of lack of availability of ilish. In Noakhali, people dry ilish for its abundance. The same happens with ilisher tok in this part of Bengal. In Midnapore and 24 Parganas, tok is made of tamarind pulp. As you move west, the same tok is made of chalta (elephant apple) and kamranga (star fruit). Some Bengali diaspora grill ilish like they grill salmon, he said.Several households are other parts of Bengal have made use of locally availableingredients to improvise the age-old recipes. Srabani Raha, a homemaker in Berhampore, Murshidabad, said she started replacingmustard with posto (poppy seed). We usually prepare ilisher jhol with potatoes. Since posto is prettycommon in our kitchen, I tried replacing shorshebata with poppy seed paste, she told us.Not all British households in India could debone ilish with elan with fork and knife and, hence, their khansamas came up with the idea of smoked hilsa  deboned and cured traditionally in khoi-pora agun or, more recently, in sawdust fire... Even today, some Anglo-Indian families take up the tedious task to debone ilish to smoke it later.

There, we stay for days and eat what we catch. To prepare ilish, we chop the fish and cook it with onion, garlic and chillies.Both my parents are Ghotis. At my house in Santiniketan, my mother makes two types of ilish. One is the bhapa preparation. For the other one, ilish is first fried and then put into a curry, which is made of tomato, ginger paste, coriander powder and kalo jeere. Salt and sugar are added as per taste. It is a light curry but tastes heavenly. For me, having ilish is a task, what with all the bones. I need someone to help me remove the bones from the fish. Ma amake kaanta bechhe daye. So, outside home, I prefer having boneless ilish only. Aparajita Ghosh, actressI am a die-hard ilish fan. Though I am a Ghoti, my wife is a Bangal. So, every ilish recipe cooked at our place will always have the Bangal essence. I am fond of all their hilsa dishes, but my most favourite is the one made with doi, kalo jeere and begun. This season, I have already had hilsa thrice. But since monsoon has just begun properly here, I look forward to gorging on a lot more hilsa in the coming days. During the rainy season, we make hilsa at home at least twice a week, if not more. I not only love eating this fish, but I have also learnt a lot of Bangal hilsa dishes from my wife and at times I like to prepare them myself too. Kharaj Mukherjee, actor"

They then get to work, watering hundreds of plants on the campus and cleaning the ground under the guidance of his teachers. Once it is done, they settle down for a piping hot breakfast served to them by the school in collaboration with the Satya Sai Annapurna Trust.Basha is a student of the Zilla Parishad School in the drought-prone Giddalur mandal of western Prakasam district. The sprawling school used to be barren with practically no green cover. However, thanks to the combined efforts of the teachers, students and their parents, it now resembles a mini forest with greenery everywhere, providing the students an ideal environment to pursue education, said the school headmaster Varanasi Giridhara Sarma.The environmental conservation efforts have had a positive impact on the childrens studies.We now have a much better understanding of botany classes, said Jayavardhan, a student, removing weeds from the garden along with his classmates. The students are divided into groups and are given the task of nurturing the saplings. Watching them grow into trees is an unforgettable experience for them, Mr. Sarma said.Parents chip inThe school has taken the help of many of the students parents, most of whom are farmers, to plough 30 cents on the campus. Vegetables grown such as brinjal, drumstick, tomato and chilli are used in the preparation of breakfast and midday meals, Mr. Sarma added.The school has 460 students on its rolls up from 300 less than a couple of years ago.

Kote and other parts of the district are in a dilemma after heavy rains and high outflow from the Kabini reservoir flooded vast swathes of agricultural land last week.Though the fields got inundated owing to floods and an ideal condition has been created for paddy cultivation, not many farmers are prepared to take the risk as they are confused.Vivek Cariappa, an organic farmer from Saragur, told The Hindu that there is confusion because the water availability has come too late in the agricultural season and could affect the yield.Besides, the dams in the region are full to the brim and there are concerns that a fresh spell of rain will force the authorities to lift the crest gates. That will flood the fields again and add to the farmers misery. Many farmers do not have the money to sow a second crop even as the returns from the first crop are bleak, he said.Low yieldAtahalli Devaraj of the Federation of Farmers Association said the yield is expected to be not more than 25% of what has survived the floods. In the initial stages, there was no water in the dam and hence farmers were advised against cultivating paddy. Now there is adequate water but many lack the confidence as weather conditions tend to be erratic and more rains could compound the crisis, he added. Mr. Cariappa said that cotton was ripe for harvesting but heavy rain during the last 10 days damaged the crop. Leaves are dropping due to virus and standing crops have contracted disease, he said.With farmers having incurred loss last year due to the vagaries of nature, they are set to suffer a fresh loss this year as well and hence their immediate future is bleak, Mr. Cariappa added.Besides, financial institutions at the ground level are averse to extending loans to farmers as their repayment capacity has been severely affected due to two years of crop loss, said Mr. Cariappa.Rise in labour costAdding to the farmers misery is the rise in labour cost for cotton cultivation.Cotton farmers in H.D. Kote have to compete for labourers with ginger cultivators, most of whom are contractors from Kerala with deep pockets. They pay daily wages that range from 250 per day for women to 400 per day for men.Hence, there is a growing perception that cotton cultivation is not longer lucrative as the return on investment is poor if not negative.Going by the past trends, it is likely that most farmers will opt for vegetables like tomato, brinjal, cabbage apart from chilli. But with majority of the farmers opting for the same combination of crops, it may happen that the output will surpass the demand and prices will crash leading to another round of loss for the cultivators."

Malleswari Sadhineni told The Hindu that there was a low pressure system over Tamil Nadu and rain bearing cloud cover over Chittoor district in Madanapalle, Kadiri in Anantapur and some eastern mandals of Anantapur, which could result in a rainfall of 10 to 20 mm over the next 36 hours.While the overall rainfall deficit of the district, which was highest in Andhra Pradesh has come down to last but one position pushing Kadapa to the top position with -49%.Ms. Malleswari does not recommend sowing of groundnut at time of the year as there was very little possibility of rain during November-end December, when the crop requires good rain for full yield and predicts pest problems and loss of yield to the tune of 50%. Similarly tomatoes, which are flooding the market with prices crashing drastically and retail prices falling to 8 and 10 a kg should not be sown again, but many farmers have sown now in 9,000 hectares and 3,000 hectares of beans, while district stares at a dry spell till September middle.In Anantapur district, Kanekal, Atmakur and Chenekothapalli recorded excess rainfall for this season and 10 mandals normal rainfall, while 21 mandals have deficit above -60 mm and upto -80mm, but remaining 19 mandals have scanty rainfall with deficit ranging from -19mm to -59mm for current monsoon. The agrometeorologist suggests sowing of bajra, foxtail millet, cowpea and horse gram as alternative crops and the Agriculture Department has already distributed 15,000 quintals of these seeds to 1,697 farmers under contingency plan."

Six robots (one at the reception and five who serve food) are seen walking through the restaurant with varied dishes  fish curry and rice, prawns biryani, Thai green curry  much to the amusement of diners.Designed to resemble a space ship, the entry is dimly lit, with one robot at the entrance, while the interiors of the dining area are completely white. The restaurant which serves mostly Indian and Chinese cuisine is able to accomodate 50 diners. We place our order on a tab  tomato soup, paneer aloo balls, and Thai green curry with rice  mentioning our preference and specifications of low salt and spice levels. The tomato soup arrives with the robot with another one following suit. We pick up the bowl and hit the exit button on the robot, which is a cue for it to move forward. Please move out of the way, says the robot standing in queue.While there are around 10 waiters, three of them are exclusively to oversee the robots. Others intervene to check if orders have reached the right table and on time. Just as we look around at the maze of activity  food being loaded onto the tray the robot is holding, the five of them walking around  our aloo paneer balls arrive. This order comes on a train to the right of our table. The robots are assigned to bring the soups, main course and strarters. Depending on the availability, the dishes are put on the train or sent through the robot, said Karthikeyan R, general manager of the recently-launched hotel.According to Karthikeyan, the robots have been programmed to work efficiently and the staff has also undergone training from the manufacturers to attend to any issues that may arise over the course of operations.Stakes and hopes are high, especially since it is the first of its kind in Bengaluru. This concept is particularly interesting for children, who have been fascinated with the concept of robots moving around and serving them. The R&D to open branches in four other locations in Bengaluru, especially in the IT areas, is going on, he said.In this AI-powered set-up, its easy to forget its a buzzing Monday afternoon. A word of caution: Go with time on your hands."

It was while indulging in this passion that he stumbled on the story of Nur Jahan, the wife of Mughal emperor Jahangir.The fascination was such that it inspired the 37-year-old designer to work on a collection titled Nur Jahan.Nur Jahan was a really strong figure but not discussed much. As I read further, I discovered that she was not only a great human being but a well-educated woman who loved art and culture.After her marriage to Jahangir, she is known to have held the reigns in the affairs of the state as Jahangir got addicted to alcohol, shares Gupta, adding, while today we hear stories of strong successful women but centuries ago, Nur Jahan was one such personality.So, this collection is inspired and reflects her personality, preferences and her love for Jahangir and the kind-heartedness she was known for.As Gupta researched about Mehr-un-Nissa who was later bestowed with the title of Nur Jahan (Light of the World) by Jahangir, he met historians and read poems written on her and started focussing on the positive aspects of her personality.In this collection, we havent focussed on the aspect of royalty, something that is oversold in India. I made sure not to make it too ornamental and heavy. Rather her strong character has been interpreted through the weaves, says Gupta who believes that weaves are the most responsible luxurious elements in the world and thus uses them to pay tribute to Nur Jahan.To give the collection a luxurious image, he has used fabrics like paithani, bandhani, Banarasi silk, tissue, kota, organza and patola.The motifs used in the collection represent occasions like the marriage ceremony of Nur Jahan woven on a Banarasi fabric and bandhani saris with her image on the pallu.Staying true to the era he was depicting, Gupta has used vintage embroideries like zardozi with pearls, ari and resham.But thats not all. Every colour palette of the collection reflects the personality of Nur Jahan. Gold and silver has been used to highlight her boldness while we chose bright rose, tomato red, radiant yellow and garden green to depict element of happiness, concludes Gupta."

The Central Railway (CR) said it had asked the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to look into the matter.AdvertisingSagar Kale (33), who runs a shop in Tulshibaug area of the city, was travelling from Mumbai to Pune on July 19 and ordered bread-omelette. When the omelette was served, there were worms on the plate, in the pepper pouch and tomato sauce, Kale said.Kale said the IRCTC staff told him they would replace the food. He shot a video of the omelette with the worms.Kale lodged a complaint with the railways on Wednesday. As for the delay in lodging the complaint, Kale said he was not aware as to where to go. I approached activist Harsha Shah who took me to railway officials to lodge the complaint, he said.AdvertisingCR spokesperson Manoj Jhanvar said they have forwarded the complaint to IRCTC, which looks after food served on trains. IRCTC will examine the complaint, he said.Shah, president of Railway Pravasi Group, said, Food served by IRCTC is of inferior quality. Even the Comptroller and Auditor General of India passed strictures against IRCTC two years back.Shah said such problems arise because IRCTC had given the contract for preparing food to private parties. IRCTC supervisor is supposed to keep watch on the quality of food served and cleanliness in the dinning car. But passengers are not even aware as to who the supervisor is. Also, there is no complaint book available in trains, she said.When contacted, G V Sonna, assistant manager with IRCTC, said the complaint has been sent to its Mumbai office. However, we have not received the evidence with the complaint so far, he said. The passenger said he has submitted the video to the Pune office of CR.Sonna denied that food served on the train was of inferior quality. In the last one year, we have not received a single complaint, he said. He also denied that there was no complaint book available in the coaches."

The nurses rushed to call Dr George Mathew, the general physician and gastrointestinal surgeon. When the doctor came, he was shocked. He pressed hard against the blood vessels to stop the flow, even as Majhi was wheeled into the operation theatre on a gurney.The gash had gone through his ear, says Dr Mathew. His nerves and muscles were cut. I worked through the night and managed to repair it. But I told the family Majhi may not be able to speak or hear again.Majhi was having a drink with his friend. Then a misunderstanding arose and the friend slashed him with an axe. They carry axes because they cut wood often. Majhi recovered and then went home.Six months later, there was a visitor in the outpatient department. He was accompanied by his 20-year-old daughter. He was smiling, but I could not recognise him, says Mathew. He pointed to his face and I could see a scar. And then I remembered.Majhi had recovered well and could speak properly but could only hear a little. And he was back to farming. Majhi presented a paper packet to Mathew, which contained bananas, and said, This is my first crop. Thanks to you, I am alive.The daughter beamed. And Mathew felt a deep sense of happiness and satisfaction.Mathew has been in Biru for the past one-and-a-half years. The former principal of the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, he retired in 2011 and spent the next few years in Jakarta, Indonesia, helping to develop a newly-begun medical college and to start a teaching hospital. But when his friend, Arwin Sushil, the chief administrative officer of the Center invited him to have a look, Mathew did so.I saw that there was a need for senior doctors, says Mathew, who has a doctorate in surgery from the Royal Adelaide Hospital, University of Adelaide. So I decided to stay.Asked about the health issues of the people, Mathew says that because of their poor living standards, many suffer from tuberculosis, malaria, diarrhoea and dehydration. Owing to their illiteracy and ignorance, they come to the hospital only when the disease is at an advanced stage, says Mathew. For some, we can do something. But for the others, it is too late. We can only give a palliative.Another problem is that because there are good roads, accidents have become very common. High speed combined with alcohol is a dangerous combination, says Mathew. We get accident victims every day. Many of them come with severe head injuries because they dont wear helmets. The mortality rate is 25 per cent, which is very high.Interestingly, the patients are getting subsidised treatment. There is a government health insurance, says Mathew. So, we dont charge the patient but the government reimburses us if the people are below the poverty line.In 2017-18, the partially-free treatment was to the tune of Rs 1.9 crore. The Shanti Bhavan Center has 50 beds and sophisticated equipment. It has two Operating Theatres and X-Ray facilities. It plays an important role in the area because the nearest hospital is at Rourkela, 100 km away.Backward and poorBiru is one of the most backward regions in Jharkhand. The majority of the people are tribals. And their primary occupation is farming. But they use the basic equipment of ox and plough. Since they depend on the rain, they grow only one crop annually, mainly rice and vegetables like brinjals, ladies finger, tomatoes, chillies, and groundnuts, says Mathew. If the monsoon fails, their crops also fail.They also collect forest produce like honey, wood and the mahua flower. This flower is destroying the community because they make alcohol by fermenting it, says Mathew. Alcoholism is rampant. Both men, women and sometimes children drink it.Interestingly, the terrain is very much like Kerala. It is full of forests with clearings in between and there are small hamlets. Asked to compare a village in Kerala with that in Biru, Mathew says, It is like comparing the USA and Africa. The availability of health-care facilities is very low in Jharkhand as compared to Kerala. It is a world apart. The South of India is far ahead as compared to the North.Surprisingly, the locals have heard of Kerala because some of them had gone to work as labourers, because of the high daily wages. They said they were treated well and felt happy, says Mathew. Asked how long he would stay, the 69-year-old says, As long as my health permits, and my family is okay with it.The family includes his wife Alice, a gynaecologist, who is on a temporary assignment in Brunei, till December, while his son Sidharth, 35, is a Bengaluru-based lawyer. Another son, Anirudh, 32, is a neuropsychologist at CMC, Vellore.In conclusion, Mathew says, This stint has provided me with a lot of happiness. I was able to provide medical care in an area where there is nothing. Also, I have experienced the joy of saving people who would have died otherwise."

People come and leave without buying much. I have started buying less vegetables because if they are not sold out, I will have to bear a huge loss. The rain has increased the prices. It happens every year.While the market rates of vegetables have gone up, the prices of vegetables at chain stores including Easy Day and Big-bazaar remain same. As opposed to these chains, street vegetable vendors do not have cold stores. With no way of getting vegetables directly from farms now, the vendors are forced to buy them from people who own cold stores."

How well do we know ourselves? Did you become who you thought you would be when you grew up? Did circumstances make you a better, a worse or just a different person? And why am I asking you all these questions? Well, this week I want to apply all these same questions to food. Food as we know it. Indian food.So here goes. What is Indian food really? Did all the food we love in our country come from within India? Or did some of the food we now consider traditional actually come from somewhere else  another city, another country, other continent? Has that food then become better, worse or just different?I dont have the answers to all these questions but as I burrow into the histories of some our favourite Indian foods, its time for me to tell you the truth. Some things are just not what they seem to be.Look familiar? Thats the zalabia, a popular Lebanese sweet made of fried fermented dough. Like its descendant, the jalebi, it is crisp, sweet and sinfully good. ( talesofjewishsudan.com )Take, for instance, the Punjabi mothers favourite instrument of love: Rajma Chawal. Its a delicacy for some and comfort food for most. Its red kidney beans cooked with spices till creamy, in an onion-tomato gravy. Its best had with your fingers, mixed into hot steamed rice. But Rajma is not a Punjabi bean; its not even Indian. And no it doesnt trace its origin to Canada either.The Rajma bean, it is said, originated in Peru and became a craze throughout South and Central America, travelling to Europe around the 15th century, when Spanish wayfarers returned home from their adventures. Migrating Indian traders carried the bean to India via Guatemala and Central America. Punjab fell for the red bean, and so did Nepal, where Rajma Ko Tarkari and Rajma Curry are staples.Then theres the Samosa. Not sub-continental, definitely not Indian. The idea of this snack of pastry or bread stuffed and deep-fried is common in many cultures. The samosa can be considered part of the same family as the Portuguese Pastel, Spanish Empanada, Italian Calzone, and South East Asian Curry Puff. Historians trace the name and the triangular shape to Central Asias pyramid-shaped samsa, and the meat-filled Uzbek version, called the Pompoqcha Somsa (samsa made with yeast dough).The word is derived from the Persian sanbosag and in North Africa and the Middle East is referred to as sanbusaq or sanbusaj. So the next time you bite into a hot Punjabi Samosa, you may just think of it as International Cuisine.The chicken tikka masala at Shish Mahal, Glasgow. Scotland is the home of this desi-sounding dish.The Persians have a lot to answer for. Not only did most tandoor cooking of bread and the great Mughlai cuisine find its beginnings in Persia and the Middle East, so did the Jalebi and Gulab Jamun. Zalabia is a very popular Lebanese sweet fritter made of fermented dough. There, sugar is added to the batter of the Zalabia, while the Jalebi is fried and then soaked in sugar syrup. Both are crisp, sweet and sinfully good when eaten hot.Gulab Jamuns as well, they say, were brought to India by Persian invaders. The Persians called it Luqmat al-Qadi, and made it by taking yeast-leavened dough and deep-frying it, then drenching it in honey or sugar syrup and rosewater. The recipe dates back to the 13th century and the dish, tis said, was popularised, in the 14th century in India, by the explorer and scholar Ibn Battuta.The rustic-sounding Chicken Tikka Masala has its roots in Scotland. Ive eaten CTM in a Scotland Pub; its a Thursday-night tradition and nearly everyone was gorging on this pale reddish-yellow special after several beers. The story goes that Ali Ahmed Aslam of Shish Mahal, a Scottish curry house in Glasgow, to assuage his customers who thought his roast chicken was too bland and dry, tossed some spices together with tinned tomato soup and, lo and behold, the Chicken Tikka Masala was born.And then, of course, there are our two favourite beverages  Tea and Coffee. Coffee was not part of Indian culture or custom till at least the 16th century. Baba Budan was a 16th-century Sufi who returned from Mecca with the blessings of Allah and seven coffee beans hidden in his beard. He returned home to Chikmagalur in present-day Karnataka and planted them on the slopes of the Chandragiri Hill. Chikmagalur remains the countrys largest coffee-growing area.Tea, of course, is not Indian but Chinese and was brought to us by the British, who found India a great place to grow tea for themselves. I personally cannot stomach the light English tea, so I am glad that we not only embraced the beverage, but also really, truly made it our own.To end with, the Ganesh festival is around the corner and in that context Id like to leave you with a question. The modak, a steamed dumpling made with rice flour, filled and steamed. Does that sound perilously close to the Momo, Dim Sum or Sui Mai? So which came first? I dont know. Why dont you find out and tell me.First Published: Aug 23, 2019 20:50 IST"

With it also came losses everytime the market went southward.Going organicNow, the differently-abled farmer has turned a new leaf by taking to vertical gardening and producing a variety of healthy vegetables including greens, the organic way.Saying no to harmful chemical pesticides and fertilisers, he produces his own organic fertilisers with discarded leaves and other organic matter. Mr Brahmaiah has also adopted the Zero-Based Natural Farming (ZBNF) technique as part of conscious-efforts to cut costs at a time when fellow farmers are grappling with ever-increasing cost of farm inputs. Vertical gardening enables me grow more in very less space, says the progressive farmer proudly showing a variety of vegetables grown by him using discarded plastic drums.Not priceyAs many as 50 plants can be grown in each drum with efficient use of water through sprinklers and by producing own organic fertiliser through vermi-composting.I practice cow-based agriculture with liberal use of cow dung and urine and neem-based products to ward off pests and ensure healthy growth of the plants, he says in a conversation with The Hindu.Proudly showing the freshly-harvested tomatoes at the top of the barrel, he says I do not charge any premium for the organic veggies. There is no marketing problem for the farmer as health-conscious people from Ongole and other places drive down to his farm and grab the heathy, but cheap vegetables. The organic vegetables grown in his farm have four to five more days of shelf life than the one grown using chemical fertilisers and pesticides, he adds.Seeds and water are the only expenses as no additional cost is incurred in this method of cultivation. Another innovation is growing different types of plants, including creepers slitting the sides of a barrel for quick growth and residue mulching to maintain soil health. I get yields on all the 365 days to avoid incurring losses due to fluctuating prices for different vegetables in different months, adds Mr. Brahmaiah, now determined to scale up the operation with more drums."

Tuta Absoluta is a South American moth that rapidly began spreading in India in 2014. It can lead to loss of 100 per cent yield of tomatoes.When we conducted studies, we found that these insects get attracted to the colour yellow. We designed a system where an incandescent light bulb is placed above the plant to attract both male and female insects. Soap water or water containing pesticide is placed at the bottom. Alternatively, a suction is placed with a mesh below, instead of the soapy water bowl. The insects get attracted to the light, hit the surface, lose balance and fall into the mesh or bowl, said Dr V Sridhar, principal scientist and secretary, Division of Entomology and Nematology, IIHR.We applied for a patent a few days ago but have already shared the technology with farmers from across the country, Sridhar said, adding, The same technology can be used in open conditions with a few modifications. For one acre, four or five light traps are enough. Tuta is more active from 7-11pm. The light-cum-suction trap is being patented. Suction mechanism enhances the trapping efficiency of adult insects.Though tomato is the main host, Tuta can also attack other hosts, like potato, eggplant, tobacco etc. Young larvae mine into tomato leaves, apical buds, stalks or fruits. Feeding results in blotches and pinholes on fruit which are generally covered with the frass (excrement of larvae). In one to two months, the technology will be commercially available. This method is part of a larger Integrated Pest Management (IPM) module developed by the institute.We have been popularising the technology among farmers by training them in it. Weve had farmers from Kolar, Andhra Pradesh border, Maharashtra and other states as well. As this is an emerging insect, not many farmers are aware of it. It can multiply in lakhs within one week. This can cut down cost and affect chemical sprays used by farmers, said another scientist from the institute."

Traders claimed that the supply has been affected post rains and they are bound to sell vegetables at a higher price to meet their ends meet.The retail rates of onion , brinjal, pumpkin, bottle gourd and okra have seen a slight increase. The price of tomatoes has been slashed by 50%, whereas prices of vegetables such as cucumber and potatoes remained the same.Apparently, the wholesale prices have also seen a sharp rise as onions used to cost Rs 20 per kg earlier as compared to Rs 30 per kg now. Brinjal was of Rs 300 for 18kg to 20kg, but its price has touched Rs 500. On the other hand, same quantity of bottle gourd costs Rs 300 which was earlier Rs 100.One of the traders, who sells potato at Rs 20 per kg, claimed that: Potato is stored in a large quantity before the monsoons so its price was not affected, but the quality has been compromised. Only the supply of pahari potato has been affected due to the monsoons.Tomato is being sold for Rs 40 per kg as compared to the last week when it was sold for Rs 80 per kg. But in Mohali , it is being sold at Rs 50 to 60 per kg.Tomatoes are supplied from Solan and due to the recent landslide the supply has been affected as all the vehicles couldnt reach the city. Only 100 crates were delivered. Now, after the roads have been cleared, 200 crates have been delivered and the rates have gradually decreased, said Shiv Kumar, a tomato vendor.Onions were being sold for Rs 20 per kg before the monsoons and then the prices increased to Rs 30 per kg last week. But it now costs Rs 50 per kg and the quality has also been compromisedRate of bottle gourd has seen an increase of three times and is being sold for Rs 30 now. Brinjal was being sold for Rs 50 as compared to last week at Rs 30.Traders who sell it have faced a major loss as they are now bound to sell only one vegetable as they cannot afford to buy four different vegetables due to the prise rise.Cucumber has seen no such increase in its price and is being sold for Rs 40 from the past one month.Pumpkin which has only a limited number of buyers was being sold for Rs 10 per kg and costed Rs 20 per kg last week. It is now priced at Rs 30 per kg.Okra was being sold for Rs 60 per kg last week and is now being sold for Rs80 per kg."

In contrast, tomato sales have remained steady, though prices have declined from a high of 40-46 a kg in the middle of the year.Market superviser Vinay Kumar told The Hindu that compared to previous years, tomato farmers this year are a happier lot as they are reaping considerable profits in Madanapalle region.Last year, prices plummeted to 6 a kg for the fine variety, forcing farmers to stay away from harvesting, Mr. Vinay Kumar said.Production of tomato was low at around 500 tonnes per day this year due to a prolonged dry spell  almost half of last years production  which also helped balance supply and demand, said Mr. Vinay Kumar.A steady demand for tomato was also partly due to a spate of local festivals such as the Ganga Jataras of Tirupati and Chittoor and other prominent village festivals elsewhere in the neighbouring Nellore and Anantapur districts. The Adi month (a sacred month for devotees of Lord Muruga) in Chittoor and Tamil Nadu also helped sustain the demand in June and July. Traders are hopeful that the price would continue to remain the same till October, as major festivals are around the corner.Slump in exportsMr. Vinay Kumar said that there has been a slump in exports at the Madanapalle market since the middle of the year. Tomato farming has immensely picked up in Maharashtra and a couple of northern States. So, it has impacted exports here this year, he said.Coming to the retail market, the tomato price continues to be a source of worry for household consumers with the second variety (10 per kg in the wholesale market) is selling at 20 a kg in the vegetable markets and at roadside vendors. The first variety is as usual hitting supermarkets in major cities in South and North India.Meanwhile, the price of onion is perturbing consumers all over Chittoor district, with 60 a kg for the fine variety, 40 for the second grade and 30 for the last category."

Come September and India explodes with colour, light, fireworks, and food. The two big festivals just round the corner are Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam, to be followed by the gaiety of Dussehra and the explosion of Diwali.Both Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam are festivals that tug at the emotional bonds of people, Maharashtrian and Malayalam people in this case. Weary form a years work, Malayalis from all over the world rush back to their native towns and villages for the festival of Onam. Maharashtrians do the same, going from cities like Mumbai and Pune back to their villages and hometowns. This is a time to bond with family and friends and celebrate culture and heritage as our people have, for centuries.Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival close to my heart, and Ive often written about how it was celebrated in our homes, and the special foods that were so typical of the festival. But I havent delved much into a classic Onam celebration. Onam is primarily a harvest festival, celebrated all over Kerala to commemorate the golden rule of king Mahabali, a fabled asura ruler. Jealous of his acclaim, the legend goes, the Gods conspired to end his reign. They sent Lord Vishnu to earth in his Vaman (dwarf Brahmin) avatar, and he trampled Mahabali into the netherworld, but granted his last wish  to visit his land and people once a year.That day is celebrated as Onam. With Onam come banana leaves, colourful Kathakali masks, the aroma of incense and the beats of the Panchavadyam and Chenda drums. Onam is the emotional string that binds all Malayalis together.And nothing brings together all Malayalis like the Sadya does. Sadya is the Malayalam word for feast and it is Keralas most popular and revered Vegetarian Thali. Sadya is not only served during Onam, a Sadya can also be the traditional meal served during a wedding or on Vishu (another festival celebrated in Kerala and in parts of coastal Tamil Nadu).I am an ardent worshipper of food from Kerala, especially of Mapla and Syrian Christian delicacies, but the Sadya has a special place in my heart. Its the one vegetarian meal that I adore. Maybe its the coconut that features in the Avial and Payasam or the crisp south Indian papadams or all the lovey fritters that go with a traditional Sadya.Normally the Sadya served on Onam is cooked without onions or garlic. A full-fledged Sadya should have at least 23 items. The meal is usually had sitting on the floor; cutlery is definitely avoided. A Sadya must comprise of Avial (curd curry), Thoran (dry vegetables), pickles, lemon, salt, boiled rice and Payasam (a sweet dish).It starts with Kaya Varuthathu (crisp banana chips fried in coconut oil), Sarkara Varatti (jaggery-coated banana chips), at least two kinds of pickle, raw mango or lime. Along with that is served a Pachadi (a sour curd curry made with cucumber and ash gourd cooked in coconut, mustard seeds and curry leaves). Then comes the classic Avial, the nectar of Kerala  soft and creamy vegetables cooked with coconut, curd, coconut oil and curry leaves. The omnipresent Sambar and a pepper-spiked Rasam. Then there is Parippu (a thick moong dal curry cooked with grated coconut and seasoned with spices and drizzled with ghee).Thoran can be made from any vegetables that are fresh and available  carrots, cabbage, beans, tomatoes or leafy veggies. The curry is flavoured with coconut and green chillies.You can take the Sadya to whatever level of fanciness you wish. You can add dishes like Erissery (a coconut curry of pumpkin and black-eyed peas), Kaalan (a sour dish made with bananas or yam cooked in yogurt, and coconut) and Olan (spiced black peas in coconut milk).As with most meals, you end with a sweet dish. Here, Palada Pradhaman (a sweet dish made with rice, milk and dry fruit) or Pazham Pradhaman (rice with coconut pieces and jaggery) is typically the last dish served.If you truly want to understand what an Onam Sadya means to a Malayali, there is a saying that describes it best. They say in Malayalam: Kanam vittum Onam unnanam, which means We should have the Onam Sadya even if we have to sell all our land.First Published: Aug 30, 2019 19:23 IST"

Subbaiyan, director of the department.Each idol, placed in a clay pot, costs 200. The department also has asked their units in districts to manufacture similar idols.You know the clay available in Madhavaram is very rich in nutrients and encourages plant growth. We have used only seeds of vegetables such as brinjal, tomato, chilly and green vegetables. If someone is interested in procuring an idol embedded with seeds of fruit plants and trees, we can make them too, Mr Subbaiyan said.The seed Vinayaka reduces the burden of immersing the idols in water bodies and sea.The idea is to prevent pollution. We have not added any colour or chemicals. After performing the pooja, the family can pour water on the statue and it will dissolve in the pot and encourage germination of plants. They can also cherish that it is a Gods gift, he said."

It cost us Rs40/kg in wholesale last week. I got it at less than half today. There were tomatoes all over the market and the quality was good. I sold them for Rs30/kg through the day, said S Palani, who owns a vegetable shop in Moggapair. But Palani refused to buy onions whose prices, with poor supply from states like Maharashtra, nearly doubled. Wholesale dealers say onions cost Rs15/kg in wholesale two weeks ago. They are now Rs30/kg. In retail market , they cost Rs45/kg because wastage is high. Many are rotten, said wholesaler Chandru.The market continues to be flooded with tomatoes. Wholesale dealer Sounderrajan said they had been getting a good quantity from within the state, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for a week-.Farmers from Mecheri and Vazhapadi in Salem and Rayakottai in Krishnagiri said their yield rose several fold this month and the increase in supply led to a drastic drop in cost.

Now, I pick up the same quantity for Rs150, said K Vairavel, treasurer of the Nethaji Vegetable Market in Erode.The markets in the district, which usually get 700 boxes (each 28 kg) of tomatoes every day, now get 5,000 boxes, he said. But the bumper yield, farmers say, hasnt helped. Farmers have not made any profit as retail prices are down.

2019-08-31,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/aug/31/from-punjab-with-love-2026700.html,"From Punjab, with love","Deena Theresa ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: I accidentally discovered Punjab House six years ago. Now, Im positive that recognition would have dawned on almost every Kochiites parents face. Owned by a Punjabi family settled in the city years ago, the restaurants fame is solely contributed by word of mouth. I remember the decades-old building, nestled in a by-lane in Broadway. My tastebuds can fondly recollect the piping hot plate of aloo ka paratha with a slab of butter shimmying its way and the lassi which guarantees you a ticket to seventh heaven.Wanting to relive the experience, I went back, to the place, and in time. The current owner, Brahamdev K Dhuper, has hospitality writ large on his face. The restaurant was started in 1969 by my mother, Pushpa Krishanlal. Back then, we just had one north Indian restaurant in the city. My father was in the Armed Forces. He was commissioned into the Indian Air Force, after the Partition and was posted in Mumbai. Our relatives were in Kochi and we would stay with them often.It was then, my mother noticed the lack of Punjabi restaurants. After my fathers retirement, we settled here and she started the restaurant. Now there are several north Indian restaurants but ours is a humble place with reasonable rates, says 64-year-old Brahamdev, a former engineer with Sony, who took over the place 14 years ago. The restaurant has a good name and I wanted to make it better, he continues. His mother is now 94 years old.Punjab House is unlike your regular Punjabi restaurants. It serves no tandoori or non-vegetarian dishes; Just your simple, humble homely vegetarian Punjabi food, according to Brahamdev. Our most favoured dishes are the aloo ka paratha, gobi ka paratha and the lassi. Also, we make some subjis (vegetable curries) such as the karela pyaz, which no restaurant in the city makes. Sev tomato, Shimla mirch aloo and papad sabji are among the rest, he says.Albeit, one can never find the same dish every day. We have customers who dine at the restaurant twice a day. Just like how it is in our homes, where the menu changes so that children do not get fed up with the food, my mother had introduced this wherein the menu changes by the day, he smiles. Now, thats some variety I need in my life.Im served their famous aloo ka paratha with boondi raita and paneer curry, the days special. Accompanying my meal is none other than the lassi. You wont find a lassi like this, says Brahamdev. And how right he is. I immediately sip the lassi. A plethora of memories rush in, along with the cold, sweet yet tangy flavour of the lassi. The answer to all my troubles.The paratha, stuffed with potatoes tastes even better with the raita. And the curry reminded me of home. Wait, didnt Brahamdev say that homely food was their USP? When we began, not many Malayalis were not accustomed to eating chappattis. Now, our Malayali customers have overtaken north Indians! Also, here you can see people across various states having food under one roof. That is my mothers specialty.She has curated the food in such a manner that everyone would develop a liking to it, shares Brahamdev. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His son, Aayush Brahamdev, runs the Urban Paratha brand, across three outlets in Kochi. Urban Paratha serves non-vegetarian and tandoori dishes, says the proud father. Brahamdev is also a HAM radio operator. Probably that explains how he connects various communities under one roof, this time, in the name of food."

Vegetable wholesale dealers and retail sellers across the city say that prices will either remain the same or decrease.Vegetable prices have decreased as compared to previous Onam seasons. Last years Onam saw a kg of cucumbers sold for Rs 80. Now, it is Rs 10 in the wholesale market, said C Ravindran, a vegetable merchant at Connemara Market, Palayam.Usually, the prices of vegetables such as brinjal, bitter gourd, cucumber and drumstick see an increase during Onam. But ahead of Onam this year, the prices of all vegetables except garlic and onion have plummeted. A kilogram of okra which cost Rs 40 last year has come down by Rs 20 and the rate of a kilogram of tomatoes has decreased from Rs 50 to Rs 25.Foreseeing the Onam sales in Kerala, farmers in Tamil Nadu increased their production and now we have surplus vegetables, he said. Last week, a kilogram of ginger cost Rs 300 which plummeted to Rs 120 in the wholesale market this week. The vegetable prices are on the decline. Regardless, we cannot give up on the profession. I need to sell vegetables to feed my family, said Usha Kumari, a vegetable seller.The prices of fruits remain the same while those of flowers have increased slightly. The price of flowers increased from Rs 60 to Rs 70 as on Thursday. Though it is not a major hike, it will increase further with a few weeks left for Onam, said Anand A, a flower merchant at Connemara Market."

The 'Kashmir Freedom March', organised by a plethora of British Kashmiri groups, went from Parliament Square past Downing Street to the High Commission building led by some UK Labour MPs. Protesters carried Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and Khalistan flags and placards saying, Stop shelling in Kashmir, End the siege Time for UN to act on Kashmir Stop war crimes in Kashmir and they shouted We want freedom and Azadi.You can try and silence a Parliament but you cannot try and silence a people. We will continue to protest on the streets of our cities and at the UN until we have delivered justice for the people of Kashmir. This idea this is a bilateral negotiation is now dead. It is time for a multilateral solution now, Birmingham Hodge Hill British Labour MP Liam Byrne, who led the march, said.Byrne is gathering names on a petition he plans to hand into the House of Commons calling on the UK Government to make urgent representations to the Indian Government through the Commonwealth and through the UN to seek restoration of Kashmirs special status; to ensure demilitarisation, restoration of communications and to immediately allow full access to human rights observers.The protesters, who were mainly British Pakistanis and British people with roots in PoK, but who included pro-Khalistan Sikhs, said they were there to mark 30 days since the lockdown in Kashmir that commenced following abrogation of Article 370. A PoK flag was placed into the hands of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Parliament Square, Westminster before the march started.Barricades were erected preventing the group from reaching the mission building in Aldwych.As there were no people to target, the crowd hurled hundreds of eggs, tomatoes, shoes, stones, smoke bombs and bottles at the building and smashed several of its windows. The High Commission of India tweeted photos of several broken windows. The tweet said: Another violent protest outside the Indian High Commission in London today, 3 September 2019. Damage caused to the premises.A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said there were two arrests, both were for criminal damage.London mayor, Pakistani-origin Sadiq Khan, tweeted: I utterly condemn this unacceptable behaviour.This is the second time in less than a month that the Indian mission in London has been targeted by unruly protesters.On August 15, protesters carrying Khalistani and Kashmiri flags tried to push forward across police lines and threw objects, targeting members of the Indian diaspora who were peacefully celebrating Independence Day at the high commission. Hundreds of thugs and hooligans were among the protesters, made up predominantly of British Pakistanis, Pakistani Kashmiris and pro-Khalistan Sikhs.They threw eggs, glass bottles, shoes, plastic bottles and other objects at the crowd who had gathered for the Independence Day event and at the mission building.The High Commission of India lodged a criminal complaint shortly afterwards with the police over a broken window and damage to the walls.Many, including women and children, had to take refuge in the building till riot police arrived and provided them with a safe passage."

Some 2,500 protestors from across the UK, most of them of Pakistani and Kashmiri origin, joined the Kashmir Freedom March from Parliament Square to the high commission at Aldwych. The protestors, including pro-Khalistani elements, carried flags of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Khalistan.The protestors threw stones, bottles, eggs, tomatoes and shoes at the Indian high commission, smashing several windows.External affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said: We consider these incidents to be unacceptable and have strongly urged the Government of UK to take action against those involved, and take necessary steps to ensure the normal functioning of our mission and the safety and security of our personnel.India, he said, is deeply concerned by the reports of unruly demonstrations by Pakistan-incited elements and consequent organised vandalism of the property of the high commission of India in London. Tuesdays protest was the second time in recent weeks that such an incident had affected the security and the normal functioning of our mission, he added.Scotland Yard said there had been two arrests for criminal damage but didnt give further details.The official Twitter handle of the Indian mission tweeted a photo of a smashed window and said: Another violent protest outside the Indian High Commission in London today, 3 September 2019. Damage caused to the premises.Independence Day celebrations in London by the Indian diaspora too had been disrupted by Pakistan-backed protestors and pro-Khalistani elements, who pelted stones and eggs at the building and the gathering outside.Following the protests on August 15 and 17, one of which was organised by the Hizb-ut-Tahrir, the Indian side had conveyed its concerns to British authorities about damage to the Indian mission and the harassment of members of the Indian community by Pakistan-backed elements.New Delhi has also been concerned about the manner in which the continuing protests have been played down by British officials.Britains Foreign Office had called last months protests as overwhelmingly peaceful while Scotland Yard called them largely peaceful. A Foreign Office spokesperson described Tuesdays protest too as largely peaceful and said police ensured a safe perimeter. The UK takes the security of all diplomatic missions extremely seriously and the Foreign Office was in close contact with our colleagues at the high commission throughout the day to ensure their safety and ability to work, the spokesperson added.Responding to the Indian missions tweet on Tuesday, London mayor Sadiq Khan had tweeted: I utterly condemn this unacceptable behaviour and have raised this incident with @metpoliceuk to take action.Indian officials believe the protests are part of Pakistans efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue following New Delhis decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmirs special status on August 5.India has been making complaints in the form of note verbale or demarches since the 1980s when Khalistani and Kashmiri separatist forces were operating openly in the UK, raising funds as well as staging demonstrations, people familiar with developments said.The position has always been - also revealed in declassified documents - that democratic dissent and protests are a matter of right and part of freedom of expression. It is a matter of balancing these rights against the duties that London is obliged to perform under the Vienna Convention, they said.First Published: Sep 04, 2019 14:03 IST"

Most had nine or less count of hemoglobin against normal range of 12 to 15 grams per deciliter of blood.The poor nutritional index served as a wake up call which set Bhalgamiya along with colleagues K J Jodhani and R D Jivani on a brainstorming session. The trio checked tiffin boxes of students and were not surprised to see almost all had dry snacks like sev-mamra, chevda, chips and fried food which was high on empty calories but poor in nutrition.Balgamiya decided to take the matter into his hands literally. We asked girls to bring just one fistful of pulses including green gram, kidney beans, chickpea, etc which they would soak overnight and sprout by lunchtime the next day, he says. The girls were fed this high-protein dish daily. To appeal to the kids' taste, teachers made a bhel adding lime, chilli, onion, tomato and salt.Over months, the simple solution started showing healthy results. Iron deficiency among girls started disappearing with improvement in their overall health. Encouraged, the school included sprouted beans in midday meal scheme.The initiative was lauded at different fora including educational innovation fair at IIM Ahmedabad . It was also placed in innovation gallery at Rashtrapati Bhavan for other regions to implement. The biggest compliment, however, was when the state government acknowledged the simple intervention to address anaemia and adopted it in the mid-day meal in 2017.A 2018 GR directed inclusion of pulses compulsory to include legumes in mid-day meals offered in all government schools,"" said a top education department official. Recently, Bhalgamiya recently presented the idea to trainee IAS officers and administrators for implementation. Now, we have shifted focus on improving nutritional value of food served to students for helping build stronger society and nation, said Jivani, Bhalgamiyas fellow teacher."
2019-09-06,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/insurance-boost-to-vegetable-cultivation/article29355546.ece,Insurance boost to vegetable cultivation,"Vegetable cultivation in Adilabad district is set to get a boost with the extension of insurance cover to tomato crop and the possibility of inclusion of a few more vegetables under the facility.Continuing manipulation of vegetable prices by middlemen, however, threatens to put a spanner in the plans of the district administration towards expanding the area under vegetable cultivation in coming years.Cultivation area downAccording to officials, the area under vegetable cultivation seems to have come down this year from the nearly 10,000 acres last year, but an accurate figure will emerge only after results of the ongoing Rythu Samagra Survey come in.The major crops include tomato (cultivated on about 4,000 acres) and cauliflower (on 700 acres), especially in Ichoda, Gudihatnoor and Indervelli mandals.We are selling cauliflower at 20 a kg while vendors are selling it for 60-80 per kg in the markets, pointed out Narwate Pradeep of Takiguda in Indervelli mandal. We are selling our produce in Kagaznagar (Kumram Bheem Asifabad district) and Mancherial markets, he added.Middlemen menaceDiscussing the nefarious activity of middlemen in vegetable markets, an official from the horticulture department said, The middlemen import one lorry load of cauliflower from Latur and Nanded districts in Maharashtra at cheaper prices to scare local farmers. Because of that tactic, the farmers are forced to sell their produce at lower  and often unremunerative  rates.Maharashtra farmers are able to supply cauliflower or tomato at comparatively cheaper rates as they incur less damage due to fluctuation in weather, observed Githe Keshav, a progressive vegetable farmer from Mannur in Gudihatnoor mandal. Our farmers put in more effort and money, thereby increasing cost of production, he said, listing the main reason for local farmers losing out to their counterparts in Maharashtra.Tomato farmers are under relatively less pressure despite the damage being caused to the crop due to the continuing unfavourable weather.Nearly 76 of them have opted for weather-based insurance for their crop on 157 acres and that has given them some assurance against crop damage, Horticulture Officer (Technical) G. Srinivas revealed as he talked of the insurance facility extended for the first time to tomato crop.A good propositionThe rabi tomato crop will also be insured and farmers can purchase the policies between October 1 and November 30. Insurance is a good proposition for tomato farmers given the experience of weather-based insurance for cotton, he opined, hoping that more farmers will cultivate vegetable crops from the coming season."

With Onam nearing, people thronged the stall to buy farm produce. It is one among the many stalls offering farm produce at subsidised rates as part of the governments intervention to control market prices.Onam markets will be organised from Saturday to Tuesday, whereby vegetables will be made available at heavily slashed rates.Two hundred such stalls set up jointly by the Agriculture Department, Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council (VFPCK) are slated to be opened in the city offering vegetables.The prices of farm produce in major vegetable markets in the city are skyrocketing. The sellers are charging triple the prices we are offering. All vegetables will be available at 20 per cent discounted rates at our stalls. If the prices in the markets increase further, then more discount will be provided to keep a check on the rates. The rates will be fixed on a daily basis depending on the prices in the vegetable markets, says Krishna Prasad P K, manager of the outlet in Palayam.All the farm produce necessary to celebrate Onam have arrived at the market in Anayara. These will be up for sale from Saturday at discounted rates, he said.Apart from the Horticorp outlets, several new Onam markets will be set up until Tuesday.The produce sourced from Kerala and those from other states are placed at different counters, thereby making it easier for the public to buy naadan varieties. Some vegetables such as tomatoes, beans, onions, potatoes, beetroot and such are not being cultivated here in large numbers. So we have to procure them from other states. We have stocked up enough to cater to the Onam demand this time, says Krishna Prasad.For people like Jayachandran B who regularly buys vegetables from Horticorp, the special Onam markets are a godsend. Such markets help arrest the prices and we get to buy fresh farm produce. During such festive occasions, retailers hike prices. These interventions help provide farm produce at affordable rates, says Jayachandran, a retired government servant.Anne John also echoes the same sentiment. Apart from arresting the prices, we also get local produce. I always buy from Horticorp and only get the produce made in the state, she says."

Various fruits, flowers, and vegetables are grown in rubber tyres, shoes, washbasins and toilet seats too. Climber plant ' Pirandai' creeps through the walls of the yard while small flowers in pink and yellow pop out from plastic water bottles hanging down. Along with them are various trees camouflaging the plants and plastic bottles are turned into art designs for showcase.Plants being grown in worn out shoes.

''Seeds for the vegetables grown here are from the waste collected itself and the garden is fully organic,'' says Deepa.Deepa, who has been in charge of the yard for three years has created this mini-forest with the help of the sanitation workers there. ''The vegetables and fruits grown here are given to sanitary workers and other staff at the yard for free,'' says Deepa.An artificial duck pond at the composting yard.

Thanks to the portria tree planted there which neutralizes the bad odour. ''We planted Poosa Maram (portia tree) because it has the capability to absorb the odour from waste and gives a pleasant space for sanitation workers segregation waste,'' says Deepa.Pomegranate, Mausambi, Guava, Cuckoo, Badam and Black Plum too are grown here. ''About six sugar cane and bamboo trees were planted three weeks ago,'' says Deepa, adding that agroforestry can help turn urban spaces into green cover and that it could be implemented in other composting yards too.ALSO READ | Mountains of trash cleared for green park at Chennai's Red Hills lakeThe yard apart from being home to squirrels and birds, also has an artificial duck pond with six ducks in it. Next to it, Azolla (mosquito ferns) are grown in a small pond as duck feed. It also has natural compost and vermicompost pits.Officials at the Panchayat said the aim is to make Red Hills and surrounding areas into a zero waste one. G Sathish, Executive Officer, Naravarikuppam Town Panchayat said six tonnes of waste is collected every day and almost 90 percent of it is segregated.''We do not want to throw away non-bio degradable waste such as rubber tyres and toilet basins. So we grow plants in that,'' said the Executive Officer, adding that the idea of creating a mini-forest was to put bio-waste into use."
2019-09-08,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hurricane-dorian-silence-devastation-mark-bahamas-town/article29367425.ece,"Hurricane Dorian: silence, devastation mark Bahamas town","The streets are filled with smashed cars, snapped power cables, shattered trees and deep silence.At the airport and dock, hundreds of people clamour for seats on airplanes and berths on ships arriving with aid and departing with people who lost their homes when deadly Hurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas.Nearly a week after disaster roared in from the sea, the rest of Marsh Harbour on Abaco island felt empty on Saturday. A hot wind whistled through stands of decapitated pine trees and homes that collapsed during the most powerful hurricane in the northwestern Bahamas recorded history.Rescue teams were still trying to reach some Bahamian communities isolated by floodwaters and debris after the disaster that killed at least 43 people. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis says 35 people died on Abaco and eight on Grand Bahama island.The U.S. Coast Guard said it has rescued a total of 290 people in the northern Bahamas following the hurricane. Six MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters and nine cutters are helping in the aid effort, the Coast Guard said.The United Nations said eight tons of food supplies were on the way by ship. Some 14,700 ready-to-eat meals as well as logistical and telecommunications equipment are being delivered, said Herve Verhoosel, spokesman for the U.N. World Food Program.The needs remain enormous, Mr. Verhoosel said.No official figures were available, but much of the population of Marsh Harbour, home to most of the roughly 20,000 residents of Abaco, seemed to have already left. Many were staying with relatives in the capital, Nassau, others with family in Florida and other parts of the United States.In Marsh Harbours Murphy Town neighborhood, on a hill overlooking the azure sea, Jackson Blatch and his son-in-law were already rebuilding. In a blazing midday sun they stripped damaged shingles from Mr. Blatchs roofs and tossed them into his truck, parked below the eaves of a home he built by hand.Like a few other Abaco residents, Mr. Blatch is staying on an island pulverised by nature.Everybody says, Leave. Leave and go where? Mr. Blatch asked. My plan is to rebuild this island. I have a lot to offer.Unlike almost every other home on Abaco, Mr. Blatchs house had little damage. He is a builder who prides himself on quality work. When mixing concrete, he never skimps, always precisely blending the recommended amounts of cement, sand and gravel for floors, columns and ceilings.When he poured his walls and floors, he laced them thick with rebar, constructing a powerful skeleton that resisted the storm.Instead of using the manufacturer-provided clips on his hurricane shutters, he used long screws on as many as possible to fix the shutters tight to the window frame.When Dorian hit, it only managed to rip away the shutters with store-bought clips, and a few sections of shingles, leaving some of the Mr. Blatch familys possessions wet but the structure and furnishings intact.So Mr. Blatch has power from a generator, drinking water, food and the help of his son-in-law, 25-year-old Moses Monestine.I dont have a mortgage. I dont want to go to Nassau, he said. I dont want to go to the United States. I dont want to depend on anyone.Abacoans, as island residents are known, describe themselves as a self-sufficient and resourceful, used to making their living from the sea. Blocks and even entire neighbourhoods are taken up by extended families a cousin next door to a brother next door to a sister-in-law, forming instant support networks that went into action ahead of the storm.Many Abacoans work on ships or docks, others at the second homes that wealthy Americans have built throughout the long, curving island.Brian Russell, 55, is a marine engineer who has lived through three hurricanes on sea and many others on land.In his home in the Dundas Town neighborhood, he has six months of drinking water and four months of water for bathing. He has a generator, and months of food.The destruction doesnt deter him.Ive been around a long time, he said. It doesnt bother me. Anywhere you go, life is what you make of it.Once the water contaminated by the storm is clean, Mr. Russell said, he can live on fishing and gardening. His little garden of onion, tomato and banana plants was destroyed, but he plans to replant, and even add soursop, mango and sugar apple.Others were more stuck than determined.Sterling McKenzie, a 67-year-old retired equipment operator, is living in his sisters house with other relatives whose homes were destroyed. They are surviving on water and food donated by Bahamian officials and aid workers who pass by daily.We might as well stay here and battle it out, he said. I aint got no choice."

For over 50 years, since the green revolution, the unaccounted push for increased production has raised the farmers costs of cultivation. It has also disrupted the availability of groundwater. If that wasnt enough, the farmer today is also held inside the vicious cycle of credit.In an interview to News18, Dr Prakash Bakshi, former chairman of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) describes the dire state of Indian agriculture.His contributions to agriculture include the designing and leading the implementation of the internationally acclaimed self-help group (SHG) programme, leading the restructuring of rural cooperatives and designing the Kudumbashree anti-poverty programme for the Government of Kerala. Presently, he is associated with the Pune based-Audyogik Shikshan Mandal (ASM) Group of Institutes.With increasing land fragmentation, there is no water for irrigation, but increasing net area under irrigation and decreasing landholding size: where is Indian agriculture headed?The most important structural issue with agriculture today is land fragmentation. By now there are more than 145 million landholdings in the country. By 2040, this will be close to 200 million. If you look at our total crop area, it is 150 million hectares. This means that in another 15 years the average landholding size will become less than 1 hectare. This is a huge crisis.When land holdings become small, the farmer's requirement for input also becomes smaller. From the supply side, it becomes a bigger challenge because of the quantities involved. For example, in 100 hectares of wheat being cultivated, the amount of seeds required is the same, whether it is cultivated by one person or a hundred persons.But from the seed sellers point of view, if he has to sell seeds for a 100-hectare farm to one person, it is very different than selling to 100 persons. Here the cost and strategy of selling changes. The same is true for the supply of electricity. For one 100 hectares, there is one connection, while for 100 one hectare farms there are 100 connections.What I am trying to point out is that because of land fragmentation, the cost of supplying inputs is increasing drastically and not just the price of input.How should the agriculture sector readjust according to the current water crisis?The policy of providing things for free to the farmer needs to be revisited.Even if we use all the groundwater and all the surface water, we must remember that close to 30 per cent of our farms still remain unirrigated. We dont have that much water. This means that we need to start emphasising on water-saving devices. Productivity needs to focus attention from quintals per hectare but also in quintals per cubic metre of water used.Some steps have been taken in that direction but they are not enough. For instance, in the previous budget, it was mandatory that drip irrigation is used for the farming of water-intensive crop sugarcane.However, the intention of certain governments to take a populist approach to agriculture has also caused problems around water. For the farmer, if he gets free electricity, he will not care about the pumps running all the time and throwing water into the fields. When there is a cost to a facility, people become more conscious.Does waving interest on loans help or is the farmer in need of some other waivers or benefits?I strongly oppose the concept of interest or loan waivers. As a policy, this is a wrong practice. Credit is only a small part of the bigger picture, while interest on credit is not even 10 per cent of the total cost of cultivation.The problem then lies with land fragmentation. As the land becomes smaller and smaller, the total produces that the farmer has also become smaller vis a vis the cost of cultivation which includes the expenditure of transportation, marketing and selling of produce. What the farmer needs is good marketing.I have been asking for three urgent reforms for the agriculture sector. One, the land leasing policy. It must be ruled that agriculture land is allowed to be leased out. Irrespective of whether the owner himself cultivates it or not, he cannot ask his neighbour or friend or someone else to cultivate it on lease.Two, reforms are required at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act. In most states, agricultural produce can only be sold at the mandi recognised by the APMC Act of the state. If a farmer wants to sell his produce to the prospective client directly, why cant he sell it? Why should someone else get a mandi fee or commission on that transaction? We urgently need to change the marketing practices of his produce.Three, Indian agriculture must move away from its focus on food grain policy. We adopted this when there was a crisis of food in the country. Now, we must endeavour to produce non-food grain crops, especially those that consume less water. We have neglected horticulture, fruits, and vegetables. This will increase the nutritional status of the country and also raise the farmers income. We must ask why MSP only for wheat, why not for tomato?Can the government have sponsored skill-based agri-courses boost agri-entrepreneurship in India?We need to start telling our farmers how to cultivate crops in other more innovative ways. We have to start telling them about vertical agriculture. We have to teach them how to use water more efficiently. This education should be given in general agricultural courses.Agri-business is equally important for both the farmer and the increasing younger population of the country. It is important to teach our farmers how to maintain quality while producing in quantity. It is easier to maintain quality in large land holdings than smaller ones for the same quantity produced. For exports to many countries, for instance, there should be no use of fertilisers and pesticides; it should be residue-free.Now, what is residue-free in agriculture? Are we teaching this to the aspirant MBAs in agriculture lot, are we teaching this to farmers? These are important things now. There has to be a shift in education policy from just growing more food, whether, in terms of quality, logistics, marketing or education, it is needed now.The government can push agribusiness-education on a large scale. The HRD ministry ought to sit down with Agri ministry and see how we can impact agri-business education to the youth and farmers in colleges. We must learn from the farmer. The courses must provide skills and knowledge on cold chain, storage, logistics, cropping patterns, water efficiency that the industry demands. We must push for practical knowledge. It is time to move away from only theoretical knowledge.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

In Anantapur market, tomatoes are not fetching a price of even Rs 3 a kg, forcing the farmers to leave the produce in their fields to save the cost of hiring labour.According to horticulture officials, half of the tomato produce is still in the fields and the yield will come to the market only if there is any rise in the prices in the coming days. As the tomato produce had started coming to the market at once in huge quantity, the prices crashed.A 15 kg tomato box is being sold at Rs 40 to Rs 50 now. The farmers, who invested a huge amount of money to raise the tomato crop, are expressing concern at the falling prices.The farmers said they do not get even transport charges if they sell the produce at Rs 50 a box. Speaking to TNIE, Sriram Gautham, a farmer of Nuthimadugu village in Kambadur Mandal, said he raised tomato crop by investing Rs 30,000 per acre. The tomato prices are falling steeply. If the downward trend continues, the farmers cannot get even transport charges, he lamented.Every day a huge quantity of tomatoes is being brought to the market yards resulting in a slump in the prices.The farmers borrowed huge money to raise the tomato crop, but falling prices have made them crestfallen, another ryot rued.Anticipating a better price, some tomato farmers have started taking their produce to Madanapalle in neighbouring Chittoor and Kolar in Karnataka.Assistant Director of Horticulture Chandrasekhar said, There is no scope for a rise in tomato prices in the open market in the coming days. The downward trend will continue till this month end.Farmers cultivated tomato crop in a large extent in the district this season and the yield is also good. As the farmers are bringing a huge quantity of tomato produce to the market at once, the prices are on the decline, he added."

As Onam fervour reaches a crescendo, heres a roundup of how educational institutions in the city ushered in the festivities with acts of generosity and togetherness.Around 35 patients of the palliative care unit of Ernakulam General Hospital and mentally challenged students of Buds School, Mulavukad, joined the Onam celebrations at St Alberts College recently. I am grateful to everyone who organised this celebration. At a time when senior parents are being abandoned by their children, this is a warm gesture, said Ramachandran, a patient. The college management organised the event to foster a sense of compassion among its students. A dance performance by the students of Buds left the audience in awe. 33 per cent of the funds collected was earmarked for supporting relief activities in the aftermath of floods.The students of the Commerce Department of St Pauls College, Kalamassery, celebrated Onam in a noble way. The fund allotted for procuring flowers for pookalam was instead used to buy vegetables to make the mandala and later donated to an orphanage run by social activist Theruvoram Murugan. There are around 27 to 30 inmates in the orphanage who were rescued from the streets.The orphange sustains itself through contributions. I asked the students to think about doing something different and they came up with the idea of making a design using vegetables, said Jibin Jacob, assistant professor, who mentored the initiative. We used 150 kg of vegetables to make the carpet. The vegetables were selected keeping in mind the needs of the inmates, added Jibin. The carpet comprised of an array of veggies including brinjals, beetroots, tomatoes, onions, drumstick, French beans, pumpkin, elephant foot yam, cucumber, colocasia, banana flower, carrots, ladys finger, ivy gourd, snake gourd, cowpea, potatoes and shallots.Onam celebrations held at Toc H Public School saw students presenting dance and music performances which highlighted various traditions associated with the festival and artforms unique to Kerala. The celebration commenced with toddlers of kindergarten welcoming everyone by reciting the popular song Vannalo vannalo onam vannalo. Boys and girls attended the function dressed in traditional outfits.Major highlights of Onam celebrations at Greets Public School was the mega Thiruvathirakali performed by the girl students and the vanchi pattu presented by the boys. The programme began with shingari melam and pulikali. The mega Thiruvathirakali and the vanchi pattu were organised to send a message of unity."

Vaanga saami, she calls out as I enter. Her shop is the converted front of her home in Vadivelampalayam (Coimbatore), a two-kilometre ride from the Siruvani Main Road.Kamalathaal (no one is sure how old she is, but the estimate is around 90) has been selling these idlis for 30 years. She doesnt lose sleep over making a profit, she says, and is more than happy with what she earns, along with her family members who are daily wage earners. I am doing well. People love it here, and eat to their hearts content. What more can I ask for? she smiles.When asked if she faces flak from nearby eateries for her price of 1 per idli, she firmly responds, It is my choice, I will sell them at the price I want to. I am not going to budge for anyone. Kamalaathaal sells 500 idlis a day. And she does not take a holiday, not even on festivals. While she makes the idlis, her grandsons wife ladles out hot bondas  each costing 2.50  on the other side of the house.Every seven minutes or so, a fresh batch emerges. Hot and fluffy idlis are scooped out and served with a tangy tomato chutney and a spicy vegetable sambar. She affectionately enquires whether I like the idlis and smiles when I tell her I do. Pointing to a gang of boys devouring idlis, she says they are her favourite customers. An elderly gentleman enters and, on finding no space, tells paati that he will return later. In the meanwhile, the boys troop out arguing about who ate the most.Kamalathaal does the lions share of the work herself; whether it is buying the rice from the local ration shop, grinding the batter for her idlis, pouring it into the mould and serving them to her customers. She grinds the chutney on the aatukal or grinding stone. Her day begins at 5 am, and her first customers start coming in by 6. If they are not eating there, they bring tiffin boxes to fill up. She winds up around noon.The hot idlis, served on plantain leaves, keep coming till I protest. She asks if I need more chutney or sambar, which I am urged to help myself to. As I leave, a little girl arrives, with a big vessel and a tumbler for chutney. She leaves with a smile, carefully balancing her familys breakfast, all taken care of with just 30."

When he started to put some pepper and sauce on it, he found worms in the pepper packet and tomato sauce bottle. He approached the IRCTC staff, who offered to replace the food. Kale made a video of the incident and submitted a formal complaint with the Indian Railways on August 21.Harsha Shah, an activist working for the rights of commuters, said that the penalty imposed on the catering agency was a good lesson. However, she claimed that Indian Railways was not taking enough precautions to maintain the standards that the Deccan Queens dining car was known for earlier.Its a 90-year-old service and the Indian Railways should ensure that impeccable quality is maintained in the dining car, which is part of the heritage of Indian Railways and the country , said Shah."

The passengers said in the complaint that when he had sprinkled salt and pepper on the meal, he found maggots.Kale had sought a replacement of the meal and was provided with another omelette. On adding tomato ketchup on the omelette, he found the worms in it again. The matter was under investigation ever since Pune rail division officials referred the case to us. Besides slapping a fine on the company engaged in conducting the catering services on the train, a warning has also been issued to them, an IRCTC spokesperson told TOI.A copy of the letter on the fine slapped by the IRCTC is with TOI.Kale said he couldnt complain immediately after his experience on the train because the Mumbai-Pune railway route was shut for days because of the heavy rain in the ghat section.I wanted to lodge a complaint, but couldnt do so because train services were disrupted. I was later advised to lodge the complaint in Pune and I did it, Kale had said.The IRCTC mainly handles the catering services on trains. However, vendors approved by the corporation are also on board many trains for the job. Deccan Queen, which is among the most iconic trains in the country, celebrated its 90th year in June. The train is particularly known for its dining car, which has been in place since years now and was recently upgraded.Railway Pravasi Group chairman Harsha Shah, who had helped Kale file the complaint, said, They should have slapped the catering company with a heavier penalty. But it is good to see that some action has been taken. Catering in trains has come under the scanner time and again. The Railways should focus on providing quality food to the passengers."

The outcome was the NGO Siruvani Vizhuthugal, that is striving to get the village back to what it was.Initially, we started a WhatsApp group with 150 youngsters from our village to discuss nature, ecology and conservation. A pipeline project for rainwater harvesting was being misused as a sewage channel by residents and apartments in the area. The drain water entered Sadivayal Chinnar and Masaorambu, the tributaries of Noyyal polluting them. We could no longer go for a swim or drink water from the river. Illegal sand mining on the river bed was another grave issue. This was the starting point for our NGO that was registered last year, he explains. The NGO began replanting native tree saplings in the village and alerted authorities whenever trucks with sand were spotted in the vicinity.Siruvani Vizhuthugal divided the village into 13 zones and assigned a co-ordinator for each zone. Six are tribal settlements. The co-ordinators keep a check on activities there and report to us. As their first project, they identified a government school in the panchayat and planted neem, pungan, poo arasu, and vaagai there. Its a canopy of trees now, says a pleased Ramkumar. Nearly 3000 trees have been planted as part of the NGOs greening efforts. Sundays are kept aside for nature. We spend time with the trees, removing weeds, and watering them. We are happy that the afforestation drive is bringing a number of resident and migratory birds to the village.Unholy consequences Post Ganesh Chaturthi, 50 volunteers undertook the task of fishing out Plaster of Paris remnants of the idols from the Sadivayal Chinnar. They worked for 13 hours trying to remove nearly 200 of them from the water bodies.Chemicals and artificial dyes used in colouring these idols contaminate the water and harm to the animals in the forest nearby that come here to quench their thirst.The Siruvani Vizhuthugal are also cleaning-up water bodies. We have collected truck loads of plastic waste. We send the waste to the landfill. We renovated 10 public toilets and assigned one each to three families in the village. The families maintain them now. We do conduct periodic checks. We constantly have conversations with people about Nature and caring for the environment.Anand T, one of the volunteers of the NGO was working in Chennai but when he came home here and saw the work the NGO was doing, he quit his job and joined them. It is very fulfilling.The elders in the village are pleased with their work. They bring us snacks and tea, smiles Ramkumar. We plan to tie up with Anna University to teach the tribal people scientific methods of epiculture. We are also researching on sustainable ways of waste management."

Nagi Reddy, on Saturday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said a long-term plan should be drafted for stabilising the prices. The Agriculture Market Committees (AMC) should be involved in the process, he said. He said a cell should be formed with experts for supervising the procurement of agriculture produce and marketing.The officials told the Chief Minister that pulses and tomatoes were not fetching minimum returns due to piling up of stocks with the farmers, and stressed the need for necessary intervention.The Chief Minister enquired about the rising prices of onion, and asked the officials to rein them in.During the TDP regime, businessmen and politicians had duped the farmers to a great extent, he alleged.Purchase centresMr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the farmers should make the best use of the Market Stabilisation Fund, and insisted that purchasing centres be opened wherever required to ensure that the farmers got remunerative price.He said the 1,830 crore, which the TDP government owed to the farmers, would be cleared by the end of this month. Rythu Bharosa and input subsidies would go a long way in helping the farmers in the days to come, the Chief Minister added."

In olden days, we were surrounded by trees, our houses were breathable. There was life around us. In modern houses, we hardly find a place to grow even small plants. Also, everyone has his/her own reasons not to grow them. Some cite lack of interest or time, water scarcity, water seepage, and even monkeys. However, I feel that you have a will, there is a way, he says.Shailender, who has a terrace garden in Padmarao Nagar in Hyderabad, not only grows various vegetables and flowers, but also makes bio-enzymes from the organic waste. The bio-enzymes have replaced all chemicals at his home including toilet cleaners, floor cleaners, detergents, body wash, car wash etc. He also makes juices from the herbs in his garden. He is also a permaculturist.I started my terrace gardening in 2014 after living in my Gurujis ashram which was surrounded by trees. I, along with my brother Sai Kumar and parents, take care of our garden. Initially, my parents were worried about the building strength and seepage, but they came aboard after water-proofing the terrace, he says.Shailender SG grows vegetables like ivy gourds, tomatoes, and herbs like tulsiShailender grows vegetables, including ivy gourds, bitter gourds, bottle gourds, ladies fingers, tomatoes, cabbages, bell peppers, etc. He also grows herbs like spearmint, brahmi, tulsi, lemongrass and flowers like lily, hibiscus, jasmine, marigold, chrysanthemum, rose etc.We dont use any pesticides. We take care of soil health with the help of the compost made from our kitchen waste and brown matter from the leaves fallen on the streets. We grow nitrogen fixer plants in the pot along with one main plant for sharing nutrients. Pests are managed by the diversity we grow. Our soil mix has less soil and more of dried cowdung and compost. We preserve our own seeds and also exchange them with other terrace gardeners, he adds.The man with a green thumb says, If you have a backyard, terrace or even a balcony, you can bring life into your home. This will increase prana, and bring in insects and birds."

But we bet that nothing made Prime Minister Narendra Modi happier than the sight of his favourite dishes arranged neatly in shiny copper thali, and served to him lovingly by his mother.He is super busy handling the reins of the nation but, on his birthday, PM Modi always finds the time to meet his mother and seek her blessings. His 69th birthday on Tuesday was no different. After an action-packed day including a visit to Sardar Sarovar dam, the PM  clad in white kurta-pajama and a saffron Nehru jacket  visited his mother Hiraba and had a simple but sumptuous lunch with her at Vrundavan 2 in Raysan village in Gandhinagar, where she resides with his younger brother Pankaj Modi.The PM is known for his austerity. Its well-known that he is strictly vegetarian and loves simple Gujarati food. So, the thaali had sliced cucumber-tomato-carrot salad, kachcha-paka tindora nu salad (stir-fried ivysalad), alu-mattar sabji (potato-peas), fangavela mag (sprouted moong) and mixed kathol (pulses), tuvar daal, rice and Gujarati rotli. It also had puran polis (flat bread stuffed with a sweet lentil filling)  another favourite of the PM.The PM was to meet his mother early on Tuesday before the Sardar Sarovar event but there w a s a change in the schedule and he decided to have lunch with her. The food was cooked by Unnati, daughter-in-law of Pankaj Modi, who along with his wife Sarita were out of State when the PM came visiting. After sharing some light moments with his mother, the PM left 35 minutes later.An old-timer who has worked closely with the PM when he was Gujarat CM said sukhdi was his alltime favourite sweet. Every time, a close friend or relative met Narendrabhai, he would carry the simple Gujarati sweet made with wheat flour, jaggery and ghee. Narendrabhai also loved Gujarati farsan such as bhajiyas, handvo, dhokla, fafda and gathiya and used to have them during state- or national-level meetings with BJP leaders, he said.Though the PM enjoyed the lavish fare at meetings, his daily diet was restricted. His breakfast comprised green tea and rotis made out of bajri. He did not have ghee in his daily diet. He would have rotis made of some grain during lunch with vegetables, lots of leafy vegetables and salads. Wheat was a big no. Dinner comprised of khichdi or porridge, very light food, he added.After PM Modis White House visit in 2014 its a well-known fact that he also observes a fast during. And during this time he consumes only lemonade and a cup of tea during the day.I love Gujarati thali. Since it is difficult to make at home, we go out to have it at least once or twice a month. If I have to chose one thing from the thaali, it will be Gujarati daal. I love it. We have it at home several times as we have a Gujarati cookGUJARAT CHIEF SECRETARYI relish Gujarati food as there is a wide range of texture in the dishes. The Gujarati daal is my favourite as it has a complex yet subtle flavour because of the multi-layer taste. I also like bhakri. We try to make Gujarati daal quite regularly in our kitchen if possible as it is thinner yet full of richness.ABAD POLICE COMMISSIONERGujarati thaali has a lot of variety and offers a wide spread of dishes. I have been on a diet for long, and I also travel a lot. Thought all kinds of Gujarati dishes are prepared in my kitchen, bajri no rotlo,and ringan bhartha find prominence.RIL GROUP PRESIDENT (CORPORATE AFFAIRS)I am a big fan of the Gujarati dinner thaali, especially bajra no rotolo, adad daal and ringna nu shaak. Since I found out that bajri is good for diabetes, I have incorporated bajra no rotlo and daal in my daily meal schedule. Besides being yummy, it is highly nutritious too.MP AND DELHI BJP CHIEFGujarati thaali is a well-balanced meal. Phulka gives carbs, daal gives protein and vegetables give fibre. Ghee on roti or as tadka on daal is good fat. None of the items have heavy cream, hence its light on stomach and low in calories. I love dhokla. I have thepla daily but nothing beats fada ni khichdiNUTRITIONIST AND AUTHORThe Gujarati thaali has a perfect blend of flavours, I just love the assortment. Looking at one gives me a sense of wholesomeness because you can tell that all the food has been prepared with so much love. I love all the dishes, but I would pick the Gujarati daal over everything. In fact, chundoo (a sweet mango pickle) is a regular delicacy in our household.ACTOR"

Read MoreWASHINGTON: Houston, we've had a problem here is the storied expression used by the crew of the Apollo 13 moon flight to report a major technical problem back to their Houston base. Nearing half a century later, Houston itself may have a problem on its hands as it gears up to host an event dubbed the Howdy, Modi! community summit for Indias prime minister that will have an unprecedented guest appearance by US President Donald Trump.While the City of #Houston tweeted out a welcome visitors from across the country in anticipation of Indian Prime Minister Modis visit this weekend at @nrgpark, the 50,000-capacity stadium that is expected to be packed to the rafters, both anti-Modi protestors and the Modi fan club are duking it out on social media and on the streets ahead of the landmark event.Billboards welcoming Prime Minister Modi are springing up in several parts of the city, Americas fourth largest, even as Modi critics, notably many Pakistanis, Kashmiri Muslims, separatist Khalistanis, and civil liberties activists are organizing demonstrations and petitions condemning the citys decision to host and welcome the Indian leader.Some pro-Khalistani truck drivers were seen driving trucks festooned with anti-Modi posters, while activists disrupted a meeting of the city hall, distributing what was described as a 50+ page packet of articles about Modi, the RSS, and its white supremacist connection and inspiration by the Nazis.In turn, pro-India activists and Modi supporters (not always the same) are warning the city of possible violence by protestors. Radical Pakistan based wahabi sunni islamists are planning to hijack and vandalise the event, hope you've made adequate security and arrangements, read one tweet from a rally supporter, and other reminded the city of anti-India demonstrations in Pretoria and in London, where Pakistani lumpens rioted in front of the Indian High Commission, throwing eggs and tomatoes.Both supporters and critics of Prime Minister Modi are pushing their agenda and narrative around the event that is also expected to be an economic bonanza for the city, which boasts of being the energy capital of the world. Some major trade deals are expected to be announced on the margins of the event, with officials from the US State Department and the Commerce Department flying out to Texas to meet their Indian counterparts to flesh out the details.Although no bilateral meeting is scheduled between Modi and Trump in Houston (they are slated to meet in New York), they could nevertheless go beyond a joint appearance at the rally. Trump himself has not spoken much about the rally ever since the surprise announcement that he will be joining Modi there, despite the growing chorus of criticism of Modi and India for its actions in Jammu and Kashmir.While a few US lawmakers have criticized Indias move and the curtailment of civil liberties in the Kashmir Valley, many more legislators are expected to attend the rally given the convergence of economic and strategic interests of both countries, notwithstanding reservations in some quarters about the leadership in both countries.The Pakistani campaign, which is getting more virulent by the day, has had little effect on the Trump administrations decision to ally with the Modi dispensation."

Narasimha Rao said on Thursday.Mr. Narasimha Rao was here to participate in the Swachh Bharat programme organised as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis birthday celebrations. On the occasion, he also inaugurated medical camps, which included cancer screening, at 75 places in the district.Speaking on the occasion, he alleged that the TDP governments failure had led to spurt in suicides by the farmers.During the 100-day rule of the YSRCP government, 50 farmers had taken the extreme step, he said.Mr. Narasimha Rao further alleged that the TDP government had failed to produce the action taken report on the 350 crore it spent and, instead, submitted a one-line utilisation report.Despite the region being drought-prone with highest deficit rainfall recorded year after year, the Chief Ministers from the region did not bother to develop it, he alleged.He said he would undertake a padayatra from October 2 to highlight the issues of the region. The BJP leader said the Centre had launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyaan in 286 districts that were water-deficient.The BJP leader promised to bring to the notice of the Centre the need for according special attention to Anantapur district. He, however, parried questions on how the BJP proposed to assure irrigation / drinking water to mitigate the drought conditions and on the Polavaram project.Tomato ryots plightReferring to the plight of the tomato farmers, he said one kg was being sold for just 5 or even less, forcing the farmers to dump the produce on the road. He wanted the government to make use of the 35,000 crore Minimum Stabilisation Fund to bail them out.The grama volunteer system is akin to the Janmabhoomi panels of the TDP, and the State government will face the music soon, Mr. Narasimha Rao said."

With price of onions rising sharply over the last few days, home budgets are sure to take a hit. Making matters worse, the price is only going to rise for the next two months till fresh yield is available in the market, say traders and farmers.On Friday, onion was selling at Rs 50-60 per kg in the retail market in Bengaluru and at Rs 40 in the wholesale market. According to Hopcoms, the price of onion per kg was Rs 60. On Thursday, the price was Rs 52 per kg and on Wednesday, it was Rs 47. Hopcoms officials say that prices are rising by about Rs 4 per kg every day.The situation seems to be the same in other parts of the state too. In Mysuru, onion was selling at Rs 50-56 per kg on Friday as against Rs 47 last week. Kalaburagi saw a sharp rise from Rs 40 per kg on Wednesday to Rs 60 on Friday. While onion was selling at anywhere between Rs 40 and Rs 50 in Mangaluru, it was Rs 45-48 in Shivamogga. Ramu, a wholesale merchant in Shivamogga said the price will touch Rs 50 by Saturday. The red onion variety is arriving in Belagavi from Nashik in Maharashtra.The import not enough to meet the requirement due to which the price has shot to Rs 3,500 per quintal at APMC in Belagavi. In the retail market, onion is sold at Rs 40-45 per kg. Kalleshi Chandgadkar, a wholesale onion merchant, said, The high price of onion at this time is common every year since stocks of the previous season drying up. Fresh yield will start arriving in a couple of weeks from Karnataka and the price is expected come down.Hoteliers, homemakers feel the pinch of rising priceThe rising prices have already started impacting restaurants and small eateries which have resorted to reducing the quantity of onions used in food items and salads. Homemakers are also using less of onions so that the home budget is not disturbed in the middle of the month. Veerendra Kamat, treasurer, Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association, said the rise in price will definitely have an impact on the quality of food as onion, potato and tomato are three major ingredients. It will also have an impact on customers. He added that restaurant and hotels can stock onions for a maximum of 15 days.Sumitra M, a homemaker, said: Increasing prices are a worry as Dasara festival is just round the corner. Our monthly budgets will be affected. The government should look into the issue of price rise.BN Prasad, Managing Director of Hopcoms, said onion price had touched the highest of Rs 60 per kg in the last one-and-half years. Stocks available in Karnataka presently is 6-8 months old from Maharashtra. Since quality is good, the prices are also high. The fresh stocks which came from Chitradurga andGadar are not that good, he said. Good quality onion is judged by its deep pink colour, pungent smell and bulb size.Uday Shankar, an onion trader, told TNIE that heavy rain over the last few months has damaged the crops in most parts of Karnataka including Chitradurga, Gadag, Hubballi-Dharwad, Challakere and even Maharashtra. This has led to a shortfall in supply. Around 50% of the onion consumed in Karnataka, especially Bengaluru, come from Maharashtra.Shankar added that so far, there was no effect on import and export. We will have to import onions when prices touch Rs 100 per kg, but it may not rise so much. Spot sales to traders from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh has also come down, he said. Usually, around this time, the market yards see the arrival of around one lakh bags per day, but that has now dropped to 50,000 bags. Each bag holds about 50-55 kg of onions, depending on the size.GOING NORTHD 50-60/kgOnionD 15 (native) D 20 (hybrid)/kgTomato D 26 -28 /kgPotato"

For North Indians living in the South, finding a place that serves authentic Naan, Stuffed Paneer, Malai Kababs, etc. can get difficult. But the newly-launched Copper Chimney in the busy neighbourhood of Koramangala sets the expectations just about right.Copper Chimney, which began its journey in Bombay in 1972, now has 15 outlets in Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, besides three in Kuwait and one in Dubai. The restaurant claims to have retained some of their oldest recipes in the menu, which gave us ample reasons to check it out.It was a quiet evening, and the view from the outdoor seating area, with an open kitchen inside, made us comfortable. A cafe latte seemed like a fine drink to soak in the rainy weather of September. We ordered Achari Mushroom, Smoked White Pepper Chicken Chop, and Bhatti Murg Tikka as starters. Interesting fact: The menu also mentions the place of influence for the dishes that are labelled as originals. For example, mushroom is an influence from Haryana, while Chicken Chop represents flavours of Balochistan, and the Murg Tikka is from Punjab.A few minutes later, we were served Kadak Roomali, an interesting variant of the famous soft, pliable and translucent roti. It was a crisp, handkerchief-thin roti, with a bowl-like depression formed by the inverted tawa on which it was cooked, topped with masala-infused chopped tomatoes and onions  a refreshing beginning to the meal indeed.As for our appetisers, the mushroom came barbecued, flavoured with mustard and pickling spices, and tantalised our taste buds immediately. The chicken chops are smoky, tossed in nutmeg, white pepper, and chillies, making it succulent. The murg tikka is grilled and flavoured with Bhatti masala.For the main course, we ordered Butter Roomali Roti along with Benaras Malai Kofta, which is a little on the sweeter side. Out of the several curries featured on the menu, the two went really well together.You can also try out the Specials here, like the Slow-cooked Frontier Raan, Chelo Kebab, and biryanis, which are flavourful and reflect the rich cooking techniques of the north.To end the day on a sweet note, we relished the piping hot small Gulab Jamuns served on a pretty platter.Cost for two: `1,500 (approx)"

Potato was priced at 28, carrot 24, tomato 10 and brinjal at 10. The sole exception was small onion, which was priced at 35, Mr. Rajendran said.Mr. Rajendran attributed the steep rise in onion prices to the shortage in supply of stock for the past two months owing to the floods in parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka, the two major onion growing states. My guess is that the price will not decrease for the next two months, he said.K.M. Shivakumar, Associate Professor of Agricultural Economics, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), said that TNAU periodically forecasts the prices of only small onions, otherwise known as shallots, and not for Bellary onions. There is no price correlation or price transmission between the two, he said, adding that there is no holistic picture regarding the present situation of price rise.According to him, the onion crop situation in Karnataka is relatively better than that of Maharashtra and that the supply from Karnataka might compensate for Maharashtra.The State government asked TNAU to forecast the prices of Bellary onion in 2015, when onion prices touched 100 per kg, to provide market advisories. Noting that no such instruction from the government has come yet, Mr. Shivakumar said,It indicates that things are sailing in a proper direction. There is no panic situation in the markets regarding the price rise, he added."

Are we going to get a plate full of raw leafy vegetables? Will we be plugging our noses as we eat food that tilts more towards nutritious than delicious? But Sant Spa Cuisine at Indiranagar firmly turns these notions on their head with dishes that arent just vibrant and colourful but nourishing and wholesome too. The restaurant brings in the concept of spa cuisine in Bengaluru and everything from its decor (soothing green walls and plants a plenty) to its dishes left us feeling rejuvenated and like we were one step closer to finally achieving our long-pending new year resolutions of leading a healthier lifestyle.Spa cuisine is a concept where we use non-refined grains and nothing is packaged or processed. All our dishes are balanced in terms of portions, Pallavi Gupta, the owner, tells us as we dig into some spinach and beetroot hummus, served with a side of khakra. The dish, too pretty to eat (thanks to the bright pink and green hues), too tempting to avoid, may have been the first to arrive on the table but was the last to leave and is a definite must try.As we go through the rest of the menu (colour-coded for easier access: Yellow for the Moringa-based dishes, green for vegan options), we decide to try their Avocado Salad (fresh, light and well-dressed enough to consider seconds) and a portion of their Crunchy Chlorophyll Dimsums on Red Curry. Considering the last time we heard that word was in high school, we wonder what it is doing on the menu here but soon learn that the basil, broccoli, baby spinach and pakchoy is what gives the dish this name.The dimsum itself was slightly bland but the curry more than compensates for it with its creamy texture.Sante boasts of a variety of smoothie bowls, enough to leave us deciding well have to make another visit to try them all. But of the two we tried  Mango Passion Vetiver and Moringa Almond Vanilla Smoothie  the former was our favourite and felt like summer in the midst of monsoon, the peach slices adding a nice taste to the smoothie.Moringa, Gupta tells us, also finds place on the menu in their attempt to stay as local as possible with their ingredients. Intrigued, we also try the Moringa Almond Shake, whose most redeeming factor is the lightness with which it settles in our belly. For a sweeter variant, try the strawberry soy drink and for a more fun kick, opt for the midnight dark activated charcoal lemonade. Brownie points to Sante for its banana leaf straws!Our mains included an organic Falafel Shwarma Burger, a Farm Fresh Pizza (complete with olives, jalapenos, sundried tomatoes, et all) and Pizza Verde (topped with different greens and more on the saltier side). Despite being cautioned that the burger may be on the drier side, we found it to be quite the opposite. If given a choice, however, we wouldnt order the pizza again, just because it seems too conventional. The menu has plenty other options that seem more interesting. Melon and Brahmi, Carbon Dimsums or The Buddha Bowl anyone? PS: You can reward yourself with a Valrhona Chocolate Pie: Decadently rich chocolate (with no added sugar) that sits on buckwheat base. Who said healthy food had to be boring? Cost for two:1,800 (approx)"

The actor who has the vigour and a youthful vibe, recently credited the humble idli sambar as one of the secrets behind his fitness. While talking to The Times of India, the Race actor revealed that his love for south Indian cuisine has played a vital role in making him what he is.AdvertisingIt probably has to do with my love for South Indian food and the amount of such food that I have consumed over the decades. I am very fond of the cuisine. Idli, sambar, chutney, dosa and all the pickles I have had with rice, rasam and curd must be the reason. South Indian cuisine like idli and dosa are healthy food options. When a person is unwell, their diet usually includes idlis  as it is the safest food option, Anil Kapoor told the media group.In 2013, India Breakfast Habits Study, a survey conducted in four metros, found that Chennai has the best breakfast nutrient profile in the country. The study covered other metros like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata on a sample size of 3,600 subjects, split across 8 to 40 years age group, and described alarming figures of nutritional inadequacy in our country.Heres why we agree with Bollywood actor:* The rice and urad dal in idlis complement each other making it a complete protein.Advertising* Traditional sambar preparations have veggies like drumsticks, pumpkin, brinjal, okra, tomatoes and various other fibre-rich seasonal vegetables that are rich in fibre and anti-oxidant. The goodness of vegetables in sambar makes it a good supplement and helps in digestion of the lentils.* Curry leaves, tamarind extract, turmeric powder, red pepper and mustard seeds have a number of health benefits, ranging from good digestion, weight loss and high immunity, hair growth among others.* A pre-clinical study published in Pharmacognosy Magazine, Sambar, an Indian Dish Prevents the Development of Dimethyl HydrazineInduced Colon Cancer said that consumption of sambar significantly reduced aberrant crypt foci in DMH-induced colon cancer model. Sambar may prevent the risk of CC when consumed in dietary proportions. It comprises a variety of spices that exhibited both pro- and antioxidant properties in different tissues, leading to its overall beneficial effect in this model.Heres how you can make an authentic sambar.Ingredients3-4  Bite-sized pieces of cut drumstick, yellow pumpkin and brinjal2 cups  Tamarind juice, extracted from a small lemon-sized ball of tamarind100g  Toor dal, pressure cooked until the dal is soft1 tsp  Sesame oil1/4 tsp  Turmeric powderSalt  To tasteFor seasoning1/2 tsp  Mustard seeds1/2 tsp  Fenugreek seeds2  Red chillies1  Green chilliTo garnish5 sprigs  Curry leaves and coriander leavesFor the sambar masala2 tsp  Sesame oil2 tbsp  Coriander seeds1 tbsp  Bengal gram1 tsp  Black gram6  Dried red chillies1/4 tsp  Fenugreek seeds1 tbsp  grated coconutMethod* To make the sambar masala, heat a pan with 2 tsp of oil.* Fry the coriander seeds, Bengal gram, black gram, red chillies and fengugreek seeds until golden brown.* Finally, add the grated coconut and fry for a while.* Cool the mixture and grind to a powder.* Boil the vegetables in tamarind juice with turmeric powder and salt.* Add some water if necessary.

But have you ever wondered if it can be used in an alcoholic drink?In addition to taking the Western path, pubs and restaurants in Bengaluru are experimenting with cocktails and how they can become a satisfying drink by adding turmeric to them. When Thejus Anand, chief mixologist, Hoot, asked me to try out a turmeric-based cocktail  Curcuma Highball  I was curious to try it out. I liked it and so did my friends. The idea of infusing turmeric in a cocktail is quite interesting, says Smitha Rao, who is a regular at Hoot, Sarjapur.Keeping turmeric intact, mixologists have given a lot of thought in choosing the accompanying ingredients and other liquor and naming the drink accordingly. Some of them use gin, honey, mint, cointreau, tamarind, lemongrass, whiskey, topped with coriander leaves. Currently, we serve Spice-Wise consisting of gin, honey, tamarind, turmeric, lemongrass and coriander leaves. However, mixologists around the world have also come up with cocktails like The Oxford Comma (tequila, ginger, bonal, turmeric, lime), The Alisha Budkie (gin, turmeric, elderflower, lime, raw egg) and The Golden Shrub (vodka, Aperol, Cocchi Americano and homemade mango turmeric shrub), says Victor Salter, mixologist, general manager, Three Dots and a Dash, Indiranagar.JW Marriott Hotel Bengaluru uses two types of turmeric Amalapuram and Armour  in preparing the unique cocktail. Turmeric cocktails are the latest in a series of healthy-ish drinks that capture the attention of drinkers. The spice is famous for its detoxifying and immunity-boosting abilities. The vibrant yellow cocktail, appropriately referred to as liquid sunshine, gives a glowing effect to the drink, says Ashish Bisht, director of events, JW Marriott Hotel Bengaluru, adding that guests talk about the detoxifying nature of the drink which gives them a refreshing and healthy taste.Turmeric is an exceptional ingredient to be infused in a cocktail. The complex flavour of turmeric can boost the taste of any drink, agrees Abhishek Kapoor, director of F&B, Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield Hotel and Convention Center.I love to try new cocktails and when I was introduced to Pentagon by Reservoire, Koramangala, I fell in love with this drink. The use of turmeric in Pentagon has been cleverly done, says Himani Shah, a regular guest at the place.HIGH Ultra Lounge and World Cafe by Sheraton Grand Bangalore Hotel at Brigade Gateway introduced three turmeric-infused cocktails drink at the beginning of September. Eternity is a gin-based cocktail, which has other elements like Mandarin Orange, ginger, turmeric powder, citrus juice and sugar; Yelloyish is a vodka-based drink with turmeric powder, raspberry syrup, fresh lime and egg white; while Turmerised includes white rum, turmeric powder, Elderflower syrup, cucumber and fresh lime.Because of the emerging trend of eating clean and leading a healthy life, most of our customers prefer drinks which are not too heavy and adding an element like turmeric brings in a healthy balance even though alcohol is the base. Their favourite is Turmerised. Adding Elderflower and turmeric makes this drink really exotic, Prashant Nandi, assistant food and beverage manager, HIGH Ultra Lounge and World Cafe, says.Rasam Iced Tea is an interesting cocktail introduced by MishMash, HSR, where the all-time-favourite rasam is mixed with dark rum, turmeric, tomato juice and Tobasco sauce, giving out a unique blend of flavours to get high.While many places started experimenting with turmeric in June, most of them are yet to come up with the trend and put it on their regular menu. The mixologist prepares it on request from the guests. The spices herbal qualities can add unique depth and exotic flavour to cocktails, which people seem to enjoy, says Richard Khailunlal Kipgen, mixologist, The Den, Whitefield. The newly-opened RumBah will be introducing turmeric-infused drinks this fall."

He watches out for me but never overrides my decision. As a result, Ive become independent-minded, says the student of Shriram Moulsari Gurgaon.While chatting with them on Daughters Day (rather interrupting their little celebration at Prankster), we saw her trying to solve a technical glitch on his phone. She then looked up and sighed. He does his best to keep up with technology for my sake but it takes some effort for him to wrap his head around it. Minutes later, Inderjeet surprises her with a pair of AirPods. Oh wow! she cries out, repeating many thank you daddas thereafter.Its fun being out with him. Hes funny and caring, and of course, always pays the bill, says Samaira, giggling. Only thing that annoys her about him  his lectures. He is super intelligent, but he needs to chill, she says, to which Inderjeet responds, I promise to chill but she must share her feelings when she is upset or annoyed. I worry when she doesnt.All Shirin asks for is my time and every year on this day, I switch off from work and the phone, to be with her. Last year she took me to Jim Corbett, and it was one of the most satisfying trips Ive taken. This year, we watched a movie and had dinner, says Vikrant, founder, Caf Delhi Heights, and Nueva.The two are quite inseparable, noticeable when we met them for coffee. Everything she said got validated by him, and vice versa. My father and I do a lot of things together. We are both dessert lovers and we often share big plates of calorie-laden desserts. We go buying cheese and chocolates together. We also love stationery shopping, says Shirin, 17, who studies at DPS RK Puram.Rahul, Anisha KumarVikrant and Shirin BatraIn what looked like a river of ripe red tomatoes, Rahul Kumar, founder and director of Red Mango, India, and his daughter Anisha Kumar, 18, laid fatigued, gasping for air. They had been pulling and tugging at each other while splattering tomatoes for what seemed like an eternity at the annual La Tomatina Festival in Spain on August 28. A tad in advance, but this was the best Daughters Day gift. He is the coolest person I know. Always determined to match up to my energy so that I get to do what I want, says Anisha.With this, they struck off another wish from their bucket list. Few days ago, they also learnt scuba diving together.Daughters Day, however, was quiet as Anisha is away studying at IE University, Madrid, pursuing a dual degree in law and business. But they still found a way to celebrate. We set a time up and spoke over the phone till both of us dropped asleep, says Rahul, slightly teary on recalling the episode. I wish she was here. The way she cuddles... After she crossed her teenage years, she became more like a mother than a daughter, so I crave her presence but I am thankful that we could take this three-week road trip across Spain. It brought us even closer as we saw each other strengths and vulnerabilities and accepted them gracefully, says Rahul.ALSO READ | LOpera, Burma Burma and Cafe Delhi Heights: These mothers made their sons dream a reality"

With screen-time becoming so essential to our personal and professional lives, taking good care of your eyes is equally important. Two dietitians suggest some nutritious food for your eyes.* VitaminsFoods rich in vitamins can help eyes fight problems, says dietitian Deepti G. Dua, who is the co- founder of Mutation Diet Clinic. Our eyes require Vitamins A, C and E rich food. Citrus rich food, such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons and tangerines contain free radical-fighting antioxidants, which can keep our eyes healthy. Non-citric food like strawberries, peppers, peaches are also vitamin sources, she explains.Researches show that eyes need high amount of Vitamin C to function well and can prevent or delay eye-related troubles like cataract, says Harshita Dilawri, a nutritionist at Know Your Nutrients.* Leafy vegetablesEggs and veggies like spinach, kale, turnip green, brocolli, peas are good sources of Lutein and zeaxanthin, two nutrients key to lower the risk of AMD (age related macular degeneration) and healthy eyes.* Omega-3 rich foodCold water fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines are rich in good fats like Omega-3 and very good for dry eyes and macular degeneration. These are also rich in Vitamin D, which is equally good for healthy eyes. If you are not a fish eater or if you are vegan, walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds are rich in omega 3 fatty acids and thus good for protecting eyes.* Legumes and BeansMany beans and legumes are rich in zinc, which is a very important mineral found in high concentration in eyes. Zinc is found in mostly all beans, including lima, black eyed beans and kidney beans along with lean meats, poultry and fortified cereals.Tip: Good breakfast combinations might be whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk, eggs and toast with jam, porridge, oatmeal, or muesli. Drinking water can also be beneficial for your eyes in many ways. Nutrient rich food such as garlic, tomatoes and soy milk, depending on their amount of intake, too could be a major add on to your eyes' health."

As a child, she loved accompanying her mother and two siblings on Sundays, which helped her discover her hobby.Baliga dedicates two to three hours for gardening every day. A few years ago, when I was working as a freelance corporate trainer, I had 60 pots to maintain. I was staying in an apartment and had space constraint. Now that we are staying in a villa community, we have a garden to maintain, she said, adding, I have a vegetable terrace garden that yields brinjal, ladies finger, tomato, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber, French beans, yard beans, capsicum, chilly, radish, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, beet, local spinach and all kinds of greens, including lettuce, she said.Savitha believes in preserving organic food at every level of gardening. I prefer everything organic as the taste of vegetables turns out to be different from the ones sold in the market. Use of organic manure and pesticides gives a safe aura to food and health. Generally, I compost kitchen waste generated from home. Sometimes, its not sufficient for overall use so I have to purchase the organic manure. Neem oil and sour buttermilk works wonders as pesticides for a few plants. Spray made up of garlic, chilli, vinegar, turmeric can be used to ward off fungi from plants. Green tea leaves can also be boiled and used as a pesticide, she explained.Baliga had a green thumb since childhood. Gardening is a great exercise which gives you inner peace. The more you communicate with plants, the more they respond fruitfully, she said.Sharing is caringThe abundant produce of fruits and vegetables is not only consumed by Baligas family but also distributed to neighbours, relatives, domestic help, and whoever visits her. Its satisfying to see that what we grow is not wasted. Sometimes, the yield is in abundance and we cannot consume it all. Coriander leaves and lettuce are taken almost every day by neighbours, said Baliga."

Wooden board panelling and warm fairy lights combined with the toasty scent of freshly baked bread check off all the right boxes in the first impressions department. A basket on the counter displays a variety of breads  garlic, basil, oats and flax seed loaves sit in between orange and chocolate-swirl buns, and I learn that they are batches made to order. After I sufficiently graze the plump loaves in the basket and the menu with my eyes, I zero in on the focaccia and the bao.The focaccia arrives as a six-inch sandwich, with a filling of sliced cucumber and cherry tomatoes in a generous drizzle of pesto sauce and cheese. The first bite into it is a gentle rush of flavours, and the sumptuously hydrated bread has me going in for the next bite within seconds. At odds with its hard appearance, the texture of the focaccia is so easy that I make record time devouring a sandwich. The bread clearly plays lead singer while the pesto quietly takes on the role of supporting chorus, striking the right balance.Two compact baos on a plate come out next. Off-white and mustard coloured pockets, with a smattering of green, they present a pretty sight. The bread is supple, but the Sichuan sauce in the filling blatantly overpowers the cabbage, spring onion and Sichuan mayonnaise. Where the focaccia stands out in its fresh and authentic flavour, the bao fails to hold ground.Determined to mask the lingering Sichuan flavour from the bao experiment, I opt for the vada pav and the pita. A palm-sized pocket, the falafel in the pita is a tad dry and could definitely do better with a bigger dollop of hummus. It leaves me wanting more, after just a cursory encounter with my taste buds.The Bread Bar Swaad Nation, 13, Barnaby Road, KilpaukHits: Focaccia and bread boxFocaccia and bread box Misses: Bao and pitaBao and pita meal for two: 240240 9884692997I am glad I saved the vada pav for the end. The garlic chutney with the slightly crunchy vada creates a burst of flavours that few vada pavs on the East coast manage to do. With three pieces to a plate, this vada pav is best relished with company, unless you plan to make a meal of it. And if you are part of a group that cannot agree, the chefs platter (an array of all their breads) on the weekend menu is the ideal pick.Manisha Khumbat, one of the proprietors and the chef here, recommends the bread box before I leave. Though I am stuffed, the sight of warm gooey cheese coaxes me into one final indulgence. The bread box is a cheese fondue with croutons in a carved-out loaf of wheat bread. As I slowly polish off the cheese, the bread crumbles into it, making the dish a fulfilling experience in itself. Before I roll out of the doors, I make a mental note to nip in again for the cheese fondue."

Its now selling those burgers nationwide because of strong demand from customers.The entry of McDonalds, the worlds largest burger chain, into the alternative meat arena has largely been seen as a question of when, and not if. Shares of Beyond Meat Inc. bolted 11% higher at the opening bell on the McDonalds announcement.Its been a breakthrough year for the companies that are trying to perfect the no-meat burger.Beyond Meat became a publicly traded company in May when it listed its shares for $45 on the Nadaq. By July, those shares had risen more than 430%. Impossible Foods has raised more than $750 million, but remains private.Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are now appearing on fast food menus across the United States.KFC last month began testing plant-based chicken nuggets and boneless wings at an Atlanta restaurant in partnership with Beyond Meat. Carls Jr. and Del Taco also selling Beyond Meat products. Tim Hortons has tested a Beyond Meat breakfast sausage in Canada.Impossible Foods announced in May that it was making meatless sausage crumbles for the Little Caesars pizza chain in some states.Fans of Wendys have begun a petition to get the chain to add a plant-based burger to the menu. Its garnered more than 26,000 signatures as of Thursday and earlier this month, CEO Todd Penegor said plant-based burgers are a trend that will be here to stay.McDonalds is pushing forward, albeit in a very limited introduction.Why just a small test? Were in learning mode, so testing is a major part of how we develop our menu, wrote Ann Wahlgren, McDonalds vice president of global menu strategy. Its how we look- before we leap."

Since the past few weeks, tomato prices have seen a surge of around 70 per cent in Delhi. People are facing a hard time in the festive season due to the price hike.The prices of vegetables in Maharashtra, Karnataka and the northern regions have been shooting up due to various factors including heavy rain.While the prices of onions almost doubled in comparison to the rates at the same time last year, tomatoes had, so far, stayed more or less unaffected.Tomatoes in Delhi-NCR have started selling for Rs 40-Rs 60 in retail since the last few days and prices are expected to increase further in the coming days.Noida resident Manju Singh said that due to the huge increase in the prices of onions and tomatoes, the kitchen budget has gone haywire. The modal price of tomatoes in Delhi was Rs 30 per kg but has now jumped to Rs 40-Rs 60 per kg.Not only in Delhi, but tomato prices have also increased drastically across the country. According to the website of the Central Consumer Affairs Department, onion price in Chandigarh was Rs 52 per kg on Wednesday.On Thursday, a 25 kg sack of good variety tomatoes was sold at an average price above Rs 800 in Delhi's wholesale market Azadpur Mandi.

As the only restaurant exclusively serving Italian-American cuisine, once you are inside the cosy and comfortable eatery, you just cant wait to taste the food.The hands-on owner-cum-chef of the 48-seater bistro, Philip Abraham, has tweaked his menu with some freak-out dishes to celebrate his seven-year success story. And it is delicious news for his loyal customers and a delectable surprise for his new ones.Tables are fast getting booked, he smiles bringing me the carrot and cumin soup  a puree of roasted carrot flavoured with cumin and finished with cream. With rains and nip in the air, the steaming bowl of creamy soup warms me up instantly.With food plating and presentation increasingly becoming central to keep guests happy, Philip too showcases his creations to demonstrate to his guests that they are getting their moneys worth. The sweetest of watermelon chunks placed with long thin slices of cucumber rolled up and tossed in citrus (orange) glazed dressing drizzle with cute little homemade cottage cheese balls is a fine visual and edible masterpiece of a salad.What arrives next is a surprise! Who puts fried aubergine and even deeper fried palm-sized basil leaves on your pizza? Philip does to deepen your allegiance with the Ratatouille pizza and further tops it with zucchini and bell peppers. The perfectly crusted pie layered with melted mozarella disappears in the mouth as does the delicate crispy fried folded pizza with minced meat and cheese called the chicken calzone.The tomato risotto with vegetables is perfectly prepared Italian rice cooked in broth to a creamy consistency with tomato and a liberal dose of diced seasonal vegetables. With a feeble promise to myself that I will start exercising from day next, I say yes to the chicken and cream cheese ravioli (pasta stuffed with chicken, cream cheese and tossed in cream and basil sauce) that looks appetising in a lovely shade of green. And oh, the other new dish  fish francaise, fillet fish coated with egg and pan-fried and served with lemon butter sauce, grilled vegetables and mash potatoes. The flavours in all the items are well balanced for the perfect bite. And each deserves some time on the plate to relish it to satisfaction.Ever since he set shop in K K Nagar in 2012, Philip has rarely let you down. He says he does not believe in fusion but likes to experiment with everything that is fresh. His desserts are usually the best to wrap-up the culinary journey. He recommends the eggless banoffee pie (tart filled with toffee, glazed banana and topped with cream) and berry cheese cake which is cookie-based topped with a mixture of cream cheese, strawberry and blue berry. I regret neither.As part of the celebrations, there is a 15 per cent discount on your food bill till September 28."

Boman Kohinoor, the man behind Britannia & Co passed away. And for a mere restaurateur, an unprecedented amount of ink was poured in tribute. Which in itself goes to show that Kohinoor, wasnt mere at all. He was part of the fabric of Mumbai that is now slowly being frayed and is turning threadbare. In him, we have lost one of the few remaining symbols of a city that represented another more gentle and upright age.I must have first visited Britannia when I was a kid. In those days, driving to the heritage precincts of Ballard Estate was no great thing. We did not give even a second glance to those grand buildings of this European-style business district designed in the Indo Saracenic style. We just drove past the Mint and took a left at the tall Port Trust World War I memorial and hopped off right outside Britannia. The streets were thinly populated, hardly anyone owned cars and finding parking wasnt even a glimmer of a problem.In those days, the signboard above the restaurant read Britannia & Co High Class Restaurant. On the sides of the worn tin signage were two advertisements for Dukes Mangola and Lemonade. Remnants of crystal chandeliers with tiny golden globe lights, high ceilings and arched doorways hinted at a time when Britannia was indeed a high-class restaurant. It catered only to British Officers and served only European food. Like many prime properties in Mumbai at the time, Britannia too was acquired by the army to house soldiers during World War II. When the war was over, Britannia was handed back to the owners, but all the officers and Europeans had gone and the ground floor of Neville House, on Currimbhoy Road was never the same. But the Iranis and the Kohinoor brothers were not going to take things lying down.Come Independence, the restaurant was back with nationalistic vigour, with a spicy mainly Parsi menu and dishes based on recipes from the Kohinoor home.We were young, and Boman Kohinoor by that logic was a much younger man. When we all trooped into the restaurant as children, running around deciding on which table to grab, the bright green checkered table linen beckoning us, a large red rooster with a black plumed tail, and a ruddy Kohinoor who both sat majestically, one on top of and the other behind the cash counter greeted us. If he ever spotted you struggle with the large menu cards tucked under the glass that covered the tables, he would spring into action to help.The usual order was the Mutton Berry Pulao. That was the single most important dish at Britannia. The Britannia Berry Pulao comes closest to the Irani Zereshk Polow as it can to a Persian dish. Zereshk Polow is a simple steamed rice dish flavoured with saffron, sprinkled with sour barberries (berry) and served with chello kabab, kibbeh or chunks of meat. Some Persian homes cook the meat and rice together and then finish it off with saffron and the berries. Britannia, added fried onions and tomatoes, Parsi spices, potato and served it as a robust pulao. It came flavoured with Parsi garam masala, saffron and sprinkled with nuts and berries imported from Iran.Kohinoor would come to the table, greet you, the bottles of Raspberry would appear as hed explain the menu, snap at a waiter, order your choice and then regale you with his sentiments about British RoyaltyWe would sit under those creaky fans hanging a mile above our heads and sweat with joy eating Berry Pulao with Britannias dark, thick, loaded masala dhansak dal, like it was our last meal. (Their dhansak which nobody ever talks about, is also incredible) Of course it wasnt our last meal. Along with the pulao, there was always an order of Britannias eminent Sali Kheema (mutton) that we wiped back with soft large rotlis, and deep fried lacy mutton cutlets  soft mince spicy patty dipped in crumbs and egg and fried. During the right season, they served fried bombils and Patra ni Macchi as specials but I never ventured there.Kohinoor would come to the table, greet you, the bottles of Raspberry would appear as hed explain the menu, snap at a waiter, order your choice and then regale you with his sentiments about British Royalty. Hed insist you try the queen of desserts, the caramel custard. Originally a classic French dessert, called Crme Caramel, its been completely claimed by Irani cafs and Parsi housewives. Chilled wobbly custard with sweet and bitter burnt caramel on top. In the old days youd get jelly too. But I cannot fathom when such a quintessential Irani place added Bengali mishti doi to its menu, which Id always prefer over the custard, much to Kohinoors vexation.Mind you, though the walls were unpainted and the plaster was peeling, the meal wasnt cheap. It did set you back a bit. But then, whats a few extra rupees for a trip to another time, place and dimension. A few years ago the rooster left his roost and now hangs on the wall as a photo in frame. Sadly the next time we go there, so will Boman Kohinoor. My only prayer is that while he will be sorely missed by his many patrons, may his legacy live on for a long time in Britannias Mutton Berry Pulao.First Published: Sep 27, 2019 21:46 IST"

The green initiative was launched about a month ago, and the terrace has many varieties of vegetables growing in about 40 bags.The terrace garden was set up on Ripon Buildings instructions to raise terrace gardens at its ward offices across the city. Terrace gardens have been set up at the offices in wards 110, 114 and 116 and more ward units will join the initiative, says Guhan, Assistant Engineer of ward 119.The terrace garden has beans, tomato, snake gourd, pumpkins and creepers have been planted. A green shade net protects the plants from the sun.The compost for the plants comes from the composting units of the Corporation and workers at the ward office water and maintain the saplings, adds Guhan.Apartment goes greenTaking small but steady steps towards sustainability are residents of Kaushik Apartments at Seethammal Colony in Alwarpet, who have started a terrace garden.Started about two months ago, the vegetables and greens in the 20-odd grow bags are flourishing.We are growing tomatoes ladies fingers, ginger, pumpkin, beans, chillies, brinjal, coriander, etc., We plan to add more plants and hope to harvest enough for the four families of our apartment complex, says Suresh Krishnaswamy, a resident.The terrace garden was set up after the residents started composting the wet waste within the premises. The compost is used for the mini garden on the ground floor and the terrace garden. We have employed a gardener who will maintain the plants, says D. Rajagopal, another resident."
2019-10-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tomato-vies-with-onion-on-price/article29560813.ece,"After onions, tomato gets dearer","For the first time in the history of Madanapalle tomato market in Chittoor district, considered Asias largest, the tomato prices skyrocketed in the the last three days, posting a phenomenal jump from 22 a kg last week to 48 a kg for the first grade variety on Sunday. The second grade stood at 28 a kg as against 13 last week. On an average, the daily arrival of stocks is reported at 300 to 360 tonnes.Coming to the retail and vegetable markets, the tomato prices have come to unnerve the consumers, selling at 60 a kg for the first variety, 25 for the second grade and 20 for the scrap variety. Consumers, who are already burdened with onions selling at 60 a kg, are a worried lot with the sudden increase in tomato prices.Advantage farmersFormer chairman of Madanapalle agriculture market and expert in tomato trading, Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu told The Hindu that for the first time, farmers of Madanapalle division were reaping the benefits from their fields in September.The tomato belt from Madanapalle towards Palamaner and Punganur, Royalpadu and Kandlamadugu received scanty rainfall this season. This has proved to be a boon to farmers. The other regions of the division like Vayalpadu, Piler and Bhakarapeta received heavy rain, damaging standing crops, which in turn resulted in slump in arrivals at the market. The farmers in a radius of 20 km from Madanapalle are a happy lot with sudden spurt in prices, Mr. Naidu said.The traders at Madanapalle observed that the first variety of tomato could find good takers in cities of Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad owing to poor production elsewhere in Karnataka, Telangana and other southern States, coupled with copious rains there.ConsumptionIt is observed that generally, the consumption of tomato in households would plummet from September onwards.However, the dry weather which still continues has become an advantage to farmers. With the start of Purattasi month, the consumption vegetables has touched its peak in Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka, and this is becoming a plus point to tomato growers.Subramanyam, a farmer at Punganur, said the present boom might continue till October-end. The present climatic conditions are good enough to reap rich harvest for the next few weeks. The prospect of future crops from January next year would naturally depend on the groundwater table, he said."

Growing up in an orphanage in old Delhis Daryaganj, the highlight of Kumars day were the hours he spent in classroom and the competitions about the Father of the Nation that he would participate in: cultural programmes; on Gandhis favourite bhajans; essays on his legacy.At 14, he was part of a group of students that toured the country in a recreation of Gandhis 1915 Bharat Darshan. It was then I knew that I wanted to spread Gandhis message, and I was good at it, he said.Kumar, 32, now works at Gandhi Smriti, housed in the Birla House in New Delhi, where he spends his day explaining Gandhis writing and life to foreign guests and delegates  except on Mondays, when the memorial is closed and he plays cricket with his son, named after his favourite cricketer, Virat Kohli.Kumar, one of 34 guides in the facility, credits Gandhian principles for keeping him on the straight and narrow after he graduated from high school in 2007. I had some friends with drinking and gambling habits. But I tore myself away. I thank Gandhis principles for that, he said.Many visitors to the museum have a vague idea of what Gandhi stood for, and ask Kumar about the Partition. The young man informs them of Gandhis staunch opposition. I tell them how strongly he was against it, Kumar said.I love that Gandhi committed mistakes and learnt from them without hiding them. In my life, I have seen that transformation is possible, he said. I am lucky to work at the same house in which Gandhi stayed.Spot of tranquillityTucked away in a leafy corner of central Delhi, Gandhi Smriti is a 10 minute-drive from the bustling Connaught Place, but is a tranquil world unto itself. The sprawling campus comprises a gleaming white mansion, where the ground floor houses the National Gandhi Museum replete with photographs, books, accounts of the 144 days the Mahatma spent here between September 9, 1947, and January 30, 1948.The 12-bedroom house was built by noted industrialist, Ghanshyam Das Birla in 1928 and played host to many freedom fighters. Gandhi first arrived here on March 15, 1939, for meetings with the then governor general, Lord Linlithgow. The house was close to the political heart of Delhi and was ideal for consultations and discussions with government officials and politicians, said A Annamalai, director of the museum.My main object in staying in Delhi, is to give to the Muslims whatever comfort I can, that object was served better by my staying at Birla House, Gandhi wrote on December 9, 1947 in the wake of the post-Partition riots.History is entwined with Birla House, right from the gate atop which Jawaharlal Nehru announced Gandhis demise in 1948, immortalised in a picture made by French photographer Henri Cartier Bresson.A large statue of Gandhi, sculpted by Ram V Sutar, with a boy and girl holding doves welcomes the visitor. A few steps inside, and you reach the spartan room that Gandhi stayed in, preserved as it was on his last day, with his glasses, staff, knife, fork and spoon, white mattress and low, wooden writing desk, untouched. Whenever you visit Gandhi Smriti, it emotionally affects you because this is where he laid down his life, added Annamalai.As the tourist walks through the high-ceilinged rooms, the voice of Kumar Gandharva wafts by, as part of a presentation of Gandhis life playing in the central rotunda. A Martyrs Column stands at the spot where Gandhi was assassinated, and a stone pavement is laid around it for circumambulation.The first floor houses the Eternal Gandhi Museum, launched in 2005, a multimedia initiative comprising physical interfaces and digital technology, such as a pillar that lights up when visitors hold hands and surround it, symbolising the end of caste prejudice. We wanted to bring Gandhi to the younger generation through this one of its kind museum, said Susmita Bharali, project manager.Every year on October 2, children pay tribute to Gandhi through bhajans and an interfaith prayer, attended by the prime minister and president. This year on October 2, Gandhi Smriti has organised two special events: one, where children from 19 Indian schools will make solar lights and switch it on together, and the second, in association with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a display of holographic images of Gandhi. Pandit Ajay Chakrabarty will lead the bhajans. The biggest legacy of Gandhi Smriti is that you can feel Gandhis presence, said Dipankar Shri Gyan, director of the Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti, an autonomous body under the ministry of culture.The government took over Birla House in early 1971 and it was thrown open to the public on August 15, 1973. The following year, Vishnu Prasad joined the staff, and over the next five decades, saw the facility blossom in size and reach. A watchman now, he notes that the number of foreign visitors has swelled, that of Indian tourists has thinned, the facility has become disabled friendly and the lighting has improved. I feel like Birla House is my home, he said.The final dayOn January 30, 1948, Gandhi rose from sleep at 3.30am. He brushed his teeth with a neem twig, prayed, and continued work on the draft constitution for the Congress. It was still dark outside and cold, so Manu, one of his two attendants, covered his legs with a blanket.His first appointment was at 7am. After his bath at around 8am, Manu weighed him; he had gained 2.5 pounds since ending his fast, kept to forge communal amity. His strength is returning, thought his secretary, Pyarelal.At 9.30am, he took his morning meal: 12 ounces of goats milk and cooked and raw vegetables, oranges, four tomatoes, carrot juice and decoction of ginger, sour lemons and aloe. After a nap at midday, Gandhi saw visitors and told an associate to fetch letters written to him. I must reply to them today, for tomorrow I may or may not be alive, he added.After some more meetings, Gandhi lay down in the afternoon January sun and had his abdominal mud pack. For shade, he wore a bamboo hat from Noakhali. Manu and Abha, his other attendant, pressed his feet.Interviews began at 2.15pm. In the audience was a representative from Ceylon accompanied by his daughter, who asked for Gandhis autograph  his last.At 4pm, Patel arrived and the two immediately fell into deep conversation. Gandhi Smriti records show that Gandhi was concerned about reports of a rift between Patel and Nehru, and said both were indispensable for Indias future.At 4.30pm, Abha brought in what was to be his last meal: goats milk, cooked and raw vegetables, oranges and a concoction of ginger, sour lemons and butter with juice of aloe. Sitting on the floor, Gandhi ate and talked to Patel.People had already started gathering in the terrace of Birla House for the evening prayer meeting. That day, Gandhi was late. It was past 5pm when he got up, put on his chappals and instead of his usual route, stepped through a side door into the garden path and made his way across the lawn.A hush fell over the hundreds-strong crowd as Gandhi approached. At the top of the steps, he brought his palms together in greeting and people parted to make a passage for him. Through the party, Nathuram Godse saw Gandhi coming straight at him. He elbowed his way to the front and approached Gandhi with his palms joined, bowed low and said Namaste Gandhiji. Gandhi nodded and joined his palms in acknowledgement.A moment later, there were three quick bursts of noise. Gandhi slowly crumpled to the ground. His face was pale, his white shawl crimson with blood, his palms joined together. It was 5.17pm. Gandhi was dead.First Published: Oct 02, 2019 03:05 IST"

Phone camera at the ready, one cannot help but try their best to capture the postcard scenery as it zips past; but no technology can exactly reproduce the Swiss landscape peppered with little villages.For about seven minutes, though, passengers will find themselves heading at full throttle through a dark tunnel which is not unlike a portal; when the train emerges out of the other end, it is a whole new world with Mediterranean weather, clear skies, greenery dotted with daisies and the prettiest cows.Switzerland has a one-of-a-kind draw and one of the biggest questions tourists often have when visiting  whether it is the first visit or the fourth  is around the cultural identity of Swiss people. Ask this, and you will get a fairly standard response: the Swiss fingerprint comprises four cultural veins: German, French, Italian, and Romansch. This is the result of a tumultuous history with neighbouring nations, which led to the now-mosaical multi-religious and multi-lingual communities.The Italian-speaking region is worth a visit because of the extremely strong symbiosis between Italy and Switzerland, and its seeing a growing interest among Indian travellers, says Ritu Sharma, deputy director, Switzerland Tourism. The proximity of the Ticino region to Italy will, in fact, have your roaming going haywire.One for all Visiting Switzerlands iconic hotspots and accessing the streamlined public transport lines are the best way to make the most of the nifty Swiss Travel Pass. The cost for which ranges from CHF 232 (for Second Class three days validity) to CHF 810 (for First Class 15-day validity). The SBB Mobile app is useful for digitally storing your Travel Pass, too, if youre not down to carrying one more thing in your surely-full backpack.One of the experts of the Ticino district is Anna Bezzola of experience and tour company Alps And Beyond. The academic and tour-pro resides in Bellinzona, which lies east of the sparkling Ticino river. Bellinzona is one of the must-visit settlements in Ticino, she recommends, largely because its so rich in history and it often makes you look at Switzerland in a different light. This place is steadily growing in tourism popularity but also promotes a stronger conversation around the heritage preservation.Of course, the restaurants in the surrounding area are more reflective of long-existing Italian inclinations. Aside from pizzas and pastas, we are talking plates of fresh tomatoes and thick slices of dripping mozzarella with beef carpaccio and peppery rocket. To cool off the Ticino way, guzzle down the well-known Coldesina, a local, iconic soda dating back to the 1880s.But to truly comprehend and appreciate the history of Switzerland, look not just at people or culture, but also at its stone and biodiversity.Through battle historyThe three Neolithic Period castles in Bellinzona  Castelgrande, Montebello, and Sasso Corbaro  and their encompassing walls, which stand at overwhelming heights, were all declared by UNESCO as a single World Heritage Site in 2000, and rightfully so. Just a glance at these fortifications will have you searching for your armour and sword, as if you have taken a time machine into the past. Look closely at the walls and you will see distinct lines where new layers of stone were added atop the old, as various rulers transitioned, making it almost impenetrable.There is a certain pull about Castelgrande and it intensifies as you proceed further into the depths of the dark bricks, the smell of aged parchment and rich wood emanating from within makes evidence of early human settlement clear.One for all Visiting Switzerlands iconic hotspots and accessing the streamlined public transport lines are the best way to make the most of the nifty Swiss Travel Pass.

Peacefully located in the centre is Isole di Brissago, comprising two green-brimmed islands: Isola Grande, the larger island which is open to visitors. The foot traffic here is controlled, a reminder to visitors that the botanical gardens tranquillity is priority. Then there is Isola di SantApollinare, the smaller island, which thrives in its natural, untouched state.It is not just the prettiness of the islands that keeps the visitor-filled ferry boats leisurely going back and forth  it is the back-story of how Isole di Brissago came to be, which dates as far back as 1885 when Baron Richard and Baroness Antoinette Fleming de St Leger bought the islands in their raw states, including the ruins of a monastery.Over the years, until 1897, Baroness Antoinette breathed life into the islands, creating havens for tropical and sub-tropical plants from all over the globe, from Mediterranean spurges to the heath-leaved banksia from Australia. Plus, one can spot a bale of endangered turtles at a pond at the base of the villas stairs, a hint at the ongoing fauna conservation on the island. However, in 1927, she had to sell the property due to wartime debts. German merchant Max Emden who was the next owner, developed the luxurious palatial estate which overlooks the lake.As of 1950, the islands officially belong to Canton Ticino, where resilient conversations around conservation, culture, science and tourism are held.Walk through the gardens and your phone battery and storage will take a hit, with you snapping picture after picture. The smells on the islands are also worth a meditative pause; they are an amalgam of fresh water, hundreds of species of blooming flowers, rich soils and the occasional dishes brought out to the al fresco dining area of the villa.The respect paid by visitors and backers towards Isole di Brissago is one for the books.(The writer was in Ticino, Switzerland at the invitation of Switzerland Tourism)"
2019-10-02,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/how-agri-mncs-are-pushing-their-products-6049610/,How agri MNCs are pushing their products,"At a time when government agriculture extension systems are crumbling, that gap is increasingly being filled by multinationals and corporates working directly with farmers, even while aggressively marketing their products.AdvertisingA good example would be Syngenta. The $ 13.5 billion Swiss agrochemical-cum-seed major, currently owned by the Chinese state-owned enterprise ChemChina, has designed crop-specific integrated solutions or protocols for paddy, maize/corn, cotton, chilli and tomato grown in India. These basically guide farmers on the application of its agrochemical products at various growth stages of a crop, right from sowing. Thus, there is a specific GroMore protocol for paddy, Fast Start for cotton, and MaxVeg for chilli and vegetables.Under MaxVeg, chilli growers are advised first to treat their seeds using Cruiser insecticide (the active ingredient molecule is thiamethoxam) for protection against root grub, termites and nematode pests. At 12.5 gram per acre, it costs about Rs 100. Once sowing happens, the seedlings, after around 12 days in the nursery, are drenched with 100 gm of Ridomil Gold (mefenoxam plus mancozeb), costing Rs 200/acre, to control root wilt fungus. This is followed, within 15-25 days after nursery sowing, by spraying of 40 ml Alika (thiamethoxam plus lambda cyhalothrin: Rs 125) and 15 ml Amistar (azoxystrobin: Rs 100) against a broad range of sucking insect pests (aphids, whitefly and jassids) and fungi, respectively.Before the chilli seedlings are transplanted 30 days after sowing, a fresh treatment of Cruiser (25 gm: Rs 200) is recommended. On the 15th day following transplantation, farmers are told to apply 150 gm of Actara (thiamethoxam: Rs 350/acre) along with 350 ml of Isabion (a bio-stimulant to enhance crop vigour and growth: Rs 350). On the 20th day, the same dose of Isabion (Rs 350) is given with 80 ml of Alika (Rs 250), with this combination repeated on the 40th day as well. In between are the applications of Folio Gold (a fungicide having mefenoxam and chlorothalonil active ingredients: 400 ml or Rs 500/acre on 30th day) and Pegasus (diafenthiuron active ingredient to control whitefly and mites: 250 gm or Rs 950/acre on 35th day). At this stage, the farmer would already have spent Rs 4,075 per acre.AdvertisingOnce flowering initiation takes place from the 45th day, the MaxVeg protocol requires application of 250 gm Splash (chlorothalonil: Rs 350/acre) and 100 ml Score (difenoconazole: Rs 200) fungicides mainly against anthracnose and leaf spot diseases. Then come a 200-ml dose of Amistar on the 50th day to prevent any flower drop (Rs 1,050/acre), 250 gm of Pegasus on the 60th day (Rs 950), 200 ml of Amistar Top (azoxystrobin plus difenoconazole: Rs 900) on the 75th day and the earlier Splash-Score combination on the 90th day (Rs 550). By this time, the fruits would have started turning red from green, after first appearing in 55-60 days.Simply put, the entire MaxVeg protocol would cost upwards of Rs 8,000 per acre. The farmer may additionally have to spray against sucking pests or chilli fruit borer on an as-needed basis. These out-of-protocol applications again cost money: Each 80-100 ml round of Syngentas Proclaim (emamectin benzoate) or Ampligo (chlorantraniliprole plus lambda cyhalothrin) insecticide entails an expenditure of Rs 700-900 per acre. And there could be up to three rounds, taking the total to Rs 11,000-plus per acre.The above application details only capture the level of engagement  how Syngenta is seeking to promote its crop protection products among farmers by developing protocols for usage at different growth stages. These integrated crop protection solutions are, moreover, crop-specific. We are probably the only company employing this approach, which goes beyond product-selling to providing crop-wise and situation-wise solutions. By using our protocols, farmers can expect to harvest significantly higher yields. Our interest is in building trust that will enable us to sell to them year after year, says J. Erik Fyrwald, chief executive officer of the Basel-headquartered Syngenta International AG.In 2018-19, Syngentas total sales in India was Rs 3,131 crore ($ 440 million), of which some 65% came from agrochemicals and the balance from seeds (mainly corn, tomato, capsicum, cauliflower, watermelon and other vegetables). India generates hardly 3% of our global revenues, which we would want to take to 10%. Thats fairly realistic for a country housing almost a fifth of the worlds population, Fyrwald tells The Indian Express.Syngenta has just set up an innovation and learning centre at Bhimadole in Andhra Pradeshs West Godavari district. The centre, spread over 38 acres, will act as a facility to test out the companys new seed and crop protection products, besides showcasing them to progressive farmers, channel partners and agriculture department officials.This centre will focus on paddy, corn, cotton, chilli and such crops grown in south India. The plan is to have three more centres in the countrys other regions, adds Rafael Del Rio, managing director, Syngenta India Ltd."

Here is what you should eat,"Mukta Patil ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: With the growing number of MNCs in the country, working night shifts have become a norm. This disruption of circadian cycle can affect our health in the long run.Effects of Night ShiftsCircadian Rhythm is our bodys natural clock which runs signals to the brain between the sleep - wake cycle.The reversal of sleep timings causes the body to lose its natural ability to heal with sleep.Reversing of sleep and work cycle will result in poor quality of sleep because the melatonin secretion which is required for sound sleep is maximum at night and nearly nil during the day.It affects the production of the hormone cortisol.How can you help yourself?Carry your own food. Optimum nutrition is the best support the body can receive.Meal Plan 1: Onion, cucumber, tomato salad, Palak Paneer/Methi chicken, rice/roti, Rajma or dal.Meal Plan 2: Chickpea salad, pumpkin and cream soup, pasta with veggies and chicken/paneer/tofu.Meal 3: Cucumber and curd raita, dosa made out of millets, Sambar and rice with roasted papad.Carry fruits, nuts and unsweetened protein bars to munch on.Cut out on late night sugar laden colas, sodas, fruit juices, teas and coffee.Staying fitKeep your water intake high. In an AC office, the bodys mechanism of signaling thirst comes down which reduces our water intake.Its best to avoid canteen food as there is no track of the hidden ingredients that go into making it, lTake a walk every half an hour, include a trip to the gym if possible.How to get better sleepFreshen up before hitting the bedMake sure that the room is pitch darkAvoid electronic gadgetsOn waking up, stretch well, include ten minutes of yoga or meditation.

When News18 visited Madhya Pradesh's Bhavkhedi village, where this incident took place, we found not just a family mourning the death of its children but grieving over a systematic, oppressive assertion of caste that had left them brutalised and helpless.News18 found that the deceased girl was forced to clean toilets in her school; that she was too scared to step out of her house for the fear of being molested by the same men who killed her later. We found the story of the deceased boy who saw his family suffer humiliation on a daily basis and who probably died trying to save the 12-year-old girl from the sexual predators that fateful morning.After speaking to the family of the victims, class fellows, school teachers, panchayat members, community leaders, policemen and villagers, News18 has put together this account of the last 24 hours of the children who were brutally murdered.Jyoti* (12) and Vivek* (10) wake up at 5:30 am. As part of their daily routine, they go out to defecate outside the farmland of Rameshwar and Hakam Yadav. They go there because there is no source of water or toilet in their home. The closest source of water with which they can wash themselves is a borewell installed outside the farmland of the Yadavs. Little do they know that 24 hours later, they will be killed at the same spot.Viveks mother has already relieved herself before dawn. While the children are out, she is boiling milk for Viveks younger siblings. Bablu*, who is Viveks father and Jyotis brother, is out to get neem twigs which theyll all use to brush their teeth with.""Do not get your daughter married, unless there is a toilet in the house,"" painted on the wall of a school in the village as a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). (Photo: Rounak Kumar Gunjan)For the past three years, their father wrote several letters to the village head, the Sarpanch, to get financial assistance to construct a toilet. The Swachh Bharat Mission provides Rs 12,000 to the rural poor for construction of toilets. Everybody received assistance from the Gram Panchayat. The Sarpanch keeps denying my pleas because I am a Valmiki, said Bablu.For more immersives like thissubscribe to our newsletter.8:00 am No HouseTea and biscuits are served for breakfast. Jyoti, while sipping her tea, is folding bed sheets that also double up as their mattresses. The kids are excited as soon as they are told that theyll be going to the house of Bablus father, Bhim, the next morning. Vivek is making plans about all the fun hell have at his grandfathers house. When will we leave, Vivek keeps asking his mother. Theyre going to Bhims home because its raining and they live in a mud house, which will soon get swamped. Bhim has a pucca house at the other end of the village. There, theyll stay dry. It is an annual ritual.I dont have a cemented house and water gets inside, Bablu told News18. The family lives in a 10 feet-by-6 feet mud house, substantially smaller than toilets in even modestly priced apartment in cities.Most villagers got their house constructed under Pradhan Mantri Indira Awas Yojana. The family again wrote several letters asking for financial assistance, but all in vain. As per the existing scheme, funding of Rs 70,000 is provided to the poor in plain areas.Bablu with his family outside their mud house in Bhavkhedi village, Madhya Pradesh. (Photo: Rounak Kumar Gunjan)I am the poorest in the village, but my application was never accepted. How am I supposed to believe that it is not because of caste bias? asked Bablu.Members of the Gram Panchayat denied allegations of discrimination. Why will we not want him to have a house? There were irregularities in his applications, said Shankar Yadav, one of the panchs. The Sarpanch belongs to the family of the accused. He had left the village after the Yadav brothers were arrested. The Sarpanch could not be contacted for this story.The village is dominated by the Yadav community. There are 30-40 Jatav households, who are also Dalits like Bablus family, but from a different sub-caste.9:00 am No SchoolVivek and Jyoti go out to play. They run around, pushing bicycle tyres with wooden sticks. They should be in school right now. But they had dropped out of school. Or rather, were forced out by their teachers who wouldn't let them forget for even a minute that the two young children were different from everyone else. That they came from the lowest caste and had to be treated accordingly.Their parents and classmates say that the teachers used to make Vivek and Jyoti sit away from the rest of the students. They were asked to get their own mats and utensils. They were not allowed to drink water from the common water dispenser.Jyoti had also complained to Bablu that the teachers had made her clean toilets several times.Meanwhile, Bablu is starting to feel anxious. He has not received any phone calls for work. He and his wife talk about running out of money, running out of rice. Being a Dalit means Bablu doesnt get to decide how he earns his living. He does whatever job comes his way.Prashant, the school headmaster denied the allegations. This is baseless. The school is a place to study. They dropped out because they were not interested in studying, he said.However, two 13-year-olds in the same school opened up about the incidents. One of Jyotis friends said, Jyoti could not eat in the utensils provided in school. She used to carry a plate with her.10:00 am No WaterVivek, his mother and Jyoti go out to fetch water. Vivek does not like going to the hand pump. He doesnt like to wait there for over an hour, looking at all the other villagers fetching water before it is their turn. Being a Valmiki means that they cant join the queue. They have to wait for the queue to end, for the last Yadav to get all the water they want before it is their turn. Being a Valmiki means that the pump they use has to be washed by upper caste women to purify it for others.Vivek tugs at his mother's saree and asks her to get water from someplace else. On festivals, it gets worse. Vivek and Jyoti walk back home with water in small steel pots. Bablu has received a call for work at a nearby farmland.We cannot even touch the hand pump during festivals. The other women pour water into our buckets from a height and then they wash their containers,"" said Viveks mother.11:00 am No WorkVivek accompanies Bablu for work. On the way, Vivek keeps narrating stories about his friends. Bablu generally does not take Vivek along for work because of the way the employers treat Bablu. He doesnt want his son to see what could be his future. It could break the little childs spirit.Bablu has no fixed job. He sometimes cleans toilets for Rs 20. He is an agricultural worker on some days and a construction worker on others. He also plays drums at weddings.The upper caste call him a Bhangi. When hes playing drums at a wedding, hes not allowed to walk with the wedding procession. He plays at a distance from the gathering. He is made to sit and eat where used plates are dumped.Jyoti stays back to help with cooking. But this afternoon, her sister-in-law asks her to cook less rice than she usually does. They are running out of rice.Vivek is too tired to eat by the time he and his father return for lunch. Rice and tomato puree is served while he sleeps on the floor, utterly exhausted.6:00 pm No FreedomJyoti is still at home. She is scared to step out of the house after sunset. Jyotis sister-in-law and Vivek are at the hand pump again for water. Bablu is at the local grocery store, bargaining for rice.Two months ago, one of the Yadav brothers had allegedly tried to sexually assault her. He had threatened to kill her if she told anybody about it.The spot where the two children lay dead outside a farm owned by Hakam and Rameshwar Yadav. (Photo: Rounak Kumar Gunjan)Jyotis elder sister said, Almost two months ago, she came home in the evening crying and told me that Hakam Yadav had tried to force himself on her.Jyotis sister-in-law and Bablus wife corroborated the incident and said that she didnt tell her husband about it due to fear of a fight.We are the only Valmiki family in the village. In case of a fight, nobody would have supported us. We really would have been killed, she said.6:30 am. September 25 The MurderVivek and Jyoti are outside the Yadav farm, defecating.Bablu is awake but theres no work to do, so hes just lying down in his house. He hears a loud cry from Jyoti. He thinks the kids are playing. But Jyotis scream is immediately followed by the scream of Vivek.He rushes out of the house. He sees his son running towards the farm. He could not see Jyoti.By the time he and the rest of the villagers reach the farmland, they find the kids dead.Jyoti's clothes are torn. The string of her pajamas is undone.***Life AfterRameshwar and Hakam Yadav, residents of the same village, were arrested on Bablus complaint under a case of murder and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.The FIR, however, does not mention molestation. Asked about the same, Bablu said, I had my childs dead body in my arms. My youngest sister was lying motionless in front of me. I was not in my senses to speak or explain the incident. I just told the police they were beaten to death by the two Yadav brothers.Local Police officers said there was no official complaint of molestation, but if the investigation reveals any such angle, they will take strict action and will include relevant sections under the Indian Penal Code.Family members preparing biers for the deceased children. (Photo: Ashok Aggarwal)Bablu and his younger brother go out looking for wood for the pyre. None of the families, not even Jatavs, help them. They head to the wild to gather wood themselves. After the last rites, Bablu begs the administration for a home outside the village. The administration promises him that arrangements will be made at district headquarters. It has been a week since the murder, but Bablu and his family are yet to find a safer place to stay.*All names except those of the accused have been changed to protect the identities of the victims and their familiesWith inputs from Ashok Aggarwal."

Prices of brinjal and green peas have increased from Rs40 per kg to Rs80 per kg.Jayesh Rana, a vegetable vendor at Bhagal vegetable market, said almost all major vegetable and fruit-growing regions in Maharashtra and neighbouring states were flooded due to heavy rain. Wholesale prices have spiked due to less supply. We have to adjust our profits and then sell the produce to end customers. Daily we are facing the ire of customers due to changing prices.Ramnarayan Mishra, another vegetable and fruit retailer in Palanpur Patia vegetable market, said, Prices of vegetable have been changing for the past one month. I have seen the price of most of the hot-picked vegetables like brinjal and cauliflower increasing by Rs10 to Rs40 per kg.Salim Shaikh, a fruit vendor in Adajan, said, Earlier, we would sell six bananas for Rs20. Now, we are selling four bananas for Rs20. Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) sources said there is reduction of almost 40% in transport trucks supplying vegetables and fruits from nearby districts and states. Most of the vegetables and fruits come from Maharashtra.Nilesh Thorat, secretary of APMC, said, Short supply of vegetables, including onion, is likely to continue till Diwali. Monsoon has ended and we hope fresh stock of vegetables to start arriving in the market in the next 20 days."

Apart from this, half the members of market committees will be women.The process of their appointment will be completed by the end of October. The State government has provided 50 per cent reservation to SC, ST, and OBCs in the market committees.The Chief Minister also decided to constitute a committee to look into the losses in district co-operative banks and undertake a study by a prestigious organisation on the ways of strengthening the banks.He instructed officials to digitize primary agriculture co-operative committees records and complete the task within a specified deadline.Jagan Mohan Reddy, during a review of marketing and cooperative departments, said, The cooperative banks should be able to decide the prices during cultivation of crops.On the issue of remunerative prices to lentils, pulses, tomato and cotton crops, he said that farmers should not be compelled to sell their produce to middlemen.Ensure that the middlemen system is eradicated completely, the Chief Minister instructed the officials.The government is also planning to announce prices of those crops that have no minimum support price (MSP). The prices will be notified at village secretariats and farmers can complain to agricultural assistants for necessary action if they fail to get MSP, Agriculture Minister K Kanna Babu told reporters after the meeting.Calling for the transformation of Rayalaseema region into a millet hub, the Chief Minister asked the officials concerned to set up a millet board by the end of October.The proposed board will take care of marketing and devise agricultural practices to be adopted by farmers for higher millet productivity in the region.Jagan Mohan Reddy enquired about onion stocks in the State in view of spiralling prices.Officials told the Chief Minister that till now 660 metric tonnes of onions have been imported from other States. This helped in bringing down the onion price to `32 per kg, they said.The Chief Minister also told the officials to help tomato farmers get remunerative price for their produce through market intervention and creating awareness among ryots about marketing opportunities in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu."

The reason: this festive season, a kg of garlic costs Rs 232, while peeled garlic costs Rs 267 per kg. Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HoPComs) officials said that while good quality garlic is usually quite expensive, now, even low-quality garlic is no less than Rs 120 per kg.B N Prasad, MD, HOPCOMS, told TNIE the price of garlic has been steadily increasing in the last one-and-a-half months. Even the price of onion did not rise this much. Earlier, in Bengaluru, the price never crossed Rs 80 in the retail market, he said.The costs of some kitchen staples, such as onion, garlic and ginger, have been on the higher side of late. However, the prices of both potatoes and tomatoes are stable now. According to HOPCOMS, a kg of onion costs Rs 54, potato Rs 29, ginger Rs 200 and tomato Rs 34.Prasad said that garlic is not grown much in Karnataka, and is imported from Madhya Pradesh. He also added that the price of onions, which was high till the end of September, has now started to drop. This is because onions are grown in Karnataka, and the price will only drop further in the coming days. To ensure that potato prices are stable, potatoes coming in from Agra are being stored in cold storage units, and its the Hassan crops that are being released in the market.In the case of other vegetables, HOPCOMS said that in general, prices are on the higher side for the last two weeks or so, and have not come down yet. Officials maintained that the price rise has nothing to do with the festival season, as it is assumed, but actually due to continuous rainfall.Unprecedented rainfall in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and in the outskirts of Bengaluru (Ramanagara, Anekal, Chikkaballapur, Doddaballapur and other areas) is the reason behind the price rise, Prasad said.Ashraf U F, a vegetable vendor in Indiranagar, said that during festival season, vendors tend to make a little more profit.Vegetables are a daily necessity, and during festive season, prices hike by about Rs 5 or Rs 10. Though it is not a big amount, it is sufficient for us, he said.Beulah amma, another vegetable vendor at Halasuru market, said that she has been getting 30-50 customers per day for the past one week, and has been able to make enough money to get through the festival season.We make a profit of Rs 100-Rs 200 per day during the festival season, unlike other days. However, this year, since it has been raining, we have also lost a few customers, as they prefer to shop in big retail shops, she said."
2019-10-06,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/new-good-food-destination-chefs-home/articleshow/71460737.cms,New Good Food Destination: Chef’s Home,"On a plate, with loveThis table busts mythsMaking memories over foodPopular in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Pune, the appeal of food pop-ups is trying to find room in the brick-and-mortar tradition of Delhi-NCR. They might not stick to one place for long, but the culture is here to stay, a logical corollary of the shrinking spaces and high rentals in metros. Sakshi Virmani and Sharad Kohli report on an eating-out trend thats hosted at the chefs home, making the experience much more personal.I find pop-ups are personal  strangers turn into friends after one pop-up itself, Sneha Saikia says with a laugh.For people in search of food with a backstory and atmosphere, or sometimes nostalgia, pop-ups have become must-save dates in the calendar. Customers are looking for an experience in an intimate space, says Osama Jalali, food historian and home chef. Theyre also looking for authenticity, which fine-dining cannot always bring.Through pop-ups, he adds, one can appreciate the full range and delights of Indias food heritage. Many Assamese pop-ups are coming up, for example, because people want to go beyond the regular fare.In Delhi-NCR, the concept hasnt gained as much acceptance as it has elsewhere, believes Srikant Vijaykar, one half of a duo thats on a journey of introducing the lesser-known but delicious Pathare Prabhu cuisine . Still, whether the venue is a Mumbai flat or a sprawling Delhi kothi, the pop-up is bringing on a platter the countrys culinary diversity.For long, food pop-ups have been part of Indias streetscape, in the form of makeshift stalls around which hungry folks would gather. Now, cuisines from regions across the land are being curated by home chefs, who are digging through old recipes and older ingredients to present local gastronomic cultures to an eager audience.When Sunetra and Srikant Vijaykar moved to Gurgaon from Mumbai in 2016, they knew little of how unique their cuisine was. The Vijaykars are a very small community from Maharashtra, the Pathare Prabhu community  worldwide, we number over 6,000, even smaller than the Parsis, says Sunetra.In fact, there is, as Srikant points out, more Gujarati and Rajasthani influence in their cuisine than there is Maharashtrian.The couples pop-ups, organised every three months at their Gurgaon pad, usually accommodate around 15 people. Each time, the response is phenomenal. Little wonder, considering the mouthwatering preparations that are served up. Some of our popular dishes are Paplet Bhujane, a white pomfret curry; Chimboree che Khadkhadle, crabs cooked in Pathare Prabhu sambar masala and lots of garlic; Gode Mutton, a mutton curry made with sambar masala; and Karandiche Lonache, shrimps in homemade pickle masala, says Sunetra.Before every pop-up, the Vijaykars fly in fresh food from Mumbai, where their events are more regular and attract the crowds. Srikant reasons it might have something to do with the palate, since Pathare Prabhu cuisine boasts more flavours than spice. A marketing professional, he is currently translating Gruhini-Mitra, one of the earliest known Indian cookbooks in which are chronicled old Pathare Prabhu dishes.At her CR Park home, Sneha Saikia serves dollops of Bhut Jolokia chutney, steamed squash, black-sesame baby potatoes and Manxo (mutton) curry, with rice on the side, on a fresh banana leaf and Kansa plate. Her Table for 6 acquaints north Indians with the delectable food of the northeast.Five years ago, Saikia noticed disparaging remarks online about food from the region. When I joined food groups on social media, I used to see foul comments about the cuisine. A lot of people still think we eat insects, that our food is visually unattractive to north Indians. I thought, let me invite people over and show them what we cook, says Saikia, who also makes Bodo and Khasi food.She recalls an incident where a college girl booked the table for the birthday of a friend, who was Assamese. The birthday boy was so happy, he was almost in tears; he described it as the best gift ever. People from almost all ethnicities have come and enjoyed this food, Saikia adds.Then theres Anchal Bhatia, who runs Tastesutra, a quaint cooking studio in Lajpat Nagar. She also holds pop-ups, including one she called Hidden Culinary Gems, in which guests were served regional preparations that have become rare, among them Bel Sherbet (with nolen gur and amaranth seeds), Kathal ke Kabab, Chicken Ghee Roast (with ragi appam), and Hyderabadi Baghaar-e-Baingan. Bhatias labour of love is India on a Thali.Yet, its not just in homes that the phenomenon of the pop-up is playing out. Hotels and restaurants, too, have embraced the concept, as have spaces like clubs in high-end condominiums. Its likely that chefs in hotels might not be conversant with a certain cuisine, so hotels can host pop-ups by a chef who would specialise in a certain regional cuisine, informs Jalali.The economics behind pop-ups is pretty straightforward, for what drives the home chefs is not profit but a passion to create a memorable experience around food. They spend on the ingredients, while the guests pay for the experience. Alternately, the organiser of a pop-up at a restaurant or hotel gets paid by the establishment in question.Further, if its happening in town, you would get to know about it through word of mouth, and your circle of fellow foodies. Or, of course, through the ubiquitous social media.At the end of the day, nothing beats the informality of strangers coming together to break bread at a table. Or, more traditionally, sitting on the floor, among carpets and bolsters and around a dastarkhwan, bonding over a daawat. It allows people the opportunity to sit down to a meal with a Muslim family, and it gives us the chance to host them, conveys Jalali, of a very personal experience.Besides, where else can you learn about ingredients like bitter brinjal, Burmese coriander or single clove garlic? These are difficult to procure in Delhi, so Saikia began growing them here (or, asking anyone visiting from Assam to bring some along). In our Assamese platter, you will find all the flavours  Khar is alkaline, for spice we have Bhut Jolokia chutney, for a little tangy flavour we have Masor Tenga (tomato fish curry), and steamed vegetables to balance the hotness, she explains.In winters, at one of the pop-ups, I introduced silkworms and red ant eggs that my cousin had sent me from Assam. Everybody was apprehensive at first but when they tried, they loved it. Indeed, food can make misapprehensions disappear and bring communities closer.So, the age-old Indian tradition of hospitality is alive. Meanwhile, at Saikias pop-ups, every scrumptious meal ends with a steaming brew of comfort. We have retained the British tea culture for community interaction in the afternoon, she says."
2019-10-07,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2019/oct/07/the-hide-and-seek-of-drought-and-flood-in-karnataka-2044257.html,The hide-and-seek of drought and flood in Karnataka,"By Express News ServiceWhile more than half of the state is reeling under floods, at least five districts are drought-hit. We are facing two extreme calamities, said Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa in his Independence Day speech. If floods devastated more than two dozen districts this year, drought has been tormenting the state for 14 years since 2001.Yediyurappa took oath as CM while the state was barely recovering from drought. However, the change in political landscape also brought in floods.Even before the government and bureaucracy could fully implement the relief measures in 156 taluks that were declared drought-hit in December last year, floods and incessant rains wreaked havoc in the state.Now, when the Centre, after a prolonged delay of almost two months, has released flood aid, the state is looking at a possibility of declaring about 30 more taluks as drought-hit.While the state government, utilising its funds as well as the central aid of Rs 1,029.39 crore released in August, has focused on the supply of drinking water, job generation under MGNREGA, supply of fodder and checking migration of rural masses, continued deficit rain has pushed more taluks into the drought-hit list. In a recent review meeting conducted by the revenue department, taluks in Bengaluru, Ramanagara, Kolar, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Chamarajanagar, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura and Gadag were identified as drought affected.If there is one district that has faced drought for the longest period, it is Kolar. Farmers in the district have tried everything from changing crops to depending on dairy farming for revenue but the extensive dependence on rainwater has left the district high and dry year after year. This wasnt the case a couple of decades ago when lakes and groundwater were the lifelines of Kolar.I own 12 acres and grow mango, potato and tomato in seven acres. But I have not grown anything in the remaining five acres because of water shortage, said Shivarame Gowda, a farmer from Kiruvara in Srinivasapur taluk.The tale of Narayana Gowda, another farmer, is different. He first chose to sow drought-resistant ragi  athree-month-crop following rain in June and July in Kolar and Chikballapur, but rains failed and so did the crop. He then shifted to a two-month crop of horse gram, with little hope of success.Every time a taluk is declared drought-hit, the DCs are authorised to undertake a joint survey to assess the extent of crop loss, as per the modalities prescribed by the government in the Manual for Drought Management 2016. Drought relief measures are then undertaken. But projects like the KC Valley give hope to Kolar farmers. Treated water from Bengaluru to fill up lakes in Kolar has shown an increase in groundwater level. Also, 31 tanks have already been filled up under the project in Narasapura and Malur. A project to construct 806 check dams across the district, of which 312 have been completed, show the way forward."

Already onions are selling for Rs 50. The normal average cost of each is Rs 20-25.Prices are expected to remain high till November 3-4, engulfing the state's assembly election which is due October 21.Traders blame excess, unseasonal rainfall in Maharashtra for short supply. Meanwhile, households are struggling to pay Rs 120-140 for a kilo of both staple items. Most are purchasing small quantities in the hope that rates will reduce shortly.In Matunga , one of the costliest markets in Mumbai, tomato was sold for an exorbitant Rs 70-80 per kg on Tuesday. Two vendors, Manoj Vegetables and Rahul Chopde, blamed short supply for the increase. In Pali Market, Bandra, Lallu's vegetable shop sold it for Rs 80 and the same rate was levied in Byculla Market. Opera House sellers charged Rs 75. In Andheri Lokhandwala the rate was Rs 50-60 while Khar Market, Walkeshwar and Mulund sold tomato for Rs 60.Wholesaler Mangal Gupta of APMC Vashi said, ""Monday's wholesale price was Rs 650 for 20 kg (or Rs 32. 50 per kilo). Fifteen days ago, tomato was reasonably priced, in fact rates were low, but due to unseasonal heavy rain in growing areas, the crop has been affected. Also a rise in demand due to the festive season has caused prices to increase. Rates will reduce by 25% next week and will normalise a week after Diwali .""This implies that Mumbaikars will have to endure high rates for approximately another month since Diwali falls October 27.Households are constrained from preparing gravy items, most of which require onion and tomato. ""Whichever political party forms the government, it seems unable to control this periodic rise. Even after onion export has been banned, it continues to cost Rs 50. We are again experimenting curd recipes for gravies or settling for dry vegetables with dal,"" said Kamaljeet Kaur, a resident of Manish Nagar, Andheri.Kaur's husband has deposited all his money in the neighbouring PMC Bank which is under lockdown. This price rise has constrained their budget further.Families which cook meat on a routine basis find themselves hemmed in on either side. In Byculla, Naseem Shaikh purchased a half kilo ""to get buy for two days"". ""Non-vegetarian preparations require both onion and tomato. Through the past two months we were burdened by the price of onions, now since four days tomato is also getting out of hand. We cannot possibly find a substitute for two staple ingredients."""

Read MoreBy: Piyush SarnaTwo days after tomatoes were being sold in the Tricity for Rs 70 a kg, the prices have come own by by Rs 10 whereas onion is still on a high.Prices of tomatoes reduced by Rs 10 on Monday and consumers can now buy it at Rs 60 per kg. As TOI last checked on Saturday, prices of tomato were at a bar of Rs 70 per kg and there was a tough fight between the traders to sell it at Rs 60-70 per kg.""From the past two months, the stock is fluctuating due to which sometimes the supply crunch hits the market. In mid August, tomatoes touched Rs 80 per kg, but it fell later. Today, I bought tomatoes at Rs 50 at wholesale market so selling it Rs 60 is justified. However, after calculating other expenses, we barely earn a profit,"" said Mohan, a tomato vendor at Sector 56 vegetable market.Exactly a month ago, the red fruit was being sold at a price of Rs 30 per kg that is 50% the current price.Due to the recent bad weather conditions in the hill region, especially Solan, the supply has been hit hard. Heavy jams are the main cause that stop vehicular movement affecting the stock.Onions, which are constantly at Rs 50 per kg from the past two weeks, continues to give a tough time to the consumers. While the wholesale rate is Rs 50 a kg, street vendors are selling these at Rs 80 per kg. ""We don't get onions from the grain market. We also, like other people, buy them from the vegetable market only as we don't require much stock and sell these further. What do the residents expect? They want vegetables at a lower price even at their doorstep?"" said one of the vendors on condition of anonymity.""Even if the prices of tomatoes are down by Rs 10, it still burns a hole in our pockets. From Rs 20 per kg to Rs 70 is a major jump. Prices of onions as well as tomatoes are so high that the common man cannot include these in salads any more,"" said Kuldeep Singh Gill, a resident"
2019-10-09,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/from-the-earth/article29628939.ece,From the earth,"The last time I ate vonn was in Goa. It was at a small restaurant, and the dessert came in a small steel katori, fragrant with the headiness of jaggery. It was a bowl of nostalgia, reminiscent of a childhood spent eating this beloved coconut milk and palm jaggery dish. My next encounter with vonn is surprisingly, at a five-star hotel. Here, the dish came dressed up in a textured glass bowl, sprinkled with cashewnuts, and a white coconut sphere snuck in its centre. It didnt look like the vonn of my childhood but it tasted the same; the addition of sorghum giving it a new and chewy texture.Culinary challengesSorghum Vonn with Coconut Sphere (750) is part of an ongoing limited and healthy menu being offered at The Sahib Room & Kipling Bar. The menu is dedicated to celebrating lesser used vegetables and grains, especially in restaurants. In keeping with peoples dietary restrictions during Navratri festivities, its a wholly vegetarian menu. You wont miss the meat. The idea behind the menu was to do vegetables with a difference. Every dish has an element  a grain or a vegetable  you wouldnt associate with a restaurant or a five star [hotel], says Paul Kinny, culinary director, The St Regis Mumbai. Their biggest challenge was creating dishes that were familiar to diners and worthy of the restaurant. They accordingly spent six months in research and did two months of trials. The final menu has 11 dishes pairing grains and vegetables and a selection of breads. We begin the meal with Panifal ka Shorba (650), a deserving way to highlight water chestnuts. It is creamy, light on the spice and has an underlying tanginess. Theres a crunchy surprise in the form of a rajgira chikki.Vegetarian bitesMaster chef Asif Qureshi, whose nihari and biryani at the restaurant are popular says that it was a challenge procuring and working on these other ingredients like black rice, kohlrabi, ghosale and red rice. Another challenge was getting the staff to change their mindsets and get used to working with ghar ke sabzi like tinda.The tinda in question is served as a Bharwan Tinda, Awadhi Korma (1,100). It is stuffed with a mixture of nuts and bell peppers. The accompanying Awadhi style gravy gives it a much-deserved richness, with the creamy tomato and almond gravy providing a good foil for the milder flavoured tinda. Kohlrabi Kedgeree (1,050) that is reminiscent of a ghee-laden khichdi. Another Goan-inspired dish is the Kela Phool Vindaloo (1,100). Its an odd dish with a savoury ghewar base sweetened by apricot chutney. The banana flower is spicy enough but lacks the bold vindaloo flavours.The star of the meal is a kebab so tender it falls apart at the touch of a fork. Kathal Gilawat on Ragi Roti (1,100) uses the jackfruit seeds instead of the fruit to make the kebab. Its the perfect meaty texture and the kebab opens up to reveal the faintest bit of cheese. A dab of jackfruit puree on the top is a strident reminder that this is a vegetarian dish. The next dish highlights another fruit from the jackfruit family, breadfruit. Roti Phal Baja (1,050) has thick slices of breadfruit pan seared with a thick rava crumb. Providing contrast and freshness to what is a stodgy baja is a vibrant labneh and a salad of raw mango and peanuts. Besides vonn, theres a Nachni Malida for dessert too. The limited menu is on till October 13, and may be extended depending on reception. Some dishes live up to the unusual pairings; others feel like theyre trying too hard. These are not unusual ingredients and they dont have to be experimental in their cooking and plating. Sometimes, simplicity works best. Just try the vonn.Till October 13.

Its howl was a complaint to both God and Allah. Umabens head began a rapid tattoo. She knew the crying of a dog was an omen for bad things, but how much worse could things possibly be? For the last three days, an earthquake had unsettled Umabens entire spirit, shaken her flesh and bones. She knew it was impossible to escape the pain of that.She got up to open the box of rotis. A small stale piece of bhakri was left. She took it in her palm, crossed the otla and pushed the heavy wooden door to reach the street. She advanced towards Kalu, the dog who sat right in the centre of the street. All around, the road was strewn with stones and bricks, shards of glass, iron rods, bicycle chains. On the left, slightly far away, Fakirbhais bandhej shop still spouted a thin thread of smoke. By the footpath, three wooden carts had overturned their wares: apples, bananas, radish, tomatoes and cucumbers were lying scattered on the street.Tabrezs cart, from which he sold besan fritters, was upturned too: a group of flies hummed over a stash of rotting onions and chillies coated with flour. All around, burnt and putrefying smells made their way upwards. The smell of dried blood mingled with them and created invisible ropeways to hell. Umaben felt nausea grip her throat at the overpowering odour. Her three- day empty stomach churned in revulsion. She had stepped out of her home after three long days.Slowly, she tiptoed through the debris strewn on the road, picking her way with care. Kalu was sitting at the crossing. Umaben called out as she waved the bhakri at him. Kalu looked at her and turned away. Umaben moved forward and said: Roti, jomle baap. Eat the bread. But the dog showed no interest. She noticed some pieces of bread strewn about the road; some others must have tried to dissuade the creature from howling. Umaben looked at the dog: its head on the ground, Kalu lay supine, ignoring her. A sigh escaped her throat: Ha Bhagwan! Oh my God!On her left, a small group of people talked in a murmur. A few policemen stood nearby, looking at her. One of them waved his hand, gesturing at her to leave. Kalu began crying again. Umabens heart leapt up win fear. Day before yesterday, the men had poured petrol over Fakirbhai and had burnt him alive. There was not a soul in the neighbourhood who had dared to intervene. Fakirbhai used to tell her, Ben, even God is afraid of the poor and the naked.He was fearless about his poverty, but he did not know that someone who was feared by God could become a target for Satan. Umaben turned away from the crossing and walked like a robot to the small shop that was once owned by Fakirbhai. It had no signboard now. She pushed open the door to the small room. Kalu came running and stopped in front of the open door.It then turned back once again to go back to its old place. Umaben went in with slow steps; the floor was covered in rush mats. On it lay a piece of white silk cloth. Numerous threads were tied on it and on the other side were marks of a design made with pencil. Nearby stood three big aluminum pans filled with blackish water. Umaben suddenly had the sensation of someone standing at her back. She turned and saw that a policeman had entered the room.Excerpted from the short story Bandhni by Sunanda Bhattacharya, from the book Womens Writings from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, edited by Rakhshanda Jalil and Debjani Sengupta, with permission from Bloomsbury India."

The soaring prices of tomatoes come just weeks after the retail cost of onions shot up to 60-80 per kg.According to traders at the Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, tomatoes have become costlier in the last few days as supplies have been impacted. Some southern states such as Karnataka and Telangana as well as some hilly states witnessed unexpected rains. This damaged the crops and as a result created a supply disruption, said a trader and a member of the Azadpur Tomato Merchants Association on condition of anonymity.At Mother Dairys Safal outlets, tomatoes are being sold at 58 per kg, while local vendors are selling between 60 and 80 per kg on Wednesday, depending on the quality and locality.As per the central government data, the average retail price of tomato in Delhi increased to 54 per kg on Wednesday from 45 per kg on November 1.Meanwhile, price of onions in retail markets in Delhi has come down to below 60 per kg due to increase in supply of the bulb by the central government through cooperatives Nafed, NCCF and Mother Dairy. These cooperatives are selling onions at a cheaper rate of 23.90 per kg. These agencies are selling onions from the buffer stock maintained by the central government.Out of 56,700 tonnes of onion stored as buffer stock, 18,000 tonnes have been offloaded in different markets, including Delhi.However, the price is still on the higher side in the retail market, retailers said.First Published: Oct 09, 2019 23:46 IST"

The sudden rise has been attributed to the disruption of supply due rains in tomato-growing states.The representatives of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare informed that supply has been hit due to incessant rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka and it will normalise in the next 10 days as monsoon rains are already receding, the statement said.AdvertisingThe government has roped in Safal, the largest organised retail network of fruits and vegetables in Delhi-NCR, to provide a substitute for tomatoes to customers. Apart from this, the statement said that the government has decided that tomato-producing states will be requested to facilitate augmenting the supply to regions which are in short supply, including Delhi.Tomato-producing states have been regularly advised to interact with APMCs, traders and transporters to ensure regular supply. The same is being reiterated to four major tomato-producing states  Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh  so that prices normalise."

The bar Bhattacharya fondly speaks about is Tote Bar at Tote on the Turf, which shut down last October, and is now back as Tote Talli.Reinventing spaceFor 10 years, the bar had been one of citys the most buzzing nightspots, attracting swish 30-somethings. And it was a true bar, as they didnt even have a separate food menu, only serving small bites from Neel (their Indian restaurant below). And when Tote on the Turf would serve as the venue for the offsite shows of Lakme Fashion Week (before they changed the venue to grander locales such as The Royal Opera House a few years ago), the bar, would also serve as the perfect spot for post-show rendezvous. The empty floor that earlier turned into a dance floor is now occupied by tables, and Bhattacharya tells us that they will host performances in the future. We have seen a whole new generation come here over a decade. With a new crowd coming in, we felt the need to reinvent the menu and reach a newer audience, says Bhattacharya.With Tote Talli, deGustibus also wants to focus on food, and the brief for their chefs was to go crazy and design something fun, and well priced. The focus being the bar, small plates and finger foods dominate the menu. And there is a section dedicated to chakna which are served in the form of bento boxes. Whether its papad, peanuts or chaklis, they have a bento box (195 each) dedicated to different versions of each of these common snacks. The usual suspects such as poutines (you can choose from sweet and regular potato) and nachos come with the basic cheese and guacamole topping options, in addition to some Mumbai style versions such as kheema (275) and nachos with Akuri Scrambled Eggs (225).Small eatsBhattacharya says that they were conscious of including different Indian cuisines to reinvent bar food, which can be seen with options such as Chettinad or Bhut Jolokia Chicken Wings served with thecha sour cream (295), or the Chilliya Mutton sliders (350) inspired by the late-night stalls at Reay Road, which are often frequented by their staff who work out of their office in the vicinity. As an ode to the earlier avatar, they still offer Baida Roti in paneer (350), chicken (375) and mutton (395) variants. More Mughlai food finds its way to the menu in the form of different kebabs (250 onwards).If cheese is all you wish to eat, call for any of their burrata offerings (375) which come with a variety of flavour pairings such as tomato concasse, chilli oil, chutneys and a brulee burrata too. We have included more small plates in affordable prices so when you come in a group, you can freely order and choose from various options rather than just one main dish, says Bhattacharya. The desi inspirations make way to the cocktail menu too with cocktails such as Mucchad (335) a vodka and paan drink; and Golmaal (335), a refreshing concoction of vodka, orange juice, tamarind, cilantro and chillies. Just in case you arent into small plates, you can call for Tote Bowls that offer tried-and-tested options such as Burnt Garlic Triple Schezwan Rice (325) or Thow Suey (325), which is Khow Suey made the Thai way.Tote Talli Tote on the Turf, Mahalaxmi Racecourse, Mahalakshmi; 91369 33274; 6 p.m. onwards"

2019-10-11,https://www.news18.com/news/india/why-strong-monsoon-rains-are-not-necessarily-good-news-for-indian-farmers-2341211.html,Why Strong Monsoon Rains Are Not Necessarily Good News for Indian Farmers,"Mumbai: India, one of the world's biggest agricultural producers, experienced its heaviest monsoon rains in 25 years this year.While rain would normally cheer the agricultural heartland, the monsoon was erratic and has left many crops damaged.Why is the monsoon important?India is the world's biggest producer of sugar, cotton and pulses and the second-biggest producer of wheat and rice. The success of these crops is largely determined by the June-September monsoon, which delivers about 70% of the country's annual rainfall.The monsoon is also critical for the wider economy. Farming makes up about 15% of the $2.5 trillion economy and employs more than half of the country's 1.3 billion people.While crops in the ground have been damaged by the monsoon, the rains have replenished reservoirs and ground water reserves, which augurs well for India's rural economy in 2020.What went wrong with this monsoon?A prolonged dry spell resulted in significantly below-average rainfall at the start of the season, prompting farmers to delay the sowing of summer crops and leaving others wilting.By the end of July, rainfall was so heavy that rivers flooded and crops were damaged.The combination of a prolonged dry spell followed by heavy rainfall increased pest infestation and disease, forcing farmers to spend more on pesticides.Which crops are affected?Soybean, rice, cotton, sugarcane, pulses and vegetables have been hardest hit.Soybean, India's main summer-sown oilseed, was particularly damaged as Madhya Pradesh - India's top grower of the crop - received rainfall 44% above average. The heavy rains stunted the flowering of the plant, which in turn reduced the pods it yielded.Sugarcane in many districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka - the second- and third-biggest producers in India, respectively - were flooded in the first week of August. This is expected to result in India's lowest sugar output in three years, industry officials say.Maturing cotton in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the country's top producers, was damaged by heavy rains in September.Rice was affected by excessive rains in southern and western India, as well as low rainfall in the top producing eastern state of West Bengal.Vegetables such as tomatoes and onions went rotten due to heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.How could erratic rainfall affect India's trade of farm commodities?Given the damage to the soybean crop, the world's biggest importer of edible oils could be forced to increase imports of palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil in 2019/20 marketing year starting from November 1.Cotton supplies from new season crops are likely to be delayed by two to three weeks, in turn delaying exports.Imports of pulses, especially pigeon peas, green and black gram, are likely to rise due to lower production.The dry spell helped the spread of the fall armyworm pest, which damaged corn and will potentially push New Delhi to import the grain to contain pressure on local prices.India, the world's biggest onion exporter, has banned overseas sales, forcing prices in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka to double.What are the prospects for winter-sown crops?Above-average monsoon rain has brightened the prospects for winter crops like wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas.For years, millions of farmers have been unable to plant winter crops because weak rainfall had reduced moisture levels in the ground.But following the heavy rains in September, moisture levels are adequate, and most reservoir levels are well-above their 10-year averages.India could harvest a record wheat crop in 2020 and production from winter-sown rice is expected to jump, analysts said. But that could also create excess rice and wheat supplies at a time when India has been struggling to encourage exports because local prices are higher than global benchmarks.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-10-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/with-a-colonial-hangover/article29654639.ece,Tracing Europe's influence on India's culinary heritage,"A story goes: When English memsahibs sent their empire-building husbands off to work, what went with them in their lunch-boxes were slices of roast from Sundays lunch, wedges of cold pork pies, leftover stew with a few boiled eggs thrown in. The ambitious brown sahibs who shared offices with these Englishmen were impressed with these packed lunches and began to believe that these bland and often insipid offerings were the secret to the power of their masters. And so, somewhere in Bombay, an exasperated homemaker, egged on by her upwardly-aspirational husband, fashioned a dish that was a cross between a shepherds pie and a pasta casserole, using leftover curry. Thus was born the dabba gosht.Krishna Shantakumar, general manager, Ebony in Whitefield, Bengaluru, admits that one cannot attest to the veracity of this story he shares, but the fact is, that colonial influences on Indian cuisine and even vice-versa were natural. A blending of cuisines occurred when the British trained Indians to recreate their stodgy offerings in a bid to counter the spice levels of Indian cooking. Simultaneously, Indians aspired to be more like their British superiors and often asked their wives to recreate English cooking, says Shantakumar.The menu at Ebony has the Bohri dabba gosht of course, along with a few Anglo-Indian classics such as the mulligatawny soup, chicken jalfrezi and brown sahib scotch eggs. To show that the experimenting never ceases, Shantakumar speaks of dishes on the menu with a colonial twist a la Ebony. Take the salonee broccoli. Broccoli being a traditional English vegetable, is cooked in the tandoor with a mustard marinade, and topped with a crispy coating.In search of adventureMany people from Britain, Scotland and Ireland were adventure-seekers and came in search of new experiences. When the ships landed, many of them made India their home and took on Indian spouses as well. They craved home food and had to make do with what was available in India. The Scottish egg, similar to the Nargisi kofta, became a speciality. The humble meat cutlet with added spices became the shami kebab. These dishes became standards in most of the clubs and barracks, explains chef consultant Michael Swamy.At Anglow, Khan Market, New Delhi, Chef Swamy showcases dishes from select regions across the country. Many of the dishes come from various experiences, like the influence and creation of the Railway mutton curry, a dish that was created for long train journeys from Calcutta. The dak bungalow chicken curry evolved when the khansamas cooked in far-off outposts using the simplest of ingredients to create a flavourful dish, Swamy says.Such cross-cultural experiments were seen across the country. Bengal was once the home of French and British colonisers, and also hosted populations of the Portuguese and Dutch. Collective influences of these communities were seen in the food created for them, explains Subrata Debnath, business head and general manager, East India Room, Kolkata. The result was a unique blend of cuisines, where local ingredients were adapted to French, and western cooking techniques  characterised by creamy sauces, the restrained use of spices, and new techniques such as baking, grilling, frying, poaching, steaming and roasting, he adds.On the menu at East India Room is the Sovabazar Rajbarir winning pantheras  a British colonisation high tea recipe with mutton. This was first made and served at Sovabazar Rajbari to British Governors and is a testimony to these cross-cultural influences and techniques. As also the beckty meuniere, grilled Calcutta bhetki with parsley brown butter and the Dacress Lane stew, a classic chicken stew served with toasted pound bread.Breaking breadSpeaking of bread, it is common knowledge that we have the Portuguese coming to Goa to thank for that. Pav is the only form of leavened bread that is made in the country today. It was the Portuguese who taught us to culture yeast and make our breads; today it is an integral part of Mumbai and Goas culinary landscape. Portuguese is the only cuisine that introduced wine in cooking in India and is also the only one that uses so many types of vinegars. A lot of ingredients were brought in too  tomatoes, green chillies, corn and cashews. Colonisers came in for trade and brought their techniques of cooking with them. Take the smoking and curing of meats with the chorizo sausage. The idea was for it to last long voyages! explains Hussain Shahzad, executive chef, O Pedro, Mumbai.Going beyond the popular vindaloo (which features on the menu) at O Pedro, Shahzad pays tribute to the Portuguese concept of petiscos or small plates that often make up dinner in Portugal, while showcasing Goan cuisine.While this is a doff of the hat to the classics in a way, the food at Punkah House in Bengaluru is a modern interpretation of many dishes influenced by our colonial history  Portuguese, French, British, Dutch and colonies in Burma and Ceylon. At Punkah, the flavours of harissa spiced chicken pate are very Indian, but the technique of making pate is French-inspired. Similarly, the galouti mousse in our lamb sticky rice dish, uses a classic European method. The same goes for our jamun ceviche and even the rasam ramen, explains Shikha Nath, brand director, Punkah House. We have tried to incorporate the colonial influence very subtly into mainstream Indian cookery; without losing the essence of any of the individual cuisines, she adds.Tradition retoldPunam Singh, co-founder, Mustard, Mumbai too has a similar approach where she is committed to telling traditional stories from the rich cuisines of Bengal and France. The two meet, not in fusion, but in flavours that one savours. Paupiettes are a favourite in Normandy, the part of France that our Chef Gregory hails from. Usually made with meat, hes chosen to make these traditional parcels with rice, serving them with a red wine sauce thats been thickened with a carrot pure. We also have the bandhakopir dolma, stuffed leaves and vegetables that are a legacy of the Armenians in Bengal. Here we stuff fresh cabbage leaves with rice and minced meat, and for vegetarians with mushroom. There is the chingri machher chiney kebab, a stuffed lobster served on a bed of salad, elaborates Singh.Over the centuries, cuisines in India have assimilated a lot of colonial influences. These have gone both ways. From the chamosa of Portugal that is inspired by the Indian samosa, to the kedgeree that pays tribute to our khichdi. While tracing the lineages of these dishes may prove difficult, the fact remains that a delicious legacy continues to prevail."

And Ive often wondered how the story of butter chicken is always connected with the story of Partition Whether you delve into the history of Partition survivor Kundan Lal Gujral and Moti Mahal, who have a strong claim that butter chicken was their invention, or read about buddies Iqbal Singh Ghai and Purshottam Lal Lamba, who, soon after Partition started the Kwality chain of restaurants, and popularised their version of murg makhanwalla, from Kolkata to London. Or Gaylord, which further refined the taste of this smoky chicken with tomato and cream gravy at from 1946 to 1957, when there was a Gaylord Indian Restaurant in Delhi, Bombay, London, Japan, Chicago and New York. Or later on, in 1972, when yet another migrant from Pakistan, JK Kapur decided to invite superstar Dilip Kumar to inaugurate his new restaurant venture Copper Chimney at Worli, serving amongst other delicacies a real robust chicken makhanwala.Back in the day, going to Copper Chimney was an occasion. Copper Chimney was a posh, carpeted eatery, with circular, brick-lined windows (an architectural feature of the Happy Home building, where it was housed) and old copper vessels hanging on the walls. The tables were clustered under a canopied ceiling, and covered in crisply starched tablecloths, German silver cutlery and huge metal goblets for water. I still get a sense memory of ice-cold water in those metal goblets, which got instantly chilled, the pickled onion and achaar on the table and, of course the taste of their butter chicken.The restaurant had an iconic feature, the show window, through which you could watch the choreography of their chefs. Behind the glass, smoke rising as rumali rotis were tossed, naans were patted and kababs were fired on long skewers by tall-hatted Ustaads. The word copper was highlighted by the huge copper tandoors that were in plain sight behind the glass. Today so familiar is the show kitchen that no Copper Chimney outlet can be designed without it.It wasnt easy to get a table at Copper Chimney; even then, in the late 70s and 80s, there was always a queue outside of eager customers waiting for previous diners to relinquish their tables. You entered Copper Chimney and the aroma of tandoori food was unmistakable. The restaurant buzzed, conversations were loud, laughter resounded and the clink of metal and china was the sound of people having a jolly good time. Later on the 90s, the restaurant shifted a couple of buildings away to a newly built property, iconic in its own right because the Lotus Cinema Theatre had once stood right by there. By now of course Copper Chimney had opened an outlet at Kala Ghoda and another one at Bandra, revised its menu, and kept up with life. But the Worli branch always remained special.The Balochistan-influenced kalmi kababs (drumsticks of chicken marinated for over six hours in cream and aromatic spices and then gently cooked in the tandoor) are among the classics that made Copper Chimney famous.I dined there a few days ago. That place too has been renovated and the menu had been rejigged. But to my surprise, they had reprised some dishes from the past that only people from my vintage will remember. I plunged into ordering some of the food that I grew up eating at the original Copper Chimney in the late 70s and 80s. Starting with the Balochistan-influenced kalmi kababs. Drumsticks of chicken marinated for over six hours in cream and aromatic spices and then gently cooked in the tandoor. Along with that, a portion of the mutton burrah chop, three ribs of mutton, with a chunk of meat at the end, in a dark red/brown masala, well charred over coal. The earthy tasting, murg achaari tikka, soft and tender pieces of chicken marinated in Punjabi pickle spices and then placed in the tandoor. Lahore-influenced bagani bahar, chargrilled chicken legs in a mint and yogurt marinade. All this with an oversized Kabuli naan. As the word suggests, the naan comes sprinkled with every conceivable dry-fruit, maraschino and nut. Its a sweet and smoky bread that goes so well with spicy gravies.For mains, soft and silken paneer masala and Benaras malai kofta, balls of cottage cheese and cream with nuts cooked in an exquisite sauce. Chicken Patiala, a truly Anglo-Indian dish. Boneless chicken cooked in white smooth-silken gravy, subtly flavoured with spices and garnished with slices of boiled egg and cheese. Then we ordered some mushroom kheema. I dont think anyone had put mushrooms, kheema, chopped vegetables and spices together before. Add to that ghost badami and Kabuli ghost, mild gravies, one cooked in almond paste and the other in Afghan spices. And finally the mutton chello kabab. Chunks of smoky meat, laid on a bed of the creamiest rice with yoghurt. A super hit item from the saga of Copper Chimney. But how could I not order the chicken makhanwala. A dish I have consumed gallons of over the last 30-odd years and whose taste remained steadfast till today.First Published: Oct 11, 2019 21:37 IST"

He later drove to seaside resort town of Mamallapuram for his informal summit with PM Modi.PM Modi, who had reached Mamallapuram ahead of Xi by a chopper, received the Chinese leader at the Arjuna's Penance monument. Donning a striking Tamil traditional 'karai veshti' (dhoti with a border in green), angavastram (a shawl), and a half sleeve white shirt, the Prime Minister shook hands with Xi as the two leaders exchanged pleasantries. PM Modi's outfit drew praise from several quarters, with Pattali Makkal Katchi S Ramadoss and Karnataka culture and tourism minister C T Ravi hailing PM for promoting the local culture.The two leaders proceeded to take a tour of the iconic relief structure Arjuna's Penance, an intricately carved ancient sculpture dating back to the Pallava dynasty and Krishna's Butter Ball - a big round boulder perched on a slope. Later, the Prime Minister offered a tender coconut to the visiting foreign dignitary and the two leaders relished the drink at the magnificent Panch Rathas complex.PM Modi and Xi then enjoyed a thrilling cultural performance at the centuries-old Shore Temple , basking in the rich heritage of India. The programme showcased the Indian classical dance forms of Kathakali and Bharatnatyam to fast-paced Carnatic music, highlighting the region's magnificent roots.After the cultural gala, the Prime Minister hosted Xi for a scrumptious dinner comprising sambhar, a mouthwatering south Indian recipe made of lentils and also a favourite of the Tamils, besides other delicacies. The meal also included 'thakkali rasam,' made of tomato and 'imli' and 'kadalai (chick pea, generally) korma', besides halwa as the premier dessert.The Prime Minister gifted Xi a Nachiarkoil - a branched Annam Lamp and a Thanjavur painting of dancing Saraswathi. The lamp is exclusively made in Nachiarkoil town by the local community known as Pathers. The painting is three-feet high, four-feet wide, weighs about 40 kgs and took 45 days to complete.The meeting between the two leaders is a follow up to the inaugural summit which was held in Wuhan from April 27 to 28 last year. ""Taking forward the Wuhan Spirit, the Mahabalipuram meet will provide an opportunity to the Chinese President and PM Modi to continue their discussions on overarching issues of bilateral, regional and global importance and to exchange views on deepening India-China Closer Development Partnership,"" the external affairs ministry had said in a statement.On Saturday, the two leaders will have a one-on-one meeting at the Fisherman's Cove resort which will be followed up by delegation-level talks.

The unexpected increase was solely led by a 15.4 per cent jump in vegetable prices.ALSO READ: Rs 80 per kg and climbing: Onion prices may not come down anytime soon, here's why!At 3.9 per cent, inflation is at a kissing distance from the RBI's cherished goal of 4 per cent. It has remained below the target for 14 months in a row now. Inflation stood at 3.28 per cent in August and 3.7 a year before in September 2018.The September spike in prices is still in line with RBI's revised inflation estimates and leaves room for further rate cuts for one simple reason.The price rise will be seen as a seasonal occurrence given the extended monsoon, which delayed harvest and interrupted supply chain of agricultural produce. For instance, rains hit supply lines of onions, whose prices jumped 54 per cent last month according to government data. However, this was somewhat offset by a 19 per cent price decline in tomatoes.ALSO READ: After onion, now tomato price soar to Rs 80 per kg in Delhi"" Indias Sep CPI surged to 3.99% from 3.21% in August, the market was expecting 3.70%. The uptick in food and fuel inflation has led to a surge in CPI print. Due to heavy and unevenly distributed rains onion and tomato prices have skyrocketed. Despite this rise in food inflation, with headline inflation currently below RBIs medium-term target of 4%, we expect the central bank to lower rates to revive growth,"" said Rahul Gupta, Currency Research Head, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.Given the seasonal aberration, RBI is unlikely to develop cold feet as food and fuel, which account for 57 per cent of the CPI basket, their direct influence on monetary policy is limited and hence the central bank may remain unnerved and continue its accommodative policy and may even reduce policy rates in December.Early this month, RBI slightly revised inflation forecasts upwards to 3.4 per cent for Q2FY20 and to 3.5-3.7 per cent for the second half of the fiscal."
2019-10-14,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2019/oct/14/sizzling-onion-prices-unlikely-to-alter-easy-rate-cycle-2047386.html,Sizzling onion prices unlikely to alter easy rate cycle,"By BloombergA more than 200% surge in onion prices is expected to push Indias headline inflation rate to its highest level in more than a year, but is unlikely to keep Asias most aggressive rate cutter from further easing monetary policy.The price-spike is likely to add at least 30 basis points to Septembers headline inflation. A Bloomberg survey ahead of a report due later Monday showed consumer prices probably rose 3.8% in September from a year ago -- the highest since July 2018.Prices of onions, as well as tomatoes, soared in September after heavy monsoon rains damaged crops and reduced supplies. With high prices of the kitchen staples known to have contributed to bringing down past governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modis administration banned onion exports and cracked down on hoarding to keep a lid on costs.Economists see no such threat to the central banks accommodative monetary policy stance, which paved the way for 135 basis points of easing so far this year, given persisting weakness in the economy. Data Friday showed factory output declined for the first time in more than two years in August amid waning demand overall.Wholesale price inflation in September eased to 0.33%, the weakest pace in more than three years, data showed Monday. While prices of manufactured products and fuel and lighting declined, food inflation was at 7.47%. Wholesale onion prices more than doubled, according to data.Surplus rainfall suggests a record summer harvest is likely, and that should keep food inflation low in the year ahead, according to Bloomberg Economics Abhishek Gupta.Cost of onions rose to as high as 80 rupees ($1.13) a kilogram in September from 20 rupees to 25 rupees the previous two months. Tomato prices in New Delhi have more than doubled to 60 rupees to 70 rupees per kilogram in the past weeks.Consequently, we expect the spike in onion prices to contribute about 30 basis points to headline inflation, said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai.Food Inflation to Rise Sharply in SeptemberOnions have a weight of 0.6% in the overall inflation basket and contribute about 10% to the vegetable basket.The inflation-targeting Reserve Bank of India expects food prices to stabilize while forecasting headline inflation to stay well below its medium-term target of 4% for the rest of the fiscal year through March.Besides, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, is likely to show that demand pressures are still rather weak. That should keep alive expectations of more rate cuts by the RBI in the coming months.Bloomberg Economicss Gupta expects core inflation to ease for a number of reasons.These include companies reducing prices to pass on the benefit of recent tax cuts to consumers, lower tax rates on consumer goods and services, an increase in the supply of affordable housing, a wider output gap, a sharp drop in crude oil prices, and strong favourable base effects during the October-to-December months, he said."

Congress","MUMBAI: The Congress on Monday hit out at the BJP for harping on scrapping of Article 370 in poll rallies, saying the ruling party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were deflecting attention from issues concerning common people like economic slowdown, price rise and unemployment.Top BJP leaders, including Modi and party president Amit Shah , have been repeatedly speaking about abrogation of provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in their rallies in poll-bound Maharashtra and Haryana.Modi has challenged the Congress to publicly state it will restore the controversial constitutional provision, which granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir, if voted to power.Addressing a press meet here, AICC spokesman Jaiveer Shergill said instead of asking the Congress whether it will restore the now scrapped Article 370, Modi should talk about reducing the prices of petrol, diesel, onion and tomato whose rate has crossed Rs 70 a kg in retail market.Shergill said the prime minister should come to the rescue of harried depositors of scam-hit PMC Bank and also took a jibe at Modi over his 56-inch chest remark.""The Congress will speak about Article 370 during the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.""But, if the prime minister really has a 56-inch chest, he should work to reduce the prices of petrol, diesel, onion and tomato, and also hand over the money of lakhs of depositors of PMC Bank,"" he said.The Congress spokesman accused the prime minister of always being in campaign mode instead of focusing on governance.Speaking at the press meet, AICC general secretary R P N Singh said for the government to find solutions to the economic slowdown and growing unemployment, it has to first acknowledge these problems.""Accept the problem before you find solutions.

The unexpected increase was solely led by a 15.4 per cent jump in vegetable prices.ALSO READ: Rs 80 per kg and climbing: Onion prices may not come down anytime soon, here's why!At 3.9 per cent, inflation is at a kissing distance from the RBI's cherished goal of 4 per cent. It has remained below the target for 14 months in a row now. Inflation stood at 3.28 per cent in August and 3.7 a year before in September 2018.The September spike in prices is still in line with RBI's revised inflation estimates and leaves room for further rate cuts for one simple reason.The price rise will be seen as a seasonal occurrence given the extended monsoon, which delayed harvest and interrupted supply chain of agricultural produce. For instance, rains hit supply lines of onions, whose prices jumped 54 per cent last month according to government data. However, this was somewhat offset by a 19 per cent price decline in tomatoes.ALSO READ: After onion, now tomato price soar to Rs 80 per kg in Delhi"" Indias Sep CPI surged to 3.99% from 3.21% in August, the market was expecting 3.70%. The uptick in food and fuel inflation has led to a surge in CPI print. Due to heavy and unevenly distributed rains onion and tomato prices have skyrocketed. Despite this rise in food inflation, with headline inflation currently below RBIs medium-term target of 4%, we expect the central bank to lower rates to revive growth,"" said Rahul Gupta, Currency Research Head, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.Given the seasonal aberration, RBI is unlikely to develop cold feet as food and fuel, which account for 57 per cent of the CPI basket, their direct influence on monetary policy is limited and hence the central bank may remain unnerved and continue its accommodative policy and may even reduce policy rates in December.Early this month, RBI slightly revised inflation forecasts upwards to 3.4 per cent for Q2FY20 and to 3.5-3.7 per cent for the second half of the fiscal."

The high retail inflation could limit the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) ability to further cut policy rates.Data separately released by the industry department on Monday, however, showed that wholesale price inflation decelerated to a three-year low at 0.33% in September compared with 1.08% a month ago, as prices of manufactured items entered the deflationary territory, signalling the lack of pricing power of producers in the current economic downturn.Inflation for manufactured items stood at -0.42% in September as against 0% a month ago. The WPI inflation rate declined in September despite onion prices rising 122% from a year ago. The government has banned exports of onions and put stock limits on traders to cool prices.The spike in retail inflation is a blip and should correct going ahead, said Crisil Ltds chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi. Overall, food inflation could remain high this year even as core inflation declines. That should improve terms of trade for the farmers, he said.However, many economists said the rise in retail inflation may impact the rate cut cycle of RBI. The decline in core inflation provides some comfort, but the unexpectedly sharp jump in the September CPI inflation has pushed up the likelihood of a pause in the next MPC review, unless the headline retail inflation recedes sharply in this month, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra Ltd.The question is whether food prices will continue to rise as onions and tomatoes continue to cause concern, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.Monetary policy has to be cautious and while it had decidedly targeted growth in the earlier policies, it has to consider CPI inflation over which rates have no control... he said.First Published: Oct 15, 2019 04:57 IST"

Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Okayama, Japan.)AdvertisingJapan woke Sunday morning to flooded rivers and burst levees, as emergency workers used helicopters and boats to rescue stranded residents from their homes in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis, the largest storm to hit the country in decades.Rain began falling Saturday and continued through Sunday morning, testing dams, pulling down hillsides, destroying roads and bridges, and driving rivers over their banks.How many people are affected?Anticipating extensive damage, the authorities urged nearly 6 million people to evacuate.AdvertisingRescue services jumped into action early in the morning, with helicopters plucking stranded people from balconies and roofs. At least 35 people were killed, with 15 people reported missing and at least 100 injured, according to the Kyodo news agency. Deaths were expected to mount as swollen rivers rushed through flooded neighborhoods.More than 370,000 households were without power, and at least 15,000 homes were without water, Yoshihide Suga, Japans chief Cabinet secretary, told reporters, adding that the country was taking every measure to recover.At least two deaths and several landslides occurred before the typhoon made landfall, and a 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Chiba, east of Tokyo, on Saturday evening just before the storm hit.What areas were hit hardest?At least 142 rivers flooded, NHK said, after record-breaking rains. In Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, a levee burst on the Chikuma River, flooding a wide area of Nagano City.Levees on 21 rivers across the flood zone collapsed, according to NHK and information provided by local governments.At least 27,000 rescue workers raced to evacuate people from the flood zones, where water reached up to buildings second stories and strong currents swept through the streets. NHK showed images of an effort to rescue hundreds of people stranded at an elder-care center in Saitama, a suburban area north of Tokyo. Television announcers urged people trapped in their homes to put up pieces of fabric as a signal to rescuers.Was the nuclear reactor at Fukushima struck?In Fukushima prefecture, where a huge earthquake and tsunami caused the Daiichi nuclear power plant to melt down in 2011, a burst levee flooded the banks of the Abukuma River after heavy rains.Separately, Tokyo Electric Power said it was inspecting the nuclear plant for damage from the heavy rains.In the city of Tamura, floodwaters displaced huge bags containing contaminated waste gathered during the cleanup of areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Kyodo News reported. A river washed away an unknown number of the bags, which were in a temporary storage area, it said.The contents of the bags, which hold up to 1.3 tons, were unclear, but they are most likely filled with irradiated topsoil and other refuse from the cleanup that followed the meltdown. Ten of the bags were recovered undamaged, Kyodo News said, and the authorities are cataloging the remaining ones to see how many were still missing.How does Hagibis compare with previous storms?After a day of heavy rains, the storm made landfall around 7 p.m. Saturday local time, in the resort town of Ito, southwest of Tokyo. It struck the capital directly, lashing the surrounding areas with heavy rains and winds of up to 130 mph, before moving north.The authorities had expected Hagibis to rival the Kanogawa typhoon of 1958, which killed more than 1,200 people in Shizuoka prefecture and the Tokyo region. Days before the storm hit, officials were urging people to get ready to evacuate.On Saturday, the authorities issued a rare highest-level warning of extreme rain in 12 prefectures, including Saitama and Shizuoka, advising residents to evacuate or move to higher floors in the nearest sturdy building in order to avoid imminent danger. All the alerts had been lifted by Sunday morning.Trains, flights and some Rugby World Cup matches were canceled.On Saturday, the authorities canceled flights across the country, Japan railways suspended service in the Tokyo region, and bullet trains between Tokyo and Osaka were suspended.Hagibis followed another strong typhoon, Faxai, which hit Japan last month, causing heavy damage in Chiba prefecture.How are residents coping?In Chiba, residents just recovering from Faxai were hit by a tornado and earthquake, on top of the super typhoon.In Ichihara City, debris caused by Hagibis piled up next to refuse from the previous storm. Hideto Ata, a 62-year-old farmer, surveyed the ruins of his crops. The tornado that accompanied the storm had ripped the roof off a nearby house and dragged it across his fields, uprooting tomatoes, bell peppers and eggplants.The devastation is huge, especially because its the second natural disaster in a short time, he said. Just when I thought everyone in the neighborhood was recovered from the last typhoon, a tornado comes along.Nearby, the retiree Teruo Ao, 80, put on a brave face as he stood next to his home, where the tornado had shredded part of his roof and a second-floor balcony, and left a twisted pile of metal in the garden.AdvertisingIm just glad my family was safe and unhurt, he said."

A Bloomberg survey ahead of a report due later Monday showed consumer prices probably rose 3.8% in September from a year ago -- the highest since July 2018.Prices of onions, as well as tomatoes, soared in September after heavy monsoon rains damaged crops and reduced supplies. With high prices of the kitchen staples known to have contributed to bringing down past governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modis administration banned onion exports and cracked down on hoarding to keep a lid on costs.Economists see no such threat to the central banks accommodative monetary policy stance, which paved the way for 135 basis points of easing so far this year, given persisting weakness in the economy.

He was addressing a gathering at the village on Monday and he honoured the villagers who were part of the Naganadhi Rejuvenation Project.He said that The Art of Living has been reviving rivers and other water resources through its water conservation initiatives. Through this, people are being made aware of various water conservation practices and the importance of the judicious use of natural resources like water.The spiritual leader was accorded a rousing welcome by the villagers and his followers. He visited the sites where the workers had taken efforts to conserve groundwater by adopting recharging methods on watercourses in Salamanatham on the Kannamangalam-Arcot Road.Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram said that women were given opportunities to revive this river and the district administration has implemented similar projects in other blocks through District Rural Development Agency.Once the lifeline of Vellore villages, the river went dry and despite the efforts of farmers to grow crops such as millet, tomato, groundnut and banana that require less water, returns from the barren lands fell inadequate to sustain them.In 2014, taking the guidance of geologist Lingaraju Yale, ex-director of Karnataka State Remote Sensing and Application Centre and with the support of Art of Living river rejuvenation project, Chandrasekaran Kuppan, director of the Naganadhi River Rejuvenation programme, designed a model to revive the river. Three important steps were taken simultaneously. While there was a campaign to boost the confidence of villagers using remote sensing and satellite maps, Mr. Chandrasekaran and his team prepared the plans. They built 600 recharge wells and 600 boulder checks. These structures ensured the flow of water into the aquifers. To hold the water, hundreds of hardy, drought-resistant saplings were planted around and across the river basin.GIS-based maps and long term rainfall patterns were analysed to estimate the availability of water for recharging aquifers and recharge structures were constructed at appropriate points.When there were rains in 2015 and 2016, after the structures were constructed, water started flowing into them. Their river became alive again, after 15 years! Seeing the success of the revival efforts, government support was assured, says Mr. Chandrasekaran Kuppan.Thanks to Guruji, the efforts of our workers paid rich dividends, and the groundwater level saw a phenomenal growth. We get pure sweet water at the depth of 30 feet now, whereas it was completely dry during the first three years of the project, said Vidhya Baskaran from Roja SHG from Salamanatham."

Whether it is street food like chaat or traditional fare like dosa and idli, food is a great icebreaker.Tiruchi, with its enviable spread of restaurants, has an equally big community of food lovers. The city has a large population of educated foodies, the ones who know their pastas and cheeses, and who can differentiate between a rotisserie and grilled chicken. Television shows and greater exposure to world cuisine through travel have created a new customer base for standalone establishments that cater to this clientele of food explorers.As the craze for food photography catches on, its no surprise that Tiruchi has at least four online groups that exclusively review local eateries with pictures. We have noticed that more high-end cafeterias and bistros have been launched in the past few years in Tiruchi. Its nice to see new places coming up with great food, says R Sridhar, founder-administrator of the Facebook group Where Trichy Eats, which has over 4000 members.Bringing new menus to the city is definitely a good idea, but the restaurants should take care not to destroy the original recipe with their own tweaks. The shawarma, for instance, has so many interpretations, that the authentic recipe has almost vanished in Tiruchi, says Sridhar Venkatesan, a food blogger.Several young entrepreneurs have created their own niche in informal, yet upmarket dining, bringing the best of Continental, American and south Asian food to Tiruchi.

We thought wed be catering mainly to the college students along this stretch of the Thanjavur highway, but now we are steadily getting diners from Tiruchi as well, says Arpitha, who studied culinary arts in Paris and Delhi.Besides a dcor that reflects the trios passion for Hollywood movies, the bistro also has a menu that offers authentic Italian with fusion forays into Mexican and Continental. Its newest offering, (for the kids, says Arpitha) is a five-option Maggi noodles menu, along with exotic desserts like Thai Banana Pancake and Baklava (filo pastry layers filled with nuts and drenched with sugar syrup).Peri-Peri Cottage Cheese Steak at The Clappers Bistro.

The hand-tossed pizzas range from the traditional Margherita featuring a topping of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil, to the fusion with Tandoori chicken.The bistro maintains separate storage and cooking utensils (including fryers) for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, and sources its greens and key ingredients like cheese from suppliers in Ooty and Chennai.A good quality menu requires a lot of hard work, and the right ingredients are essential to get the same results every time, says Arpitha. We have some very well-informed customers, who have taught us how to adjust the menu according to local tastes.Social media has helped to spread the word about The Clappers Bistro, with the movie association aiding in marketing. We have been overwhelmed by the response so far, and we hope to keep cooking up something delicious for our customers, says Bhalaji.On the road to tasty fareAlifiya Husein, proprietor of TN 45 Bistro.

I wanted people to get a taste of delicious fare from the dhaba and the home kitchen, with some popular fast food, says proprietor Alifiya Husein, who has created the wide-ranging menu from her own experience as a hotel management graduate and catering industry professional.The recently launched bistros meal combos start at 99 and go up to 699, offering customers a good deal for single or group dining.Roast leg of lamb at TN 45 Bistro.

Among the specials, is a made-to-order roasted leg of lamb that requires an advance notice of 3 hours.And for a dish that definitely knows how to make an entry, theres little to beat the bistros sizzlers (cottage cheese, chicken and fish).Its important for customers to enjoy their food in a relaxed atmosphere, which is why we advise them to be prepared to wait for their orders. Each dish has to be made from scratch, so it will take at least 25 minutes to be served, says Alifiya.The bistro also undertakes orders for fresh cakes and desserts.Alifiya plans to bring some of her own heritage into the menu by debuting a Bohra Muslim thali soon. This meal, usually lunch, is meant to be shared by at least 6-10 people, and is served on a big platter. I hope to feature dishes that I have learned from my mother in this wholesome offering, she says."

It meant that the next step towards a sustainable closed agricultural ecosystem had been taken,"" said Wieger Wamelink from Wageningen University & Research.The researchers simulated the properties of Lunar and Martian regolith and ""normal"" soil, potting soil from Earth, as a control.Nine of the ten crops sown grew well and edible parts were harvested from them.Spinach was the exception, according to the study published in the journal Open Agriculture.Total biomass production per tray was the highest for the Earth control and Mars soil simulant that differed significantly from Moon soil simulant, the researchers said.The seeds produced by three species, radish, rye and garden cress , were tested successfully for germination.The researchers said that if humans are going to establish a base on the Moon or on Mars they will have to grow their own crops.An option is to use Lunar and Martian regolith.These regoliths are not available for plant growth experiments, therefore NASA has developed regolith simulants, they said."

2019-10-17,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/fresh-from-the-farm/article29727445.ece,Fresh from the farm,"Deepanker Khosla, back in Mumbai after seven years, is now cooking at the Four Seasons instead of ITC Maratha. The chef, who grew up in Allahabad co-owns Bangkoks Haoma, which, he describes as, Asias first urban farm restaurant. There he serves nine and 13-course tasting menus that includes dishes like golgappa with puffed wheat, tamarind and yogurt alongside prawns on the rock with tamarind, lime foam and peanut and eggplant relish with tomato chutney and batti (a twist on the litti chokka). Khosla wants to evoke memories from Indian childhood meals, Food is about taking you, the diner, back to one memory. Its no surprise then, that his food has found favour with Indian visitors and the Indian diaspora that call the Thai capital home.Farming and SustainabilityAfter quitting his job at a Bangkok, Khosla, decided to set up a roving food truck, which broke down for 18 days outside of the capital in the midst of the Thai countryside. While waiting for replacement parts to come from India (the truck was made by Tata), Khosla managed to spend time on the surrounding farms daily and it made an impact. When it was time to decide on his new chapter, Khosla wondered, How do I transport this entire farm to the restaurant?The restaurant, Haomas philosophy translates into both big and small touches:The entirely closed aquaponic system is fed with rainwater, which in turn gives the plants and vegetables water to grow. Khosla doesnt hand out visiting cards but instead uses QR codes for those that want to keep in touch. At the end of the meal, all guests are given seeds to plant at home so that they can feel connected with the food that they eat. Khosla firmly believes in the sustainable ecosystem that reminds him of his Allahabad home, where dinner was prepared with freshly harvested vegetables from the garden and there was a connection with the seasons and the soil. The restaurant has been open for two years, beating the wave of sustainable fine-dining thats taken over Europe and is trickling into other geographies. Khosla looks at sustainability as a tradition instead of a trend, citing, It as the way that our fathers and our forefathers ate. They didnt eat food with chemicals and they didnt eat genetically modified stuff. What we need to educate diners about is that this is a way of being.No homecoming is complete without asking about where Khosla plans to go while in Mumbai. The chef has already managed to eat at Trishna on his first night in the city and hes now looking forward to paying a visit to Swati Snacks and Bade Miyan next. Like all taste-based memories, the Mumbai meals will probably spark some ideas for the next menu change at Haoma.The Haoma pop-up is taking place at the Four Seasons, Worli today and tomorrow; call 2481 8333 for more details"

2019-10-17,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/oct/16/grandma-goes-green-2048644.html,Grandma goes green,"SP Kirthana ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Around 11-km from Coimbatore is the quaint Tho p p a m p a t t i Poonga Nagar. The o t h e r w i s e nondescript village is slowly gaining fame because of an 82-year-olds good green deed. When you reach here, ask for kaikari paati veedu, and anyone in this village can guide you to S Nanjammals one-bedroom house. Enveloped by plants, climbers and creepers, her house is a treat for every city slicker. Her love for plants and distributing free seeds and saplings to anyone and everyone have rightfully earned her the moniker kaikari paati. She invited us into her garden and we were greeted by a burst of green dotted with purple brinjals, red tomatoes and yellow flowers of ladies finger.I have around 17 varieties of plants including chillies, tomato, brinjal, bottle gourd, snake gourd, curry leaves, moringa, and greens like ponnangani and thandan keerai. I use gardenfresh vegetables to cook my daily meals, she says beaming with pride. She also has fruit-bearing trees like papaya and guava. Gardening invokes happy memories in Nanjammal, who used to practice farming in childhood. The space in her house might not be big to cater to many plants, but she tends to them affectionately. She has placed a fence around the plants, waters it and checks for any pest attack regularly. She uses extract of neem leaves and custard apple tree leaves to spray and control the infection. She also makes natural fertilisers using waste vegetables and other ecomposable waste.Self-sufficient village Nanjammals son Bharathi Chinnasamy, an author, follows the Gandhian way of life and he was particularly attracted by one principle  the need or self-sufficient village communities to better the balance between man and nature. He began walking on this path ten years ago and has worked with many self-help groups and dreamed of implementing this idea. My idea of making villages self-sufficient is by inspiring people to grow vegetables in their own gardens. This will help them have good health and it also makes them responsible towards nature.I have tried this concept in more than 30 villages across Tamil Nadu but didnt get the expected results, he says. Bharathi has shared his experiments in his book Ellame Illavasam published last year. Nanjammal believed in this cause and started supporting her son in his mission two years back. She started working towards making Thoppampatti a self-sufficient village. Bharathi has travelled a lot across Tamil Nadu and worked hard to make this concept relevant.So, I wanted to try this in my village and distributed seeds free of cost to villagers. While some of them planted those seeds, some of them threw it away. I took efforts to make them understand why I was doing this and suggested that they grow at least one vegetable plant in their garden that will cater to their need. But even that went in vain. Then I decided to give saplings of brinjal plant instead of seeds as I had those aplenty. I made necessary arrangements for brinjal saplings to grow in my garden and once it attained a particular height, I gave it to the villagers for free, says Nanjammal. Four months back, she gave brinjal saplings to 37 families. Seeing the plants bear brinjals, many villagers came forward to purchase saplings from her. Nanjammal also makes it a point to visit the villagers houses to help them plant and maintain the saplings, at regular intervals.Till families see the result, they do not want to plant trees. I go to their houses once a week to look at the growth. If it has any pest attack, I use natural pesticides like neem leaves extract to control it. I also cut the infected leaves of the plants. Sometimes, family members also come to help me, she says. After planting brinjal saplings, she distributed seeds of snake gourd and bitter gourd plants. Now, she is distributing saplings of curry leaves. I come from an agriculture family in Erode. I started going out into the fields at the age of seven. So, growing vegetables is not a difficult task for me. I enjoy it and like creating awareness of sustainable living. My vision is to make my villagers grow at least 10 varieties of vegetables and greens in their garden. I want people to make farming a habit, she shares.Bond with plants Nanjammal chooses saplings to be distributed based on the size of the family. All the seeds are procured from the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University in the city. This cause is not so expensive. A packet of seeds costs `10 and you can get around 200 saplings. Growing vegetables in your garden will make you realise how fresh vegetables look, free of chemicals, says Bharathi. The mother-son duo also insist people to grow plants in public places.A few families can join hands and grow plants like moringa or creepers like pumpkin in public places near their houses and share the vegetables. It will also help create a bond between them. The state government can take our village as a model and implement the concept in other villages too, says Nanjammal. Bhuvaneshwari R, one of the villagers, says, Initially when she gave us the sapling, we didnt take the cause seriously. She supervises the growth of the sapling and helps us take care of them. When we started reaping the benefits from the plants, we felt happy.Every day I get around one kilogram of vegetables needed for our family from my own garden. She has made the village green and self-sufficient. Under her care, the future of Coimbatore looks green, healthy and self-sufficient. It is not hard to grow your plants. While people in villages and independent villas can maintain a small garden, people in flats and complexes can grow it in public places and split the vegetables, she says."
2019-10-17,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/oct/17/deliciousness-delivered-2048928.html,Deliciousness Delivered,"Ayesha Singh ByExpress News ServiceIn a happy coincidence, our quest for food on a lazy weekend ended with an order from a recently launched takeaway and delivery place called 1900 AD  A Kitchen Love Story. On that day, judging a book by its cover turned out to be the best thing. If it wasnt for the unusual ring to its name, we probably wouldnt have made it past the first page of the menu.The executive chef, Sanjeev Dogra, from Gaggal Himachal Pradesh, has bought the quintessential culinary style of slow cooking from the mountain tops to citys hurried gourmands. He cooks most things in clay posts and smokes them on charcoal till his olfactors give a nod of approval.Our short-listed selections included Dum Chicken Curry, Chefs Special Paneer, Daal 1900, and the thing that we were most excited about, The Khatta Mutton, a signature Himachali dish, also the only regional dish on the menu. That was a disappointment since the chefs indigenous knowledge could have been tapped into to display Himachali cuisine that is anyway a niche in Delhi. Also, there is no sweet section in the menu, a big letdown if youre looking for dessert.The food arrived 10 minutes before the requested time setting a good first impression. It came in well-tied cardboard boxes labelled accurately and neatly. There was no leakage or spillage, and every preparation inside had a seal. An accompaniment of vinegared ring onions, mint chutney and tissues came intact.All mains were in earthen handis sealed with dough. Each carried a printed label. The pot was received hot and it remained so for 20 minutes until we all sat down for a meal that was to become a treasured one for a long time.We dug into The Khatta Mutton curry right away. This is traditionally a staple of the Dogri community of Himachal Pradesh and Chef Dogra has used the best of his understanding to make this. No improvisations or innovations its prepared the way it was cooked traditionally in his family.The dish is not khatta (tangy) in the way you imagine it to be but was well laced with amchur spice (mango powder) that lends it a subtle pungency. The meat was tender and the gravy accompanying it filled the air with a satisfying aroma that could only come from pot roasting.The Dum Chicken Curry oozes out whiffs of ginger and garlic adorned with fresh minty flavours. The balance of spices has been achieved skillfully and chilli is thrown in moderately.Both conventional orders but also house specials, the Chefs Special Paneer and Daal 1900, were predictably good. The former had thick, rich tomato gravy with large chunks of paneer and a generous dollop of butter submerged under it. The piquancy of these dishes is best enjoyed with a simple naan or roti accompaniment to ensure the robustness is balanced with the neutrality of the bread.The menu comes with a large selection of other popular North Indian food options from Mutton Chaap, Makhmali Seekh Kebab, Allo Nazakat, Soya Chaam Masala to biryanis, all of which is prepared with the minimal use of machines. The most used implement is the motor and pestle which has replaced grinders, and mud pots have substituted a lot of the steel ware.The food is cooked in desi ghee, mustard oil and rock salt and each is simmered in pots to keep the moisture circulating evenly. And the result is right in front of us. A dexterous curation is rarely found in takeaway/delivery services. Try it."
2019-10-18,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/all-about-sustainability-foraging-and-a-bottle-of-gin/article29737758.ece,"All about sustainability, foraging and a bottle of gin","The gin-aissance refuses to die down  from being considered a ladies drink to becoming the hottest spirit in the bar world in the past few years, theres no doubt that gin is in. India has emerged as the fifth largest gin consumer in the world so its no surprise that the market is moving beyond the mass brands and introducing consumers to artisanal, often small-batch gins from around the world.One of the newer entrants is The Botanist, a super-premium, artisanal dry gin distilled on the wild Hebridean island of Islay in Scotland. The gin owes its layered complexity to the 22 hand-foraged botanicals that go into it, from typical Scottish ones like gorse and heather to meadowsweet, chamomile, and three different types of mint. The gin is trickle-distilled in the worlds last surviving Lomond spirit still, modified to slow down the distillation process, explained Caitlin Hill, award-winning mixologist and South Africas Gin Queen who is the brand ambassador for Rmy Cointreau (which owns The Botanist brand). Hill was in India recently to judge The Botanist Wild 22 competition, which was held in Goa in August, this year. Twenty-two selected bartenders from across India participated in an immersive three-day experience, which saw them foraging for wild botanicals to create a signature gin cocktail.Into the wildForaging for ingredients was made trendy by Noma in Copenhagen and soon became quite the rage, especially in the world of New Nordic restaurants. It was only a matter of time before it made an appearance on the cocktail scene. As a bartender or a bar-owner you look for ways in which you can set yourself apart and foraging is a great way of doing exactly that. Theres a lot of effort required for successful foraging, much more than just going to buy botanicals from a store or calling a supplier, said Hill. Judging the competition was Matt Whiley, an acclaimed bartender who owns several bars, including Scout London (No. 28 on the Worlds 50 Best Bars 2018 list) and Scout Sydney. Whiley has won multiple awards and was most recently awarded the European Bartender of the Year at the Mixology Bar Awards 2019. Both Hill and Whiley are enthusiastic proponents of foraging, with Whileys London & Sydney bars both focusing on sustainability and using foraged ingredients in their menu of inventive craft cocktails. Foraging is about celebrating what we have in our backyard, we overlook that all the time, said Whiley.The bartenders got a crash course in foraging on day one at Cazulo Feni Distillery in Cansaulim in South Goa. Surrounded by beautiful garrafes (handmade large-bellied glass bottles traditionally used for stocking feni) in the worlds first feni cellar, Cazulos second-generation distiller Hansel Vaz spoke about Goas rich wild produce. Goa was a major port for centuries, and the Portuguese who were keen agriculturists brought with them all sorts of plants, fruits and flowers. Some of them like potatoes, tomatoes, guava, pineapple, etc. reached the rest of India but there are many botanicals that are known only here like different cherries, local limes, etc., he said. Vazs distillery is surrounded by a wild farmland and we followed him on a trail as he pointed out pepper, bay leaves, nutmeg, betel, turmeric, allspice, cashew, breadfruit, and several other plants. The idea is to open up your eyes and train your senses to figure out how you can use these botanicals, whether its the fruits, flowers, or leaves, shared Vaz.Wilder stillOn day two, we accompanied the bartenders to another, larger and decidedly wilder farm also in South Goa. Here, father-and-son duo Laban and Kevin de Souza split the bartenders into two groups and guided them into the wild. The foraged bounty ranged from citron, passion fruit, star fruit, kokum, and hog plums (locally known as ambade) to rare findings like soursop and noni fruit (both of which purportedly cure several ailments, from cancer to diabetes). Apart from the fruits, spices like pepper, allspice, fennel, and cinnamon, and leaves like betel, ginger, lemongrass, etc. found their way into the bartenders kitty. We also encountered a toddy tapper who effortlessly shimmied up a palm tree and brought down freshly tapped toddy for us to taste. Hill was especially fascinated with it; If I had to design a cocktail, I would probably carbonate the toddy, add a citrus element, and of course some Botanist gin, she said.Cocktail hourOn day three, the bartenders assembled at Firefly, Goas hottest new party spot, to battle it out for the title of The Botanist Wild One. The bar was decked out with bottles of The Botanist Gin and the judges milled about (apart from Hill amd Whiley, the competition was judged by celebrity chef Vicky Ratnani, and Goa-based artisanal bread-maker Sujit Sumitran). The dance floor was set up with tables where the bartenders were hard at work with their prep  blending, sous-viding, shaking, stirring, and tasting  as they perfected their drink. Every table was brimming with foraged ingredients  fruits, leaves, roots, et al. Im using allspice leaves infused in choriz fat, star fruit and Goan limes to make my cocktail, B-Town, said Rahul Raghav, Bar Manager at The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro.At another table, Bengaluru-based mixologist Karthik Kumar who is the Director of Beverages at Big Brewsky Brewing Company was tenderising octopus with pepper leaves. I want to bring the connect between the land and the sea with the foraged leaves and this octopus. Im calling my drink Wild & Sea, he explained. Working on adjoining tables, JW Marriott Mumbai Sahars bar and beverage manager Sarita Sharma and Goa-based mixologist and bar consultant Evgenya Prazdnik were both using passion fruit to produce two rather distinct drinks.The competition began with the contestants unleashing their creativity not just with the drinks but also by presenting bar snacks with foraged ingredients (like the breadfruit chips with hog plum dip served by Sharma) and even making coasters with pressed leaves & flowers. Im interested in the bartenders techniques and Im really looking forward to what stories they have to tell, said Hill. For Whiley, it was all about the taste; More than anything else, the cocktail has to taste great; everything else that goes around it is good but if it doesnt taste great youre going to be let down, he said.The judges declared Evgenya Prazdnik as the winner for her cocktail Jungle Calling, which blended the earthy notes of The Botanist Gin with the tart flavours of passion fruit, star fruit, and local limes, all foraged from the farm the previous day. The chilli oil garnish at the end brought a nice balance and an attractive finish to the cocktail. Prazdnik will now head to Islay in March 2020 for the international competition.The Botanist is available at leading restaurants in in the city like The Bombay Canteen, Toast & Tonic, Americano, Qualia, etc. and retails at  6150 (700-ml bottle, ex-Mumbai)."

The crunch of gravel gives the place an air of Downton Abbey, but the hotels famed Sikh doormen, in their white turbans and ornate uniforms, are an instant reminder that youre firmly in ex-colonial territory.(Photo | Raffles.com)Before youve uttered a single word, the hotel knows more about you than you might think. To personalize guests experiences, their profiles start to be reviewed about two weeks ahead of arrival, according to Grace Kiong, the hotels head butler. This attention to detail ensures that when a visitor arrives, their personal butlerevery suite gets oneis one step ahead when it comes to anticipating their possible needs.After alighting from your car, its just a few paces to the red carpet, where staff open the door and a wave of serene elegance washes over you. The lobby itself is a beautiful location for an afternoon tea, with parlor seating, a crystal chandelier and stairs leading to higher floors in the back.(Photo | Raffles.com)Raffles, which hosts a grand reopening festival on Friday following an extensive renovation that brought the icon into the 21st century, has hosted everyone from Somerset Maugham and Rudyard Kipling, to Elizabeth Taylor and King Edward VIII (the monarch who abdicated the British throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson).From humble beginnings in 1887, it now houses a variety of restaurants, bars and numerous upscale shops, in addition to its luxury suites.For me the very special grace of Raffles is that it offers such intimacy and such a sense of quiet and of privacy, Pico Iyer, the essayist and novelist who recently completed a stint as the hotels writer-in-residence, said via email.Because there are only 115 suites, and theyre spread out across so much space, a guest really feels she has a whole world to herself. The verandas outside each room, the books placed inside each room, the green lawns near almost every room and the quiet spaces on the second and third floors overlooking the lobby all invite one to take a break, to read, or sip a drink, or make sketches, or write letters, or keep a diary.(Photo | Raffles.com)The best thing about working at Raffles? My colleagues are like family to me, shares senior doorman Narajan Singh, who has been with the hotel for 28 years. Even though its situated in the center of a busy city, he says, you will always be able to have a quiet moment to yourself, sitting at one of the benches around the hotels courtyard or gardens.The hotel often welcomes guests whose parents and even grandparents have previously stayed there. I cant stress enough how special the Raffles Hotel is to people, head butler Kiong says.The hotel often welcomes guests whose parents and even grandparents have previously stayed there. I cant stress enough how special the Raffles Hotel is to people, head butler Kiong says.(Photo | Raffles.com)The ultimate emblem of the hotels place in history is the Singapore Sling. Bartender Ngiam Tong Boon created the cocktail here in 1915. Guests willing to brave the lines of tourists can enjoy one at the famous Long Bar. And if youve had a Singapore Sling elsewhere and didnt like it, its still worth trying this oneits far better than most iterations. If you really love the fruity concoction, the hotel even offers a masterclass in how to make them.On the dining side, one in-house option is La Dame de Pic, the Singapore outpost for Anne-Sophie Pic, a gifted and delightful French chef who has 10 restaurants and seven Michelin Stars under her belt. The tasting menus dont disappoint. Pics signature berlingotspasta with French cheese fondue fillingexplode with flavour.(Photo | Raffles.com)The wagyu beef is spectacular, and the tomato and fish dishes are lovely on the eye as well as the tongue. The cheese cart is worth saving room for. Be prepared for a hefty price tag, especially if you opt for the wine pairing, but the menu is equal to the cost.For a post-dinner tipple, the Writers Bar is a small but sophisticated place off the lobby, featuring a series of cocktails inspired by famous authors who have visited the hotel over the years. Theres even a drink based on the traditional Southeast Asian dish rojak, a spicy fruit and vegetable salad.(Photo | Raffles.com)The bartenders fall easily into conversation but will also offer privacy when a patron wishes. Here in August Iyer waxed poetic about his writer-in-residence giga stint that produced his book, This Could Be Home: Raffles Hotel and the City of Tomorrow.The ultimate moment at the hotel, Iyer said, is the early evening, maybe 6 oclock, you sit out on the veranda drinking a cup of tea or something stronger, you have a book there or a diary or a postcard, the wind is coming in off the sea taking the heat off the day.For yet another slice of history, be sure to visit the Bar & Billiard Room, which opened in 1896 as a club under British colonial rule. Its the oldest standing bar in its original location in Singapore and is said to be the place where the last tiger was killed in Singapore, in 1902.(Photo | Raffles.com)Space has just reopened as BBR by Alain Ducasse, offering shared dishes that highlight Mediterranean cooking. Small plates like salted cod fritters and octopus with paprika and olive oil are served along with heftier dishes like roasted sea bass and barbecue striploin steak.The Tiffin Room, which has been part of the hotels history since 1892, serves North Indian cuisine in tiffin boxescontainers with multiple compartments stacked on top of each other that are used for meals in India and beyond. Wooden floorboards have been brought back to revive features from the early 1900s.Another dining option is y from Jereme Leung (the name means art in Chinese), which brings adaptations of provincial cuisine from across China. The wide-ranging menu features suckling pig and dim sum selections along with braised sea cucumber and abalone. Theres even a section for Chef Leungs favourite drinking snacks, including Sichuan spiced crispy fish skin and century eggs with roasted peppers and pickled ginger.(Photo | Raffles.com)Outside, the Raffles Courtyard contains an open-air bar that sits in a beautifully landscaped area of the Raffles Arcade. A gazebo-like structure covers the main bar area and there are umbrellas over other tables. Guests are provided with paper fans to help cool off from the Singaporean heat.And hidden away on the top floor is the pool, enticingly blue on hot days in the city. Youre in the heart of Singapore, overlooked by a handful of towers, but you might as well be a world away.(Photo | Raffles.com)My very first night of my 15 recent nights in the new Raffles, I was introduced to a little lounge in the spa in which one can recline in a quiet, dark room, sip tea and nibble at the nuts on offer and, quite wonderfully, do nothing at all, the writer Iyer said by email. One does not have to get a spa treatment or even use the Jacuzzi to enjoy this lounge if one is staying at Raffles, and every time I visited, it was completely empty and beautifully, liberatingly silent."

We will be able to supply the required quantity till the fresh crop arrives, said an official. The arrival of fresh onion stock has begun from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and it is expected that prices will show a downward trend in the coming week especially after Diwali , the ministry said.As far as tomato is concerned, the ministry said there has hardly been any damage to the crop in Andhra Pradesh which is a major producer.Horticulture commissioner has been asked to write to Andhra Pradesh government asking to dispatch the fresh tomatoes immediately for augmenting supplies in major demand centres including Delhi and its suburbs.It directed Mother Dairy to sell tomatoes at Rs 55 per kg or less through its Safal retail outlets across the national capital region (NCR) to provide relief to consumers.The ministry claimed that tomato rates have normalised in most states. The arrivals from Madhya Pradesh have begun which will have an immediate easing impact on prices. The tomato crop in Karnataka has begun arriving in the mandis and this will have an immediate impact on prices especially in the southern region, the government said.Meanwhile, the horticulture commissioner has been asked to consider the proposal to explore the possibility of cultivation of more tomatoes and onions in north India.In case of pulses, the panel decided that the existing stock should be offloaded in the market through Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and NCCF in smaller packs of half and one kgs."

In fact, instead of 10, we are getting three trucks every day. That is why we had to write to NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd).Earlier this week, Delhi Food and Supplies Minister Imran Hussain had written a letter to the Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan requesting him to direct NAFED to supply 10 trucks of onions every day for the next 10 days for Delhi so that they can be made available to people at subsidised rates.Sources present at Fridays meeting, however, claimed that the Delhi government rejected some of the trucks citing poor quality of onions.They also claimed that some trucks were rejected during Navratri on the ground that there will be less demand during the festival.NAFED has sufficient stock of onions and has requested that all stock be picked up and retailed by various state governments as per their requirement, said the statement.The arrival of fresh stock has begun from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and it is expected that prices will show a downward trend in the coming week, especially after Diwali, it added.The meeting was attended by representatives of the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare, including officials from the Department of Consumer Affairs, NAFED, Mother Dairy, Kendriya Bhandar and other agencies."

The folds in her pleats are crisp. Her temple jewellery accentuates her sharp features. Only  we are not at a dance recital. This is the meticulous work on a watermelon by food artist and sculptor M Elanchezhian. For the last 15 years, with his craftsmanship and attention-to-detail, this Theni-based self-taught artists work has been nothing short of artistic brilliance.Elanchezhian completed his diploma in catering from Annai Fathima College of Arts and Science in 2003. He worked in the hospitality industry across different parts of India for five years. Theres a preconceived notion that anybody who takes up catering ends up being a chef in a five-star hotel. I chose a lesser travelled path and took up edible sculpting. Hardly one in a 100 chefs can do this. Everybody around me mocked my decision. Nothing bogged me down. Here I am, going around the world and developing the art, said Elan with pride. The artist carved the faces of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China President Xi Jinping on a watermelon during their visit to Mamallapuram.A spin to sculptingHe was at New Delhi recently for a programme organised by Kalam Foundation on the occasion of the late former president APJ Abdul Kalams birth anniversary. The artist had carved four different avatars of the leader. The first time I carved his face was in 2004 and it took me seven hours.Now I can do it in two minutes. I take a print out of the design to be carved and replicate it on the fruit. Im always open to taking part in international and national workshops and conferences in this field. But, Ive decided to settle down at my native place, Gudalur. The lush green fields, organic produce, and variety in vegetables and fruits inspire me to try out mediums to carve on, said Elanchezhian, who can carve with his mouth and eyes blindfolded.Edible, sustainable artFrom green chilli to pumpkin, size is not a function of his art. The designs are inspired by leaders, art, culture and festivals. Elan opts for a vegetable or fruit that is native to the city he travels to, connecting cultures and communities through his work. His toolkit comprises knives and paring knives sourced from all over the world during his travels.Its called edible art since the vegetable or fruit that I can work on can be eaten. People fail to understand this and call it wasting of resources. For instance, I carved a rose out of a tomatos outer skin and the pulp was used to make rasam. I made a vegetable bouquet and the next day we made a salad out of it. Instead of peeling the outer skin and disposing it of into a bin, I make a design out of it, but people have problems. Keeping the flipside apart, I feel glad to have laid a path for the upcoming generation which wants to take this up as a full-time profession, said Elan who has won the Kalai Valarmani Award from the Tamil Nadu government for art in 2014.Visual treatThe artist has carved images of lesser-known leaders for Tamil Semmozhi Manadu in 2010 and earned appreciation from former late chief minister of Tamil Nadu M Karunanidhi. His work also includes the 100 avatars of former late chief minister of Tamil Nadu MG Ramachandran created on his 100th birth anniversary.In Elans work, the mundane becomes the muse, and art is celebrated sumptuously. There was no social media when I started. Now people are recognising my work after 15 years of painstaking work. The Government of Tamil Nadus horticulture department has recognised this art form but it must support the artists and give them a platform like those in other parts. My dream is to travel to countries like Thailand, China, and Malaysia where food art has been practiced since ancient times, and learn a few techniques for my art. Im open to taking classes to those interested, he said. For details, call: 9865242186"
2019-10-19,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2019/oct/19/tapas-to-taste-2049889.html,Tapas to taste,"Ayesha Singh ByExpress News ServiceMaachis manages to match up to its reputation. From the creators of one of the most popular Indian cuisine restaurants, Not Just Paranthas, a place that specialised in more than 150 different paranthas, Varun and Supra Agarwal is back with a new concept. Borrowing from the Spanish Tapas, they have brought regional Indian Tapas to the food stage. Of the many places represented through its menu map, we highlight the five you dont want to miss.RAJASTHANI KHOBA ROTIHow a regular roti can be transformed into a piece of culinary wonder is a thing to be testified through this preparation. The name khoba signifies the shape of the roti which has indentations or cavities. This originated from the villages in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and is a thick dough roti with bishops weed and other spices. At the restaurant, its served with Panchmel Daal Tadka or Daal Keema.DAKAI PAROTA FROM BENGALA street favourite from the region, Dakai Parota is a kind of layered paratha which can be roasted on a flat skillet or deep-fried. Like you have puris in Delhi, kachodis in Rajasthan and Luchis in Bengal, this dish is similar but of course, far from same. it is crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. A whole is made on the top following which, a filling of Kosha Mangsho Aloo or Lamb is filled, he says.BHOPALI BHUTE KE KHEESAnywhere you go in Bhopal youll see mashed corn on the roadside being prepared into a snack. At Maachis it becomes a palak patta crisp with Mascarpone quenelle and a tangy tamatar salsa added to complete the twist.FISH POLICHATTU-MOLIKATU FROM ANDHRA PRADESHTwo of the star preparations of the Andhra region, are fish preparations. Polichattu is a delicate kokum scented spicy tilapia, wrapped in plantain leaves and seared on a griddle. It uses a regional paste heavy of curry leaves, onion and coconut. Its spicy but not hot. It is pungent. Molikatu, on the other hand, is lightly flavoured. All spices and herbs are from India, says Varun, who is also the chef.SHILLONG SHAPALEThe place of origin for this pie dish is Tibet. The meat (non-vegetarian version) or corn (vegetarian version) is minced with hands, following which burnt chilli tomato chutney is added to it. We source a variety of Himalayan smoked cheese from a local vendor and incorporate it into the dish. The warm gooeyness adds a distinct nutty flavour and the lemongrass gives a very unusual ring, says Varun.Maachis, Ardee Mall, Sector 52, Gurgaon"

Currently, tomatoes are selling at  60-80 per kg in the Delhi retail market.However, in the long term, the committee acknowledged the importance of developing production centres closer to the major demand centres of northern India, especially given the seasonal surge in prices every year.Horticulture Commissioner was asked to consider the proposal under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) [a centrally sponsored scheme] for exploring the possibility of cultivation of more tomatoes and onions in Northern India, said the statement.It added that SAFAL, the governments major retailer in the area, was advised to take advantage of Operation Green Scheme, which aims to reduce post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, agro-logistics and storage capacity.With regard to onions and pulses, State governments were urged to pick up stock from the NAFED buffer and offload it in local markets in a bid to lower prices.During the meeting, it was informed that trucks of onions from Maharashtra arriving in Delhi were being rejected despite the stock quality being checked by Delhi government officials at the point of dispatch itself. The Centre urged the Delhi government to depute more personnel at loading sources to ensure that there is no rejection on arrival and facilitate constant supply of the vegetable to the Capital, said the statement."

Fresh stock has started to arrive from Madhya Pradesh, which will have an immediate easing impact on the prices.For increasing supply in Delhi-NCR, the Andhra Pradesh Horticulture Commissioner has been asked to dispatch fresh tomatoes as there has hardly been any damage to the crop in the state.In Delhi-NCR, Mother Dairy will cap the price of tomatoes at Rs 55 per kilogram. Mother Dairy and Safal have also been advised to consider repackaging tomato puree packets of 800 gram into smaller packets of 100 and 200 gram for wider consumption.As a long term measure for growing onions and tomatoes in north India, the Horticulture Commissioner has been asked to consider the proposal under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for exploring the possibility of cultivating these vegetables.The MIDH is a centrally sponsored scheme for the holistic growth of the horticulture sector.Safal has also been advised to take advantage of the Operation Green Scheme of the Central government. The scheme aims to reduce post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, agro-logistics and storage capacity."

Also, the garlic prices have caused the housewives' expenses to double.According to official data, the inflation rate of vegetable soared to 15 per cent in September and vegetable prices at retail shops doubled.Despite the government's attempts to control onion and tomato prices, in big cities, onion is available at more than Rs 50 per kg while tomato is touching the Rs 60-80 per kg level. Garlic prices are Rs 250-300 per kg, while those of green vegetables are also getting costly. Amid this, the staple potato is also started increasing in price.""I am paying more than Rs 1,000 these days for a quantity of vegetables that I was getting in Rs 500 two months back. It has changed my kitchen budget,"" said Sarika, a housewife and resident of Mandawali in east Delhi.She said prices of green vegetables like cauliflower and pointed gourd have gone up along with onion, tomato and garlic.According to the list of prices available at the website of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, onion price in the retail market in Delhi was Rs 52 per kg on Friday, while on September 18, it was at Rs 52 per kg.

Skirting the northern foothills of the Aravalli mountain range, the constituency is seen by many as an extension of Gurgaon constituency and has seen rampant construction activity in the past few years. It is a town in making, and as one travels along the Gurgaon-Sohna Road, one can see many upcoming condominiums and private educational institutions dotting both sides of the road. The towns aspirations, however, are dampened by a lack of basic civic infrastructure, a concern that is expected to be on peoples mind when they cast their votes on October 21.The constituency will witness a five-way battle among the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) Sanjay Singh, Congress Shamsuddin, Jannayak Janata Partys (JJP) Rohtash Khatana, Indian National Lok Dals (INLD) Rohtash Singh and Bahujan Samaj Partys (BSP) Javed Ahmad. In the 2014 polls, the BJP had emerged as the front-runner from the constituency while the INLD candidate stood second.Ahead of the polling day, HT visited different parts of the constituency to assess the various issues that concerned residents. At the Sohna bus terminal, people sit huddled together as they wait for the next roadways bus and talk about the poor connectivity in the region. The service of roadways is very poor. One has to wait for hours to get a bus during the day, while there is hardly any bus after 5pm, said Hitesh Bhardwaj, 18, who is a first-year BA student at Dronacharya Government College, Gurugram.Bhardwaj said that the lack of bus service prevented him from attending extra classes in the evening. There is no bus for us to return from the city in the evening. The only other option is to take shared tempos. We have to change three tempos to reach home, he said.Raj Dabas, 32, said that poor connectivity is a major impediment since most students travelled to other districts for college and there is no university in the area. There is no university in the jurisdiction. There are a few semi-government colleges and most of them are affiliated to MDU. There is no separate college for women either, said Dabas, adding that the BJP had nothing for the constituency in the past five years.He plans to vote for the JJP candidate in the fray, and said that both BJP and Congress candidates are outsiders who had been parachuted only for the elections. How can we expect these people to work for us when they dont even understand the area? JJP candidate Rohtash Khatana is a strong candidate since he is a local, said Dabas.His views were echoed by others, who said that most people are not familiar with the BJP and Congress candidates. It is difficult to predict the outcome, but the BJP and Congress are on a weak footing. The BSPs and JJPs candidates have contested from here in the past. They have an edge over others, said 62-year-old Brahm Prakash, while discussing the prospects of the candidates with his friends outside a tea shop in Chungi no-1 area.He added that BSP candidate could benefit from the Muslim votes in the region, where both Meos and Gujjars are dominant groups. Prakash is yet to decide on his candidate but said that he would vote for development.Sher Singh, 52, concurred that Sohna had not seen any development. There is no good college, hospital or industry in the area. Road infrastructure is also poor. We have been seeking the widening of the Sohna-Tauru road but to no avail, he said. Expansion of the Sohna-Tauru road is a concern shared by many residents. The road sees heavy traffic and frequent collisions take place on the stretch.Singh said that unemployment is possibly the biggest concern in the region, eliciting an agreement from others who surrounded him. The BJP says it will be 75 paar. I agree with them. The rates of onion, tomato, petrol, all have touched 75 paar, he said, while others nodded in agreement.First Published: Oct 19, 2019 20:08 IST"

The farmers who brought their yield to Pathikonda, Aspari and Aluru wholesale markets, have dumped their produce on the roads as the price is highly unremunerative and they would not get even the transportation costs. Cattle are feasting on the dumped tomato produce at market yards. Some farmers have stopped engaging workers to pluck tomatoes as paying their wages has become burdensome for them due to slump in prices.It is alleged that commission agents are exploiting the farmers, dashing their hopes of reaping good profits due to bumper yield this year. Traders are offering a pittance to the farmers for a kg of tomatoes and commission agents hand in it is amply evident.As their protest from Thursday to Friday afternoon demanding remunerative price has not yielded any result, the hapless farmers dumped their produce on the road cursing the indifference of marketing officials to their plight.B Sayanna, a farmer from Tekmal village in Devanakonda Mandal, said he raised tomato crop in four acres by investing Rs 1.2 lakh. I brought the produce to Pathikonda market by hiring tractors. Here, the traders (middlemen) are offering just Rs 10 per basket (one basket contains 10 kg of tomatoes). I cant get back the investment leave alone profits. How can I repay the loan taken for raising the crop? he rued.K Hulthenna from Chinnahulthi in Pathikonda Mandal said, I cultivated tomato in 10 acres. The crop yield is good this season compared to last year. But the market prices are not satisfactory. We invested Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 per acre, excluding transportation charges.Though the district authorities directed the market yard officials to hold auction of tomatoes inside the yard, the commission agents, who colluded with traders, are not ready for it and exerting pressure on farmers to negotiate the price outside the yard premises, which resulted in steep fall in the prices.Assistant Director of Horticulture Raghunatha Reddy said the tomato prices are not satisfactory only at Pathikonda market where a basket is being sold at Rs 30. Tomatoes are priced at Rs 350 a basket at Billekal and Rs 300 at Pyapili.This is the start of the season and there should be good demand for tomatoes. Farmers cultivated tomato crop in nearly 5,000 hectares in the district. The peak season for tomatoes is November and December. The market prices of tomatoes will certainly go up in the coming days, he added.BJP Pathikonda incharge E Ranga Goud said, This is not the first time that tomato farmers are incurring losses due to lack of remunerative prices. It has become an annual ritual. Despite many agitations, the government has turned a blind eye to the issue. It is not taking any measures for market intervention to stabilise the prices of tomato and onion when they are on the downward trend, to rescue farmers.Farmers in precarious situationIf tomato crop is not cultivated, the prices will skyrocket, if cultivated, the prices will slumpTomato crop requires an investment of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 per acreTomato is 10 month long crop.The first four harvests get good price of Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg in wholesale marketThe prices start declining from fifth to eighth harvests of the cropThe arrival of crop in large quantities results in slump in pricesSetting up of tomato processing units will be helpful to farmers, which will ensure support price to farmers as the vegetable is highly perishableTomatoes are exported to Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra from Chittoor, Kadapa and Kurnool districts"

Most women make the mistake of using too many products on the skin when only one can do the job.

Weather changes, periods, certain types of food and stress can contribute to skin breakouts.This works wonders and also, lets admit it, its the easiest one. There are some fruits which are more beneficial for your skin than others. The best fruits that let your skin feel alive and fresh are watermelon, bananas, strawberries and tomatoes.Experts believe this is one of the most important tips for brides-to-be.

Borrowing heavily from the cooking styles of China, Tibet and, of course, India, it manages to hold its own, thanks to its earthy taste.Chef Anil Bangwal of YetiThe Himalayan Kitchen in Connaught Place in Delhi, says, Nepali cuisine is not about finesse or subtle flavours. The food traces its roots to the villages where people believe in using fresh ingredients and tempering the food with chillies.While it does share similarities with Indian cuisinelike the ingredients we usethere are a lot more differences. Indian cuisine depends on ground spices and khada garam masala, while Nepali food is flavoured with everything fresh.Set against the backdrop of the Himalayas, Nepal boasts an array of ethnicities. This diversity is reflected in the countrys cuisine. Also, the fact that the country only opened up its borders in the 1950s, adds to the focus on locally grown produce.Mustard oil is the chosen medium of cooking and curd is the most common accompaniment, which finds its way into drinks (lassi) as well as desserts (sikarni). Other common ingredients that people of this countryespecially the Newar communityuse, are lentils, potato, tomato, coriander, chilli, peppers, and garlic. In fact, daal-bhaat-tarkari is a perhaps the most common meal in Nepal, as chapatis do not find favour here.Considered a healthier counterpart to its rich Indian cousinfresh herbs, watery soup-like gravies, and chopped taste enhancers such as coriander, garlic and chillies, rather than ground pastesNepali cuisine relies on the simple methods to achieve outstanding flavours.Momos or their sweetened versionyomarisare another staple here and can be found with various fillings. Raw noodles or wai wai are a popular snack and can be spiced as per taste. Perhaps two extremes and at the same time very important items in a daily meal in Nepal arepotato and buffalo meat.One can be expected to have quite a bit of either or both during a typical week-long stay in this Himalayan country.Though not yet hugely popular in Delhiwhere foodies tend to go for their trademark butter chicken or biryani and kebabsNepali food is slowly gaining ground. Yeti co-partner Goumtesh Singh is doing his bestand successfully tooto win over patrons. He says, The response is overwhelming. Since the palate is so close to the food that we eat at home, the dining experience is more enjoyable.While momos and daal-bhaat may be common in the Indian kitchen too, other Nepali must-haves offer an adventurous journey for the palate. For those with a sweet tooth, try the sel roti, Nepals version of the doughnut, though not as sweet.Also, this tiny country loves its greens, from fresh spinach to fermented leafy greens known as gundruk, which is common accompaniment with meals, on the lines of the Indian aam ka achaar. Your Nepali food journey would be incomplete without the dhidoa cross between porridge and halwa. A savoury dish made of maize and buckwheat, it is often eaten as a main course. So if you thought there was no novelty in trying Nepali food because it was as good as Indian, maybe its time you headed to that charming eatery serving Nepali cuisine in your city."

He also directed the officials to purchase the farmers produce if the traders are not ready to buy it. Accordingly, district officials offered a minimum support price of Rs 6 per kg, depending on the quality of tomatoes. The best quality tomatoes were sold at Rs 19 per kg. Officials said nearly 100 metric tonnes of tomatoes, including Fridays stock, were completely sold out at the market on Saturday.According to official sources, the Chief Minister also told officials of Kurnool district to visit the market yard and interact with the farmers to know their problems. The government has de-regulated fruits and vegetables so that the farmers can sell them without paying market fee and agent commission.Earlier in the day, agents tried to buy tomatoes outside the market to foil the steps taken by the authorities. However, the farmers refused their proposal. Pathikonda Market Yard authorities kept a close tab on tomato sale at the market. The police were also given orders to file FIRs against the agents who are harassing farmers. The new measures taken by the government has forced the agents to purchase tomatoes at the market yard itself.Agriculture marketing regional joint director Sudhakar said the prices ranged between Rs 6 and Rs 19 a kg of tomatoes, according to quality. He also visited the market yard and monitored the tomato trading.Later, Sudhakar told the media that about 100 metric tonnes of tomatoes were sold at the market on the day. The State government purchased eight tonnes of tomatoes from the farmers with the price stabilisation funds.Meanwhile, the joint director blamed the four buyers in the town for the whole mess. Unlike other markets such as Madanapalle, where there are more buyers, Pathikonda market has been monopolised by these four buyers, he added. The police filed FIRs against the four buyers for breach of trust as they refused to buy tomatoes from the market.Meanwhile, former deputy chief minister KE Krishna Murthy, TDP Pathikonda in-charge KE Shyam Babu, BJP leader E Ranga Gowda and Congress leader B Kranti Naidu visited the yard and interacted with farmers. Krishna Murthy alleged that the YSRC government has failed to solve the farmers problems. He urged the government to fix Rs 10 a kg as minimum support price for tomatoes."

2019-10-20,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/discover-flavours-of-northeast-in-lanes-of-humayunpur/article29747917.ece,Discover flavours of Northeast in lanes of Humayunpur,"Tucked away in a corner of Safdarjung Enclave, opposite the Deer Park, is Humayunpur, a Jat-dominated urban village with a rather nonchalant look. Motorcyclists try to honk their way out of a maze of narrow lanes covered with tangled web of overhead wires and lines of clothes hanging out to dry. To truly experience Humayunpur, one has to get lost in the maze and discover what it has to offer.Tattoo studios, boutiques, grocery stores and small restaurants occupy the ground floor of the homes and rock and blues and jazz tunes stream out of them onto the road.Food for thoughtKorean, Burmese, Chinese, Manipuri, Assamese, Tibetan, Nepalese and a host of other delicacies are served at the restaurants and have over a short period of time attracted foodies from across Delhi looking for a unique dining experience. It is a space where the culture of the original landowners, the Jats, intermingles with the culture of people from the north-eastern States who have over the years become their tenants and have made Humayunpur their home.Nobody comes here for the dcor of the restaurants or to click Insta-worthy photos of the streets. They come here for a food experience as it offers a unique variety like no other place in the city, says Rouhid Ali, who runs a Burmese restaurant in the area. Many people from south Delhi travel all the way to north Delhi to taste something different, like Korean and Tibetan food, at Majnu Ka Tila. But at Humayunpur, they do not have to travel so far to try the authentic flavours of Himalayan cuisines or those from the north-eastern States. Here, most of the people running restaurants are like home cooks and serve food like it would be served in their own home. I think this is what sets Humayunpur apart, says Ali.Authentic tasteAli specialises in Mohinga, a dish he learnt to cook from his grandmother who was a Burmese. I honed my skills while working at a Burmese restaurant. Several people come here looking for dishes like khow suey, but what I serve here is what people back in Burma eat on a regular basis, says Ali. He hopes that more visitors would start coming to Humayunpur as rents have already started soaring and some established chains that have outlets in areas like Hauz Khas Village are already starting to set up shop here. Advertising has only been through word of mouth as we cannot afford to pay food delivery apps for listings. Perhaps with the coming in of more established chains, more people will discover the unique food that is available here.But food is not all that Humayunpur has to offer. Reinii, from Manipur says he came to Delhi as a student to prepare for the IAS entrance examination and after exhausting all his attempts at clearing the competition, he is now placing his bets on a clothes boutique that he has opened. I started my shop two months ago so I cant say yet whether business is good or bad, but I started it with the hope that the market will attract a young, trendy clientele. So far, a lot of foreigners and students have come to shop here. Most people who come to eat at the restaurants drop in to look at our sneaker collection or western clothes that are different from what you get at the malls and are cheaper as well, says Reinii. There are several like Reinii who have seen how other urban villages like Shahpur Jat and Hauz Khas Village transformed overnight into trendy markets and are hopeful that Humayunpur too will see a boom.Unique spicesAlso popular at the market are grocery stores stocked with pickles, spices, dried fish and fresh vegetables flown in from several parts of the Northeast. Sam Kadoyee, who runs one such grocery store, says that people from across Delhi come to source unique vegetables, spices and the famous raja mirchi from his store. A glance at the fresh produce section shows that most of the vegetables are not available at regular grocery stores in the city and are essential to bring out the flavours in Manipuri and Naga cuisines. We fly in tree tomatoes that are a sour version of regular tomatoes, schezwan peppers, michinga patta, peruk, chillies and an assortment of mushrooms, among other ingredients, that are not found in Delhi and it is not only people from the Northeast looking to cook home-styled food in their kitchens but also many chefs from big hotels and expats from Korea who shop here to add authenticity to their dishes, says Sam. He adds that he has been in the business for eight years and over the past year, many people from various parts of the city have started coming to the market to eat and after sampling the food, they walk into his store and pick up the condiments and spices to take home.Apart from the restaurants, boutiques and stores hidden in the alleys, a striking feature about Humayunpur is how the owners of thr property have embraced the people and culture of the Northeast. Playing cards while taking puffs from a hookah, a group of Jat men sit outside a Korean restaurant in the afternoon.Cultural harmonyWhile some of them say they do not work as they live off the rent, others are sceptical about the influx of tourists visiting their village. We hope more tourists come here, it will be good for us as we will get more rent. Earlier, people from the Northeast earlier used to come as students and go, but nowadays, many of them are staying back and starting their business. Rents are cheap and the ground floor of the buildings are being used for commercial activities, says Sushant, who is a lawyer and a resident of Humayunpur. On how two diverse cultures coexist in one place, Sushant says: I am 26 years old and from when I can remember, people from the Northeast have been living here. It is nothing new and we have grown up living together. When people visit, they find it different from other colonies in Delhi. But for us it is very normal and we are accustomed to the way they dress, their food and culture. Nobody who has grown up in Humayunpur would use racial slurs or harass the women. It is a very safe space and we gel well together.Only time will tell if Humayunpur becomes one of Delhis fad markets, but property owners and the entrepreneurial spirit of those trying to run small businesses make it a unique nook in south Delhi for people from the north-eastern States and opens a window into their food and culture for Delhiites to enjoy."

He went on to become chef de partie at various prestigious restaurants with well-known names such as M Menagier (Le Moulin du Maine Brun), George Paccard, Roger Pierre (Hotel du Palais), M Villier (Restaurant La Palm dOr, Hotel Martinez, Cannes), Francis Chaveau (LAmandier) and the Majestic.In 2004, he won Best Chef of France (Meilleur Ouvrier de France). He then started the Michelin Star restaurant Le Pergolse in Paris. He reminisces about the time when he decided to start his own restaurant. It was a Sunday afternoon. I was having lunch in Lyon, with my mentor Pierre Osin, and he told me there is a restaurant in Paris, would you be interested in buying it? I had two goals: one was to start my own restaurant and the other was to get the Best Chef recognition. I went to Paris and bought the restaurant. Within a year of starting it, I got my first Michelin star in 2004.He discovered his love for cooking when he was just 11. Both my parents are doctors. It was my grandmother who instilled a passion for cooking in me. We would stay on a farm and source all the produce from there and cook.Working in Dodin Bouffant was a turning point in Stephanes career. The chef there was very good. Dodin Bouffant would be the restaurant where Stephane resembles a western classical composer with his shock of white hair, aquiline nose, dark black brows and a charming smile. On further probing, he says, he is inspired by art and music and excitedly shows photos of his house that is filled with art work. I named my restaurant after the Italian composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. He used to stay in the same street in Lyon, where my restaurant is. I love to go to museums and meet artists. My apartment is full of art work, one of my favourite artists is Vincent Van Gogh. He, in fact, describes the cuisine at Le Pergolse as art dcor. The food has lots of flavour, good presentation, not too modern. The restaurant is known for its sardines preparation and fruit souffls.But in these MasterChef days, what is more important  taste or presentation? In Lyon, a famous French singer who is blind told me he loves my food because he can recognise it. He could not see the food, but loved the flavours, consistency and could identify every single flavour.My focus is on the taste, though presentation is important, but flavour is foremost. The taste should confirm the look. I also believe that any food that looks good will taste good too.The chef adds he prefers using products sourced from the farmer rather than synthetic food.  In Europe we do not have spices. French cuisine is always mild in taste, we add herbs like tarragon, dill and sometimes coriander, but there are no spices. So the taste of the chicken is important, what it is fed, how it is bred. We focus on the ripeness of tomatoes. We dont over flavour it with spices. Every region has its own gastronomy. The south-west is known for a type of bean stew, the Alsace region for sauerkraut. Lyon is known for their pork and chicken.They put more cream in their food. The wine is also excellent."

I dont know if it is psychological but in my mind, Paris is the worlds most expensive city. Everything costs a lot. The taxis can be even more expensive than Londons and they are harder to find. Good restaurants can cost a fortune. The labour laws make it expensive to run a high-quality establishment so, despite sky-high prices, most three-star restaurants dont make much money ---- they are relieved if they can break even.I wondered, as I sat down to write this, if Paris hotels are really as expensive as I imagined. So, I did an internet search for rates on Monday 21 October. The Bristol, one of nicest hotels in Paris, offered its cheapest room at Rs 1.07 lakh. The Royal Monceau (with rooms designed by Philippe Starck) started at Rs. 88,000 and went up. In contrast, The Ritz in London offered rooms at Rs. 49,000 per night while the Paris Ritz (different owners and a marginally grander property) sold its cheapest room at Rs 87,000. Even within the big chains, there were variations. The Park Hyatt in Paris was at least 10 per cent more expensive than New Yorks much grander Park Hyatt, the groups flagship property.There are cheaper hotels, of course. The four-star Hilton Opera will cost Rs. 25,358. The Westin will set you back Rs 30,000. But even these are hardly inexpensive. And so, I try and steer clear of Paris and its hotels.As is true of many European cities, rooms can be tiny. When my son was small, I took him to Disneyland Paris. On our way there we stopped overnight at the Meridien Etoile (Rs. 21,000 on Monday ) and the room was so small that there was room for either us or for our suitcases.Its always hard to find a decent room in Paris at a reasonable price. I have stayed in a good-sized room (but not much service) at the four-star Hotel Banke (Rs 30,000) near the big department stores, which is a conversion of an old bank. (Hence the name.)And this time I was intrigued to stay at the one-year-old Hotel Brach, a small but central hotel (just 55 rooms) designed by Philippe Starck. I was not sure what to expect because while Starck made his reputation in the 1980s with New Yorks Royalton, his next hotel for the same company (Morgans run by Ian Schrager) went for a different look.Starck invented the design style of todays modern hip hotels, all dim lighting, dark colours, designer lobbies, bespoke furniture etc. His style has been copied and adapted so often (most famously by Jacques Garcia at Pariss Hotel Costes) that it is hard to tell whether a hotel has been designed by Starck or an imitator.Post-New York, Starck has changed track. The Royal Monceau (run by Raffles) in Paris is as idiosyncratic a design as, say, the Royalton (there are acoustic guitars in the suites!) but it is much cheerier. So when I heard that Starck had designed Brach, as a small intimate space at lower room rates than his usual properties, I was intrigued. (Brach costs Rs 30,000 or so. The Royal Monceau is around Rs 80-85,000.)As it turned out, I was hugely impressed, both by the hotel and by Starcks new aesthetic. Black is out. Bright is in. The rooms have lots of light, both from the sun (during the day) and from the numerous fittings. The furniture is comfortable and there are no awkward elements: no light switches you cant find, no fiddly shower settings, etc.I liked the little touches. The minibars were full, not just with the usual drinks but with small bottles of pre-mixed cocktails and loads of food from protein bars to unusual crisps to chocolates. Near the top of each wall was a rack packed out with pictures, art objects etc.It was a significant departure from the style that made Starck famous and I imagine it will also be as widely copied as the original.I liked the public spaces too. The restaurant was always full of Paris trendies but it had a relaxed, unhurried air to it with soft furnishings and shelves full of books. The lobby (on the first floor) opened out to a large terrace with armchairs and tables where you could get service. And most spectacular of all was a terrace garden with terrific views of Paris where they also grew vegetables. I saw a chicken coop near the tomato trees so I imagine that they have no difficulty in making a good coq au vin.Most surprising of all was the service: friendly, warm, efficient and gracious. This is not something you associate with hip hotels. If you are in the hospitality business, you should check out Brach. It is at least ten years ahead of anything we have in India.I ate twice at the Brach restaurant (they kept tables for hotel guests though it was always packed). The food comes from a trendy open kitchen, is North African-influenced and can be hit and miss. For instance, it was never clear to me why they destroyed a perfectly good Morrocan-style tenderloin tartare by dousing it in truffle oil. Surely truffle oil is not an essential ingredient in North African cuisine?Because I had time for only two proper meals in Paris, I thought I would go to the oldest and the newest restaurants I could find.The oldest was easy. Bofinger is a 134-year-old brasserie in the Marais district and claims to be the oldest continuously-running brasserie in the world. It has three different areas including the main room with a magnificent dome and though it is huge, it seems to be always full.Most foodie destinations in Paris are full of camera-phone wielding Chinese and other tourists but because Bofinger is outside the centre (in the Marais district), few foreign tourists venture there, despite its fame. At least  of the guests were French and some seemed to be regulars. (Its not family-run or anything, though. Since 1996, Bofinger has been owned by Jean-Paul Bucher who has also bought La Coupole and many other historic Paris restaurants.)Bofinger has some specialities. Regulars order the onion soup and so did I. But I found it kind of pheeka and a huge cheese-heavy crouton unbalanced the soup. The Alsatian choucroute is famous. The dish consists of sausages and other kinds of pork products on a bed of cabbage and the Bofinger version is pretty much a classic. My dessert, another brasserie standby, the Floating Island, was also made in the classic style to a very high standard.Bofinger is a Paris experience. But going once is enough.The newest significant restaurant in Paris was harder to find. Yannick Alleno is one of Frances most celebrated chefs. He has had three stars since 2007 when he was at the Hotel Meurice. In 2014, he took over Ledoyen, a famous Paris institution in the gardens off the Champs-lyses and Michelin gave him three stars again. In 2018, he opened a small sushi counter in the Ledoyen building and within six months, that got a Michelin star too.On October 7, he opened Pavyllon, a counter-seating restaurant in the same Ledoyen building. When French chefs have experimented with counter-seating (as many of them did after Joel Robuchon opened his first LAtelier), they have generally treated the counter outlets as places for simple food. (Though LAtelier in Hong Kong mysteriously has three stars: the one time I went there, it was one-star food at best.)Allenos place is more ambitious. He uses the chefs from his main restaurants and the service staff are told to conform to the standards of the main Ledoyen. Prices can be low (the cheap lunch is under 100 euro) or they can be high (a sprinkling of white-truffles on your cheese souffl can cost 94 euro); it is really up to you.I had no idea that the restaurant was opening when I asked my friend Bruce Palling, the British-Australian food and travel expert, to recommend a place for lunch in Paris. Bruce suggested Ledoyen and connected me to Allenos assistant. She wrote back to say that though the main restaurant was not open for lunch on the one day when I was free, they were about to open Pavyllon. Would I like to eat there instead?I said yes and so, a week after the restaurant opened and before the reviews had appeared, I found myself at the counter. There had been little publicity, only word of mouth and the other guests were largely French people who were regulars at Ledoyen.From the very beginning, the service was clearly patterned on the main three-star restaurant. I had a glass of champagne as an aperitif and the sommelier came to the table with a bowl of small kalamata olives and an empty plate. He had found, he said, that this champagne (Pierre Peters, Blanc de Blancs) went well with Parmigiano and olives. He then brought over a huge block of cheese and, with a sharp knife, scraped layers of Parmigiano on to the plate. (Yes, it was a perfect combination.)I ordered one of the set menus (in France, this is usually better value than a la carte) with the wine pairing. The sommelier re-appeared and said that there was no set pairing. He spoke to each guest and then chose the wines. What kind of wine did I like? I explained that when I talk to sommeliers at his level, I dont waste time showing off and discussing my taste in wines. I always put myself in the sommeliers hands and ask him to surprise me with wines I dont know.He did just that and served several unfamiliar wines (a sweet wine from Cyprus, a dry wine from the Tokai region of Hungary which is better known for sweet wine, a wine made in tiny quantities by Chapoutier in the Rhone valley for Alleno etc.) all of which he discussed in detail.The food was outstanding. Intensely flavoured pigeon, fresh mullet, a delicate salmon tart, a warm Comte cheese souffl with cubes of foie gras, a brilliant pistachio dessert and more. Throughout the meal, they kept up a steady stream of vegetable tempura (made with different kinds of mushroom, artichokes etc.) that were crisp and delicious.Later, at the end of the meal, when I chatted with Alleno, he said he was pleased with the tempura idea (his own, I presume) because it was important to have vegetables in the meal but he did not want to do them as side dishes. As for the food, well, he had tried to simplify his cuisine, but...I loved the experience. In any case, I love sitting at a counter in front of an open kitchen. I liked it when Allenos chefs came up and explained each dish. (Though many of them did not speak English so the French guests were at an advantage.)Will the food remain this good? At present, it is better than one star and near two stars in quality. But this is the opening team. Alleno was there himself. The chef from the Japanese restaurant was at the pass and so was one of Allenos most senior chefs who had formerly run his Dubai restaurant. The desserts were overseen by the groups Corporate Pastry Chef. The real test will come when the big guns move on.But one star is assured in the next Michelin. And as the food stabilises, another should follow.Its a breakthrough for counter dining in France.To read more on The Taste With Vir, click hereFollow more stories on Facebook and TwitterFirst Published: Oct 22, 2019 10:50 IST"

The traditional dishes of this cuisine vary from region to region because of the influence of several cultures. From Greek to Middle Eastern and the Balkans to Ottoman, the combination of flavours and ingredients are blended together to form dishes that can be enjoyed by all, especially the vegans. This is the only reason that the Turkish cuisine is fast making its name on the worldwide culinary platform.An important aspect of Turkish cuisine is whether a dish has meat in it or not. When a dish is cooked without any meat then its called zeytin yal which means cooked with olive oil, and are mostly served cold.The highlights of Turkish vegetarian and vegan cuisine are dolma and sarma, in which just about everything can be stuffed. The cuisine tends to be olive oil-based, giving an extra light flavour to so many delicious fresh veggies.Here are five delicious Turkish vegan dishes that you should surely savour Mucver just means fritters in general, and these are zucchini fritters with feta cheese, onion, and dill. The zucchini is either shredded or finely chopped and then fried in olive oil, typically with a touch of red pepper flakes sprinkled on top to give it just the slightest hint of a kick to it. It can be made with or without egg and depends on your taste. These are the most common and classic type of fritters; however, one can make carrot or potato mucver as well.This dish is inspired by Ottoman cuisine and literally means the imam fainted. The name supposedly comes from an imam, whose wife told him that shed used all the olive oil for just one dish. He fainted first at the cost of this one dish, and then after trying it imam fainted again at how delicious it was! It is essentially a large flat eggplant stuffed with all kinds of yummy goodies and drenched in olive oil. The stuffing is an onion and garlic with tomatoes and herbs and spices.Mercimek Kofte, or lentil balls, are traditional kofte prepared using cooked red lentils and bulgur, and then shaped into balls and then stuffed with herbs and spices. Different recipes call for rice, onions, currants, and pine nuts, and its often eaten around a piece of lettuce, cabbage, or vine leaves. Veggies can be thrown in as well, like peppers, zucchini, tomatoes or eggplants. But traditionally, its just a load of herbs and spices with possibly some tomato and pepper paste for a real burst of flavour with every bite.Its a bulgur-based salad made with tomato paste, finely diced tomatoes, parsley, and garlic, and looks very similar to Tabbouleh salad. Dry onions or spring onions are both fairly common, and so are cucumbers chopped as finely as the tomatoes. Lemon and olive oil are usually used as dressings, though many regions use pomegranate syrup (nar eksisi). Its served often for celebratory occasions and always with a cup of Turkish tea as well.Vine leaves are usually stuffed using rice, onions, currants and pine nuts along with veggies. As rolling out the stuffed vine leaves can be difficult, its often a rite of passage for children or a bonding experience as all the family gets together and stuffs their food together before devouring the delicious food.These are amongst the most common dishes and an excellent source of protein for vegans looking around for something new to try!(With inputs from ANI)"

Parents need to decide whether they want technology to be a babysitter, or an enabler in their childrens education.Harmful blue lightDr Sharat Babu Chilukuri, chief medical director and MD of Sharat Maxivision Eye Hospitals, says: Wi-Fi emits electromagnetic waves that can affect the development of brain among children. Blue light emissions from LCD screens affect the eyes. If they sit near a TV, children are exposed to both the Wi-Fi and blue light. The ideal solution is to completely ban screens for children. When they keep looking at an object placed close to their eyes, they are prone to myopia.If the children are already wearing glasses, constant screen time can increase the power of the spectacles very fast. So, it is advisable to wear UV-protection glasses while watching these channels. However, nowadays, children have to constantly interact with their phones because teachers and schools are communicating increasingly through them. Perhaps, the change has to start from there.kakoli_mukherjee@newindianexpress.com @KakoliMukherje2"

Parents need to decide whether they want technology to be a babysitter, or an enabler in their childrens education.Harmful blue lightDr Sharat Babu Chilukuri, chief medical director and MD of Sharat Maxivision Eye Hospitals, says: Wi-Fi emits electromagnetic waves that can affect the development of brain among children. Blue light emissions from LCD screens affect the eyes. If they sit near a TV, children are exposed to both the Wi-Fi and blue light. The ideal solution is to completely ban screens for children. When they keep looking at an object placed close to their eyes, they are prone to myopia.If the children are already wearing glasses, constant screen time can increase the power of the spectacles very fast. So, it is advisable to wear UV-protection glasses while watching these channels. However, nowadays, children have to constantly interact with their phones because teachers and schools are communicating increasingly through them. Perhaps, the change has to start from there.kakoli_mukherjee@newindianexpress.com @KakoliMukherje2"
2019-10-23,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/interview-about-chittoor-cuisine-with-home-chef-rajeshwarisivaprasad-puthalapattu/article29775594.ece,Let’s chat about Chittoor cuisine with home chef Rajeshwarisivaprasad Puthalapattu,"Those who keep up with television cooking programmes will know Rajeshwarisivaprasad Puthalapattu, her soft-spoken manner and tempting dishes; so it was only right that the micro-cuisine shes best known for is brought to the plates of the city at Rayalaseema Ruchulu.Rajeshwaris family has been celebrating Chittoor cuisine for many generations now and she explains its a necessity to keep the traditions going. If we keep celebrating Italian or Chinese food, why not the cuisines of the different regions just as much? the 39-year-old points out. Shes been very vocal about the domination of unhealthy milkshakes and popcorn taking over many snacking routines.Ask her whats so different about the Chittoor culinary techniques and she responds, One of the first things is that we dont use a lot of spice... nor do we use a lot of oil. In fact, there are some people who prefer non-vegetarian dishes with more oil, but that isnt part of the Chittoor approach. Rajeshwari was so particular about the cooking, that she even brought over her familys blend of ingredients to share with the diners.The Chittoor cuisine dates as far back as 100 years and its uniqueness lies in that there are Tamil influences in the dishes: low amounts of chilli and extremely subtle dashes in coconut. The best part of this type of cooking is theres a feast for both non-vegetarians and vegetarians, alike. There are even idli and dosa components here.Crab curry at Rayalaseema RuchuluSoups are an important part of Chittoors meals; the crab soup comes recommended for its health benefits, says Rajeshwari. We tend to use mud crabs as their shells are especially rich in minerals such as calcium. Crab is also beneficial to heart health for its high volumes of omega-3 fatty acids, and Ive seen a lot of people enjoy the detoxing effect before the main meal starts. Those with a less fishy-palate can opt for the tomato soup, which Rajeshwari has prepped as a rasam.The venchpam pappu is the dal Rajeshwari finalised as she says it captures the spirit of Chittoor and its agriculture the best. There are 15 pappus in the Chittoor cuisine alone, she explains, but it was easy to decide upon the venchpam pappu for its slight bitter aftertaste which is actually pleasant.She recommends the pappu to be mixed with hot white rice and ghee, and enjoyed as is. When you think rice and Rayalaseema, the immediate reference is ragi but Rajeshwari says takalipandu annam (tomato rice) and marval kodi pulao (chicken pulao) are integral to the meal.Marval kodi pulao (chicken pulao, home-style) at Rayalaseema Ruchulu, HyderabadThe sabzis are worth a second helping, purely because we dont see produce such as gorchikkudu (cluster beans) or items such as sundelu (boiled pulses) at a food festival. But authenticity is what Rajeshwari wanted here.For the meat eaters, there are dishes many would rather eat in the privacy of their own homes but Rajeshwari doesnt want diners to shy away: boti nanchu (lamb gizzard), nethili pakodi (fried anchovies) and kaalla pulusu (paya curry).Nethili pakodi (fried anchovies) at Rayalaseema Ruchulu, HyderabadSome like it hotFor those missing the fire in their bellies, Rajeshwari brings out a special karam chutney with ground onions; it packs quite a punch at the smallest pinch but the aftertaste will keep you going. To keep things balanced, the home chef offers nannari sherbath for that cooling effect while encouraging better digestion. In the hot and often arid Rayalaseema region, nannari is favoured.At the end, gulp down some rosemilk, a favourite for those in the Rajahmundry areas.After perusing all these dishes and their verbose names, ask Rajeshwari what her daily meal spread at home is like, and its not too different. I want my family to have meals comprising different flavours and textures, she explains proudly. We are, after all, the ambassadors of this cuisine so it should reflect every day.The Aha! Rayalaseema Food Festival is on till November 10 at Rayalseema Ruchulu in Jubilee Hills. Call 8688686886 for details"
2019-10-23,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/british-police-find-39-bodies-in-a-truck-container/article29776243.ece,British police find 39 bodies in truck container,"British Police found the bodies of 39 people inside a truck at an industrial estate near London on October 23 and said they had arrested the driver on suspicion of murder.The discovery of the bodies  38 adults and one teenager  was made in the early hours after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 30 km east of London.Police said the trailer had arrived at nearby docks having travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the bodies were found just over an hour later.The red cab unit of the truck was believed to have originated in Ireland. It had Ireland emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message The Ultimate Dream. The driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, remained in custody.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the news and was receiving regular updates about the investigation which was focused on human trafficking. We know that this trade is going on - all such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice, he said.All those in the container were pronounced dead at the scene after the emergency services were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park, not far from docks on the River Thames.Police said the trailer had travelled from Belgium to Purfleet and landed shortly after 12.30 a.m. on October 23 (5 a.m. IST). It left the port on the truck at about 1.05 a.m. and ambulance services notified police about the discovery of the bodies at 1.40 a.m.Originally it was thought both parts of the vehicle had entered Britain at Holyhead in North Wales on October 19 and to have originally started its journey in Bulgaria.The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said while the vehicle was registered in Bulgaria by a company owned by an Irish woman on June 19, 2017, it had left the next day and never returned. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said his country had no other connection with the deaths.Desperate and dangerous situationPrime Minister Leo Varadkar said Irish authorities would carry out any investigations necessary if it was established that the truck had passed through Ireland.Police officers in forensic suits spent the day inspecting the large white container on the truck next to warehouses and had sealed off much of the surrounding area of the industrial site with large green barriers as they carried out their investigation.The truck was later driven away to a secure location at nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered.At this stage, we have not identified where the victims are from or their identities and we anticipate this could be a lengthy process, Essex Police Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters.I appreciate how much attention this incident will continue to attract and the public and media appetite to understand what's happened. We also need to understand what has happened, she added.For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in the back of trucks, often seeking to reach the United Kingdom from the European mainland.Separately on October 23, police in the neighbouring county of Kent found nine people alive in a truck on the M20 motorway, heading towards London, Sky News reported.In Britains biggest illegal immigrant tragedy in 2000, customs officials found the bodies of 58 Chinese people crammed into a tomato truck at the southern port of Dover. It had begun its journey in Zeebrugge.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Opposition Labour Party, said the latest deaths were an unbelievable human tragedy that needed answers.Can we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container, he said."

Hybrids have a longer shelf life and are of better quality.It was informed in the meeting that transportation of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh was not feasible. Tomato prices have shot up to Rs 60-80 per kg in the national capital and some other parts of the country due to rains in key growing state of Maharashtra.In case of pulses, the official said cooperative Nafed has been asked to provide milled-tur dal at Rs 82 per kg to the Delhi government.Besides, tur dal will be sold at Rs 80-85 per kg at 'no-profit no-loss' basis through Safal, Kendriya Bhandar and NCCF outlets in the national capital region, the official said.These agencies will sell the buffer stock of pulses created by the government.

Garlic prices have also hit the roof with the retail price at Rs 260 per kg as against the earlier Rs 120.Pune and its neighbouring areas have been getting sharp rain spells of varying duration over the past many days this month. The city received an intense three-hour downpour in the early hours of Tuesday, with Lohegaon recording the highest 56.4mm rain, and another bout of showers in the evening. Roads were waterlogged, bus breakdowns were frequent and water gushed into housing societies in different parts of the city.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association, told TOI that half the leafy greens entering the market are in the rotting stages because of the continuous rainfall. Cluster beans, lima beans, peas and brinjals too are short in supply due to the rain during the harvest period. Vegetables rot if it rains for two or three days during harvests. In some places, farmers cannot even enter their fields due to waterlogging, he said.An APMC official confirmed that the rise in prices was due to the intense October rains. The state assembly elections on Monday also resulted in a dip in supplies with just 1,000 vegetable trucks coming to the APMC market on Tuesday. The market is getting 200-300 fewer trucks per day for a week. The quality of vegetables is also poor and the prices of vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, coriander and fenugreek have increased, he said.Subodh Zende, a vegetable wholesaler in Market Yard, said the wholesale prices of vegetables such as cabbage , carrot, tomato, bottle gourd and brinjal had risen by 30-40%. Vegetables in the fields are rotting due to the rains. Some fields are mucky and waterlogged. Constant exposure to the rains has also caused vegetables to catch fungus, he said.Vitthal Hanamgar, a vegetable vendor on NIBM Road, said leafies such as fenugreek and spinach were retailing for rs 10-15 a bunch just a few days ago. Now, they are selling for Rs 25-30. Coriander particularly has gone up to Rs 60 a bunch from the earlier Rs 15-20, he said.Inderjan Sen, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said, Coriander has registered the highest price rise. This is a hike which has not been noticed in a year now. Last year, during the same period, coriander had touched gone up to Rs 40 a bunch at best.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, said the constant flooding in the farms has caused spoilage and drop in supply by 50% in major markets. Leafy vegetables like coriander, fenugreek and spinach are rotting within a day in the fields, he said."

This has been done in London by the High Commission.The immediate trigger for this diplomatic note has been the protests by pro-Pakistan groups over Kashmir outside the Indian High Commission on August 15 and then again on September 3. The one on Indias Independence Day was meant to disrupt celebrations in the High Commission. The matter was taken up at the highest level during a phone conversation on August 20 between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson.The information released from the Indian side said that Modi referred to the violence and vandalism perpetrated by a large mob against the High Commission of India in London. It also said that Johnson had expressed regret over the incident and assured that all necessary steps would be taken to ensure the safety and security of the High Commission and its personnel and visitors.However, a subsequent protest in September had turned uglier. Not only did the protestors manage to reach very close to the High Commission premises, they also threw tomatoes and eggs and broke a window pane.London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the attack when the Indian High Commission in the UK tweeted about it. However, questions were raised about why the police failed to restrain the protestors some distance away from the High Commission.Meanwhile, the matter resonated in the UK Parliament as well on Wednesday with Conservative Party MP from Harrow East, Bob Blackman, questioning Johnson over the steps being taken by the government to prevent violent protests scheduled for Sunday.""This is a police operational matter and the home secretary [Priti Patel] will be raising it with the police,"" Johnson responded. ""We must all be clear in this House that violence and intimidation anywhere is wholly unacceptable in this country.""Blackman has been speaking out in India's favour since the decision to revoke Article 370 and withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir found echoes among Britain's MPs. The north London MP, who is also chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Hindus, has accused the Opposition Labour party of interfering in an internal matter of India.On Wednesday in Parliament, Blackman said, ""In this House, we defend forever the right of peaceful protest. Yet on 15 August, pro-Pakistani organisations held violent protests outside the Indian High Commission. This Sunday, there is the threat of 10,000 people being brought to demonstrate outside the Indian High Commission on Diwali, the most holy day for Hindus, Sikhs and Jains. What action is the government going to take to prevent violent protests this Sunday?""Blackman has also written to Mayor Khan urging him to take steps to ensure the so-called ""Free Kashmir"" march on Sunday does not proceed.""I am receiving vast amounts of correspondence from multiple diasporas highlighting concerns which stem from community safety perspectives plus the obviously confrontational date selected: the holy festival of Diwali,"" Blackman said in his letter.Last week, Khan had issued a statement condemning the march and called on the groups to reconsider, while highlighting that the power to ban marches of this nature lies solely with the UK Home Secretary and not with the mayoral office.""This march will only deepen divisions at a time when Londoners need to come together. That is why I am calling on those organising the march and all those considering taking part in it to think again and cancel their plans,"" he said, stressing his City Hall office would be working with Scotland Yard to ensure a ""robust"" policing plan was in place for such a march.According to Metropolitan Police details on the permissions sought for the proposed march, an estimated 5,000-10,000 protesters plan to commence their march from Richmond Terrace near Downing Street and converge outside the Indian High Commission in London.""This march finishes at the diplomatic mission  the very building which saw prolonged bouts of violence and thuggery in the summer  and sadly the building remains scarred from when windows were smashed, objects repeatedly thrown and other ugly scenes,"" noted Blackman in his letter to Khan in reference to the violent clashes on August 15.""After the horrific scenes in August the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist diasporas are worried that authorities in the United Kingdom are not doing enough to protect them,"" he added.The ""Free Kashmir"" rally is being promoted across social media channels as an annual ""Black Day"" event to mark October 27, 1947, as the day when Indian troops allegedly entered the then princely kingdom of Kashmir. The ""President"" of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, Sardar Masood Khan, and PoK ""Prime Minister"" Raja Muhammad Farooq Haider Khan are expected to participate in the march on Sunday.(With inputs from PTI)Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-10-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-vegetable-prices-skyrocket-as-rain-plays-havoc-with-harvest-6083022/,Pune: Vegetable prices skyrocket as rain plays havoc with harvest,"The prices of vegetables in citys retail markets have shot up as large tracts of vegetable crop have been destroyed by heavy rain in the last two days.AdvertisingEven a common vegetable like brinjal is retailing at Rs 100 per kg while herbs like methi and coriander are retailing at Rs 30-40 per bunch.Heavy rain has lashed the vegetable-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Satara and Sangli over the last 48 hours.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, said, The crop was ready for harvest but the rain has led to complete destruction.AdvertisingThe crops most hit by the heavy rain are brinjal, okra and beans, among others.Yields are very low most farmers are not able to get to their fields to pick their crop, said Gadhave.He said the current price rise may continue for the next fortnight. After that, the second picking of the crop will start and that will bring prices down, he said.The arrival of vegetables at Punes wholesale market has also dipped considerably. On Monday, the market had reported arrival of 220 quintal of cluster beans, 1,619 quintal of tomatoes, 120 quintal of green peas and 464 quintal of cucumber.The amount of arrivals is much lower than what it was a month ago, when Punes wholesale market saw the arrival of 370 quintal of cluster beans, 1,961 quintal of tomatoes, 125 quintal of green peas and 562 quintal of cucumber on September 21.The arrival of vegetables to local markets from Karnataka has also dropped quite a bit, as heavy rain has hit harvest even in the neighbouring state."
2019-10-24,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/39-container-truck-death-victims-in-uk-were-all-from-china/article29787437.ece,39 container truck death victims in U.K. were all from China,"All 39 people found dead in a container truck near an English port were Chinese citizens, British police confirmed on Thursday, October 24, as they pressed to investigate one of the countrys deadliest cases of people smuggling.The Essex Police force said 31 men and eight women were found dead in the truck early on October 23 at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, a town 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London. The force says one victim previously thought to be a teenager was instead a young adult woman.The 25-year-old truck driver, who is from Northern Ireland, is being questioned on suspicion of attempted murder but has not been charged. Police in Northern Ireland have searched three properties as they sought to piece together the journey of the truck and the victims.The Chinese Foreign Ministry posted a statement on its social media account saying that Chinese embassy employees in the U.K. were driving to the scene of the crime to aid the investigation.Britain remains an attractive destination for immigrants, even as the U.K. is negotiating its divorce from the European Union. Upon hearing of the deaths, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed in Parliament on October 23 that people smugglers would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.The tragedy recalls the deaths of 58 people in 2000 in a truck in Dover, England, who had undertaken a perilous, months-long journey from Chinas southern Fujian province and were discovered stowed away with a cargo of tomatoes after a ferry ride from Zeebrugge, the same Belgian port used in the latest tragedy.In February 2004, 21 Chinese migrants also from Fujian who were working as cockle-pickers drownedwhen they were caught out by treacherous tides in Morecambe Bay in northwest England.Groups of migrants have repeatedly landed on English shores using small boats for the risky Channel crossing, and migrants are sometimes found in the trunks of cars that disembark from the massive ferries that link France and England.But the macabre find in an industrial park on October 23 was a reminder that criminal gangs are still profiting from large-scale trafficking.The truck and the trailer with the people inside apparently took separate journeys before ending up at the industrial park. British police said they believe the container went from the port of Zeebrugge to Purfleet, England, where it arrived early on October 23.U.K. authorities have warned for several years that people smugglers are turning to Dutch and Belgian ports because of increased security on the busiest trade route between Calais in France and Dover in England.Britains National Crime Agency warned in 2016 that people smuggling using containers on ferries was the highest-priority organized immigration crime threat. The same year, the U.K. Border Force identified Zeebrugge and the Hook of Holland in the Netherlands as key launching points for people trafficking into Britain."

Now this is not the first time Ive been to Rajasthan; in fact Ive hit that trail several times before. Ive been to Rajasthan in the bitter cold of a Jaisalmer winter and in the oppressive heat of a Jodhpur summer. To the serenity of the lakes in Udaipur and to the unyielding fervour of Ajmer Sharif.And most often I have feasted on fine food and great meals. How can I forget Dargah Bazaar and the streets of Ajmer, the sounds, smells and flavours of the food outside the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the langar with freshly made biryani and sweet rice. The qorma and nihari with warm roti. Kachodi with kadhi, jalebi and warm milk, and Ajmers ever-so-famous Sohan Halwa.Ive also sampled the rare and illustrious Karan cuisine in Udaipur. The preserve of the Bedla clan of Mewar, recipes go back two centuries. The Smoked Baingan Bharta, Chaas, Pulaos and Kheema. Even smoked arhar dal cooked in milk and their iconic Banjara Mans, cooked nomad style with just salt and a few spices. But thats it.Otherwise its all just Laal Maas, Ker Sangri, Gatte ki Sabzi and Dal Baati Churma. Whether you are in Jodhpur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer or Jaipur, thats all you will be served under the baldachin of Rajasthani cuisine. Any hotel you go to, any chef you meet, and its once again Laal Maas, Ker Sangri, Gatte ki Sabzi and Dal Baati Churma.Till I walked up to a community table last week at the Fairmont Jaipur and met chef Prasad Metrani. I was in the Pink City to attend the third season of the Gourmet Getaway food festival, organised by the intrepid, flamboyant and stately restaurateur Dushyant Singh. There was array of foods from all over India. Bhatte di Murg and Punjabi Egg Curry Dhaba Style from Amritsar. Rogan Josh and slightly sour curd-marinated Mutton Shyaam from the kitchens of the Kashmiri Pundits.There was a spread from the surprising Kumaoni cuisine and bits of Bengali, Italian and Thai which, along with wines and cocktails, made for a rather fulfilling evening. As part of the festival, chef Metrani cooked up a lunch the next day at the Fairmont.Also on the menu was Silbatte ke Kachche Gosht ke Kabab with Tashtari. Stoneground on a traditional silbatta and smoked and flavored with clove and cardamom, the kababs are coarser than a Galawati and softer than a Shammi. Tashtari is a saffron-flavoured bread cooked in a clay oven. The two go beautifully together.It was a feast of lost dishes. Well researched and studied, a banquet was laid out in their restaurant aptly called Zarine (Persian for Golden). Amid tall pillars and arches, water bodies glistening in the background, we sat at a long table resplendent with brassware. A long silken scroll announced the dishes.The first course: Nargil Shorba. Nargil means coconut and the base of this soup is coconut milk. Its a recipe that they say originated among the tribal people of Gandhara, an ancient region beyond the Hindu Kush. Native to the Middle-East and Central Asia, this shorba made its way to India in the Mughal era. Its a mild simple soup, now flavoured with coriander, green chillies and spices, and can also be cooked with meat. Chef had added vegetable gnocchi and parmesan crisps to it.Served along with this was Tootak, which are balls of semolina and khoya stuffed with a spicy paneer mixture, brushed with saffron-rosewater and baked. Its a Deccani recipe from the kitchens of the Nizams as well as a signature dish of the local Hindu Kayastha community especially served to welcome guests.Next came Kamal Badal, an exotic snack of thinly sliced sundried eggplant, crisply fried lotus stem and spinach with tomato chutney. Created by the Mughals to feed hungry soldiers during their many campaigns. They needed a snack that was nutritious, could be preserved and could also be carried along. This snack could be kept for days and would not change taste, hence was called Kamal Badal.Then came the meat. Silbatte ke Kachche Gosht ke Kabab with Tashtari. Stoneground on a traditional silbatta and smoked and flavored with clove and cardamom, the kababs are coarser than a Galawati and softer than a Shammi. Tashtari is a saffron-flavoured plate-shaped bread cooked in a clay oven. The kababs were silken, gently spiced with a slight bite on the tongue, and beautifully complemented by the Tashtari.And there were more kababs. Katambari Kebab, a lost recipe from the royal kitchens of Maharaja Ala Singh, the first ruler of the princely state of Patiala. This kabab was allegedly invented when chicken breast was cooked in a cylindrical instrument called a phukna. This chicken breast was stuffed with cottage cheese in a sesame seed marinade and finished in a tandoor.For mains there was Raan. Gil-e-Hikamat, Pathiyonki Raan  mutton leg cooked in a clay pot with mutton kheema in a saffron sauce. For those who preferred chicken there was Kibti, from the kitchens of the Maharaja of Patiala. Slow-cooked chick meat with saffron potato fondant, heirloom tomatoes and fenugreek.These dishes were served with hot, steaming Doodh Shabnam Pulao, a lost recipe from Uttarakhand where Basmati is cooked with almond milk, saffron, walnut and morels.The glorious finish was Nazakat ka Meetha, a medley of rare desserts. Puffed rice with a lehsun ki kheer. Pudding made with raw garlic and milk. Jauj ka Halwa made of wheat, milk, sugar and flour. And chikki, the kind made of puffed rice and jaggery during Baisakhi and Lohri in Punjab.This was a meal fit for a royal, and while it wasnt exactly Rajashthani food, it was the best food Id eaten in Rajasthan. And whats more, thankfully all through the meal nobody mentioned Laal Maas, Ker Sangri, Gatte ki Sabzi and Dal Baati Churma.First Published: Oct 25, 2019 20:04 IST"
2019-10-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/probe-expands-in-truck-deaths-all-39-victims-are-from-china-6087215/,"Probe expands in truck deaths, all 39 victims are from China","All 39 people found dead in a refrigerated container truck near an English port were Chinese citizens, British police confirmed Thursday as they investigated one of the countrys deadliest cases of human smuggling.AdvertisingThe Essex Police force said 31 men and eight women were found dead in the truck early Wednesday at an industrial park in Grays, a town 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London.A magistrate gave detectives another 24 hours to question the driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland who has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He has not been charged, and police have not released his name.Police in Northern Ireland searched three properties there as detectives sought to piece together how the trucks cab, its container and the victims came together on such a deadly journey.AdvertisingPippa Mills, deputy chief of Essex Police, said the process of conducting post-mortem examinations and identifying the victims would be lengthy and complex.This is an incredibly sensitive and high-profile investigation, and we are working swiftly to gather as full a picture as possible as to how these people lost their lives, she said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Chinese Embassy employees in the U.K. were driving to the scene of the crime to aid the investigation.Police believe the truck and container took separate journeys before ending up at the industrial park. They say the container traveled by ferry from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge to Purfleet, England, where it arrived early Wednesday and was picked up by the truck driver and driven the few miles to Grays.The truck cab, which is registered in Bulgaria to a company owned by an Irish woman, is believed to have traveled from Northern Ireland to Dublin, where it caught a ferry to Wales, then drove across Britain to pick up the container.Global Trailer Rentals Ltd told Irelands national broadcaster RTE on Thursday that it owns the trailer and that it was leased Oct. 15 in County Monaghan, in Ireland, at a rate of 275 euros ($299) per week. The Dublin-based company said it will make the data from its tracking system available to investigators.The companys directors told RTE it was shell-shocked at the news and that it was it was entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been.Groups of migrants have repeatedly landed on English shores using small boats to make the risky Channel crossing, and migrants are sometimes found in the back of cars and trucks that disembark from the massive ferries that link France and England. But Wednesdays macabre find in an industrial park was a reminder that criminal gangs are still profiting from large-scale trafficking.The tragedy recalls the deaths of 58 Chinese migrants who suffocated in a truck in Dover, England, in 2000 after a perilous, months-long journey from Chinas southern Fujian province. They were found stowed away with a cargo of tomatoes after a ferry ride from Zeebrugge, the same Belgian port that featured in the latest tragedy.In February 2004, 21 Chinese migrants _ also from Fujian _ who were working as cockle-pickers in Britain drowned when they were caught by treacherous tides in Morecambe Bay in northwest England.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed in Parliament on Wednesday that people smugglers would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Britain, with its high demand for tourism, restaurant and agricultural workers, remains a very attractive destination for immigrants from all countries, even as the U.K. is rethinking its immigration rules as it prepares to leave the 28-nation European Union.Nando Sigona, a professor of migration studies at the University of Birmingham, said tougher migration controls born of populist anti-immigrant sentiment across Europe were closing down less dangerous routes to the West, which has encouraged smugglers to take more risks and try out new routes.The fact that all these people came from the same country could hint to a more organized crime scenario, he told The Associated Press. Usually, if its an ad hoc arrangement at the port, you would get a bit of a mix of nationalities.He said smugglers can earn more by packing as many people as possible into a ship or truck.Death is a side effect, he said.Sigona, who has studied Chinese immigrants to the U.K., said Chinas rising middle class has more access to multiple routes to come to the West legally _ say, with student or tourist visas. This means that the West is now closer to the public imagination in China, and could prompt those with fewer resources to put themselves and their families into debt in hopes of reaping similar rewards.U.K. authorities have warned for several years that people smugglers are turning to Dutch and Belgian ports because of increased security measures on the busiest cross-Channel trade route between the ports of Calais in France and Dover in England.Britains National Crime Agency warned in 2016 that people smuggling using containers on ferries was the highest-priority organized immigration crime threat. The same year, the U.K. Border Force identified Zeebrugge and the Hook of Holland in the Netherlands as key launching points for smuggling people into Britain.Belgian authorities said they had not made much headway in finding out how the container ended up in Zeebrugge.AdvertisingUp till now, we have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. We dont even know which road was followed by the truck in Belgium, said Eric Van Duyse, spokesman for the Belgian prosecutors office. We dont know how much time it stayed in Belgian territory. We dont know if it stopped or not."
2019-10-25,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/each-dish-at-this-khan-market-cafe-is-superb/article29798009.ece,Each dish at this Khan Market cafe is “superb”,"Once in a while you have a meal that leaves you with a silly smile on your face. I had one such experience the other day. A dear friend and her daughter (our much loved niece  henceforth referred to as OMLN) said they wanted to take us out for lunch. They suggested a few places where they like the food, but I wanted to try out a new restaurant. There was one in Khan Market which had some interesting east European dishes on the menu. So we decided to meet there.We went, we saw, we left. The place was dark, the servers were new and knew little about what was on the menu, and the chef seemed equally at sea. So we quietly left without ordering and went looking for a restaurant called Foxtrot.As it happened, on my way to the restaurant which shall not be named (though, to be fair, OMLN said shed had a very nice meal of Dal Makhni and veggie stuff there some weeks ago), I bumped into chef Agnibh Mudi, who had delighted us with his superb creations at The Perch, another Khan Market restaurant, several months ago. He was now at Foxtrot, he told us. So, after emerging from the dark eatery, we quickly made a beeline for Foxtrot, which was just a few buildings away.Foxtrot is a newish restaurant, situated in the middle lane (if you turn into the lane from the bookstore Bahrisons, turn left and it will be on your left). We went up a flight and found  to our delight  the restaurant was well lit, with natural light filtering in through the windows, too. Chef Agnibh (and the other cheerful employees) helped us navigate the menu. OMLN wanted pasta, but nothing too heavy (so Pasta Linguine with Cherry Tomato and Basil for her), the friend wanted something different (Smashed Galouti Biryani for her), my wife wanted something porky and sharp (so Crumbled Sausage Flat Bread with Peri Peri Sauce with Jalapeno and Olive for her) and I was ready to cross some health barriers (Tenderloin Steak with Pommes Dauphine for me).For starters, we asked for a salad: warm goat cheese with walnuts and honey mustard dressing, and lots of rocket leaves. And the chef sent to the table a plate of their signature kulchas  some stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese, some with beetroot, and served with a curd dip, crumbled roasted papad, tomato chutney and so on.A meal for four should cost between 2,700-3000, including service charge.This doesnt happen very often, but each dish was superb. The salad was outstanding, with caramelised walnuts and fresh rocket leaves, small grapes and cherry tomatoes, all tossed in a light dressing. The kulchas were delicious, too  soft, yet crispy, with just the right kind of stuffing and dips. Our entrees were all perfect. OMLN enjoyed the pasta, which she said had a nice texture, and a light touch. I had some of the crumbled sausage flatbread, and loved it. It was like a very nice, thin pizza, but wonderfully crunchy and full of all of the good stuff. The friend enjoyed her biryani: the galouti came well merged with the fragrant riceI loved the tenderloin (buffalo meat), cooked just so, with the sauce on the side, a mashed and crispy potato chunk and lots of flavourful green veggies: asparagus, broccoli, snow peas. The meat was tender, and I actually liked it even without the sauce. The chef told us that the ingredients all come from specialized places, the greens and micro-greens from a farm on the outskirts, the ribs from Bengaluru.Our meal was, in a word, outstanding. We were happy that fate (bumping into the chef, finding the other place inadequate) did its bit for us. The silly smile is still on my face.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Cue all-white omelettes, boiled-whites in salad, and a yolkless life.Youre missing out. Egg yolks are not the enemy. The yellow bit makes up 34% of the weight and contains half the protein. The albumen or white portion is merely less fatty, which is why it fits into formal ideas of what to eat.If you eat the egg with the yolk, heres what you get: more calcium, copper, iron, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc. And Vitamins D, B6, B12 and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.Dr Zubeda Tumbi, clinical nutritionist, says the best way to cook eggs is to boil, poach or scramble them or add lots of vegetables. Think of a Spanish omelette with the works - tomato, capsicum, bell peppers, coriander, mint, spring onions, mushrooms and spinach.Just avoid going overboard. Yolks are said to be a source of dietary cholesterol associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke, says Dr Tambi. Still you wont get those from yolks alone. Your disease resistance will depend on your hormones, other dietary components, lifestyle, and family history, says Dr Tumbi.First Published: Oct 26, 2019 19:23 IST"

When in doubt, pick dry-fruits and nuts over mithai and chocolate. And dont overeat  leftovers make cool treats tooTo control blood sugar: Eat pistachiosThe pistachios low glycemic index means they have minimal effects on blood sugar. They also have protein, healthy fats, and fibre, which support healthy blood glucose in the body. Theyre loaded in magnesium, another tool in blood-sugar management. How sweet is that?If youre tired and low: Eat walnutsIt packs the most antioxidants (vitamin E, ellagic acid, melatonin, carot-enoids) of all the nuts in your shiny tray.

The soil pattern in this village does not make agriculture easy, and like many other farmers, Mr. Panada works in the city as a labourer to eke out a living.Till this year, that is. His chilli crop has already earned Mr. Panada 55,000, and in the Rabi season, he expects his tomatoes to yield 35,000. I am happy that I need not leave my village to earn money. I get my seedlings from the nursery established in the village. I sell my crop and I can send my kids to a better school too, said Mr. Panada.The village is a part of the first phase of a project on improving livelihoods in rural households by improving availability of water and setting up community institutions. The project is undertaken by N.M. Sadguru Water and Development Foundation in Dahod and is supported by Axis Bank Foundation (ABF). The first phase includes 270 villages of Jhalawar, Banswara and Dungarpur districts in Rajasthan and 421 villages of Dahod, Mahisagar and Panchmahal of Gujarat. The population primarily comprises Scheduled Tribes, who own merely two acres of undulating, hilly land per household.With the four-year-long first phase ending in 2018, a third party audit has given encouraging results. As per the pre-intervention survey, only 3.44% population was in the income range of 84,000 to 1 lakh. The post-intervention data shows that the number has increased to 61.76%, said Kanhaiya Choudhary, CEO of N.M. Sadguru foundation. The non-governmental organisation was established in 1974 by Harnath Jagawat and Shrmishtha Jagawat, and works in the area of natural resource management. Phase 2 of the project will continue till 2023.The project has also introduced initiatives for crop productivity enhancement, seed production, vegetable cultivation, horticulture, floriculture and dairy development.The initiatives introduced under the project are water resource development, crop productivity enhancement and seed production, vegetable cultivation, horticulture, floriculture and dairy development.Deepsingh Bharatsingh Parmar is a floriculturist in Dahods Kamboi, known as the village of flowers. It is hilly terrain. We levelled it, dug tubewells after building water structures on the river and turned the area suitable for production of rose, marigold and chrysanthemum, he said. Mr. Choudhary said the farmers who were earning negligible incomes and chose migration are now deciding on what crops to grow, selling them on their own and investing the money in supportive businesses like dairy.Social institutions are the foundation of the programme as most project activities are launched and sustained through them. It not only empowers farmers to raise and resolve their issues, but it also transforms the lives of women by providing them financial autonomy and social mobility, said Jacob Ninan, executive trustee and CEO of ABF.Hiraben is a member of the Water User Group under the lift irrigation scheme on Hiren river at Bajwa Amba village in Rajasthans Banswara district. She has started a nursery under the project to make available seedlings of tomato, brinjal, ladies finger and cauliflower. I provide seeds to farmers in my village or even to outsiders. I earn money and have learned to deposit it too. I enjoy helping my family, she said.(Disclaimer: The visit to study the project was arranged by Axis Bank Foundation)"

Read MoreCHANDIGARH: Taking the School Nutrition Gardens (SNGs) project a step further, the Ministry of Human Resource and Development MHRD ) has issued further guidelines to schools for not only setting up SNGs, but also on how schools should impart knowledge to students about how every part of a vegetable or a fruit can be used.The MHRD guidelines can also be used by people for growing small gardens in their homes, even if the space available is less. The ministry has also mentioned the names of vegetables and fruits that can be grown and how, especially in areas with little land or less rainfall. The MHRD has further asked schools to motivate students to start SNGs at homes using the methods shared by the ministry, like using pipes, tyres, etc to grow vegetables and plants.According to the MHRD, given the rapid rate of urbanisation, many schools do not have free spaces to grow vegetables, etc. For them, there is an effective alternative that is simple and practical, i.e. gardening in containers. Such a garden has many benefits for schools in urban areas as they help to green the school and reduce air pollution.By using containers, students will learn to grow vegetables and fruits in small spaces. After knowing that a large piece of land is not essential for this, they will be able to utilize and reuse discarded containers, said the ministry. Further, organic garbage such as kitchen scraps and anything that decays, can be processed into compost in such containers. Through a careful selection of plants, the temperature of the immediate area of the school can be lowered.The MHRD also offered suggestions on how students can use unused spaces in schools and homes, like vacant staircases, school entrance sites, etc. Containers that can be used include tyres, earthen pots, cemented pots, buckets, water cans, drums, damaged sink, wash basins, old plastic pots, old polythene bags, etc.The MHRD also suggested to use climber plants like pumpkin, bottle guard, bitter guard, cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, tinda, etc, and advised schools to consult local experts for their advice before making the final selection. Vegetables and fruits which are appropriate for SNGs have also been shared in the guidelines."

It also helps in speeding up metabolism and enhancing overall health due to the presence of antioxidants, she tells indianexpress.com.View this post on Instagram A post shared by    (@camera_bondi_golpo) on Oct 28, 2019 at 2:28am PDTSo, what should you have? Think of green vegetables, fruits, and whole ingredients. Detox foods include spinach, red and green peppers, tomatoes, and fruits like grapes, oranges, melons, apples, and bananas. Add cinnamon, ginger and grated garlic in your dishes. This would reduce the inflammatory chemicals your body has been producing because of too many mithais, shares Avni Kaul, nutritionist, wellness coach, and certified diabetic educator, founder, NutriActivania.However, experts point out that it is always better to take small steps to achieve a bigger goal. Detoxifying can be done by just changing your diet, such as eating more fresh salads, advises Kaul. Consume raw vegetables and fruits like cucumber, carrots, radish, onions, tomatoes, oranges, papaya, apples before every meal. Raw foods will make you feel amazing and are known for eradicating toxins and healing your body quickly, she says.AdvertisingSince Diwali sweets are mostly made of milk and milk products, maida and sugar in high amounts, it is good to keep a check on consumption of refined products after the festivities are over, advises Dr Pramod Tripathi, founder, Freedom from Diabetes. Since milk contains IGF factor (insulin-like growth factor) which does not allow insulin to work properly, it should be avoided by diabetics. It is also recommended that refined products like sugar and maida be avoided. All these products not only raise your sugar levels but also hamper your system, he points out.Dietician Shikha Mahajan, holistic nutritionist, Diet Podium, says that the ideal way to start with a healthy eating plan is to cut all carbs from your diet, except some light fruits. This will help cut out the retained water and get you rid of bloating. She adds that no intake of salt can help flush out excess water and toxins in the body.ALSO READ | National Nutrition Week 2019: Why rainbow diet matters?However, if one chooses to detox for more than a day, its important to consume more protein, advises Mahajan. If you do a detox for longer than a day, you must make sure that you get two portions of lean protein like chicken, fish, egg white or tofu every day. This will make your detox sustainable and help you follow through, she explains.The thumb rule is to drink more water, which is often not the case. There is no point in doing a detox if you will forget to hydrate. Detox can be extremely dehydrating if you dont have enough water. Also, the toxins can only be flushed out with water. Add lemon to warm water and drink it three-four times a day, states Mahajan.Remember these easy tips for a detoxDrink lukewarm water with lemonTake a glass of warm water with half a lemon squeezed in. Have it on empty stomach; you can also sip that with cucumber cut into your water bottle throughout the day. Drinking lemon water in the morning helps flush out toxins and sugar from the body, which is good for weight loss. It also helps relieve problems like acidity, bloating, burping and heartburn.Cut down sugar intakePost Diwali your body is still coping with all the excesses, so try to cut down on your sugar intake, fats and processed carbohydrates. If you drink tea or coffee everyday, then avoid putting sugar into it. No matter how much you are craving for leftover sweets, try to have a slice of fruit instead. Eliminate all fried foods from your diet. Also, limit your intake of chapattis or rice and carbohydrates. Cut back on the portions of your food and try dividing your meals into 5-6 portions rather than three large meals a day. Consume more raw, steamed or sauted vegetables.Take out time for exerciseDont bother to join a gym or invest in fancy equipment to burn some calories. Walk for 30-45 minutes daily. Try taking the stairs instead of the lift. Do what you enjoy the most! If you enjoy dancing, get up and groove. The key is to do something daily which helps burn calories at a steady pace.Eat only home-cooked mealsRestaurant and street food may be tasty but are loaded with oil, salt, starch and sugar. If you cook at home, you have control over the ingredients and cooking methods. You can easily prepare a nourishing meal like khichdi and chaach rather than ordering food from outside.Include healthy fatsHealthy fats like nuts, seeds, egg yolk, avocado, coconut and ghee will enhance the results of your detox. These are especially helpful for those who are showing toxicity in their skin, hair, under-eye, etc, as they rejuvenate the dullest of skin.SleepGet at least seven hours of sleep per night so the body can recoup the damage and start healing from within."
2019-10-30,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nature-in-a-package/article29827398.ece,Nature in a package,"A nutshell held a business idea for Vishal Shah (30) soon after he returned to Mumbai from the U.S. on completing his studies.The year was 2015. Mr. Shah looked in every store for coconut water, but could find none. I couldnt roam around with a nut, and didnt know where to throw it, he thought to himself. I needed something in my bag. Also, the neighbourhood nariyal pani walla did not come every day to deliver. What could I do?And thus, a business idea was born. Mr. Shah runs Storia, a venture that is into packaged coconut water, unique shakes and street-style drinks targeted at the urban youth.Mr. Shahs family already ran Drytech Processes, which makes ingredients for multinational food and beverage companies. The idea was to not build a new category but to disrupt the existing category. On April 17, 2017 we launched packaged coconut water, said Mr. Shah, managing director and founder, Storia Foods and Beverages Ltd.The idea was to see how an unorganised sector could become organised. The country knows about the benefits of coconut water, which is a big category, but there was no industry there, said Mr. Shah.A greater challenge was to educate consumers, because the belief in India was that packed products are not natural. So we created packaged coconut water, which is 100% natural  no sugars, no flavour and no preservatives  at a price of 40, with a six-month shelf life. The idea was to inspire wellness.Two years down the line, the company is selling about 1.5 lakh packs of coconut water a month and has cornered about 2% of the market, which is estimated at about 100 crore. The target is to cover 9% for FY20.The company uses aseptic Ultra High Temperature treatment technology wherein a product is heated for three to four seconds at a very high temperature and cooled immediately so that the fragrance remains intact.In aseptic processing, thermally sterilised liquid products are packaged into sterilised containers under sterile conditions to produce products that do not need refrigeration.Related productsIn 2017, the company had come out with a beverage whitener, a milk substitute with calcium, potassium and protein but without transfat. This got a lot more demand in the business to business segment. Today, every vending machine uses milk substitutes, said Mr. Shah.With an aim to disrupt the flavoured milk market, the company also developed a shake, introduced in September 2017. It then unveiled a range of shakes that are not flavoured milk, he said.The idea was to create a different offering in the same category. The vision of Storia is to disrupt the existing food and beverage industry. So, if you want juice, you dont come to me, if you want a street-style juice, then come to me. Our product provides a value-added proposition to the consumer at the same price points, Mr. Shah said.The company recently unveiled a range of street-style drinks in the category of juices in flavours like pani puri with an apple base; guava chilli; green mango masala, and tomato masala to name a few.The category is a mix of food and spices. The idea was, anything you drink or eat on the street is converted into a healthier street-style option, said Mr. Shah.Again, aseptic technology helped preserve product purity. In September 2018, the company introduced natural fruit shakes that have a six-month shelf life and are priced at 25 and 30. It produces 5 lakh bottles of shakes per month.The marketThe products are available in 33 cities and sold in over 50,000 outlets. Storia co-packs with Drytech and with another co-packer in the South for coconut water. The company aims to reach one lakh retail outlets across India for Storia and one lakh retail outlets for each product category namely coconut water, shakes and street-style drinks.It has developed products in the health food category, which will be unveiled in the next five years. The company is now stepping up the branding and marketing, for which it is looking to raise $4 million to $6 million in funding. It recently started an outdoor campaign involving an investment of 15 crore across nine big cities.The competitorsIn flavoured milk, Storia is taking on Amul, the market leader in this category. In coconut water, it is competing with Daburs Real Active brand, which is the biggest organised player in this segment. And in street-style drinks, it is taking on multinationals such as Coke and Pepsi, which sell Maaza and Slice respectively, as also Parle Agro, which sells Frooti.With Storia, Mr. Shah wants to bring people together. In particular, the brand capitalises on the Indian tradition of sharing stories while consuming food. Storia means stories in Italian. The idea was to try and build a better society through food and stories.And how does he hope to achieve that? There are success stories or how well youre doing. Then there are failure stories, taboo stories, stories of empowerment. The idea is to build something that can work towards the betterment through food.The Storia threadFounder : Vishal ShahFunding: $3 million mobilised from family and friendsRevenue: 23 crore in FY19Started in: 2017Volume: 1.5 lakh packs of coconut water,5 lakh bottles of shakes per monthTarget: Youth, health-conscious people"

Their religion Zoroastrianism is arguably the worlds first monotheistic faith, and is one of the oldest religions still in existence. Parsis migrated to the Indian subcontinent from Persia (now Iran), after the Muslim conquest of Persia between the 8th and 10th century AD.Reportedly, the Chenoys were the first lot of Parsis who came to Secunderabad around 1803. When the Hyderabad Contingency was transferred from the old Cantonment of Jalna to Bolaram in 1800, the Chenoy family came along with them and were the recognised army shroffs or bankers of the said contingent. Many in the Chenoy family earned different titles such as Khan Bahadur, Khan Saheb and Nawab, says CA Jehangir Bisney, trustee of Parsi Zoroastrian Anjuman of Secunderabad and Hyderabad (PZASH).AssociationsParsis are known for their philanthropy and charity activities. Located at MG Road, Secunderabad, PZASH is the largest Parsi Trust of the twin cities. Apart from providing subsidised housing to the community members, PZASH has various other schemes such as education encouragement, poverty amelioration, child incentive, etc. It also provides medical equipment for emergency use, adds Jehangir.The other prominent institutions are Zoroastrian Club, BRJC Parsi High School at Park Lane, Secunderabad, Zoroastrian Stree Mandal and Parsi Dharamshala near Paradise, Secunderabad. There are various other private trusts that provide housing and other aid to the deserving families.There are nearly 1,000 Parsis in the twin cities. A substantial number of them reside in the three colonies within the precincts of the three Fire Temples. Two Fire Temples are in Secunderabad and one is in Hyderabad. Most of the Parsis are members of PZASH. The fee is a nominal `1 per month. Capt Kayarmin Pestonji of Chermas and Manek Daruvala of T.I.M.E. are some of the prominent Parsi businesspersons in the city. The Anjuman will be celebrating the centenary celebrations of its Fire Temple in July 2020, informs Jehangir.FestivalsThe Parsi community celebrates its new year on the first day of its calendar. On March 21 every year, the community observes Navroze, a traditional Persian / Iranian festival celebrating the onset of spring. A few days after the Parsi New Year, the community celebrates the birthday of its Prophet Zarathustra called Khordad Saal. The prophet Zoroaster (Zarathustra in ancient Persian) is regarded as the founder of Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster taught followers to worship a single god called Ahura Mazda.CuisineParsis love eggs, potatoes and meat. Almost all the vegetable dishes made from okra, tomatoes or potatoes will have eggs on top. Meat dishes will have potatoes in the form of salli (matchstick-fried potatoes). Dishes like the dhansak have lentils which are adopted from typical Indian preparations and given a meaty twist. Fish dishes use local seafood like prawns and pomfret, and the use of banana leaf (patra ni macchi) in their preparation shows the skillful adoption of local ingredients and making it their own. Lagan Nu Custard is a dessert which is the Parsi version of the French Creme Brulee and has derived its name from being served at weddings.Marriage ceremoniesCommunity weddings take place every year and more frequently in the cooler months of November, December and January. Most of the community weddings take place at the picturesque Parsi Dharamsala complex located at Paradise, Secunderabad. The complex has a large hall/pavilion. The weddings always take place after sunset and are performed by the community priests.1,000Parsis in the twin citiesA few businessesChermasT.I.M.E.

2019-10-30,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/oct/30/terrace-of-greenery-2054384.html,Terrace of greenery,"By Express News ServiceCHENNAI: Creating a dedicated space for lush greenery can be a challenge when it comes to the congested city spaces. However, Abhay Kewadkar claims to be lucky when he moved into his space in 2015 at Benson Town, Bengaluru, which came with a terrace spanning across 2,500 sq feet.Kewadkar went on to convert the massive space into a lush terrace garden. A winemaker by profession, Kewadkar was no stranger to planting and maintaining similar spaces. In a city, one must consider themselves lucky to avail such a space and continue the passion on a terrace. With added assistance from a friend, we waterproofed the area, which is of prime importance, and further created pockets of soil for the plantation, he says.When it comes to planting, Kewadkar expresses his love for flowers, which he carefully chose, keeping the weather conditions in mind. The variety of flowers can be described as vibrant such as the red, white and yellow hibiscus, a corner solely dedicated for red and white roses and a spread of pink geranium. The garden also has jasmine, temple trees (white and pink), bottle brush, anthuriums (red and violet) and for the landscape effect we have various kinds of palms as well, he says.Apart from flowers in full bloom, the garden also houses a variety of fruits and vegetables which is treated with organic manure. The list of essential greens in this space includes spinach, fenugreek, bottle gourd, broccoli, pomegranate, guava, lemon and a recent addition of strawberries. We also have certain herbs such as dill, rosemary, thyme, mint and lemongrass. Apart from these, we also grow some ginger, garlic, turmeric and a rotational cycle of tomatoes, arugula and basil.Kewadkar states that the every day consumption of basic vegetables and fruits comes from the garden that he maintains with the help of a gardener giving the much needed attention to the space. The space you see here today has taken over a year to develop, I was actively involved in plantation through my profession. The one thing you should remember is to start with a small batch and gradually carry things forward. Its a learning curve."
2019-10-31,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onion-tomato-area-may-be-increased-to-stabilise-prices/story-aoB3XtOMnahkL2ZuGXztbP.html,"Onion, tomato area may be increased to stabilise prices","indiaUpdated: Oct 31, 2019 05:51 ISTThe government is weighing policy options to increase the area and production of onions and tomatoes in northern states to tide over supply disruptions from southern and central states, especially during the monsoon months, that cause prices of the vegetables to spike.The consumer affairs ministry has proposed to the horticulture commissioner under the agriculture ministry that increasing production of onions and tomatoes in states such as Haryana, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh be included in the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, according toan official with knowledge of the matter.This is a centrally sponsored scheme in which the Union government funds up to 60% of total costs, with state governments contributing the rest. In the case of hill states, such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the Centres share of funding is higher at 90%.Onion prices more than doubled in many cities since August. They have since settled at around Rs 50-55 a kg in retail markets. During times of normal supply, retail prices usually range between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg.Heavy rains during August-September in Maharashtra, the biggest onion producing state, as well in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, disrupted onion shipments to northern India as well as other parts of country. Unseasonal rains could have damaged nearly 30% of the onion crop in Maharashtra, said Shirish Jamdade, an official in the states horticulture department.The main summer onion crop  sown during May-June and harvested in October-November  accounts for just 15% of the countrys annual output. Yet, this crop is critical because it replenishes markets at a time when they generally run out stocks from previous harvests.Traders who rely on stocked onions they set aside for such seasonal shortages then up prices, leading to inflationary spells.According to data from the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation, rain-led disruptions caused onion arrivals at wholesale markets in September to slump to 3.5 million quintals until September 25, from about 6 million quintals in the previous year.Higher production in northern states can ease supply shocks in eastern states such as Bihar, West Bengal and the north-east, an official with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.During the price spiral last month, metros such as Mumbai and Delhi were the worst hit, and retail onion and tomato prices soared to Rs 75-80/kg.Sowing of the countrys main summer onion crop was delayed by over a month in Maharashtra due to a sluggish start to this years monsoon in June, which pushed back harvests in what is a lean season, another reason for the price spike.On September 13, the Union government curbed exports by raising the minimum export price (MEP) of onion to $850 a tonne (about Rs 62,000). Imposition of MEP makes an Indian-origin commodity expensive for foreign buyers, thereby discouraging shipments abroad.As prices failed to cool, the government then imposed a ban on export of onions on September 29 to augment domestic supply and cool prices.The horticulture mission, under which onion output is sought to be raised in northern states, will aim at productivity increases through improved varieties, quality seeds and planting materials, the official cited above said. The mission also aims to promote subsidised greenhouse cultivation and horticulture mechanisation.If implemented properly, the proposal for higher production within northern states can fulfil demand during the lean phase. But the scheme may need to offer some form of subsidy and be also backed by higher procurement of onions, said Alok Kumar, a former horticulture scientist at the Indian Council of Agriculture Research. The government usually buys onions from farmers to build a buffer stock; this stood at 44,205 tonnes in June 2019.Price spikes in onions increases overall food inflation, potentially upsetting the Reserve Banks inflation target. Higher inflation can cut economic growth and affect businesses by making borrowing expensive.Onions are the second most consumed vegetable in the country after potatoes. An average Indian household spends 13% of its total vegetable bill on onions alone, according to HTs calculations from the 2011-12 (latest available figures) Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) conducted by the National Sample Survey Office. CES is the most authoritative source of consumption data in India. To be sure, spending on vegetables was just 10% and 9% of total food spending in rural and urban India in 2011-12. Cereals, milk, and milk products had the biggest share in food consumption in India.Onions have an overall weightage of 1.7% in the food inflation basket. According to a calculation of Kotak Institutional Equities Ltd, assuming a 50% rise in onion prices on an annual basis, wholesale food inflation would swing up by 80 basis points. That translates to a rise of 30 basis points in retail food inflation. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.First Published: Oct 31, 2019 00:23 IST"

2019-10-31,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/where-the-wild-things-grow/article29841892.ece,Where the wild things grow,"The inviting scent of frying onions makes its way into a quiet, sun-dappled clearing at Solitude Farm in Auroville.A cook is rapidly tossing sliced onions and chillies in a wok. She works in a kitchen that is open on all sides. It spills into a caf on the right, where an intern lines up boxes heavy with freshly harvested herbs for the community. As the cook shouts out that breakfast is ready, pouring steamy tea into a row of steel tumblers, farm workers slowly meander in for breakfast.In the centre of it all, is Englishman-turned-Aurovillian Krishna Mckenzie, in a turban and lungi, giving his team precise, rapid-fire instructions in fluent Tamil. He spoons steaming varagu (kodo millet) into his bowl, topping it with a ladle of vegetable curry, between urging everyone to pause for breakfast. Then, he eats quickly, checking his cracked, clearly hard-working phone between spoonfuls.There is a lot going on at Solitude these days. The cafs organic lunches are gaining popularity, as are the farm visits Krishna hosts on Saturdays. Their fruit and vegetable baskets go out three times a week to subscribers in Auroville and Puducherry. In a mission to educate people on the benefits of locally grown food, Solitude has also started hosting cooking classes, as well as workshops on permaculture.Taking a break, Krishna stretches out under the trees with a glass of tart soursop juice. Looking around his six-acre farm, vibrant with about 140 varieties of local herbs and vegetables, he explains how Solitude, which started in 1996, thrives on do-nothing farming, inspired by Japanese zen master and farmer Masanobu Fukuoka. (A proponent of natural farming, Masanobu is the author of the influential The One-Straw Revolution.)Teenage beginningsI was 19 when I came here, says Krishna, adding that India felt like home right from the beginning, perhaps because he studied at the J Krishnamurti School, Brockwood Park, in Hampshire, UK.When I first came to Auroville, in January 1993, we had no mobiles or Internet. We used to meet and plant trees, he states, adding that his interest in farming was cemented by a chance encounter in 2003, when he was visiting Vandana Shivas farm in Dehradun.Masanobu was there, in a white beard and indigo robes... He explained how we cannot improve Nature. Instead by observing her natural processes and systems, we can achieve very high yields. His techniques were defined by his region, bioregion and topography...Krishna springs up and dives into the farm, ducking through water sprinklers. He scoops up a handful of rich, moist soil wriggly with earthworms. We need to honour soil. Healthy soil results in nutritional diversity.Pivoting around, he says, There is incredible variety here, and we did not even plant many of our indigenous greens. They spring up when you nurture the soil. We have Malabar spinach, amaranth and roselle, in addition to a range of keerais: kori keerai (waterleaf), agathi keerai, moringa, manathakkali, ponnanganni... We have medicinal herbs, like mudakathan (balloon vine), thoothuvalai (solanum) and guduchi (giloy)... They do not need a lot of water to grow, and thrive in this climate.Krishnas mission now is to convince people to expand their culinary horizons. Subscribers get what is in season, he says, rifling through a basket. This week, there is spring onion, bottle gourd, green papaya, ridge gourd... He holds up a bunch of greens, punctuated with bright blue flowers. This is the juice kit: soursop, tulsi, hibiscus and clitoria ternatea flower. (Also known as the butterfly pea, the flower, in demand at trendy cafs around the globe, grows wild at Solitude.)When we adopt the principles of permaculture, plants start emerging everywhere. Where did this sundakkai (turkey berry) come from? asks Krishna, pointing at a hardy plant. I have no idea, he shrugs. We planted about 24 fruit trees, then added papaya, turmeric, pineapples and drumstick around them, followed by tomatoes, ladies fingers and greens. Then the volunteers turned up: chillies, ponnanganni, nannari (sarsaparilla)... we did not plant those. They were free!Tradition on a plateThe produce makes its way into Solitudes restaurant, which specialises in serving healthy, traditional thalis. We cook local food that represents the cultural, nutritional heritage of this bioregion, says Krishna. Sundakkai sambar, green papaya kara kuzhambu, tapioca chips, ragi adai, mudakathan dosai and thoothuvalai rasam.Meals are cooked fresh, over a wood fire. Krishna pauses. It is not easy. We are going against the flow of a tsunami. But we do not see this as just a restaurant. It is a social learning space. He adds, It is important we celebrate local produce. Otherwise, we will become homogeneous. I do not even have a university degree. I have nothing special about me.... If I can do it, anyone can.Solitude Farm is in Auroville. The caf is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 3 pm. Krishna runs a free tour of the farm on Saturdays at 11.30 am."

Virtually all private schools are closed, and most government schools are shut  one of the clearest signs of the fear that has gripped Kashmir since the government locked down the territory and separatist militants began carrying out attacks to disrupt its control.The government wants students to return, and teachers at the few open schools are reporting for duty. But their students are not: Officials estimate attendance at those schools to be around 3%.Parents in the Kashmir Valley say they are terrified of sending their children out with troops everywhere and separatist militants on the prowl for trouble. The militants are demanding that civilians boycott work and school, and they have killed several people to assert their resistance to tightening New Delhi rule.This week, militants dragged construction workers onto the street and shot them, leaving five dead and one wounded. It was the deadliest single attack on civilians since Kashmirs autonomy was stripped.What if the school or a bus carrying children is attacked? asked Saqib Mushtaq Bhat, a father worried about violence. What if there are protests and their faces get shot by pellets?He would never forgive himself, he said, so he keeps his three children home.The result is fear, bewilderment, sullenness and boredom. Some of the older students worry that their dreams of becoming professionals were ruined. And many children said they were lonely and depressed, relegated to watching television for hours a day.Theres nothing else to do, said Reyan Sofi, a fourth grader.The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has smoldered for decades, at times flaring into major disruption to life in the valley.This generation of Kashmiri children has been among the hardest hit. They have known nothing but conflict. For the past 10 years, huge protests and clashes keep erupting. Many young people have seen friends killed, maimed or hauled off by security forces. Their schools are constantly closing, sometimes for months at a time.The long school closures in the valley are causing major disruptions in young peoples educational and professional development, producing feelings of insecurity, helplessness and demoralization, said Haley Duschinski, an anthropologist at Ohio University specializing in Kashmir.This latest round of trouble has felt particularly ominous, many Kashmiris say.The governments move in August to strip statehood away from Jammu and Kashmir became official Thursday, turning what was once an Indian state into federally controlled enclaves. People are angry and scared that Indias move could lead to another war with Pakistan, which also claims the area, or to pitched combat with an intensifying militant movement.Officials insist it is now safe for children to go to school and blame parents for not sending them back.Its a big loss, said Younis Malik, Kashmirs director of school education.But many here blame the government for creating this crisis and say that officials are not serious about guaranteeing the childrens safety or resuming education.The children, meanwhile, are desperate to get out of the house and go back to school. They want to see their friends. They want to learn new things. They know their futures depend on it.You should either burn my books and my uniform or send me to school, Reyan, the fourth grader, grumbled to his father on a recent day as they sat in their house in Baramulla, a town in northern Kashmir.His father, Pervaiz Ahmad Sofi, a forestry professor, threw open a window and pointed toward a group of soldiers in riot gear, stationed just outside their house, guarding a highway.Now tell me, do you still want to go to school? he said. Reyan looked down and walked away, back to the TV.Indian schools are intensely competitive. Mehak Javid Bhat, an 18-year-old, was preparing for medical school when her high school shut. With just four months to go before her make-or-break exam, she cant compare study notes with her friends because none of their phones work. She cant get on the internet to look things up she doesnt understand. She cant get in touch with her teachers.My dream of becoming a doctor is ruined, she said. Sometimes I wonder why was I even born here.Her father, Javid Ahmad Bhat, feels helpless. He had been tucking away a little money from his apple orchards each year to help pay for medical school.Its like my 10 years of savings are being destroyed every day when I see her suffer, he said.You need a guide, a teacher and a friend  but she has none these days to solve her problems, he said.Some Kashmiri educators refuse to give up. Mufeed Ahmad Malik, a high school physical education teacher, walks through villages in south Kashmir like a letter carrier, delivering homework assignments door to door.Read it and prepare yourself, Malik repeated at each door, his shoulder bag bulging with papers. And come to school on the day of the exam.The nearby government school, where he teaches, keeps its gates shut. The teachers arrive in the morning and sit in a courtyard savoring the fading sun  winter is on its way.Some have taken up knitting, and as they talk about the situation and how it affects their lives, they make woolen sweaters. Then they leave in different directions to deliver homework. They were not confident that many children would show up for exams.Malik fears that if the schools dont reopen soon, some children will go down the wrong path. In southern Kashmir, many boys revere the militants. They have grown up playing games in which they dress up as militants or Indian soldiers, hiding behind apple trees, firing wooden guns at each other.If they dont even sit for exams, Malik said of his male students, they will end up becoming militants.The security forces already assume that is happening, focusing their suspicions intensely on teen boys or young men. Many have been jailed, at times hauled off without process or explanation, and that number is only increasing.Other young people are being put to work, like Musaib Amin, 15, who now helps his grandmother in the fields, picking tomatoes. In August, one young man who should have been in college (colleges and universities are empty, too) died after he was bitten by a snake while herding sheep. His bite was treatable. But his family could not call an ambulance or find the anti-venom.Aliya, the fifth grader who keeps checking on her school, hasnt given up hope. The other day, she opened her closet and stared at her white and gray uniform. It remains crisply ironed, untouched since August.I miss wearing it, she said.She ran outside to play in the yard, by herself.Sameer Yasir and Jeffrey Gettleman c.2019 The New York Times CompanyGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

She walks slowly, stopping every now and then and examining the plants that grow in the yard of the homes and strikes up conversations. This bottle gourd is mature. Wait for three more days and it will make for an excellent poriyal, she tells Kalaivani S. This has pretty much been this 82 year olds routine for the past four months. These plants have grown out of the saplings and seeds that I distributed, she says. It is very fulfilling to watch them flower and bear fruit.Nanjammals oldest son, Bharathi Chinnasamy, is a Gandhian who dreams of self-sufficient villages, she says. I am doing what I can to help him realise his dream. Bharathi buys the seeds from Agricultural University. I choose high-yielding varieties suggested by experts from the institute. Each pack costs 10 and my mother grows around 200 saplings from each packet, he explains. She is no stranger to farm life as she grew up in a family that cultivated groundnut, millets, betel leaves and rice at Erode. I did everything from preparing the land to harvesting the crop. I came to Coimbatore 20 years ago to be with my son. Now I grow tomato, chilli, keerai, brinjal and drumstick in my backyard, she says.The harvest | Photo Credit: M_PERIASAMYThere are 37 families in my village and I gave them 10 varieties of seeds in May 2018. Many of them did not use it, and those who did had no idea on how to take care of the plants. That is when I decided to step in and teach them the basics of cultivation. In June this year, Nanjammal grew brinjal saplings for 15 days in her backyard and supplied them to her neighbours. I gave each family three to five saplings and taught them to prepare the soil with compost and plant them. The response was great, she says.This encouraged Nanjammal to supply them with seeds of bottle gourd and bitter gourd as well. To protect the saplings from insects, Nanjammal makes natural pesticide from leaves of neem and custard apple. I use it once in 20 days, she says. The villagers had their first harvest after two months. It was such joy. People came to visit me with their first produce.Nurturing a plant The soil has to be mixed with compost in equal proportion.There should be at least two feet distance between each plant.Water once in two days.A mixture of cow dung with water can be added as fertilizer once in a monthMake sure there is enough sunlightUse natural pesticide once in 20 daysRemove weeds without failB Malathi, another resident of the village, says that she never thought that farming was something she could do. Nanjammal paati cleared all my doubts and taught me to nurture plants. My harvest was good and I supplied the surplus snake gourd and brinjal to my relatives. My family now eats fresh, chemical-free-veggies every day. Nanjammal supplies seeds and saplings free of cost to families in her village | Photo Credit: M PeriasamyLast month, Nanjammal included Anyapalayam village in Erode in her initiative. That is my native place. We travel there twice in a week to check on the plants, she says. The duo plans to make at least 15 varieties of vegetables and fruits available to the villagers. We hope to plant pandal avarai, sundakkai chedi, guava trees and drumstick trees in common areas in these villages. The yield from these trees can be used by everyone. The good harvest has made me popular in our locality and now I am invited by nearby areas to teach them farming. I am happy to share what I have learnt over the years."

Not that they are into any fad diet, rather, the four of them have learnt the art of self-sustenance through subsistence agriculture.While a 20-cent plot of land in Vilavoorkkal near Malayinkeezhu on the outskirts of the city cradles their own paddy fields, a well-maintained kitchen garden on the terrace of their Kowdiar residence provides them with enough for day-to-day needs. Adding to this is the six-cent land around the house where some indispensable spices such as ginger, turmeric and black pepper, bananas and tubers such as chena, chemb and kaachil are cultivated.Uma Maheshwaran at his farmland in Vilavoorkkal near Malayinkeezhu | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementWe make our subsistence agriculture activities a fun family affair. Farming is a hobby of mine and I take to the fields after work hours, weekends and holidays, says Uma Maheshwaran, a Professor at the Department of Plant of Plant Pathology at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. He bought the plot at Vilavoorkkal in 2008 for the purpose of starting his own farming. For land preparation that involves ploughing and levelling, he ropes in the help of Krishi Bhavan workers. Planting of saplings is done using the transplanting method and a portion of the plot serves as a nursery where seedlings are raised.Not dampened by the rains, the family recently celebrated another harvest, this time procuring about 400 kg of the Jyothy rice variety. All our rice requirements are met throughout the year from our own fields. Any surplus is usually given off to kith and kin, explains Uma Maheshwaran.Rajasree M R at the terrace kitchen garden | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor the last two crop seasons, he cultivated the long and red Jyothy variety, having previously harvested the high-yielding, short-duration Prathyasha variety and the medium-duration Aishwarya as well. As the paddy crop duration is generally a little over three months, Uma Maheshwaran cultivates pulses on the plot during summer, when he manages to get a yield of close to 10 kg a year. He says one or two local labourers are employed for threshing, while the professor himself chips in.On the terrace of his single-story house, one can find a range of vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, bitter gourd, cluster beans, ladies finger and so on apart from red amaranth and a few varieties of chilli in eco-friendly grow bags.Keeping it cool Uma Maheshwaran says he uses basic farm implements. During the cool season during the November-January period, he grows vegetables such as cabbage and cauliflowers. No matter how much care you give, pests and diseases are unavoidable since we do not use pesticides. Sometimes, I spray organic pesticides like neem-garlic oil if required, he says.Perhaps, three essential items that we cannot grow on our terrace are onions, potatoes and garlic as they flourish more in cool climates, says his wife, Rajasree MR, Joint Director of Plant Protection, Krishi Directorate. She says every Sunday morning, the couple makes it a point to visit their Vilavoorkkal plot for weeding and examination of crop health.Anand U, a banker, says he developed a passion for farming right from a young age, learning from his green-thumbed parents. For me, farming feels like a refreshing break from an otherwise hectic and monotonous schedule. It also helps you be in close communion with Nature, adds Anand, now posted in Thrissur.Anand U near his farmland | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor Aparna Raju, farming came a new experience when she became part of the family after tying the knot with Anand but says she took to it like a duck to water. Now, in her father-in-laws absence, she makes it a point to water and prune the plants on the terrace. What I have learnt from my experience is that farming is not a hard row to hoe. In fact, anybody can do it, she says.The family is also focusing on apiculture, for the twin benefits of promoting cross-pollution for their terrace farming as well as to harvest honey for own use. A vermicompost pit set up in their backyard helps in recycling kitchen and farm waste and use the same as organic fertiliser for the plants.They want to promote sustainable subsistence agriculture not just to set an example against the growing menace of food adulteration in a mass consumption-driven culture but to highlight the trails and tribulations small-scale farmers go through.For now, its about making hay while the sun shines!"

Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry in Nauni near here worked towards an appropriate alternative -- the cultivation of Kharif onion.ALSO READ: Fresh stock to bring onion prices down in coming weekKharif onion cannot only save the farmers and the public from the sting of inflation but can also be a better option to increase the income of the farmers provided that the farmers adopt its cultivation techniques through the scientific method.The Kharif onion crop reaches the market at a time when the public is reeling under the increasing prices of onions.Deepa Sharma, a Vegetable Scientist at the University's College of Horticulture and Forestry in Neri in Hamirpur, has been working on a Rs 20.43 lakh project sanctioned two years ago by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in New Delhi, for popularising Kharif onion cultivation in Chamba district of the state.ALSO READ: After onion stalls, officials planning subsidised tomato stalls in rythu bazars?University scientists Rajveev Raina and Sanjeev Kumar Banyal are associated with the project as co-investigators.Under the project 245 demonstrations on farm fields, 14 training programmes have been organised in the last two years, which have benefitted 362 farmers, the university said in a statement.Keeping in view the growing demand and profit of kharif onion, the university wants to extend its cultivation to all suitable areas of the state.The experiments conducted in the Chamba district have yielded encouraging results. The farmers can replant setts during the second week of August and sell green onion bulbs from the second week of October.This crop is ready for harvesting from last week of November to the first week of December. The kharif crop is harvested at a time when the prices of onion are high and, therefore, the crop can be sold easily at Rs 50 per kg from the field itself.The farmers can obtain a yield of six quintals from one quintal setts and earn up to Rs 30,000. Vice-Chancellor Parvinder Kaushal called upon the farming community to take kharif onion cultivation as an enterprise."

Because of the extended monsoon and the delayed onset of winter, the harvest of several winter greens and other vegetables has been delayed. As a result, wholesale as well as retail prices of several winter vegetables have been rising over a fortnight.Green peas and purple yam cost as high as Rs 200 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, carrots, little gourd, French beans, and even fenugreek leaves cost more than Rs 100 a kg. The prices of tomato and onion, which are widely used in gravies and an array of dishes, have also gone up, hurting the pockets of restaurateurs.Many crops were damaged due to the extended monsoon, said a well-placed source in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Ahmedabad. Moreover, the supply of some vegetables not harvested here is also short. Thus, prices have been impacted.Commenting on the output, Mafa Bharwad, a farmer from Kamijla village in Surendranagar district said, I grow bitter gourd and ladys finger. Depending on the demand and supply, I get Rs 30 per kg sometimes. Bharwad said that but most of the times, farmers get around Rs 200 for a 20 kg bag of these vegetables. The winter crop will be delayed this time, he said.Vipul Patel, a farmer from Dhakdi village of Viramgam taluka of Ahmedabad district, cultivates tomatoes, brinjal, and cauliflower. Farmers get barely 50% of the wholesale rates of vegetables, he said. The recent unseasonal rain has badly affected tomato and cauliflower crops.Sources said that it will take another fortnight to a month for vegetable prices to stabilize."

Last year, she harvested 125 crates per acre of tomatoes, each weighing 20 kg. On Saturday, as she walked from one plant to the other, Dhere says, she would be lucky if she managed to put together 20 crates.AdvertisingOnly a month ago, the 68-year-old farmer, who has been working on the farm since she was 16, was readying herself for a bumper tomato crop. But the extended wet weather in Maharashtra, coupled with the two-day rain in the last leg of October, has literally poured cold water on her dreams.The last few days have been very bad. Never in my life have I had to witness such erratic rainfall. This is the worst harvest season of my life, she says. Dhere is among 4.5 lakh farmers in Nashik district who are staring at the worst harvest in the last five decades.While Pimpalgaon receives an annual average rainfall of around 630 mm, this year it received 1,283 mm rainfall, of which 283 mm was received in the last 30 days alone. The rain this year, villagers say, has been among the most intense that the area has known in a generation, and the scale of the disaster it has wreaked to the standing crop is only slowly becoming apparent.AdvertisingUnseasonal rain that lashed the state in the last week of October has put Maharashtra in the middle of another agrarian crisis with 54.22 lakh hectares (more than 40 per cent) of the total 138.82 lakh hectares under kharif sowing damaged. In Nashik district alone, of the 7.40 lakh hectares of farmland, crop on 3.83 lakh hectares has been completely destroyed affecting around 4.52 lakh farmers.Small and marginal farmers, the worst-hit by the agrarian crisis, have lost their entire crop and hope of a better future. Balu Trimbak Hire says his entire soyabean harvest on three-acre land was washed away by the rain last week. I had harvested soyabean and had kept it on my farm thinking that I would sell it in the coming days. But heavy rains washed away the entire harvest. Rainfall also destroyed the soyabean crop that I had not yet harvested, Hire, who is staring at financial uncertainty, says.My only source of income was my harvest. With it gone, I do not have any way of generating money. The government help will be minimal, and I am dreading how I will be able to sustain my life and plan the next sowing. This has been the bleakest Diwali for me and many other farmers like me in this region, Hire adds.On Saturday, the state government approved Rs 10,000 crore as immediate relief to the farmers who have suffered crop loss in the state. Affected farmers are, however, concerned over whether this would be enough to help pull them back fromthe brink.The real impact of this crisis will start unfolding next month when cities start facing a shortage of vegetables and agricultural produce. There needs to be a long-term plan for the revival of this distressed sector. As of now, this seems to be absent, Ravindra Borade, chairman of Nashik division of Maharashtra State Grape Growers Association said."

Other crops lost include jowar, bajra, maize, vegetable and fruits. The otherwise drought-prone Aurangabad division is the worst-hit, with over 60% or 22 lakh hectare of the cultivated area damaged.Officials said there was delay in arrival of rains this year, which affected sowing in many areas, and now, farmers are facing huge losses due to unseasonal rain. ""This has been a difficult season for farmers in the state,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis, who chaired a review meeting on Friday to assess the losses, has asked the state administration to complete field surveys in the next few days to know the exact number of affected farmers. He has also directed that a grievance redressal mechanism be set up at district level for farmers to register their complaints. A meeting of the cabinet sub-committee has been called on Saturday to discuss the issue.Fadnavis said, ""The state has experienced four cyclones in the last four months, and due to the Kyarr super cyclone, in the last two weeks of October, there was major rainfall that caused big crop losses. We have asked for field surveys to be done, and even photos taken by farmers and the local administration will be considered as proof. He said production estimates for this year were very good. ""A lot of the crop was also harvested and kept, but it has been lost,"" Fadnavis noted.The state government has also decided to send a memorandum to the Centre to seek monetary aid for farmers.Of the kharif crops, mung and urad have been harvested, a state agriculture department official said.""Seeds have automatically germinated under the intense spells, damaging the crop. In some areas, entire farms were waterlogged for days, rendering them useless. This is the first time in several years that it rained so hard in October. The showers were above normal on several days in a month when it does not rain much,"" the official said.The actual yield from this kharif season will be known after three weeks. The agriculture department usually has some rough production estimates around this time of the year, but the showers have hampered this exercise too.""Jowar, bajra and vegetables like onions and tomatoes have been washed out due to the rain in October which led to rotting of crop roots,"" Vijay Thube, director of Shashvat Krushi Vikas Producer Company, said. ""Our farmers from western Maharashtra provide vegetables to markets like Mumbai and Pune. Unfortunately, we now have very little to sell,"" he added.Over 100 farmers registered with farmer producer group Krushi-Vikas Farmer Producer Company Ltd in Haveli are in a fix. ""Around 70% of crops in our region have been destroyed. I had sown leafy vegetables, sugarcane, cabbage and cauliflower. The nullah next to the fields began overflowing after heavy rain in October, and all the water entered my fields. Crops that were about to be harvested were waterlogged for days,"" Amol Jachak, who heads the firm, said.Ajit Thorat, a farmer in Ambegaon taluka, said 90% of the grapes in his vineyard were destroyed, while there was 100% damage to crops like soybean and onion. ""I have never seen so much rain in October. The damage is significant,"" he said.Kalidas Apet, Shetkari Sanghatana leader from Beed, said the government is inactive and insensitive to farmers' demands. ""The losses are huge, but the government is not bothered. We have demanded this be declared a national disaster and relief given as per the National Disaster Management Act,"" he said. He added that a large number of farmers facing losses are not covered under crop insurance and will solely rely on government relief."

The best part of our job is when guests recognise our efforts and pay us compliments for the hard work.What trends are you noticing regarding wine and food pairings?Gone are the days when rule books were followed. Now the trend is less formal and more contemporary. The guests we get are open to experimentation. Theme dinners with wine and food is one of the most sought-after trends.What was your biggest disappointment as a chef?While I am aware that there is stiff competition in the market, it breaks my heart to see a team member leave. My vision for the team is to continuously strive to present them with exciting career opportunities, and it has always been my endeavour to deliver this. As an executive chef, it is hard for me to see talent go, and I try every possible way to retain them.What do you always avoid ordering on a menu?I avoid ordering spicy food off the menu as it always kills the taste and flavour of any dish. Authentic dishes with high spice level is fine but if the dish is generally spicy, I would definitely avoid it.Of the dishes you prepare, which one would you never eat yourself? Why?As a chef, there is nothing that I make and would not personally try. It is imperative for me to first be convinced myself before I offer it to my guests.Which is your favourite restaurant? What would you prefer to eat there?One of my favourite restaurants would be Sri Murlidhar Veg in Narayanpeth, Pune, which has been serving home-style thali since the last 60 years.Describe one incident when you messed up a recipe real bad.The incident took place during the early stages of my career at a food competition in Mumbai. I somehow messed up the recipe of a flourless chocolate cake during the competition. However, I managed to salvage the situation by recreating the recipe by following the instruction clearly next time, and that worked well for me.What is the best recent food trend?Zero waste is a trend that all chefs must adopt. Chefs are using leftover ingredients to create something new, whether it is using broccoli stems for purees and soups, dried tomato skin as garnishes or for making powders.I also believe in procuring ingredients from local farmers and avoid imported food items wherever possible.

It is just one of those food groups that looks deceptively simple but takes years of expertise. Even as continental fast food joints crop up in the city every other day, only a handful serve burgers that are just right to please a bun and patty loving heart. And parking itself firmly in the sparse list is the Blue Restro & Lounge of PGS Vedanta which is hosting a pizza and burger fest until November 17.At first glance, the menu seems run-of-the-mill. But, on a closer look, one notices subtle nods to flavours and cuisines that make the items truly global. The dishes on the menu are fusion preparations. Despite pizza being originally from Italy, we have added Asian and Mediterranean twists. Malai tikka pizza and dragon chicken pizza are two examples, says Shivadas P M, executive chef at the hotel.The marinara pizza is a seafood lovers delight. Topped with squid, prawns and fish chunks, the meat complements the saucy and cheesy flavours of a traditional pizza. For vegetarians, the classic Neapolitan will not disappoint but the winner is the prosciutto E funghi, a salsa-like spread that covers a generous cheese base peppered with sliced mushrooms. Garnished with freshly chopped cilantro, the pizza retains the crunch of tomatoes rendering an incredible lightness to the bread.Notwithstanding all the pizza options, a dining experience at the Blue Restro & Lounge would be incomplete without sampling at least one of their trademark burgers. Served with plentiful french fries and condiments like coleslaw and pickled vegetables, the most popular on-the-go food gets a gourmet makeover.The double patty cheese burger is rather a conservative name for the giant beef overload that comes to you on a wooden slab. Quite intimidating, you have no option but to abandon your table etiquettes and just dig in. Stretch your mouth all you can and you still cant bite into the entire burger at one go. Imagine a bun stacked with a couple of layers of veggies, a thick patty grilled with a cheese slice and sunny side up egg times two and it is sure to give you a food coma.But the grilled BBQ vegetable is a real show-stealer, a fresh take on the modest vegetable burger, this one come with a mountain of sliced aubergines, zucchini, tomatoes and bell peppers glazed in balsamic vinegar as stuffing between the buns. The zesty veggies are a refreshing alternative to the traditional patty which is inconspicuously absent.All the elements that go into the burgers are prepared fresh by the chefs. We grill the patties only once the order is placed so the juices in the meat remain intact, adds Shivadas."
2019-11-02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/where-rats-have-a-field-day/article29863649.ece,Where rats have a field day,"On the landscaping section of the Marina, green is offset by hickory-brown. There is no aesthetics attached to this colour combo. Sandwiched between the beachs well-trodden promenade and its service lane, the green patch is actually marred by burrows dug by rodents. The problem is quite extensive, stretching from the Marina swimming-pool area to the Light House. To state the obvious, it is not just a blight on the landscape, but a public-health hazard.At the very least, for the past couple of weeks, the problem seemed to be getting out of hand, with the rodent presence being noticed even by superficial observers. They usually come out of the burrows in large numbers in the evenings. Food leftovers carelessly cast aside by visitors is the major attraction for the rats.The burrows are largely found on the fringes of the landscaped area, close to the short enclosure walls on which visitors park themselves and have food.Public-health officials at the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) admit there is a rat-infestation problem that raises its snout now and them.We use rodenticide to deal with the problem, which we try to keep down to a manageable level, explains P. Madhusudhan Reddy, Deputy Commissioner (Health), GCC. The rat population at the Marina include regular rats and the bigger-sized Indian mole-rats. The latter can be belligerent, and this writer has been witness to how they boldly wrest paper-plates with leftover food from crows.On the morning of November 2, a team of GCC officials and workers led by Health Officer for Zone 9, E. Saraswathi Sainath, carried out a rodent-eradication exercise.Following the usual-followed procedure, half-cut tomatoes smeared with rodenticide paste were placed in the burrows. The burrows were also closed.During the rainy season, it is considerably difficult to control rat population, as the paste often gets washed away in the rain. A rodent that has ingested rodenticide will have considerable thirst, and during rains, there will be water at hand for it to drink. Once it drinks sufficient water, the rodenticide will lose its effect. So, during heavy rains, we only close the burrows and keep the rodenticide exercise for later, when the weather is more suitable for it, says a Corporation official.The method may sound squeamish, but that is the only way the rodent population is being kept under control now.Rodent-control exercise at the Marina is carried out on a weekly basis. As Marina cuts through five wards in Zone 9, the exercise calls for considerable coordination. Also, during the monthly food raid, the same activity is carried out under the supervision of entomologists from Zones 6 to 10, says Saraswathi.A cyclic processObviously, the problem and the solution are trapped in a quickly-recurring cyclic process. Is it possible to break out of it, and find a method that may be more lasting? The better question would be: Is it possible to keep food leftovers particularly out of this space?People are not supposed to be at the landscaping area, and that explains the steel enclosures. However, in some patches, they have been broken and so people gain access to the area. Conservancy workers at the Marina do clear the carelessly-throws food plates, but given the number of visitors to the beach, it is quite a handful for them, explains Saraswathi. Tackling this issue requires considerable cooperation from the public.How a food plate changes hands, beaks and clawsA human hand flings a paper-plate with leftover food sticking to it. Thats the beginning of a journey for the carelessly-discarded plate. A murder of crows swoops down on it, and pecks away at the morsels. Three rats wait in the wings, expectantly. Following movement of human feet nearby and some shooing, the crows take to wing, leaving the food plate all to the rats. Out of the blue, another contender arrives on the scene. A dog sees an evening snack and snatches the plate from the rats. The plate would have been spared this buffeting around if it had been deposited where it belongs  the dumpster. At many sections of the Marina, there is a pair of dumpsters to be found  one for wet waste and another for dry waste. However, most of the time, they are silent witness to such food tussles."
2019-11-02,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/nov/03/catch-of-the-times-2055621.html,Catch of the times,"Shilpi Madan ByExpress News ServiceYoure tucking in a repository of selenium and Omega-3 fatty acids as you fork through the harissa-stroked sea bass or crunch your molars on the tortilla-crusted fish, or even tuck in that limey pate. There is something about the sea bass, with its gleaming silver scales, that serenades your taste buds that makes it so attention-worthy as the other piscean cousins jockey for desperate visibility on the menu. Heres the lowdown.THE BASS NOTEAce chef Prateek Sadhu of Masque, Mumbai, minces no words as he explains the relative low popularity of the desi sea bass a la Bengali Bhetki, Keralite Kalanchi as opposed to the superstar status enjoyed by the Chilean sea bass (the rechristened Patagonian toothfish). The popularity of the faux Chilean sea bass has a lot to do with the wildly successful marketing gimmick behind it, he laughs. Of course, it is a very accommodating fish that pairs well with a lot of flavours, but it really is just a very well-spun story. It is a classic case of lack of awareness. If people stop asking for Chilean sea basswhich they really shouldand we were to start talking about Asian sea bass with the same passion, we could probably turn its fate around too. Though I am not biasedas long as fish is fresh and responsibly caught. We do use barramundi quite often at Masque. Bhetki too is a versatile fish to cook withit is sturdy and not overly fishy, with a mild flavour that lends itself well to a number of our preparations.Price points play a pivotal role in determining the choice of the marine used at upmarket eateries. Locally available sea bass pegs the gourmet gospels at more affordable rates. Says Chef Daya Singh of CinCin, Mumbai. We work with the Asian sea bass at our restaurant CinCin. Since it is locally sourced, freshness of the catch is assured. I marinate the sea bass in a mixture of Italian herbs for half an hour to lend it a flavour canvasas it offers a blank slate. It isnt really as flavourful and fleshy like the Chilean sea bass. While this dish comes together with simple pan-frying of the fish together with sautd vegetables, I add Kalamata olives to bring in a spot of extra acidity to the dish: this adds a wine-like sweet and sour layer to the preparation.Chef Sahil SinghTHE GROOMING GUIDEOn domestic turf, people often confuse the Vietnamese basa (often pumped with chemicals for whitening) as sea bass. How do you discern between the two? For starters, find yourself a trusty fishmonger,  says Prateek with a laugh. Judge the fish. The flesh of the sea bass will be thick and firm, whereas basa can feel a bit mushy. The eyes of the fish should look clear and sharp, not hazy, and the gills should be bright, he explains, pointing out that the selection and storage of the bass is equally important to the making of your dish. Store it belly side down on ice. For fillets, do not freeze directly over ice but in the fridge. Make use of the fish within 24 hours for best effect.SCORECARDA protein powerhouse, the Chilean sea bass ranks high on both the taste and health charts simultaneously. Says Chef Sahil Singh of Tygr, Mumbai, As sea bass has a delicate flavour, you must ensure that the fish flavour is not overpowered with the sauces or marinades. For instance, I have come up with a simple grilled Chilean sea bass fillet with chickpea mash, tomato and basil: the combination of flavours works beautifully. The benefits are abound in the flavour palette too. Sea bass fobs off inflammation in the human body too and is a great immunity booster. Adds Daya, Since it is fleshier than its Asian peer, and richer in fatty acids, it makes for a great fork in, minimal flavouring or seasoning while cooking it. Make sure the scales of the fish are hard when you buy it."

But even on other days, the air is 6-10 times worse than normal levels.We need to understand that we are breathing bad air all year long. While the spike is going to cause trouble in acute symptomatology, we need to accept that year-round exposure is dangerous  particularly for children. This needs to be addressed.Any preventive measures?AdvertisingSome of these effects may be reversible. If pollutant levels come down significantly, one can witness some improvement in lung function. Regular preventive measures obviously include medications and avoiding going out.How helpful are medications and inhalation therapies?Someone with asthma would need medicines to control inflammation in the airways. If pollutants worsen symptoms, use of such therapies will definitely increase. Several people perceive use of nebulisers and inhalation medications as strong medicines; on the contrary, it is a much lesser dose."

Vegetables like brinjal and tomato are priced at Rs 50/kg while other vegetables including bitter gourd, raw banana, beans, ladys fingers, cabbage, cauliflower and ridge gourd are priced above Rs 70-80 per kg.The surge in onion prices is attributed to higher prices at source market, Nasik district of Maharashtra being the major supplier.Sources at Kuberpuri said according to the wholesale market for onion and potato at Aiginia on the city outskirts, retail price should be maximum Rs 50/kg. It is job of retail traders to display both wholesale and retail prices at their counters.

The monthly budget of an average Malayali is likely to be affected soon owing to a steep increase in the prices of some essential vegetables. The items that saw a hike in prices include two of the basic ingredients in every Malayalis platter  onion and garlic.The prices of onion and garlic have gone up mainly because of the shortage in supply. Most of the central and northern states and neighbouring Karnataka received heavy rain in October, affecting the production. This has led to a demand-supply mismatch. Kerala, too, has been witnessing heavy rain for the past few weeks. As vegetables are highly perishable, traders cannot take the risk of keeping additional stocks, said Nazeer M M, a trader at Kakkanad.The traders said the prices will remain high until new stocks arrive.The prices of onion, shallot (small onion), garlic, potato and tomato have increased steeply. The price of just one kilogram of garlic has increased by Rs 90 from the last month, to cross Rs 200 mark this month. Likewise, the price of small onion has increased by Rs 35 from last moth. Fortunately, the prices of many other vegetables remain stable.According to traders, more local produce are expected to hit the market in two weeks. Under the Palakkad zone, vegetables will be procured from Vadakarappathi, Perumatty, Elevancherry, Kollengode and Kizhakkencherry.Prices have mainly gone up for the items brought from other states. According to traders, the October rain that lashed states like Maharashtra  one of the major suppliers of onion to Kerala  had led to the price hike, said Uma P, Palakkad district manager, Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Kerala (VFPCK).The prices will become stable if more local produce are brought to the retail market. After the recent floods, our domestic vegetable production has gathered momentum. We expect that cowpea, bitter gourd, snake gourd and tomato grown in various areas in Palakkad will reach the market in the coming weeks, Uma said."

Prices surged ever higher over the last few days, with onions currently being sold at Rs 80-Rs 90 per kg in retail outlets in the state capital of Bhopal.The prices are peaking in other cities as well.Excessive rains this year destroyed the onion crop in both MP and Maharashtra, which is another prominent supplier of the commodity, leading to a short supply that pushed up prices, said Rajendra Saini, a wholeseller at the local Karond Mandi.Saini said onions were selling at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale market on Thursday, adding the situation would be the same unless supplies improve drastically in the near future.Saini said the same is the case with other vegetables. Garlic prices have shot up almost five times, selling at Rs 150 a kg in the city. While the price of tomatoes has increased from Rs 25 per kg to Rs 40-Rs 50 per kg over the last few days, potatoes are now selling at Rs 20 per kg as compared to Rs 7 per kg earlier.Salim Khan, a vegetable vendor from Bittan Market, said most of the vegetables were selling at Rs 10 to Rs 25 last year.Onion prices are slightly lower in Indore, which is based in the onion-growing region of Malwa and Nimar. Since farmers with inferior quality of tainted onions, fearing rotting, are unable to send their produce long distances, they dump the crops in Indore mandi, said another Indore-based whole-seller Ajay Agarwal.To prevent rotting, suppliers are buying old stocks of onions and mixing them with the new inferior stock in order to enable the consignments to reach long distances without rotting, he added. Agrawal said onions are selling at Rs 45-Rs 48 per kg in wholesale markets and Rs 60-Rs 70 in retail markets.If the weather and supplies improve, only then will the prices of onions and other vegetables cool down, said Agarwal, blaming the dwindling supplies on heavy rainfall. MP has witnessed 148% of the normal rate of rainfall this year, with the agricultural-rich Malwa-Nimar regions primarily bearing the brunt of the rain fury.Most traders believe the prices will reduce once the supplies improve and fresh stocks hit the market, which could take within a fortnight to a month.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

As soon as a couple of trucks reach the city the prices fall, as was observed around November 8. However, the entire fleet, which started from Nashik in Maharashtra, has yet to reach the city. So, supply has run out quickly, driving up the prices, said Parlad Singh, president of the Apni Mandis Association.PRICES HIGH IN NASHIK TOOTruck drivers were also reluctant to go back to Nashik to pick up supplies as onion prices over there had increased, said KK Abrol, president of the Chandigarh Transport Association (CTA).Because of bad weather, the onion crop there was affected and prices have gone up. Our margins for transporting onion back to the city have fallen so many truck drivers are choosing not to go down to Maharashtra to transport onion, added Abrol.Meanwhile, officials of the Sector 26 vegetable market said that onions from Rajasthan were selling in the wholesale market for around 50 per kg.However, the quality of these onions is much poorer compared to the ones from Nashik, so they dont find many takers.ADMN WATCHING SILENTLYChandigarh administration officials have said that no steps have been taken to control prices. There is a problem with supply but it will be resolved in a few days, an official said on condition of anonymity.Tomatoes also maintained a high of 50 per kg after selling for 30 last month even as Punjab mandi board officials pointed to irregularity of supply affecting prices.Supply from Himachal Pradesh has been erratic, and tomatoes get destroyed even when light rain occurs. The local crop of tomatoes will be in the market soon and will drive down prices, they said."
2019-11-12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-silver-lining-to-the-kc-valley-project/article29956197.ece,A silver lining to the KC Valley project,"Sixty-five-year-old Chowdappa is taking out his bicycle to head home for lunch in Chowdadenahalli, Kolar. With the south-west monsoon continuing well beyond its usual season, it was an opportunity for farmers like him to make the most of the extended monsoon.He owns a one-acre farm where he grows ragi. We grow just enough to feed our family and not for sale. We can cultivate ragi only if there is rain. We did not get much rain this year too, but the last few days have been better. There is water in the kere (lake), which has helped this time, he said, adding that when he cannot do take up farming, he works as a daily-wage labourer.Another monsoon has passed, and according to the IMDs official figures for June to September, Kolar district, which had been declared drought hit seven times since 2011, had a 20% deficiency in rain this year too.Finally, something changed this year; borewells are slowly springing back to life, and lakes are filling up, pumping up water tables despite the failure of the monsoon. And people are giving credit to the controversial KC Valley project, which pumps treated water from Bengalurus sewage to tanks in Kolar district.In Bellur, 70-year-old Neerganta Ramaiah is resting under a tree with other men from the village. There was no water in the kere for nearly 20 years. If it rains, its our good fortune. I have five acres, and apart from ragi, maize and avare (lub lub), I even cultivated eucalyptus on one acre because I thought something is better than nothing. Due to the project, the borewell has started working again. We know it is dirty water, but we believe the earth has its way of treating it, he said.Another farmer Namgyappa vehemently argues: It is dirty water. There are no takers for it.M. Srinivas, whose farm is close to the Lakshmisagar lake, said the water was unfit for direct consumption. But we were in a dire position. This project has indirectly helped rejuvenate farms and fodder for cattle, he said, though saying it was too early to call the project a success.Project to fill 126 tanksC. Mruthyunjaya Swamy, secretary, Minor Irrigation Department, told The Hindu that the project, which aims to fill 126 tanks in the district, has filled 40 so far. We have pumped 2.5 tmcft overall and the aim is to pump 5.5 tmcft in one year. The daily discharge of 310 MLD of treated water from the BWSSB is being pumped into the project, with the Lakshmisagar lake being the first discharge point. The Srinivasa Agrahara lake is the last point. Around 20 km have been covered and we have another 25 km to go, he said.On Monday, the State government told the High Court of Karnataka that the Indian Institute of Science has been requested to study the environmental and public health impact of the KC Valley project.The water was never intended for direct use. The main aim was to help increase the groundwater level, and the treated water, once it enters the earth, is purified and helps push up groundwater. We have put up multiple checks in place and pumping is stopped immediately if there is any variation, said Mr. Swamy.Situation upstreamBut the scene is less optimistic upstream. Mahesh Kumar, 29, is tending to his marigold plants on a hot afternoon. His family also cultivates tomato, potato, brinjal, ridgegourd, and bottlegourd. Much of this is sold in Bengaluru city. Their profit margins are thin.For one kg beans, we are paid 10 to 15 in the market, 25 very rarely. Weekly once, we travel to the city in a tempo, for which we need to pay 100 for every 35 kg of produce. The borewells we drilled are 960 ft and 1,200 ft deep. The project has not helped those who are upstream. Due to the deficiency in rain, we leave one or two acres uncultivated, he said.Mr. Swamy said the project will cover the areas upstream in the second phase. By 2021, we hope to fill all tanks of Kolar, he said."
2019-11-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/how-a-farmers-producer-company-is-indias-largest-grape-exporter-6118374/,How a farmers’ producer company is India’s largest grape exporter,"Back in 2011, when Vilas Shinde decided to convert his farmer-entrepreneurs company into a full-fledged cooperative or Farmers Producer Company (FPC), there were economic and market-driven compulsions behind it.AdvertisingShindes journey as an agro entrepreneur had begun in 2004, when he, along with nine other farmers in Nashiks grape bowl, incorporated a privately-held company to undertake direct exports and help realise a better value for their produce. That very year, the fledgling firm shipped 4 containers of fresh grapes to the European Union (EU).2009, however, proved a watershed moment, when the EU rejected grape consignments from India after they were detected to have pesticide residues beyond acceptable limits. That, according to Shinde, was the trigger for forming the Sahyadri FPC, which, by 2013, had 550 farmer-shareholders.My idea was always to build a value chain specifically for small and marginal farmers. But now, we also realised the need for investing both in infrastructure and backend integration to enable farmers grow quality produce, he says.AdvertisingIn 2018-19, Sahyadri FPC exported 21,141 tonnes of grapes to the EU, Russia and UAE, while recording a profit of Rs 17.89 crore on total sales of Rs 360 crore. The latter also included domestic sales through 13 retail shops in Nashik and Mumbai. This company, which now has over 6,600 farmers, is also Indias largest grapes exporter.Sahyadri has a three-tier structure comprising the apex organisation itself, crop-wise FPCs and farmers under them. The mandate of the crop-wise FPCs (for grapes as well as tomatoes, pomegranates, bananas, guavas and other fruits & vegetables) is to provide technical support to farmers, apart from undertaking aggregation, grading, sorting and packaging of produce. The apex Sahyadri FPC handles post-harvest management, processing, distribution and marketing, both for exports and the domestic market.Sahyadris 65-acre campus at Mohadi village in Nashiks Dindori taluka today has infrastructure for packing, pre-cooling, ripening, cold storage and aseptic processing of the produce of its farmer-members. Equally significant is the backend integration system, wherein the plots of individual farmers are geo-tagged to allow the company keep real-time update of the crops growth and accordingly plan its harvest calendar. Besides remotely monitoring crop condition on the ground through an in-house IT platform, Sahyadri also claims to guarantee complete traceability of its farmers produce by embedding the related information in bar-coded packets.Shinde admits that price volatility in the commodities handled by his organisation presents its own unique set of challenges. Sahyadri has recently signed a contract with Hindustan Unilever to manufacture jam, squash and tomato puree for the latter. This, it hopes, would help cushion growers from production glut-induced price crashes and also improve capacity utilisation in the already-created processing infrastructure at the Mohadi complex.Shindes next target is to design an insurance product targeting grape farmers. The present so-called weather-based products are not subscribed, as their coverage does not reflect ground reality. For example, in Nashik, unseasonal rains happen in September and October, whereas the insurance cover offered is applicable only after November 15, he points out. The recent post-September heavy rains, the second time after 2017, has made the design of an effective insurance product all the more necessary."
2019-11-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rbis-choice-monetary-policy-committee-6120252/,RBI’s choice,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India is scheduled to meet in the first week of December. With various economic indicators indicating that growth has slowed down considerably over the past few months, the consensus so far has been that the MPC will cut the benchmark repo rate for the sixth straight time in December, bringing it below 5 per cent. It was expected that this accomodative stance would continue in the next year as well until there was firm evidence of a broad-based pick-up in growth. But the sharper than expected spike in headline retail inflation in October has complicated the policy choices before the MPC. Data from the National Statistics Office shows that headline retail inflation edged up to 4.62 per cent in October, up from 3.99 per cent in September, largely on the back of higher food inflation. This upswing, which is unlikely to reverse in the coming months, has created uncertainty over the future course of monetary policy.AdvertisingThe inflation data shows that food inflation has jumped to 7.89 per cent in October, up from 5.11 per cent in the previous month, driven by a surge in vegetables prices, especially of onion and tomatoes. This surge is unlikely to subside. Food inflation is likely to remain elevated over the coming months, driving up headline retail inflation. Core inflation, which is essentially inflation excluding food and fuel, has moderated further, however, signaling continued weakness in demand. In its last policy review, the RBI had lowered its estimate for growth this year to 6.1 per cent, down from its earlier assessment of 6.9 per cent. This estimate was based on growth coming in at 5.3 per cent in the second quarter, and ranging between 6.6-7.2 per cent in the second half of the financial year. But there is little possibility of the RBIs projections materialising as various high frequency indicators suggest that growth is likely to fall below 5 per cent in the second quarter. Thus, the MPC finds itself in a peculiar position of having to address the growth slowdown while inflation rises.Going by current trends, with little possibility of a meaningful recovery in the near term, the situation warrants further monetary accommodation. So, while the MPC should carefully assess the trajectory of food inflation, its primary concern should be to arrest the slowdown. It should frontload the rate cuts in its December policy, though the magnitude of the cut will depend on the extent to which growth deviates from the RBIs own projection. The shift to external benchmarking should lead to a quicker transmission of the cuts to the broader economy."
2019-11-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-world-on-my-plate/article29981759.ece,The world on my plate,"Last week, I had a doctors appointment. Once I was done, I wanted to have a good meal somewhere. I had heard about this restaurant called Article 21 in central Delhi, and thought a detour via Rafi Marg would do me some good. And it sure did.Article 21 is a new restaurant in Delhis Constitution Club. Its an area thats close to my heart, as I lived in the apartment block abutting the club for many years. The club has been done up in recent years and is now quite a plush place, unlike the somewhat seedy complex that it was when I lived in the neighbourhood.Some months ago, I heard that a restaurant had opened up there. Then, last week, someone said that the place had expanded and introduced a new menu.The food was very good and the prices were low. That piqued my interest. Its quite a big establishment and looks rather like the usual government-run restaurants.But the menu surprised me. It included various kinds of cuisines  from north Indian, south Indian and Anglo-Indian to Italian, Burmese, Chinese and African. I was, for instance, surprised to see on it a South African dish called the bunny chow (99). This hollowed out bread stuffed with spicy curry is one of Durbans most popular street foods.The restaurant opens at 8 a.m., and you can have your breakfast there: eggs to order (poached, omelette, fried, scrambled and so on), stuffed parathas, aloo puri and aloo bhaji (each 75).Any dish with the word Railways in it interests me. So we asked for the cutlets and in the meantime went through the other pages of the menu card.It had Amritsari Machchi (295), Martaban Murgh (299), Omelette Curry (149), Vegetable Khao Suey (249), Dhaba Mutton Curry (349), Prawn Moilee (399), Mutton Biryani (289), Chicken Biryani (219) and El Fungi (pasta with a mix of mushrooms in bchamel sauce for 179). And a host of other dishes.I decided I wanted the Nasi Goreng (with chicken, 229). And we asked for an Italian Green Chick Pizza  with pesto, roast chicken, cherry tomato and mozzarella (249).Each dish was superb. The cutlet had been browned just right, and the chicken filling, thick and creamy, was almost like a paste. It was light without being bland, and I enjoyed it immensely. The pizza was delicious too. The crust was thin, almost like a roti, and the pesto-tomato topping was delightfully tart.Best of all was my Nasi Goreng, an Indonesian rice dish that I am very fond of. The rice was fragrant, and had been lightly fried and browned with various kinds of spices. There were little minced chicken balls in the rice, and two chicken satays with a peanut sauce and some prawn crackers on the side.The rice came topped with an oozy fried egg. The egg went to my co-diner (I like my yolk well fried) and I happily dug into the rice. It was out of this world. I have had this dish in many places, including at luxury hotels, but this matched  rather, outdid -- the best. I am going to keep coming back to Article 21. The world will be on my platter.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Mehta, executive director of the SEA.As a result local soybean prices have risen to their highest in 3-1/2 years, making exports of soymeal uncompetitive, traders said.Lower soybean production could force India, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, to import more in 2019/20 marketing year that started on Oct.1, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.Other Crops HitThe deluge also hit cotton in the world's biggest producer.Cotton bolls were damaged by late rains in Maharashtra and Gujarat, which account for over half of the country's output, said Arun Sekhsaria, managing director of exporter D.D. Cotton.0Until a few weeks ago, industry officials such as Pradeep Jain, president of Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Factory Owners and Traders Association, were expecting a 20% jump in cotton production in 2019 from a year ago.But now Jain says the production could rise by 10 to 12%.Cyclone Bulbul also soaked the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal last week, damaging rice crops in these key producing states, said Nitin Gupta, vice president for Olam India's rice business.""Supplies from the new season crop for exports have been delayed by around two weeks,"" Gupta said.Sugar mills in Maharashtra, the No. 2 sugar state, were forced to delay the start of the new crushing season by a few weeks due to wet fields, said Prakash Naiknavare, head of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.The heavy downpours also elevated prices of vegetables such onions and tomatoes and lifted food inflation to 7.89% in October from a year earlier.That in turn pushed inflation above the central bank's medium-term target of 4% in October for the first time in 15 months. The untimely rains also delayed winter sowing of wheat, chickpeas, vegetables and other crops.""I need to harvest soybean before planting sugarcane. But soybean harvesting has already been delayed,"" says Chikhale.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

The 25-year-old chef who is hosting Oota, a week-long promotion of Mangalorean cuisine at Xandari Harbour in Fort Kochi, says, If I had a free hand I would host a 30 course dinner.Shriya was invited to the city by Guestronomy, co-founded in Januaray 2019 by experience curators, Sareeka John and Payal Bafna. Her menu is a showcase of her research and modernisation of traditional food. She and partner Varun Shetty were guided by food writer Antoine Lewis to prepare a questionnaire and collect data as they went about ferreting recipes from homes in the villages around Mangalore. I contemporise regional recipes but use traditional ingredients  lost veggies, old grains, for example jackfruit seeds. I elevate it to a level where it is presentable in a modern restaurant. But the flavours remain the same.The idea behind Shriyas singular culinary route is to promote underrated and unexposed Mangalorean food. I am trying to discover the cuisines of the different communities of the region. All coastal cuisines use coconut but it is used very differently in each. Shriya began her research with Bunt cuisine, which is rich and luxurious and moved into Konkani, Jains and Catholic food. The food of the Maghuveera, a fishing community is vastly different, as it is all about highlighting seafood, she says.An example of her style of cooking is the Tamboli, a cold coconut curry in Udipi cuisine. Her version is served as a soup featuring prawns smoked with lavancha (vetiver) roots. Vetiver is infused in drinking water in Udipi homes in the villages for fragrance and cooling, she says. She gives tender coconut water a twist prepping it up with fizzy soda and serves it as coconut Spritzer.Mangalorean food is a backyard cuisine. It is about all what is grown in the kitchen garden and farms of homes. The cuisine does not use tomatoes or fancy vegetables. It is about leaves and roots, gourds, pumpkins and millets. Primarily the food is non-vegetarian but in a 10-12 course meal you will find 60 % of it is vegetarian.Shriya plans to expand her research to three regions of Karnataka  Coastal, Malnad or hilly cuisine of Coorg, Sirsi and Jog Falls. She also wants to explore the cuisine of the North Karnataka plateau  Badami and Hampi. Malnad is known for its wild meat recipes-goose, quail and wild boar, while akki roti, rice bhakri and jowar roti, dry chutneys are from North Karnataka .Shriya credits her cooking style to her time at Ellipsis, an American restaurant in Mumbai which was focussed on free style cooking. Though she trained with Gaggan Anand, she says she found it ultra modern and too scientific for her liking.Food is about comfort. I want people to eat my food on a daily basis. I modernise it to an extent. Indian food is about generosity and flavour, so it can have a degree of fine dine setting. At my pop ups I encourage people to eat with their fingers, she says.(Oota is at Restaurant 51, Xandari Harbour, for dinner, till November 18. Dinner for one comes at  2,250.

After battling plastic menace with the support of children and the general public, the MCC on Friday launched a free breakfast for pourakarmikas, who are instrumental in keeping the city clean.Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath launched the programme to provide free breakfast to 2,400 pourakarmikas near Madegowda Circle in Rajivnagar in Shantinagar (Ward 11).Speaking at the function, the mayor said that the she was happy to relaunch the MCCs ambitious project to provide breakfast to pourakarmikas.The programme was introduced last year but discontinued after there were complaints from pourakarmikas about poor quality food served to them. So we had called fresh tenders to provide nutritious food. The health officers will conduct regular inspection, she said.As part of the programme, pourakarmikas who work in cleaning and working in underground drainage units will be served with 400 grams of food between 8 am to 10 am at designated points in the 65 wards. The food will be prepared in Rajarajeshwari Nagar where around 18 chefs and 12 assistants will be involved.During the launch, pourakarmikas were served with uppitu and kesaribath and a sweet apart from a mineral water bottle. The menu will be changed every day like uppitu, bisibele bath, idlis and sambar, curd rice, vegetable bath, tomato bath and lemon rice.MCC commissioner Gurudatta Hegde was present."

However, the pods can be cooked as well. Snowpeas are a good source of vitamins A, B6 and C. Besides they are an excellent source of dietary fibre and also contain folate and minerals such as potassium, said he told.He said that there are plenty of exotic vegetates that can be successfully grown in mid and high hills and can be a promising intervention for enhancing farmers income. These crops are best suited for intercropping with apple and other fruit crops."
2019-11-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/does-your-diet-include-vegetables-signs-you-are-not-eating-many-6122381/,Does your diet include vegetables? Signs you are not eating many,"Vegetables are healthy, but dont have many takers. For many  children and adults alike  consuming vegetables is an arduous task. And they would rather eat unhealthy than incorporate the wholesome goodness of all kinds of vegetables. But, if you do not eat vegetables, things could go wrong with your overall health. Here are some signs you need to up your nourishment game.BruisingAdvertisingVeggies contain everything, from protein and minerals, to vitamins. And if you do not eat them, your body will start showing a deficiency. When it is low on vitamin C, there will be an increased risk of bruising. And, who would want that? If you are seeing one too many bruises on your body, start consuming red bell peppers, kale, broccoli, dark leafy vegetables, to name a few.Being tiredBeing tired is a normal thing. It is your bodys way of telling you to slow down and get some rest. But, if you are tired all the time, chances are, you are lacking the goodness of vegetables. Vitamin B and iron deficiency can cause fatigue. Start eating leafy greens and starchy vegetables like kidney beans, asparagus, lentils, etc.Low immunityA slight change of weather and you are coughing and sneezing? This is a classic sign you are not healthy and need veggies to boost your immunity. The nagging cold is a sign your defenses are down. Stock your fridge with products which have vitamin C, like green leafy vegetables.Foggy memoryAdvertisingHaving trouble recalling things and focusing? You have lack of nutrients to blame for this. While occasional forgetfulness is okay, it should not slow you down on a regular basis. And if it is, chances are you need the goodness of vegetables to get you back on track. Have plenty of carrots, broccoli, corn, tomatoes and leafy vegetables.Muscle crampsAnother classic sign is having muscle cramps, especially when you are trying to exercise outdoors. You can easily get rid of this by having both fruits and vegetables. So, start eating well already.Getting stressed more often, and then running in circles to be able to deal with it, is also a sign."
2019-11-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/winter-is-coming-srinagar-6123319/,Winter is coming,"ON November 5, the Met office in Srinagar issued a warning: An active western disturbance and its interaction with cyclone MAHA is mostly likely to cause widespread moderate to heavy snowfall and (rain in plains of Jammu, Kashmir) in Ladakh during 6th to 8th November Low temperatures and heavy snowfall submitted for the information of general public.AdvertisingBut with the Valley yet to recover from the lockdown that came with the August 5 revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, with pre-paid phones and Internet connection still to be restored, the warning went largely unnoticed.On the morning of November 7, Srinagar and the rest of Kashmir woke up to a blanket of snow that brought the days temperature to a maximum of 6 degrees Celsius. Trees, which had given way under the weight of the snow on their canopies, lay uprooted across the Valley, power lines caved in and air transport was halted for two days. While electricity in Srinagar was restored after five days, large parts of the Valley continue to be plunged in darkness, nine days after the seasons first snow.On November 16, the J&K administration moved former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti from a Chashmi Shahi hut, where she has been under arrest since August 4-5, to a government quarter in Srinagar. Her daughter Iltija Mufti said she had been moved out because the hut where she was kept was not fully equipped for Kashmir winters.AdvertisingWith the Valley still snowed under, the new Union Territory administration, having moved to Jammu in the last week of October as part of the annual Darbar Move, was largely missing in action. The annual pruning of tree branches was mostly not done and the snow machines were missing from the roads.Despite repeated calls, Divisional Commissioner Basheer Khan was unavailable for comment.A senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, said the snowfall was unusually heavy this time and that the administration did its best to ensure the advisory reached people. He also said the government acted swiftly to ensure the roads were cleared after the snowfall.Also Read | Govt should not mistake us Nagas for KashmirEvery year, taking its cue from the apple harvest season, Kashmir begins to prepare for the four-month-long winter  stocking up essentials, pruning trees, preparing charcoal and covering water pipes with foam and clothes to prevent them from freezing. But this year, even before the chinar trees had started to shed their ripe, golden leaves, the lowlands of the Valley had witnessed the first snowfall of the season, sudden and heavy. From around two-and-a-half feet of snow in south Kashmirs Shopian to around 10 inches in most parts of north Kashmir on November 7, this was among the Valleys heaviest snowfall spells for the month.The unexpected winter took everyone by surprise: from the homemaker who hadnt brought out her kangri (the fire-pot tucked under pherans whose glowing charcoal embers keep Kashmiris warm during its bitingly cold winters), to the apple farmer who hadnt pruned his trees.35 per cent of apple trees in Valley damaged due to snowThe apple farmers, BaramullaIf it snows again, I will be finished, says Irshad Ahmad Bhat, shifting his gaze between the apple trees in his two-and-a-half-acre orchard and the skies. It is cloudy and the J&K Met office has predicted another spell of snow  the second in the first fortnight of November.Under the heavy snowfall this year, most of the apple trees in Bhats orchard, at Goshabugh village in Baramulla, have been damaged  some of them have been uprooted, some split down the middle, some have had their branches ripped off.It took us more than 30 years to raise this orchard. See what one spell of snowfall has done, he says, standing beside a tree whose trunk stands cleaved. The soil is moist, the trees are weak and the leaves are still on the branches. These trees wont stand any more snowfall, he adds.Kashmirs apple industry, a major contributor to the regions economy, is the biggest casualty of this years untimely snowfall. The snow, which came on the back of a dismal season marked by militant threats, government intervention and low market prices, has dealt the industry another blow. Official figures reveal that more than a third of the Valleys fruit trees have been damaged in the snowfall.The Valley accounts for around 75 per cent of Indias total apple production, making it a Rs 8,000-crore industry. Kashmir produces more than 18 lakh metric tonnes of apples, grown across 3.62 lakh acres and supporting a population of more than 40 lakh people.According to our preliminary loss assessment, 35 per cent of orchards have been damaged due to the unseasonal snow, says Horticulture Director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat. The damage has been particularly severe in Kupwara, Baramulla and Kulgam districts.Every year after the harvest season, fruit growers prune tree branches to reduce the surface area of the tree so that it doesnt give way under the weight of snow. But this year, with farmers delaying the harvest after militants warned them against plucking the fruits, the trees were not pruned. Pruning, which usually lasts until the end of December, is a specialised skill, with labourers in high demand immediately after the harvest season.With Internet still down, Bhat says he missed the J-K Met departments snowfall advisory. Even if he had, he says, he probably wouldnt have been able to save his trees since they werent pruned. Blaming the government for the loss, he says, Theydidnt do enough to make sure the weather advisory reached people.Other orchardists such as Shahnawaz Ahmad, who owns three acres of an apple orchard in Shopian, says he acted fast to limit the damage from the sudden snow. As the snow started to accumulate, we went into the orchard and shook the tree branches to remove the snow. That helped save many of my trees, he says.Recently, the Horticulture Department released ads on radio, informing growers on how to hasten the shedding of tree leaves so that the trees can be pruned. But the ads came too late: the snow had already damaged most of the trees.Two-hour night shift in outposts, down from eight hours, due to the coldSoldiers at crpf camp in sumbhal, bandiporaEveryone sayS Kashmir is heaven, says A K Roy, an Assistant Commandant of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at a camp of the 45 Battalion in Sumbhal, Bandipora. Around him lie heaps of snow speckled with dirt, and a steady drizzle picks pace. Of course, it is heaven, he continues, but only from April to October. After October, it is hell. Roy is originally from Bihar and this is his second posting in the Valley.To outsiders in the Valley, especially security personnel posted for the first time, Kashmirs long winter months can be harsh. Having brought in additional troops this summer, the government has made elaborate arrangements for them, including arranging one lakh thermal inner wear, more than 60,000 jackets, sleeping bags and blankets. The government has also constructed 70 insulated prefab barracks and issued 1,500 kerosene heaters to the troops.But nothing prepared a young personnel from Manipur to the sight he woke up to one night. It was around 3 am. It was snowing. I was ecstatic. I had never seen snow before in my life, says the soldier, who came to Kashmir four months ago. It was a bit cold and I wore my gamcha (scarf) and went out to see the snow. But as the morning drew closer, I started to tremble. The joy of seeing snow for the first time was over. There was no electricity at the camp and there was no way to escape the cold  only a kerosene stove, he adds.The kerosene stove is what sees paramilitary personnel through the Valleys winter months. More than a hundred kerosene stoves have been issued to the Sumbal camp, that has anywhere between 200 and 250 CRPF men. But the personnel say the stoves, though essential, are not enough when temperatures drop to sub-zero levels.As the Valleys farmers prepare for their harvest, it is the first sign for the CRPF to begin their winter preparations, starting with servicing and repairing of the kerosene stoves.We start preparing for winter in the last week of September. We get all the heaters from the store, get them serviced and repaired, if needed. We also make an assessment of how many new ones we need and purchase them, says Assistant Commandant Kailash Chandra, a resident of Rajasthan who looks after the administration at the camp. An icy cold draft blows through his room, small and dark and without electricity for the last eight days.The CRPF stores are well stocked with winter essentials such as snow boots, winter uniform and thermal wear, but the camp commander has little say in deciding when to requisition them. That decision is taken at the top, by senior officials in the Valley. A cold assessment is done and they decide when to provide what to the personnel, says Chandra. We get regular instructions. The snow boots, thermals etc are issued almost simultaneously throughout the Valley. Similarly, we also get specific instructions on when to issue the heaters and the stoves, he adds.The stove has its limitations, though  they are not allowed inside the mobile vehicle bunkers and they are almost useless in the camp outposts or the sand bunkers in the open. We are not allowed kerosene heaters inside the bunker vehicles because there is the risk of suffocation. But sometimes we manage to sneak one inside, and ensure there is some ventilation. How else can we survive this cold? says a CRPF personnel from Odisha recently posted in Srinagar.142 hours of power blackout in north KashmirThe Bashirs, Sopore, BaramullaOn the night of November 6, Madeeha Bashir, 18, was preparing for her Biology exam when the lights went out. A routine disruption, she thought, and switched on the power back-up at her home in Chinkipora in Sopore, south Kashmir. By morning, the power back-up packed up too. On November 9, the district administration announced that it would take five more days to restore lines.So for the next few days until her Biology exam on November 14, Madeeha studied by the candlelight. I also had to cut down on study hours. I usually study for more than 14 hours during exam season. But I could barely study for six hours, she says.In north Kashmir, we had a problem because transmission towers fell at five or six places. It takes around a month and a half to erect a new tower, says Chief Engineer, Power Development Department, Qazi Hashmat. But we have temporarily restored power by criss-crossing the lines onto other towers. It is a temporary arrangement. The permanent arrangement will take some time.Every year, the change of season brings with it a quintessentially Kashmiri ritual  families start to store essentials such as rice, pulses, dried vegetables, wood, gas cylinders and kerosene, besides getting the kangris and charcoal ready to tackle the freezing cold. This squirrelling away is essential as supplies to the Valley are often halted by landslides on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway.While Srinagar sources a lot of its supplies from Jammu and other parts of the country  fuel, gas cylinders, vegetables, rice and fruits  rural areas, which are largely self-sufficient, have an even elaborate winter preparedness plan.In July, when the vegetable output is in surplus, villagers sun-dry tomatoes, gourds, brinjals etc to store for the winter months.By the beginning of November, trees are pruned and the twigs are half-burnt into charcoal, a winter essential. Families also stock up on wood.Over the years, while Kashmirs traditional mud houses, with their small windows, made way for concrete homes, many of the new homes retain the hamam, a room with floor made of a locally sourced stone. Every morning, wood is burnt below this stone flooring, helping the room stay warm.The Bashirs dont have a hamam, but they have their own ways to beat the cold. This time though the family was caught unawares. We usually start preparing for winter after November 15. We didnt expect so much of snow so early, says Zainab Bashir, Madeehas mother.30-35 per cent of saffron crop damagedSaffron farmers, PamporeThe sudden drizzle on the evening of November 6 left Ghulam Mohammad Pampori with a knot in his stomach. He was planning to harvest his saffron crop the following morning  the third and final major picking of the golden spice  and he was hoping to finish the job before any showers, which usually end up tearing the delicate stamens of the saffron flowers.As he woke up in the morning, his worst fears had come true: a thick blanket of snow covered his two-and-a-half-acre saffron field, burying the small flowers and with it the hopes of saffron growers.Over the last around two decades, the saffron fields of Pampore have rarely had reasons to cheer  incessant rain or long dry spells have reduced saffron production, from around 30,000 kg in the 1990s to a meagre 6,000 kg last year. This year, going by the first two phases of harvest, farmers had hoped for a turnaround. But that ended with the sudden snowfall of November 7.We have never seen so much snow this early in the season, says the 70-year-old Pampori. There have been instances of early snowfall before, but the snow was never more than two to three inches. This time, there was at least 16 inches of snow in my field.The harvest season for saffron usually lasts a month  from mid-October to mid-November  and the harvest is done in phases. Spread across 8,000 acres, the saffron fields of Pampore produce on an average more than 3,000 kg of saffron every year.Pampores saffron farmers say that this season, in the absence of the Internet, the governments snow alert never reached them. But even if we had got the alerts, I dont think we could have done anything, says Adil Majeed, who grows saffron on his one-and-a-half-acre farm. Thats because you need to wait for the flowers to bloom properly before the stamens are plucked. And the flowers were not in full bloom, he adds.AdvertisingThe snow is only the latest adversity to hit the saffron growers, who are already distressed over the import of Iranian saffron. Jammu and Kashmir produces only 8,000 kg a year while Iranian saffron is imported in tonnes. How can we compete with that even though their quality is no match? says Pampori. We were already broken, the snow has now covered us like a shroud."

2019-11-16,https://www.news18.com/news/india/untimely-rains-hit-indias-summer-crops-delay-rural-economy-recovery-2-2389093.html,"Untimely Rains Hit India's Summer Crops, Delay Rural Economy Recovery","Kalamb (Maharashtra): Heavy rains in October and November have brought more misery to India's farmers, after summer-sown crops such as soybean, cotton, rice and vegetables suffered rain and flood damage during the wettest June-September monsoon season in 25 years.""We couldn't harvest soybeans last month due to continuous rainfall,"" said Shantabai Chikhale, 65, while harvesting with her son on a one acre plot in Maharashtra, India's second largest soybean production state.Chikhale had been expecting a bumper crop, but now estimates that two-thirds of the soybean pods on her farm in Kalamb village were knocked off by the rains, while much of the remaining crop has been damaged.The recent wet spell is also forcing farmers, like Chikhale, to delay sowing winter crops, placing a further drag on the rural economy at a time when India's economic growth has slumped to a six-year low.After the ample monsoon rains, The Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) had expected India soybean harvest to be more than 10 million tonnes, just a little down on 2018's 10.3 million tonnes.But heavy recent rains damaged the crop in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which account for more than 85% of India's output, and forced the trade body to cut that estimate to below 9 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the SEA.As a result, local soybean prices have risen to their highest in 3-1/2 years, making exports of soymeal uncompetitive, traders said.Lower soybean production could force India, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, to import more in 2019/20 marketing year that started on October 1, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.OTHER CROPS HITThe deluge also hit cotton in the world's biggest producer.Cotton bolls were damaged by late rains in Maharashtra and Gujarat, which account for over half of the country's output, said Arun Sekhsaria, managing director of exporter DD Cotton.Until a few weeks ago, industry officials such as Pradeep Jain, president of Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Factory Owners and Traders Association, were expecting a 20% jump in cotton production in 2019 from a year ago.But now Jain says the production could rise by 10 to 12%.Cyclone Bulbul also soaked the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal last week, damaging rice crops in these key producing states, said Nitin Gupta, vice president for Olam India's rice business.""Supplies from the new season crop for exports have been delayed by around two weeks,"" Gupta said.Sugar mills in Maharashtra, the No. 2 sugar state, were forced to delay the start of the new crushing season by a few weeks due to wet fields, said Prakash Naiknavare, head of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.The heavy downpours also elevated prices of vegetables such onions and tomatoes and lifted food inflation to 7.89% in October from a year earlier.That in turn pushed inflation above the central bank's medium-term target of 4% in October for the first time in 15 months.The untimely rains also delayed winter sowing of wheat, chickpeas, vegetables and other crops.""I need to harvest soybean before planting sugarcane. But soybean harvesting has already been delayed,"" says Chikhale.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

2019-11-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dushyant-chautala-haryana-pm-said-things-against-nitish-i-was-called-monkey-these-are-political-statements-not-a-commitment-6123367/,‘PM said things against Nitish… I was called monkey. These are political statements… not a commitment’,"The 31-year-old Dushyant Chautala led the 11-month-old Jannayak Janata Party to victory in 10 seats in the Haryana Assembly elections recently, and showed political astuteness by allying with the BJP and securing the post of Deputy Chief Minister for himself. With his win from Hisar Lok Sabha seat last time, he had become the youngest MP ever. Last year, the Uchana Kalan MLA split from his family-run Indian National Lok Dal and formed the JJP. Recently, Chautala told the Assembly that the state government would bring a Bill in the next session of the House to provide 75% reservation for Haryana residents  one of the JJPs main poll promisesAdvertisingMANRAJ GREWAL SHARMA: The 10 seats that you won in the Haryana Assembly elections were on a mandate against the BJP. By allying with the party, havent you betrayed those who voted for you?The mandate was not only against the BJP but the Congress too. Going with the Congress or the BJP It was the same call for us. Our agenda was to establish a stable government in the state. With the Congress, we could not have made a stable government because they did not have the numbers. We would have been short by five (MLAs).We have agreed on a Common Minimum Programme with the BJP, and a committee with two MLAs, one from each party, has been set up for it Our priority is 75 per cent reservation in private jobs. A Bill shall be introduced in the next Vidhan Sabha session. Before that, my target is to get it passed through the Cabinet as an ordinance so that we can have 75 per cent employment in every corner of the state.AdvertisingMANRAJ GREWAL SHARMA: There is a lot of anger amongst youngsters about the lack of jobs.Apart from Tripura, which is a very small state, we (Haryana) have the largest number of unemployed (people). I have mooted 75 per cent quota for locals in jobs in the state. Unemployment is also impacting the Goods and Services Tax returns. Nobody has ever reported a story on revenue losses due to the GST. It is because the GST is collected at the base where (the product) is consumed and not at the place where it is produced. Today, most of the GST collection is from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, but the net losers are Haryana, Punjab and states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand, which are producing more than they are consuming. If we do not create employment within the state, consumption will not be much. If someone from outside finds employment in Haryana, they take revenue back to their state, and the consumption will happen there. It is this loss (of revenue) that we are facing. Our state is facing a crisis of more than Rs 1,500 crore per annum  these are my own figures and not the governments. Recovery will happen when we begin to employ people of our own state in private companies.VARINDER BHATIA: Can you elaborate on the Common Minimum Programme agreed upon between the Jannayak Janata Party and the BJP?I have analysed the BJPs manifesto, and about 60 per cent of the points are common with our manifesto. We will have people from the manifesto committee and bureaucracy implement the policies as soon as possible. We have to analyse and get the best results out of both manifestos. There are things in the BJP manifesto which can be worked out with the JJP manifesto. One of their points is to increase (old-age) pension. We want it to be Rs 5,100. So we have to come to a mutual conclusion over the amount.When I analysed the (plan to) increase salaries of sarpanch and zila parishad members, from Rs 3,000 to Rs 8,000, and Rs 1,600 to Rs 4,000, respectively, it showed a budget increase of Rs 70 crore per annum and that is not a big number for the government. The government can spend the amount to streamline the panchayati raj system. A sarpanch spends Rs 3,000 on one days travel to Chandigarh, because there are four tolls on the way. There is expenditure on fuel and food. How can he travel twice or thrice a month to Chandigarh on a salary of Rs 3,000? A policy change is needed. We have to work on the idea.Read | Chautala family united, parties are different, says DushyantVARINDER BHATIA: How will you generate funds for providing pension of Rs 5,100 per month?We have to see If we ensure 75 per cent reservation in employment for our own people, our consumption will increase, and our budget will also increase by approximately Rs 9,000 crore through GST collection. Taking some Rs 800 (crore) out of the Rs 9,000 crore is what? Its not even 10 per cent. Cant we invest that 10 per cent into development of people who require help, especially people who are in their old age.CHAHAT RANA: In the Common Minimum Programme, what do you have for women of the state?Our agenda is to provide support for mothers and their children. If you streamline the system and deposit an X amount into the account of mothers, I think it will become much easier for them to pay for the education of their children and other facilities, instead of running around departments (to get the money). As an MP, I have seen mothers seek funds for treatment of their children, or for their admissions, and complain about running between departments. Streamlining the system will help everybody. The biggest issue for a mother, till her children are 15 years of age, is to find ways to support them. And, if it is a single mother, the burden on her is double.KANCHAN VASDEV: You sought votes promising to bring about change. What is that change in Haryana now?I am in power as the Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana. Isnt that a change?SOFI AHSAN: But you proposed a new system and joined the old oneI will continue to fight against issues such as the medical scam (alleged wrongdoings in the purchase of medicines, equipment etc). People voted for us, against the Congress and BJP. There has been corruption in the past five years. I can assure you that there will be action taken against those involved in the SC/ST scholarship scam, mining scam, the medical scam There has to be change in the way things are run We will work together.MANRAJ GREWAL SHARMA: In Haryana, whenever a coalition government has been in power, the bigger party eats into the smaller party. Do you fear that?If you see what happened earlier, when Bansi Lalji (of the Haryana Vikas Party) and the BJP were in alliance or when (Om Prakash) Chautalaji and the BJP were in alliance the BJP, which was a minor partner in the alliance with the INLD and Bansi Lalji, is a major partner today. They came to power with full majority in 2014.It has been a challenge for us because we had to create the party in December 2018, get it registered in April and then we had to face three elections, including the bypolls. But see the increase in the peoples support. In the Lok Sabha elections, we got about 6 per cent of the votes and today we are at15 per cent. We had eight lakh votes and now we have 18 lakh. People have supported us to bring change and development in the state. Who knows what will happen in 2024 but I assure you that we (the BJP and JJP) will work together strongly till the next elections. We will focus on generating more employment; more industries have to come in The number of mobile companies in India has increased from four to 260, but how much of this has come to Haryana? Zero. We need to get Apple, Samsung and other such firms. They can ensure large-scale employment.VARINDER BHATIA: You said that action will be taken against the corrupt, but your own family members have been convicted in corruption cases.You need to define what corruption is. The case against my father according to the High Court judgment it is very clear that zero money was involved and no relative or party worker was given employment. Where is the corruption? There were two lists and nobody can prove which was original and which was not. The 3,206 JBT (Junior Basic Training) teachers were employed in 2000 and today it is 2019. They have done 19 years of government service and are still there. How can you call it corruption? Its not like Bihar or Uttar Pradesh where people went out of jobs and were thrown behind bars. There was a huge chunk of money involved. In the case of my father, I can make it very clear that he was not even a part of the state government. He was put behind bars because of a word that was put in the chargesheet  Bhai Sahab.Read | Meet the core team of Dushyant ChautalaVANDANA SHARMA: What is your stand on the cases registered against Jats for violence during the 2016 quota agitation?There was a statement issued by the BJP government that those cases will be taken back. We will work on it and I guarantee that some steps will be taken. But I think the matter is sub-judice and in the high court for now. It is too early to predict what will happen.VARINDER BHATIA: During the campaign, Union Home Minister Amit Shah called the Hooda and Chautala families termites of democracy. After the alliance, you went and presented him a bouquet.Political statements were also made by the Prime Minister against Nitish Kumar I was also called a monkey during the campaign. These are just political statements.MAN AMAN SINGH CHINNA: So all such statements should be taken with a pinch of salt in the future?It is not a political commitment its a political statement. If I start picking statements made by people in the Congress, or people who are supporting the Congress or anti-BJP statements made by people who are now in the BJP and were earlier in the Congress You cant do politics like that. You need to have a large heart and forgive and forget in order to move forward for the development of people. That is the main idea.SOFI AHSAN: Stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab has been blamed for the pollution in Delhi. How do you plan to tackle this?The cases (in Haryana) have not been registered by officers, but through satellite mapping  as per my information. Yes, paddy husk is burnt In the last decade we havent taken steps to reuse the waste. There have been power plants made in Punjab and Rajasthan. There is one power plant right next to my village, Chautala, which is in Rajasthan. It has a capacity of 3 MW and produces power out of agricultural waste  paddy, wheat or of any other crop. We need to set up the same in Haryana. The government has already approved one such plant in Panipat. But that is not enough. We need to expedite the process, there has to be a policy change. We need to build more waste-to-energy plants.Decomposer is another thing. There is technology being created in HAU (Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University) I have asked for a full report. They have built a dome where agricultural waste is put and the fuel produced can replace LPG, and can be supplied to one full village with a population of 5,000 people. If we can do that at a cost of Rs 15 lakh per village, people can convert waste to energy in their own village. This harks back to Gandhijis idea of a nation of self-sufficient villages.NITIN SHARMA: In its previous tenure, the BJP government faced flak for proposing a tax on the income of professional players.I will not dwell on what happened in the past. I know that we (Haryana) ensure one-third of the countrys medals. The 2020 Olympics is round the corner, our idea is to provide the best facilities at any expense to all those who are participating. We have wrestlers who have already qualified. We have a boxer also. We need facilities and we need international-level training. We were never in competition in table tennis We never won any medal in the Asian Games (in the sport). But now we have won three medals in the Asian Games Winning three medals in the Asian Games is equivalent to winning three medals in the Olympics because most of the countries participating in table tennis at the Olympics are Asian anyway. We dont have facilities for fencing in Haryana. I went for the Run for Unity at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Gurgaon and a group of five girls came up to me for a selfie. They informed me that they do gymnastics and that they dont have indoor facilities. This needs to be developed in the next five years. We have the capability but we also need to provide adequate facilities.During the elections, I got worried when I noticed that most of the counting booths were on sports grounds, which had been closed for six months  from the Lok Sabha to the Vidhan Sabha elections. We need to make sure that at least athletes get to access these stadiums.Read | Out of Tihar, Ajay Chautala says: I told Dushyant to go with BJPHINA ROHTAKI: According to you, which area needs immediate attention in the state?Its unemployment. That will be my prime focus. I will work 24/7 on this. We have huge employment opportunities in the state, and if we get 75 per cent share in that So I shall work towards that. Have you seen the Haryana government taxis in the state? The drivers are not from Haryana. Why dont we employ Haryanvis? Why cant we give our children training to become professional drivers? Where will Uber and Ola go then? They will have to hire our own people.JAGDEEP SINGH: What do you think is the reason for the economic slowdown?I have witnessed economic slowdown for the second time in my life. The first time was when I was in college in the US I have seen my batchmates, who drove Hummers, switch to cycles in a period of nine months. That kind of slowdown needs drastic steps. The Central government has taken one or two steps but they need to do more. We need foreign investment. We have a young economy We can fill the gap that China and US have failed to fill because they have an ageing population.SAURABH PRASHAR: The quality of education in the state is also not very good. Do you plan to focus on that?I promise you that in the next Budget the GDP share for education will be brought up to the level of BRICS countries such as Brazil. We have invested only 1.4 per cent of our GDP in education. Brazil invests about 4.8 per cent and China 6 per cent.We also need to focus on research. Not one university (in Haryana) has a patent. I was talking to the CM the other day Why do the IITs and IIMs survive? Their research brings in funds. We invest so much into our universities but what do we get back? There is one university, HAU, which used to give something back because it had dairy, horticulture and agriculture But Mr (former CM Bhupinder) Hooda took out veterinary section from agriculture When the BJP came to power at the Centre, they announced a horticulture university. However, instead of inaugurating another university, they just separated the horticulture department of HAU to make an independent university. Now only agriculture is left with HAU, which too is only limited to paddy and rice We have to take steps to merge these universities and make research the prime focus. I will work with the CM for that. We dont have to pay two vice-chancellors to run one institution.MANRAJ GREWAL SHARMA: What is your vision for the farmer?AdvertisingWe need to change the crop cycle and work with Israel on vertical farming. I went to Singapore as part of a government delegation and saw it has tomatoes growing at 20 feet through the year. I have tried it at my house where we have grown tomatoes under solar panels. We need to educate farmers instead of just providing subsidies and saying that we have done our duty."

Senthil Kumar on Saturday nabbed a 25-year-old youth on the outskirts of Madanapalle in connection with the case.The body of the girl, who came to attend a wedding with her parents at Angallu village of Kurabalakota mandal on November 7, was found behind the function hall the next morning.With the help of the CCTV footage, a blurry image of the accused was released to the media, and it went viral in the police department network all over India.The special party led by Deputy SP (Madanapalle) Ravi Manohar Achari and circle inspectors Sadiq Ali and Ashok Kumar picked up about half a dozen suspects, with features similar to the image of the suspect.When the police tried to reach one of the suspects, identified as Pathan Mohammad Rafi alias Rafi alias Giddu (25), a native of Molakavaripalle near Angallu village, he was found missing.Rafi was an accused in two criminal cases, which included an attempt to rape a five-year-old girl in 2009, and an attempt to molest a 12-year-old girl.With suspicion growing against Rafi, the police intensified the search for him. The day after the girl was found murdered near a spot close to his residence, Rafi had allegedly tonsured his head to evade detection.A lorry cleaner by profession, Rafi, reportedly escaped to a remote location in Chhattisgarh on the pretext of carrying a tomato load.The police took the help of the lorry owner in persuading Rafi, who was wary of returning, to come home. After he was convinced that he would be safe from the police, Rafi arrived on the outskirts of Madanapalle on Saturday, only to be nabbed by the special police party. He reportedly confessed to killing the girl."
2019-11-18,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/add-these-foods-to-your-keto-diet-plan-and-stay-healthy/articleshow/72094427.cms,Add these foods to your keto diet plan!,"The keto diet has become one of the most followed diet fads, and the discipline is being adopted by more and more people with the passing of each day. The notion that it quickens the process of weight loss seems to have resonated well in the minds of people, and results do seem to show a positive impact. The keto diet is based on the state of ketosis, which is a metabolic state wherein the body converts fat reserves into energy instead of carbohydrates, thus burning fat more efficiently and at a faster rate.The ketogenic diet consists of foods in which 75% of the calories are derived from fats, 20% from protein, and 5% from carbohydrates. Since most of the calories are obtained from fats, the body will enter a state of ketosis and end up burning more calories. There are many kinds of food that are included in a keto diet, such as animal products like eggs and chicken, dairy products like cottage cheese, and fruits like avocado. Today, we will look at 5 vegetables that you must include as a part of your keto diet.Half a cup of broccoli has just 2 grams of net carbs, and a majority of the calories comes from protein and fats. It is loaded with nutrients and contains fiber, which helps you lose weight by keeping you full for longer.With just 1.5 grams of carbs in half a cup of cauliflower, it makes for an excellent low-carb addition to your keto diet. Moreover, it is rich in vitamin C and folic acid, so you get an extra boost of nutrients.One serving of mushrooms has 20 calories, and just 2 grams of net carbs and 3 grams of protein. The rest is all fat, so it works well to provide your body with the fat needed to be used as energy. It also packs a healthy dose of nutrients and even boosts immunity.Apart from containing just 4 grams of net carbs per cup of fresh leaves, spinach is loaded with 6 grams of fiber, something that helps in increasing satiety. Spinach is also packed with vitamins and minerals, making for a healthy and keto-friendly vegetable.Tomato makes for an easy addition to not just to for a keto diet, but for most diets in general. Used as a taste enhancer in salads, as a part of vegetables and in gravies, tomatoes are everywhere. A medium sized tomato contains just 20 calories and 4 grams of net carbs."

Sources said the Maharashtra leaders will meet central leaders and then sit across the table with the NCP.Maharashtra has been under the Presidents rule since November 12. The returning monsoon this year, Pawar said had ruined almost every standing crop in major agrarian parts of the state. He said early 44 farmers in Nashik alone had committed suicide in the past 10 months.WATCH | Presidents rule in Maharashtra: All you need to knowThe Pawar-Modi meeting comes two days after the Prime Minister praised the NCP for their decision to not enter the Well of the house during proceedings.In the memorandum, Pawar said crops like soyabean, paddy, finger millets, corn, bajra and vegetables like tomato and onion were at the harvesting stage but incessant rainfall in Nashik completely ruined them.Owing to Presidents rule in the state, the NCP chief requested Modi to intervene and ensure immediate steps to provide relief measures to ameliorate distressed farmers.In the memorandum, Pawar demanded zero per cent credit to farmers to raise new crops and to save them from being exploited by private money lenders or finance companies. Citing data, he said that cotton crops over 35,000 hectares had been damaged.He stated that the Maharashtra Governors recent announcement of Rs 8,000 per hectare for agricultural crops and Rs 18,000 per hectare for horticulture crops were too inadequate to compensate for the losses faced by farmers. Recalling his tenure as the Union Agriculture Minister, Pawar said that in 2012-13, farmers had received a compensatory amount of Rs 30,000 per hectare and a similar amount should now be disbursed.Pawar also invited Modi to a Sustainability conference  Innovation and Diversification in Sugar and Allied Industry  to be organised by Vasantdada Institute (VSI) from January 31 to February 2, 2020.-with PTI inputs The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Sankara Rao, a nature lover, developed a wonderful roof garden at home located at Kamakshi Nagar in Vizianagaram to create awareness among the people about the benefits of natural farming.Dr. Sankara Rao, who now works as anaesthesiologist at Maharaja Institute of Medical Sciences at Nellimarla in the district, says that people make use of the space in their homes to beat rising pollution and temperature.Growing vegetables, flowers and fruits ensures physical and mental well-being. Initially, it may come off as a tough job, but one gains confidence when one sees the plants grow, Dr. Sankara Rao added, who is also a writer.He won the first prize for his story Bahumati at a State-level competition organised by Manchupalli Satyavati Devi Foundation.Its when I am here that I ruminate on issues and get story ideas, he said, adding that spending time with Nature will be a soulful experience for anyone.Various fruits and vegetables that are grown at his place include coconut, mango, guava, sapota, orange, tomato, pumpkin, eggplant, bitter gourd and others.Dr. Sankara Rao, who represented Parvatipuram Parliament seat between 1999 and 2004, said he campaigned about zero based natural farming in his constituency and enlightened the people about the harmful effects of extensive usage of fertilizers and pesticides."

I am also trying very hard to stick to my truism that praise comes from me quite miserly. I am trying not to overstate the elation and rapture I felt, as I left the restaurant after eating that meal.So before I turn into a gushing fanboy, let me talk about Akerkar himself. Somewhere in the 90s, south Mumbais beau monde started prattling about how theatre actress Jinx Akerkars son had returned from abroad armed with an engineering degree and wanted to give it all up, to do some catering.I knew the Padamsees and the da Cunhas and Jinx had dabbled with The Theatre Group, so I heard the news too. Even at that time I thought to myself, that fellow must have gumption. The next nugget the grapevine brought in was that the Akerkar boy had started a catering service from home called The Moveable Feast, which did French-European food for home parties. This was a time when catering for parties from home meant you either slaved in the kitchen along with your cooks and maids, or hired a chef for the day or ordered in from an Indian or Chinese restaurant.Just as The Movable Feast was making the citys movers drool came Just Desserts. Along with AD Singh, Rahul appropriated Parisian Bakery and Caf, an Irani eatery in Fort, for the evenings. The caf downed shutters at 6 pm, and thats when Rahul and AD brought it alive with desserts and coffee. It was insane. Bombay thronged to this place; there was music, coffee, pastries, not only in the caf but flowing out onto the pavements and on top of bonnets of cars.Just Desserts then moved over the weekends to The Ripon Club, but permissions and landlord woes shut it all down.I lived at Breach Candy then. A faux hard rock caf had opened near China Garden, and Open House, under the Kemps Corner flyover, was quite the rage for burgers and stuff. One fine day, Open House shut and Under the Over opened. It was 1992 and we had never seen a caf like that in our little lives. Rahuls personality was written all over the smart, stylish, bright, simple restaurant. Twenty-seven years later I still remember the menu. Stuffed potato skins, cheesy nachos and chicken Dijonnaise (a creamy mustard sauce with bacon bits). And the piece de rsistance, the Hungry Mans Barbecue. Half a chicken roasted and smothered in a smoky, sweet and tangy sauce. And brownies and Baileys cheesecake for dessert.Here Id like to emphasise that Id never heard of brownies or cheesecake before that, and neither had most people. By that time I had met Rahul, but by chance. I was art directing an ad campaign that was being photographed by the then young shutterbug Atul Kasbekar. Rahul (with hair), featured prominently in the photograph, all double-breasted with a hand-tied bow. Id then meet him as he bustled around in and out of the kitchen of Under the Over.I have very fond memories of that place; two stand out for me. The first a very spirited lunch with writer, author and friend Nisha da Cunha who accompanied me thinking shed have to settle for a salad, since she was vegetarian, but was pleasantly surprised. And the second, a heart-to-heart with Cyrus Broacha who had quit his first proper job that morning so that he could head to New York to study acting. Unfortunately Under the Over shut down, and my lament will always be that very little remains documented about a restaurant that changed the way we ate in Bombay.Then came Indigo. The first standalone fine-dine restaurant in the city. Rahul took over this little cottage in a bylane of Colaba and shook all five-star hotels out of their complacency. Indigo elevated the dining experience to the highest level, with design, cuisine and a focus on modern and classic-modern food. The clubby bar counter with dining areas, its terrace with a deep, brown cigar lounge. The lobster bisque with hints of fennel, Camembert souffl truffle fondue, beef carpaccio with capers, the risottos made to perfection, pork belly slow-cooked with bacon jam. This was gastronomy at its best. I had many a good meal and dozens of great boozy evenings stumbling down the wooden staircase and onto the pebbled exit, looking up at the lonely dome of the Taj at night.Then another first, Indigo Deli, which opened where Nanking once stood. Top-notch design, lots of wine, the best charcuterie and fromagerie, great sandwiches, pizzas, mains, dessert and breads. And then Neel at Tote on the Turf, the finest Awadhi food. I could go on and on, but I need to get to Qualia before I run out of ink and space.Staged with high ceilings, chainmail curtains, jars of pickled viands; you enter to the soothing crackle and pop of a wood fire that heralds warmth and energy and embraces you. Qualia is a spectacular space. Its posh, yet approachable. The staff is friendly and warm, yet proper. In his words, Rahul brings his international and Konkani tastebuds together in a chorus of strong flavours and vibrant textures.I started with the oxtail tortelletti. Little packages of pasta stuffed with tender meat in a reduced and flavourful bold meat stock with roasted onions a la a French onion soup. It was fresh and resolute. Next the steak tartare. Smarting and pickled, perfectly denatured meat served along with cured egg, pickled mushrooms, capers, chives and a slice of homemade sourdough.Coimbatore pork chops in a cider cumin glaze with white beans, poignant candied tomatoes and crunchy sage leaves. And pizza for my finale. Half with steak and eggs and the other with clams and mussels. The steak and poached egg, with mushrooms, tomatoes, aged cheddar and mozzarella, and the mollusk with black garlic, confit potato, Emmental and arugula. Not about to leave without dessert I finished with the Textures of Bitter Chocolate soil, ganache, wafers and wonderful things.Ill put it this way: there are gimmicks and mimics and then there is Rahul."
2019-11-22,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/thane-patient-at-kalwa-civic-hospital-finds-worm-in-her-dal/articleshow/72177599.cms,Thane: Patient at Kalwa civic hospital finds worm in her dal,"Representative imageTHANE: A woman patient at a Kalwa civic hospital was shocked to find a dead worm floating in the dal served by the hospital on Wednesday.The incident occurred when dinner was served in ward 6 of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, where the woman was admitted. She immediately informed the hospital authorities, who then withdrew the dinner plate. They said that the worm probably came from an infested tomato that was used in the dal.Municipal authorities issued a show-cause notice to the hospital's canteen contractor, and warned them against such an incident happening again.An official from the hospital said, ""After the patient came forward, we checked all the other patients' food, and it was not contaminated. We are enquiring about the incident to find out who is at fault.""The hospital staff said that the quality of food at the hospital was bad and that students had fallen sick due to that. ""A tab should be kept on the quality of food by a professional, probably by the FDA, in all hospitals. Students complain about stomach ache and are seen suffering from loose motions,"" said a doctor from the hospital."
2019-11-22,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/for-the-love-of-a-sandwich/article30047161.ece,Why Fika in Adyar dominates Instagram feeds,"On a weekday afternoon, it is fairly easy to get a table at Fika. Which is saying something, because the garden party-esque, pink-and-white-and-sunlight restaurant has been keeping diners waiting in line by the hour every weekend since it opened three months ago.This is partly because of its (very) Instagrammable interiors and the consequent buzz it has created on social media. And partly because they opened with an inexplicable system that keeps walk-ins waiting, even when the reastaurant is practically empty.The very first thing I order from their considerable menu is the pork chop. The second is a filter coffee. The first, I am told, is unavailable. The second arrives beautifully styled, just like a cappuccino. It tastes a lot like cappuccino too  perhaps the only filters Fika approves of are those on Instagram.So far, my meal is underwhelming  but the next dish turns the tide, and in record time. My smoked chicken spaghetti arrives before my coffee is even half-finished, keeping to the clock with a regularity that the kitchen constantly lives up to, dish after dish.The serving portion makes it a comfortable dish for one. Mild and creamy, with the chicken smoked just enough to keep it from being bland, the dish is as comforting as it is fun. As far as flavour goes, the real colour comes when you bite into an olive, which will almost always be accidental. This one dish alone almost makes up for the previous two disappointments, and then the next one tips the scales completely.The Fika special sandwich is a hearty open sandwich of thick bread, with lettuce, tomato, chicken, bacon and a seasoned, soft-boiled egg. It is just about as satisfying as you can expect a messy sandwich to be. The chicken is simple, with no bells and whistles. The egg is beautifully seasoned with a liberal dose of pepper and a few other spices. A number of herbs are sprinkled atop, giving the dish the look of a messy little summer garden. The bacon is just short of crunchy, indeed nothing gives a harder bite than the bread itself. The softness of tomato, the mushiness of egg, and all the layers in between, give it a lovely mix of textures.Fika Hits: Fika special sandwich, smoked chicken spaghettiFika special sandwich, smoked chicken spaghetti Misses: Filter coffee, fish and chipsFilter coffee, fish and chips Meal for two: 2,0002,000 9962200662I had to battle against my will to choose between this sandwich and one of Fikas extensive offering of pizzas, and it is a decision I do not regret. If you have a larger appetite than me, however, I suggest you try some. Chef Willi Willson, best known for introducing the city to stylish, modernist cooking when he was Executive Chef at The Park hotel, after which he worked with a string of successful city restaurants, is a noted authority on wood-fired, thin crust pizzas. Says the chef, We do our full wood-fired pizza here and are heading into unique pizza toppings that are a little different from what I make elsewhere.The fish and chips that follows, on the other hand, is meh. To be fair, the fries are beautifully golden-brown and halfway between crisp and soft. The fish, however, is not the batter-fried fillet I expected, but three seared pieces fried to be reminiscent of pakodas. Once I bite through the batter, the fish is bland and falls short of even salt. There have been plenty of attempts to give popular street foods the urban chic treatment before. This one fails.Yet, Fika is definitely worth a second visit, especially for long tte--ttes on lazy afternoons. The chef promises to have some new treats waiting  I am working more with burrata, a creamy-centered mozzarella which I love. One of my favourite dishes coming soon is the chicken breast with burrata and bacon, he states invitingly."

Dr Michael Dixon, a supporter of the integrative medicine, who is currently the chairperson of the College of Medicine and Integrated Health, as well the erstwhile chair of UKs NHS Alliance, introduced them. The Prince himself is a supporter of the stream of medicine, choosing to be a patron of the Faculty of Homeopathy in its 175th year, despite much criticism in Britain.The visitToday, after Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwalls sixth visit to Soukya, in Bengaluru, Mathai says the couple came in for a six-day rejuvenative treatment, where naturopathy, Ayurvedic, and yoga practices were employed. He says he is also a holistic consultant to them (he studied across Kerala and London) as and when required through the year.The couple enjoyed the organic produce and the vegetarian food that the facility provided at this 30-acre, 25-room facility, including appam and stew, as well as dosas with coconut and tomato chutneys. The Duchess felt at-home and showed her husband around as if it were her own place, says Mathai, who gave them the full tour the day after the Prince arrived, the whole centre being reserved for them. Camilla was already here with five of her women friends, while he attended to matters at the British Asian Trust that he is the founder patron of, with reports in Britain speculating on how the two would spend his 71st birthday apart.The birthday was a quiet affair, with him cutting a cake that Suja Issac, the co-founder who heads the nutrition unit at Soukya, arranged. We also told them that we would like to do a thanksgiving prayer at the Holy Trinity chapel, and said, If you would like to join, please do so. They graciously agreed, and the four of us (his wife and two sons) were with them. The priest did a 20-minute programme, singing in English, Malayalam and Syriac, says Dr Mathai. In the evening, the 10-foot tall stone lamps usually only lit for Diwali, were lit up for the group.Into the futureMathai, whose mother was a homeopathy practitioner herself, has been a proponent of integrative medicine, and is International Ambassador for the College of Medicine, London. Hes just back from a conference that the college hosted, where this years theme was social prescription or the idea that people can take care of themselves by way of exercise and diet, so they dont need to go to a doctor unless necessary.This, he says is exactly what hes been advocating at his Mathais Rural Health Centre, a Soukya Foundation, which services 38 villages at Hoskote Taluk, in Bangalore Rural. In addition to the regular clinic, the centre facilitates yoga in schools.Last April, an AYUSH centre was started in Saint Charles Hospital, London, as a testing ground to introduce the Indian streams of medicine into the NHS system. I initiated the project that is now run by the College of Medicine and funded by the AYUSH ministry and the British Asian Trust. This was inaugurated by our Prime Minister and Prince Charles, says Mathai. It will be monitored by the University of Westminster. Dr Mathai calls it a Golden opportunity to enter the UK system, and says he suggested to Prince Charles that he take the model to several commonwealth countries.He is now hoping that with the support of the Prince and Dr Dixon, Dumpfries House, an 18th century structure across 2,000 acres that already has a Health & Wellbeing Centre, can be tapped into. My idea is that we have a facility there that can cater to the high income group which can then subside treatment for the community, he says.The connectionDr Michael Dixon speaks about his connection with integrative medicine and Dr Issac Mathai.What brought you to integrative medicine?I was looking for answers, because through my practice there were people with chronic tiredness or frequent infections or irritable bowel or headaches or even stress and depression, back pain and neck pain. All these things are only partially treated by the conventional model.When did it come to you that the solution lay here in integrative medicine?I had been a conventional doctor for 10 years and was really quite depressed at my inability to treat so many conditions. The positive was meeting come complementary practitioners, who came to my surgery. Now we have 12 different practitioners, including acupuncturists, osteopaths, massage therapists, herbal medicine (in my practice). Probably the very first for me was attending a course in manipulation and finding that I could treat back pain and neck pain with some very basic manoeuvers and stretches, and feeling that I was returning to my roots as a doctor. I found that I was able to help people with very bad backs to start walking and improving and they appreciated the fact that the doctor wasnt simply giving them a tablet or telling them to see a physiotherapist.All of the integrative forms of medicine lay an emphasis on talking and touching. Do you think allopathy has lost that?I think it has. The other thing it has lost is time. If you can only spend a short time, you cant get to fully understand what their problems are and what the treatment required is. Hippocrates said that touch was very important in healing people and we know that Ayurveda preceded Hippocrates.Could this have led, in part, to the mental health crisis, in part?I think it could, because we need to go back to the roots. In the west, people self-harming has reached epidemic proportion and stress and depression are ever increasing. And thats to do with our society itself being very fragmented and people not being connected to each other in a way that they often are in Indian communities. So I think the cause is disconnection and the treatment  it has to be about building relationships. It has to be about human warmth, kindness, and about things that we find difficult to talk about  like unconditional love. And simply throwing a pill at someone who is highly distressed is never going to be the entire solution.What aspects of Dr Mathais treatment philosophy resonate with you?His commitment to whole-person medicine  the mental and the physical and not dividing us up into different parts of the body or different diseases. And the holistic approach that includes diet, exercise, yoga, as well as a range of treatments suited to an individual. (At his facility) People are able to get away from the everyday stresses of life  like eating and drinking too much, like being under pressure and stress  to a place thats altogether more peaceful, alongside a much more healthy vegetable diet, a healthier way of living  its really a whole package.Within the UK any kind integrative medicine hasnt received support at all.Complementary medicine is not well respected in England. More often thats on the parts of the press and some of the conventional medical establishment. Conversely, quite a lot of patients do see complementary practitioners and do find theyre helped by them. There are a number of conventional doctors who embrace the complementary approach."

Besides this, they have also called for a bandh in the city on Tuesday.Announcing this at a press conference on Saturday, Salim Mundewadi, the president of the association, said the corporations action has left them with no option but to go on a strike.He said the authorities began removing the shops without giving any notice or time. We have been doing business here for over five decades. But one fine day, the corporation comes up with heavy machines and starts removing our shops, he said.Alternative placeReferring to the assurance given by Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil of providing vendors an alternative place, Mr. Mundewadi asked why it was not given before the eviction began.Congress leader Abdul Hamid Mushrif said the district administration should have made proper alternative arrangements. He called for peoples support by participating in the bandh on Tuesday.Asifullah Khadri, the advocate who is representing the vendors at the Kalaburagi bench of the Karnataka High Court, said the eviction of the businesses amounted to violation of the Municipal Act. He said the commissioner had to obtain permission of the Regional Commissioner, but he hadnt.He said since the High Court had stayed eviction on this lane, a contempt of court case would be filed.Prices shoot upMany people found it extremely difficult to get their supply of vegetables as the businesses near Bara Kaman, Kabraji Bazar and Nehru Market remained closed, following the call for indefinite strike by the vegetable vendors. Prices of vegetables in the other markets shot up  tomato was being sold at 50 to 80 a kilo."

The price has risen by 33.3% in a week  from 60 to 80.President of the apni mandis Prahlad Singh said, In around two decades in Chandigarh, the price of onions never reached 80 per kg. The supply hasnt reached the city this week and farmers are earning little from onion produce.Officials at an apni mandi said, Most onions in the mandis have come from stores and the stock will run out within a few days. No fresh supply of the commodity reached the city on Saturday. The price may increased further if supplies dont become normal. Only onion from Rajasthan will be available in the market and none from Nashik.Political scenario of Maharashtra to blameA senior official of the UT food and supplies department, on the condition of anonymity, said, The shortage of onions isnt just in Chandigarh but all over the country. It is happening due to the political upheavals in Maharashtra. Nashik supplies major portion of the onions across the country and, at times, the commodity is used as a tool to meet political ends.

The restaurant does not have the look and feel of a typical Andhra joint but the dcor elements, however, are typical to three broad regions of the Telugu-speaking regions coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Rayalaseema.My dining companion and I started off the dinner with an innovative dish, where they have experimented with rasam, which the region is famous for. Verushanga Tamata Chaaru, a semi-thick soup made with peanuts, tomatoes and onions, churned our appetite with the tanginess and a rich flavour of mixed spices.The restaurant is a fiery heaven for non-vegetarians who love the heat of chilli and the kick of spices in meat. We tried Telangana Lollipop deep fried chicken drumsticks tossed with green chilies, curry leaves and dusted with pounded spice and Udayagiri Mamsam Vepudu  lamb flavoured with curry leaf-infused gravy. On the first bite, the first wave of heat will hit you, followed by an amalgamation of spices absorbed by the meat.Go for the Goddu Karam Chanduva Fry, which is a whole pomfret marinated in green chilli paste, deep fried and sprinkled with homemade chilli garlic powder. However, this is not for the faint-hearted as it can leave Habanero and Sriracha in the dust trail on the Scoville charts. For vegetarians, the appetizer section is a little limited but Chamadumpa JeedipapPuvepudu, a colocasia and cashew fry, stood out. We longed for a glass of beer as the flavours and the crispy colocasia would go well with it.Andhra meals are synonymous with pappu and Samaikya clearly knows how to get theirs right with Gongura Pappu. The perfectly cooked lentils and gongura greens (roselle) on a hot bed of rice, with a dollop of desi ghee on top, made our day. If you want to do some experimentation with vegetarian food, then Pachikaram Junni Paalu, Creamy Paneer Bhurji cooked with full fat milk, is a good recommendation.For the non-veg main course, we tried a few of their specialties, the first one being Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, an authentic Vijayawada-style biryani prepared with slow-cooked horse gram gravy. It has a distinct and pungent taste, which is very different from dum biryani. It might need an acquired taste to gorge on but you can definitely give it a try for its uniqueness. The star dish in the entire course was the Bommidayulu Pulusu, a traditional Andhra eel fish curry. It was savoury with classical Andhra spices. The heat was tempered down and well-refined.Rounding up the whole experience was the Double Ka Meetha, a classic Hyderabadi sweet made of fried bread slices soaked in hot milk with spices, saffron and cardamom. We also tried Qubani Ka Meetha prepared with apricot pulp. While the desserts were from the region, they were nothing out of the ordinary.Samaikya procures specialty ingredients such as Gongura, Bommidayulu (eel fish) and Guntur chilli from their region of origin, making these dishes authentic. The head chef is from the region and recreates his grandmothers recipes, which adds to the authenticity.The food festival will be held till December 1 at Samaikya in HSR Layout. Cost for two: `900 (approx)"

My wife stocks up the requirements for the preparation and the kitchen is all mine. By cooking, Im able to equally commit and take part in the welfare of the household. One does not get that satisfaction just from earning money for the family but also spending quality time, says Bharat while making lemon-sized balls out of vada batter.He has been cooking for almost 25 years. While growing up, cooking was a necessity for him and his four siblings because his parents used to be away at work. Recipes were learnt from observation. It eventually developed into passion and experimentation.From college to work, there have been several commitments at various stages. I always find time for cooking because it gives me a high and sense of liberation. Im attempting to make different temple cuisines out of interest.

He likes innovating, playing with ingredients, and is a perfectionist with following a particular method of preparation. His enthusiasm defies his age. He started cooking under his elder sisters guidance from the age of 16. The desire for perfection and feeding people has only expanded with age. Hes 73 now.Although the women of the house predominantly handle the cooking department, I often like contributing my share. My wife and I work on our timings and cook on alternate days. There are a few delicacies that Im known for in the family. Nobody but I can cook them with efficiency. One need not prepare delicious meals to be a good cook. Even basics help, says Padmanabhan who made pongal and bajji for the day's breakfast.K Anand Bhattar, priestHis level of dedication extends beyond cooking to the cleaning process. No item goes waste. I like arranging things in a certain way. The environment while cooking has to be serene and organised. We grew up in a generation that never relied on outside food. Everything would be made from scratch at home. Ive passed on the cooking skills to my children to take care of their basic needs. My spicy chutneys are peoples favourite. I also like trying out different kinds of kuzhambu and traditional items, he says. To date, he prepares an array of sweets and savouries for festivals and sends it across to relatives.Nenthram pazham raceIngredientsNenthram: 3 (a variety of banana), Jaggery: 1/4 cup, Red chilli: 5, Pepper: 10, Channa dal: two tsp, Dhaniya: 1 tsp, Urad dal: 1 tsp, Aesofittida: 1 pinch, Tamarind: 1 amla size, Salt to taste, Turmeric, Grated coconut: 2 tsp,Methodl Add salt and turmeric to the tamarind water and boil the nenthrams l Take a pan, add oil, chilli, pepper saut and grated coconut l After cooling, grind to a thick paste with water l Add jaggery to nenthram l Add everything and boil l Garnish with mustard and curry leaves in coconut oil.Hymns and ladlesHymns and prayer chanting fill Anands kitchen. Its a delight to watch him slice merakai (Chow Chow) effortlessly, and saut it in a pan with urad dal. A simple vegetable curry for the day is ready. He picked up the art from his father and grandfather who were excellent cooks.My grandfather was a caterer. Id accompany him for marriages and help in laying banana leaves. In one such instance, at the age of 15, I had to make kaju cakes since the head cook fell sick at the last minute. It turned out to be tasty and people loved it. Since then, Ive been equipped to cook in bulk for even 1,000 people, says Anand, who loves to read about ancient cooking practices and regional cooking. He takes turns with his wife for cooking depending on his work timings. Both his kids are also trained to cook.Anands job demands him to travel across the world for different kinds of rituals. Once in Rajasthan, we were gearing up for the days puja. The cook, who had to come, met with an accident and I had to take over. I had to cook in the freezing temperatures without even tasting the food. One needs to identify everything with smell. Its a different kind of experience that not many will get, points out the priest.Anand believes in educating his children on the consumption of organic and healthy vegetables. They never order or buy from outside. Its the homely familiarity that he has passed on to his children.BisibelabathIngredientsRice: 1 kg, Tur dal: 300 gram, Turmeric: 1/4 tsp, Red chilli: 5-8, Coriander seeds: 50 g, Black pepper: two tsp, Cumin seeds: 2 tsp, Hing (Asafoetida): 20 g, Fenugreek: 30 g, Kadala: 50, Urad dal: 50, Mustard seeds: 20 g, Jaggery: 50 g, Tamarind: 50 g, Gingelly oil: 100 ml, Ghee: four tsp, Salt (rock salt), to taste, Green chilli: 2, Salt: 80 g, Vegetables: (100 g each), Brinjal, Ladys finger, Chow Chow, Capsicum, Small onion (if need be), Dry coconut, grated: 100 g, Curry leaves, Coriander to garnishMethodl Boil tur dal, add turmeric and keep asidel Boil rice, mash and keep it asideFor the powderl Pour oil in a panl Add coriander seeds, red chilli, pepper, fenugreek, curry leaves  saut and grind itl If you need more spice then add bay leaves, cardamom (4), anise (2), fennel (4tsp), add jaggeryl Roast all the ingredients, grind and keep it asideFinal mixingl Pour oil, mustard seeds, red chilli, urad dal and channa dall Add capsicum and onion separatelyl Add the other vegetablesl Salt 80 gl Keep it on simmer and close the lidl Add tamarind waterl Add the roasted powder and boil them all togetherl Now add the boiled tur dal and mix them all to rice.

In a time when both men and women are on par in everything, why attach pride to the aspect of cooking alone? Why does it become special when a man cooks for his wife while the latter does it every day?, asks Jagannath R who has too many questions about the kitchen conundrum.Jagannath grew up in Kolkata in a household where everybody cooked. It was a family affair. He forayed into cooking at the age of six under his parents supervision. It helped him during his scouts and guides camps when they were asked to make a basic meal for survival without the luxury of having appliances or ingredients.I spent most of the time in boarding school, college, and now I have a travelling job. During college days in Chennai, my sister and I would cook to unwind from everyday stress. I do the same now. After long hours at work, we find it to be therapeutic, he says.A good set of knives, minimal cooking appliances, and western music in the background  this is the ideal mood for Jagannath to get him cooking. He loves having friends over for parties frequently and likes to prepare multi- cuisine delicacies. Warm appreciation and motivation from friends make him want to cook more food. Im proud that I can cook anything and dont have to be dependent on anyone. My friends envy me for that, he shares.Spaghetti with tomato sauceIngredientsStore-bought spaghetti: 200 gram, Garlic: 10 cloves (finely chopped), Onion: 2 medium size (finely chopped), Tomatoes: 2 medium size, Olive oil, Salt to taste, Oregano to taste, Chilli flakes to taste, Thyme to taste, Fresh/dried basil to taste, Parmesan cheese: 30 gMethodl In a deep vessel, add water and bring it to a boil l Add salt to the water.

From helping his mother out in the kitchen to learning the nuances and tricks of cooking from his aunts, hes come a long way to preparing a meal for an entire household.My father was a flawless cook. Even if its a basic flat beans curry, hed do it with perfection. I admired and liked his cooking better. Hed make roti for me and my grandfather on the terrace under the moon, just the traditional way. He died when I was young and I decided to carry forward his memories through cooking, reminisces Muhilann.The budding architect grew up in a big household. To help his aunt, hed wake up early morning and get started with the days cooking. During his childhood hed leave for school only after washing and drying the used vessels. I appreciate criticism. But if they touch my nerve by finding faults often then Id deliberately prepare it in a way they dont like. Im mischievous in the kitchen, says Muhilann.During his college days in Ooty, Muhilann used to cook and have his friends over whenever they felt homesick. There was always food in his room. My mother used to visit me with traditional sweets and candies. Everybody in college loved it so much that I opened a stall and made money out of it. I also used cooking as an incentive to study better. Whenever I scored low marks, Id make a demand for a kitchen appliance and when my mother promised to buy it for me then I would clear the paper with good scores. Its a lifelong skill that I carry everywhere to make people happy, he says.Vennai puttuIngredientsRice: 1 cup, Bengal gram dal: 50 gram,Jaggery: 2 cup, Coconut:  shell, Cardamom: 5 nosMethodl Soak rice for two hours, finely grind it to a batter consistency l Boil four glasses of water and add Bengal gram dal l Once Bengal gram dal is half cooked, then add rice batter to itl Stir it well until the rice batter is cooked.

Families, vendors and restaurant owners struggle to keep this staple ingredient out of their daily menu, despite the pinchSelvaraj M, GomathiChettinadu Hotel, TeynampetAlong with a hike in petrol prices, basic food products have also become expensive. Onions now cost Rs 85-Rs 100 per kg. Earlier, we used to buy 60 kg of onion per day but we have had to reduce it to 45 kg on average, and sometimes it reduces to 25 kg too. Customers expect the quality to be consistent, but its us hoteliers who suffer. We cannot compromise on quantity, but we are striving to maintain quality. We are uncertain of what will happen in the future.CR Balaji, officer at a petrochemical industryThe first and obvious reason for the price hike is poor rains in our state. Not just onions, the price of every vegetable has shot up. As common people, were left with no choice but to cut down our consumption by half. We cannot afford to miss out on our daily intake. My wife and I also make it a point to buy from local vendors in our area because we find fresh and affordable goods. Small-scale vendors are also having a hard time with the increase in prices. However, they do manage to get vegetables at a marginalised price from Koyambedu.Nazir J, Lip and Lick Snacks, TeynampetWe buy about five to seven kilos of onions daily and havent cut down on the quantity after the price hike. We dont expect the prices to drop soon. As of now, our profits remain the same. Maybe when that reduces, we might have to cut down on our onion consumption.Diwan, retailer atNungambakkamEarlier, I could sell 60 kg in one day, and now, I sell the same amount in two days. People have reduced their onion intake. I have to sell onions at a high price to ensure I recover what I bought them for. Sometimes I have to sell for Rs 80 a kg.BG Shivakumar,owner of Tamu TamuOnion and lettuce prices at the moment are higher than usual. As a restaurant, we havent cut down on purchases nor have we changed our menu prices. We consider the movement in prices to be fairly normal pressures on margins that we face from time to time and have to budget in our expenses.Manikandan, wholesalerin Tambaram SanatoriumWe sell onions at Rs 70 a kg because if we increase the price nobody will buy it. Despite the loss, we cannot run a vegetable shop without onions and so we sell it. Our stock comes from Bengaluru and is usually expensive. Good onions usually come from eastern India. Okra, onion and tomato are the fastest-selling vegetables in my shop and I rely on those for most of my income.PS Maheswaran,retired engineerThe prices of vegetables are fluctuating every day. I prefer shopping at supermarkets, either at malls or standalone stores because they give offers. When onions were Rs 75 a kg they sold it at Rs 15 a kg. I make use of those offers and stock up on vegetables. These are basic vegetables and we need to buy them irrespective of prices. The quality might not be the same everywhere, but we cannot survive without them either.K Vani,homemakerWe are from Coimbatore and generally onion is an important ingredient in our every meal. This increase in price has forced us to either use lesser quantity, or avoid dishes exclusively made of onions like onion chutney. I was saddened when I read that government has planned to import onion. We are capable of cultivating onions and the government can take initiatives to encourage farmers. Some positive steps need to be taken to bring down the onion price.Shruti Bhaskaran, graphic designerIn the past, every time the onion price went up, we used to stop purchasing them and cook dishes without it. As onions are a must in every dish, even though the price is high, now we just buy some for daily use. Sometimes, we also try to buy them in bulk and use it.Preethi, a residentof West MambalamWe have had to reduce our consumption. Earlier, I would buy two kilos for the week, now I buy just one kilo. As onion has to be used for all kinds of gravy, I have started grinding it in the mixer so that I can use less quantity while making enough food."
2019-11-23,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/nov/23/in-crust-we-trust-2065634.html,In crust we trust,"Likhitha P Nair ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: Walking into 360 pizzeria in Panampilly Nagar, you instantly notice the fragrance of freshly baked dough. Looking around, you can see the rustic interiors complementing a smouldering afternoon sun and a lit-up message on the wall that reads Be Amazing. This message best describes their on-going Italian pizza fest too. As I walk in, chef John P Thampi runs me through the menu, and I settle down by the window with a passion fruit lemonade.I come up with each flavour after a lot of experimentation. We take feedback from our customers, the team here, but the final tasting and suggestions come from Isaac Alexander, the director of Avenue Regent, says the chef as he brings the first pizza to my table. Halloween gave me a jumpscare with all the pineapple on it.But the very first bite pleased my palate with a sweet and salty flavour of bacon, and pumpkin sauce. The second preparation, called San Marino is my personal favourite. Made with crispy bacon, grilled prawns, and scallions and topped with mozzarella cheese, this pizza is a perfectly balanced flavour burst. We first tried this with normal bacon, and later the crispy one. It made a huge difference, adds the chef.With an experience of nearly 20 years in continental cuisine and having worked in Dubai for most of his career, chef John is particular about making this pizza fest versatile. The butchers calzone is one such experiment with a heavy meat-based filling.German chicken sausage, barbecue chicken and chicken ham, cooked with Spanish red chillies and coriander leaves, topped with cheese, tomato and barbecue sauce, is an unimaginable treat for any meat lover. This is then wrapped in a crispy crust and topped with sauce, a preparation that is hard to find in the city. The lineup has three vegetarian pizza options, of which primavera is a must-try. The sun-dried tomatoes are made in-house. I am particular about details like these, as it adds that extra zest to your pizza, he says.Handmade and baked in an imported oven, the crust of chef Johns pizzas are as thin as your patience while you sit and wait for him to bring out the next pan. The star of this special menu is a stewed apple and Nutella calzone that is perfect to satisfy your sweet tooth. This preperation with dark and white chocolate chips, short crumble and praline is a perfect way to wind up your pizza adventure here.Till November 30.From 12pm to 11pm.`290 onwards."

A few dozen young men and women wait and watch as batches of dosas take shape. Not the round dosas we are used to but oval ones, topped with oodles of shredded cheese, butter, paneer and tomato. Between the dosa and the topping is sandwiched a layer of runny upma. The process of creating this fusion dosa at Ram Ki Bandi is dramatic  the cheese bubbles and turns red as it is sprinkled generously with chilli garlic powder or chat masala. For the young people wearing the lanyards of IT companies and grumbling about bosses, this dosa, sliced into two and topped with a dollop of peanut chutney, is what they eat before they call it a day.Hyderabad, known for its biryani, haleem, kebabs, sheer korma, sheermal and shorba, has suddenly seen an explosion in its range of food, making it quite a gourmands destination. Little wonder then that the city now has been included in the Creative Cities Network by Unesco in the gastronomy category. And all that eating is helping the economy too: a study by an auditing firm discovered that about 12% of Hyderabads working population is directly or indirectly employed in the food sector.Dosa with toppings | Photo Credit: Getty ImagesThe average Hyderabadi is quite the foodie: the city consumes some 700 tonnes of chicken and 291 tonnes of meat every day, according to a dossier prepared by city officials. On festivals, chicken consumption goes up to 2,000 tonnes, says Musharraf Ali Faruqui, zonal commissioner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, who was part of the team that drafted the case for Hyderabads inclusion in the Unescos Creative Cities Network. The team mapped eateries ranging from pushcarts under expressways to tea shops that pop up for a few hours a day to omelette kiosks near bus and train stations. We found roughly 1.5 lakh establishments, plus countless tea stalls. Some of them stick around for just a few hours before moving on, he says. The team also discovered that 10,000 women in self-help groups are employed in the food sector in Hyderabad.On the menuDiners are spoilt for choice. From experimental dishes that come from small new-age eateries to the established players dishing out success formulas, the range is huge.Arrayed on both sides of the Musi River, the choices for breakfast at The Grand, Nayaab, Shadab, Shah Ghouse and more are staggering. The meat dishes include bhaji gurda (kidney curry), kaleji (liver curry), jabaan (tongue), paya (broth with trotters), and keema (mince), while vegetarians make do with bagara (seasoned rice), kuska (plain biryani), and khichdi. Shorba is a rich broth with a floating layer of lard, seasoned with coriander and served with sheermal, naan or roti. At Nayaab, it is newspaper executives and early morning visitors to Charminar who stop by for tea and breakfast.By 8 a.m., the traffic picks up and business at Ram Ki Bandi winds down. We close by 9 a.m., says Ram, a first-generation food entrepreneur. A few hundred metres away, groups of students, daily wage workers and office goers throng the road near Hanuman Tekdi. People were getting bored of the routine idli-dosa-upma, so I created cut dosa  I made the dosa crisper, added a topping of upma, and cut it into two. Others got the idea from us, says B. Komariah, the owner of the eatery. Starting with a roadside stall in 1982, he now employs 45 people. I was 24 and jobless when a Tamil rickshaw puller named Kumar suggested I start a tiffin centre. We borrowed 1,200 and ferried the grinding machine here in his rickshaw. He taught us about the batter and other cooking secrets, says Komariah, as people jostle to buy the tokens for a plate.Piping hot mirch bajji | Photo Credit: Nagara GopalBetween 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., the streets near schools and colleges, banks and small businesses become hubs for fast food. My favourite breakfast is keema roti. But now most restaurants in the old city serve puri-bhaji. It is cheaper and also filling; people can no longer afford meat for breakfast, says Hyder Razvi, who lives near the Darul Shifa, the oldest part of Hyderabad. A traditional snack like lukmi, which earlier had a filling of mince mutton, is now stuffed with either mashed potato or beef.Of kulfi paansSunil opened Shree Lakshmi Tiffins in Boggalkunta near Abids in central Hyderabad four months ago. The shop shares space with one of the citys fanciest pan shops, which has evolved into a juice parlour and a chaat and pani puri hangout. Mayur Pan House opened in 1998 and boasts on its menu kulfi paan, Meenakshi laddoo paan, and chocolate paan, among other choices. By evening, the area in front of the shop is transformed into a street cafe where families drop by to dig into Jain pav bhaji, samosa ragda, avocado juice, garlic bread, or that eternal street food favourite, pani puri.By afternoon, biryani preparations for dinner have begun. At the Shah Ghouse Cafe in west Hyderabad, biryani looks like a work of art in the making. Hyderabadi biryani is kacche gosht ki biryani, where raw meat is cooked with rice creating many layers of flavours, says Muhammad Rabbani, the owner of Shah Ghouse. On large kadais, chef Chand Bhai uses his eyes and hands as measuring tools, throwing in sea salt, chilli powder, spices, and curd on the meat, then leaving it to marinate. He then layers the marinated meat with half-cooked rice before setting it to cook on dum. Three layers of long-grained rice cooked for different lengths of time appear to be the secret for the perfectly cooked biryani. One kadai of biryani can feed 40 people.Vermicelli being prepared | Photo Credit: G RAMAKRISHNAFood should always be eaten in the place where it is cooked. You can order food online but it arrives cold. A takeaway doesnt give you the atmosphere of a restaurant, says Rabbani. He goes to sleep at 4 a.m., when everyone else wakes up to food.But it is not just elaborate food that is Hyderabads culinary calling card today. A small family-run confectionery near Salar Jung Museum makes a little sweetmeat called badam ki jaali (almond coin). Shaped like a Nizam-era coin, the mellow sweet is an heirloom delicacy.Nouvelle cuisineAt the other end of the spectrum are the new-age patisseries with owner-chefs trained in Paris or London. Hossein Barazandeh studied baking in Paris and opened a desserts place in Banjara Hills called Feranoz. Beginning with a small bakery, Sahil Taneja went on to Concu, a high-end patisserie, also in Banjara Hills. He imports the choicest strawberries and the best gold leaf for dessert toppings. Recently, he opened another restaurant in Jubilee Hills called Farine. His neighbours are Churrolto (Spanish cafe), Guilt Trip (dessert house), Maguro (Pan-Asian diner) and a drive-in restaurant called Cuba. Gourmet city? For sure.The gastronomy reaches a crescendo during Ramzan. A 1 km radius around Charminar transforms into a food street where the action begins at 5 p.m. and goes on till dawn. It is a night bazaar where mutton shikhampur, a pan-fried minced kebab stuffed with raw onions and coriander, competes with patthar ka gosht, chunks of delicately flavoured meat grilled over heated stone. The dish of choice is, of course, the sublime Hyderabad haleem  a thick, dark spicy stew of meat, lentils, crushed wheat, vegetables and ghee. Lots of ghee. The dish, understandably, has a GI tag.Except Punjab and Kashmir, you will find workers from all States working here. Their number goes up during Ramzan when we employ 800 men, says Ameer, who manages a popular city restaurant. One of the bigger haleem makers, Pista House, has even created a network to door-deliver haleem every day at Iftar across multiple cities.Importantly, the Unesco Creative Cities Networks gourmet tag is as much about food as it is about pulling people out of poverty and meeting the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. As the food business booms, it has created lakhs of jobs in Hyderabad  for bouncers, bakers, baristas, chefs, delivery executives, cooks, scullions, maitres dhotel, and even rat catchers. At a cloud kitchen in Nanakramguda, one of the specialised jobs is that of a rat catcher.

Thanks to the Boy Who Lived, owls are now everywhere from clutches to rucksacks and pendants to home dcor and restaurant names. And so we have the Fat Owl, which Guru Shivaram, one of the partners of the restaurant at JP Nagar (so happening), says is not so much about owls as the mask you could put on to have a good time.In my minds eye, I saw a fluffy owl, wearing glasses welcoming diners, but then that is the problem with being too literal. There was an abstract owl on the wall and a running theme of the mask. On three levels, the sewing machine legs on the tables in the family section were quirky and the thriving mango tree that the restaurant is built around heartening. Fat Owl is a gastropub offering with the usual suspects as far as food and wine go. While there are pages and pages of non-vegetarian choices, (the steaks looks jolly) I was trying out the vegetarian options.Fat Owl No 610, 100ft Ring Road, 15th Cross Road, 1st Phase, JP Nagar Call 063660 35777Wallet factor: 1,500Ambience: Outdoorsy, modernHits: Pumpkin ravioli, beetroot tikkiIn a pub even if it is the middle of the day, one should try a drink no? So it was elderflower and gin in a glass studded with fruit and rosemary. One had to look sharp for the notes of elderflower as it was getting slightly overwhelmed by the citrus and herbsno missing the gin though.For small plates we tried cottage spring roll where cilantro added an edge as did the tomato relish. There was also beetroot tikkiwhile I am not a fan of the beet, the texture and the pesto sauce redeemed it. So much so that I went the whole hog and checked out the beet and arugula salad. The orange and balsamic vinegar dressing worked, not so much the walnuts. Then there were the Portobello packets (such a lovely sound the words have)which were baked samosas, a healthy treat, if you lean away from oily comestibles.While there are a variety of pizzas and burgers (have kept it for another visit) for the main course, Guru suggested the cumin roast pumpkin raviolithe soft pasta pillows stuffed with super flavorful grated pumpkin hit the right spot as did the delicately spiced Thai green curry with sticky rice.Dessert was kulfi ice cream (arent they the same?), sticky toffy pudding (nice) and gluten free chocolate fudge, which had an interesting texture. Pleasantly stuffed, an Americano would have been perfect to round off the meal. Unfortunately Guru said the machine developed a glitchso another solid reason to visit the Owl one more time."

With citizens of both countries suffering due to high prices of food items, they came up with the idea of writing to Pakistan PM Imran Khan.They have suggested Khan to return Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to India, hand over terrorist Hafiz Saeed and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, apologise for past sins and take tomatoes from them. The farmers have put their letter to Khan on Twitter, tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan embassy in the post.Ever since the ban on export of vegetables, tomato prices have hit the rooftop in Pakistan and the vegetable is selling at Rs 400 per kg there. Several tehsils in Jhabua, especially Petlawad, have been exporting tomatoes to Pakistan for the past several years.The farmers also staged a protest in Jhabua on Sunday wherein they shouted PoK do-Tamatar lo (Give PoK, take tomatoes).We heard through media reports that people in neighbouring country are buying tomatoes at Rs 300/400 a kg and we believe that if their PM considers tendering an apology, we too may think of offering tomatoes to them through Wagah border, said an elderly farmer.Mahendra Hapad, the head of Bharatiya Kisan Union Jhabua, told News18 that the farmers have sought an unconditional apology from Khan, besides asking him to hand over Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim and peacefully returning PoK.If the Pakistan PM agrees to the conditions, our district unit would consider resuming exports and would urge the government of India to continue supplies, read the letter. The farmers in Jhabua used to export tomatoes at Rs 400 to 500 a crate (around 25kg) when the relations were normal between the two neighbours.Get the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

In what could well be a record for the State, a kilo of onion on Wednesday crossed 100 in wholesale markets.Traders and officials in the Horticulture Department claimed that this was the first time onion prices had crossed the psychological barrier of 100 in Karnataka. It is being sold for 115-135 a kg in retail markets, while the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price on Wednesday was 118.The price hike indicates that the Union governments programme to stabilise the rising cost of kitchen staples  tomatoes, onions, and potatoes  announced in the 2018-19 budget, has evidently failed to take off, said a senior procurement official for a leading retail chain.Farmers and traders blame the heavy rains in August and September across Karnataka and Maharashtra. This has led to large-scale crop damage creating an acute shortage of supply. Even the onions currently being sold are wet, of very low quality, and decompose very fast, said Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association.A respite in the near future seems unlikely as the next harvest is only expected by the end of January 2020. This gives no respite to consumers for another two months and may drive the retail prices further north to even cross the 150 barrier if the government doesnt intervene, traders said. The only way to bring some stability in the prices is to import onions from Egypt on a mass scale, said B.N. Parasad, managing director, HOPCOMS.Lax responseThe Union government-owned MMTC Ltd. is said to be looking at importing one lakh tonnes of onions from Egypt and has already placed an order for the first consignment of 6,090 tonnes at a cost of 60/kg. It is expected to land on Indian shores by the first week of December. However, Karnataka is yet to place an order for onions from this consignment.When contacted, Shashikala Jolle, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, said she was busy with the byelection campaign in Gokak, Belagavi, but would review the situation soon.Shamla Iqbal, Commissioner, Food and Civil Supplies Department, said the department was reviewing production strategy with the Horticulture Department and will take a call. There is still time to place an order, she said."

Ridge gourd, bitter gourd, bean and carrot are priced at Rs 70- Rs 80 per kg while cauliflower and cabbage are being sold at Rs 15 to Rs 30 per piece. Potato is being sold at Rs 25 per kg.While rainfall and thunderstorm in October have impacted the vegetable production, thus bringing the supply down and increasing the prices, lack of enforcement by the Regulated Market Committees (RMCs) also led to artificial price rise of vegetables. Even the committees are yet to be formed in several blocks to check price rise in the local vegetable markets.Locals alleged that vendors are responsible for artificial scarcity of the vegetables in the district.Sumanta Kumar Das, a resident of Baripada town, said due to increase in the prices of onions and tomatoes, the kitchen budget has gone haywire. The price of tomatoes in the district was `20 per kg but has now jumped to `40-`60 per kg, he added.Prafulla Singh, a local vendor, said the prices of vegetables in the district have been shooting up due to various factors, including heavy rains, last month.Civil Supply Officer (CSO) Kishore Kumar Patra said it is the responsibility of Baripada Municipality to check price rise of vegetables through RMCs."
2019-11-30,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2019/nov/30/key-to-keto-2069345.html,Key to Keto,"Likhitha P Nair ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: A recent study published in the journal Science Immunology talks about how low-carb diets like keto can help provide immunity against infections like influenza. According to researchers, the ketogenic diet characterises the immune response in the lungs, promoting the expansion of T cells that play a central role in protecting lung against infections. The weight-loss results it can give sans a tiring exercise routine is visible, but Keto meals can be hard to follow regularly. All the meat, oil and fat you have to consume daily can get quite overwhelming.The best part of a Keto meal is that it includes more than just meat and proteins. Keto revolves around more fat in your diet and that can be accomplished by using a lot of coconut and coconut oil in your regular cooking if not paneer and ghee, says Cinu Chandran, a Dubai-based Malayali chef who extensively works on home-made keto recipes. According to the chef, you can easily put together tasty items from around your kitchen, rather than worrying about a confusing grocery list. Just marinate a piece of chicken breast in some curry powder, garlic, salt and lemon juice. Then egg wash (egg that is beaten with water, milk or cream) and coat it in dry coconut flakes. You can panfry this and serve it with garlic mushrooms for an easy keto meal that is packed with nutrients.Another problem most people face on a ketogenic diet is the lack of fibre intake, which could lead to constipation. The routine only allows the intake of selected low-carb vegetables, and for an Indian diet, there are even fewer items that are affordable and readily available including cabbages, broccoli, tomatoes, spinach, cabbages and cauliflower. But one can always look for replacements, says the chef. Our state is blessed with plenty of homegrown veggiesespecially nutritious leaves like moringa, pumpkin leaves, amaranth etc.So making a coconut-rich thoran with these vegetables or a simple stir-fry serves the purpose, he says, adding that mushroom and tender jackfruit dishes are great options too. He also recommends making a regular cabbage thoran, and stuffing your omelette cooked in home-made ghee with it."

She was in the city for a discussion on farming and her zero-waste lifestyle at Go Native, HSR.She loves trees, so much so that she didnt hesitate to lash out at municipality workers for insensitively handling the living beings. She says a tree needs everything from love and companionship to a healthy environment, just like a human needs to survive. It is a miracle to see a tree survive on the roads of India. The roads are cemented till the roots of the tree, without leaving any breathing space. It hurts to see a badly pruned tree. Municipality workers cut them without knowing the proper techniques to do it. They dont even have proper tools used to prune the trees, says 60-year-old Kumar.Coming from the suburbs of Los Angeles, Kumar calls herself the black sheep of the family. When people were moving ahead with modernisation and urbanisation, she followed a path where she can do things in the traditional way. That is what led her to grow her own food. But how does zero-waste farming work, is it even possible? Yes it is, according to Kumar. I do a lot of mulching in my garden. Mostly, it is using any material like dry leaves, wood dust etc to spread it over the surface of the soil as a covering to retain moisture in the soil, says Manju, who has around 87 trees in her garden. She mostly uses greywater (bathroom water) and black water (kitchen water) for irrigation. She also practises rainwater harvesting.With no formal training, Kumar has been farming for the past 45 years. Now she maintains her garden with 87 fruit trees and a farm where she grows vegetables. Her aim in a year is to plant at least 10 trees, and to preach the same, she uses social media as her tool. I love the way social media works. It has helped me connect with so many like-minded people. People easily reach out to me for queries. Together, its easier to make an impact than being a single warrior, she says.Easy steps to takeStart with herb gardens.Easily grown plants like potatoes,tomatoes, chilli, etc.Change your detergents to plant-based one so that you can reuse the water.Your kitchen waste are the best kind of carbon.Get a compost pit to compost it at home."

While this trend isnt new but chefs across the city are busy rustling up their very own speciality.The trend of using alcohol in cooking has been primarily adopted from the Western style of cooking along with Asian cultures for indirectly turning them into kinds of vinegar, informs chef Saurabh Udinia, Farzi Caf, adding, A major part of the reason for the rising popularity of using alcohol as an ingredient can be given to the versatility of alcohol  from fuel for cooking to braising, deglazing and finishing, thus enhancing the overall flavour of the dish.Udinia uses local fermented rice beer to finish bamboo rice and serve it with Naga Pork. He also flambs Tandoori Raan, lending new dimension and richness to it.Using alcohol during the cooking processes leaves behind a faint aroma and a subtle taste, bringing out the flavour in food like salt.Whether it is wine, beer, rum or vodka, the alcohol improves flavour perception through evaporation and molecular bonding, bridging the gap between aroma and food thus increasing flavour penetration. Our signature pasta using alcohol is Penne Alla Vodka, which is traditional penne pasta, usually made using heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions and cheese. The creamy and bright Italian delicacy tastes great with a mild vodka flavour and a flamb aroma, says chef Ashish Singh, Caf Delhi HeightsAmit Bagga, Co-founder of Daryaganj, finds a growing demand for this trend.People want experimentation and Baileys Kulfi is one of the dedicated experiments in-house at Daryaganj.

Keeping the traditional taste of classic kulfi intact, we have embellished it with layers of baileys, thus, providing an elevated experience unheard of.While the alcohol and food combo creates wonders, chef Anas Qureshi, Molecule Air Bar, points how one needs to be careful when choosing the alcohol.Use any alcohol you would drink. Nothing undrinkable and none of that cooking wine which is just inexpensive wine that isnt meant for drinking. If you deglaze with a non-alcoholic liquid such as broth, fruit juice, or water, the flavour of your sauce wont be as intense.Qureshi himself uses alcohol in Butter Poached Chilli Garlic Prawns which are deglazed with white wine.This is a delicate dish where the prawns are slowly poached in clarified butter with dry red chilli flakes, garlic cloves and peppers so that they soak in all the flavours from the butter and stay moist while cooking. Once the prawns are perfectly cooked we finish the dish on a high flame with a dash of white wine and season the dish, he shares."

The firebrand writer aka P Lalita Kumari has rocked the literary world busting myths bringing alive historical female characters who are feminists in their own right. She was speaking at SheThePeople Women Writers Fest held on Saturday at The Park, Somajiguda.Prof T. Vijay Kumar was in conversation with her taking the audience on a fiery ride and riot of words. Talking about 50 years of her writing, Volga said, Also means 50 years of struggle from across all classes and areas which includes rural regions as well. Of women who cannot read or write. It also means 50 years of feminist writing in Telugu literature.Its a celebration of womens writing. Different people understand feminism differently. For me, feminism is understanding the inequality in the society. Within women there are inequalities including sexual preference. Feminism is analysing society through the lens of gender not just for women but men as well.Volga was a committed leftist writer. Prof Vijay asked her as to what made her leave leftist politics and enter feminist political writing? Volga quickly responded, I studied Marxism and learnt social and political aspects of society, writing for those who think like me. Though there were female writers, women werent considered intellectual by the thinking men. They were treated as subaltern and not leaders. This troubled me a lot. I began to question the democractic set-up within the organisation. Thats when I decided to leave.On her novel Swechha, her former colleagues were bitter ly critical. Vijay asked if it was a right decision to leave?The book was already in the market with one lakh copies while it faced much criticism from leftists. The 69-year-old author added, These were stories of common women with a lot of ideas. Shes married to a good man of her choice but she leaves him in the end. The women wanted to live as citizens. Take part in movements. The husbands wanted her to be a mother. A woman. Thats all there is for her in a marriage. In my tales there are women in live-in relationships. The good people got very angry decades ago. Its the readers who decide what they want to read not the progressive critics.Conversation is very important in her writing, especially among women. When women come closer its easier for them to discuss and connect. Among women, there is always feminist sisterhood. Brotherhood has an ideal. The conversation among women disturbs men, especially a conversation between Sita and Surpanakha who actually should have been enemies. In one of dance ballets, they dance together. Its a war between Aryans and Dravidians. Surpanakha is this beautiful Dravidian woman. Draupadi was also there. Doordarshan wanted to showcase it and they didnt accept the character of Surpanakha. They wanted to remove her from the story.She later wrote three more stories. Theres another one on Ram whos trapped in his own loneliness. Its later translated as The Liberation of Sita. Her recently-translated book is Yashodhara on Gautam Buddhas wife. How did she see Yashodhara as? The Sahitya Akademi awardee author replied, People can easily identify with Sita and Draupadi. Its all about power dynamics in understanding and operating the society. Maybe Yashodhara gave reason to Buddha for becoming a sanyasi. How is it possible that he decides to leave the palace and the wife doesnt wake up? She is not the victim. Maybe she was the strength behind Buddhas decision. Its time they are not seen just as poor victims.And the narratives by women writers and poetsFOOD FUNDAThe panel Food Trends 2020: From Kombucha to Keto was moderated by city-based food writer Shivani Mohan and saw gorgeous actor-author Tara Deshpande speaking on the same as she said, How many of us know the real Roghan Josh? A lot of restaurants fool the consumer by adding tomatoes for getting that typical red colour. In fact, Mawal flowers are used for the colour and not any other alternative colouring agent. After this Shivani shot the question, What are the five ingredients you would like to see in kitchen in 2020?And the other panelist Seetha Anand replied, Breakfast should consist of lots of food. Fill your fridge with fresh vegetables. Salad doesnt mean slices of cucumber and onions. You should look at it and your mouth should water. Shivani suggested that the whole family should come together for preparation of food to which Seetha replied, Get children to eat healthy and include them in the preparation. We eat for various reasons. Not just one reason. And then there was the eternal fusion question. Tara chuckled, Fusion can be confusion. Who would have thought of blueberry bagel? A Jew would be tearing his hair. Burgers trend started in the forties. Fusion food has been there from a long time. For example: Vada Pav. The bun is Portuguese. The potatoes are Portuguese.EVERYDAY STORIESThe session Womens writing: Chronicling the everyday was moderated by author-blogger Kiran Manral. Author Shilpa Suraj elaborated on romance writing saying, People mistake womens writing as fluff. Its not. Writing is the rut of life which is processed. Kiran asked authors if male romance writers are outselling female writers? Shilpa responded, The real work begins when your book is out. Men somehow write from a relatable perspective. Thats why they sell more. Kiran asked writer Sophia Lorena Benjamin as to how difficult it is to correlate what a woman goes through especially the protagonist? My book Claudia is on historical romance is set in Goa. When the Portuguese left Goa, they must have left behind a lot of relationships. I couldnt find much material on that, but wrote on it. Claudia falls in love and goes through it all. Younger audience relate well because the protagonist also finds solutions and does not just sulk.THE SONG OF POETSThe poetry session When Words Sing: Womens Journeys Through Verse saw six women poets from the city reading in English and Telugu. The poets not only read their verses but also talked about their journeys of writing. Poet Shikhandin shared about her different childhood of being a third unwanted child. But how she was also surrounded by animals and birds which seeped into her writing. Poet-teacher Jhelum Chattaraj talked about how her stay in Hyderabad has shaped up her writing as she read a poem on nail paint and eating fish, while poet Nabina Das explored socio-political aspects through her poem They Are Kissing. Telugu poet Shahjahana, whos gone through much in life especially when it came to men, spoke about it reading a lyrical poem. The audience enjoyed the poetic evening as an attendee Nivedita N said, This session just woke us up. We need more evenings like these."
2019-12-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-the-kitchens-of-murthal-onion-prices-6162505/,Inside the kitchens of Murthal,"The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food. The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food.On the stretch of National Highway 1 which passes through Murthal in Haryana are over two dozen dhabas  both big and small. These popular rest stops started out catering to truckers, providing hearty, if simple, meals of parathas and dals, as well as cots on which their customers could rest. Since the 1980s, however, many have grown into restaurants that cater increasingly to customers who come from nearby Sonepat and even Delhi, just to sample the dhabas famous tandoor parathas with white butter.At noon on a Tuesday, the parking lot of one of the more popular eateries, Pahalwan Dhaba, is already full. Inside, bowls of sirka pyaaz (onions in vinegar) are on each table, along with green chillies and pickles. Platters of parathas, dals and other dishes emerge from the kitchen in a steady stream.In a room behind the kitchen, surrounded by sacks of potatoes and seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and radish, two young men seated on chairs pull out onions from sacks piled in one corner and chop them into a large plastic container. These, we are told, will be used as tempering for some dishes, while many more will be boiled and then ground to a paste. The onions are chopped fresh, based on the dishes being ordered at the restaurant.Many years ago, when the price of onions had shot up dramatically, the dhaba had tried to cut back on the use of this staple in its kitchen. Nothing tasted the same, recalls Sudesh Sandhu who, along with her husband, owner Dayanand, runs the eatery. Since then we decided that should the price of onions skyrocket again, we will still use as many as we usually do. Our customers come here for the taste, and if it eats into our profit for now, its okay. We can make it up when the price drops, which it is sure to, she says.Onions are currently selling for about Rs 90 per kg. On an average, Sandhu informs, Pahalwan Dhaba uses about 250-300 kilos of onions every day: this includes the onions used to make aloo-pyaaz and pyaaz parathas as well as the ones that are sliced and served raw as part of the salad or are preserved in vinegar. The bulk of the onions, however, go into the curries. Sandhu explains, Our reputation is built on the taste of our food. And tomatoes and onions form the base of almost every curry that we serve here. If you reduce the proportion of onions in anything, the taste changes noticeably and thats not something were willing to risk.Pahalwan Dhaba, which has been around for more than three decades, does enough business annually to be able to absorb the cost of not letting onion prices affect customer experience. Sandhu says that smaller or newer eateries in the area havent been able to do the same, with many substituting onions with daikon radish in the salads. One of these is the three-year-old Shiva Dhaba. While owner Pradeep Arya isnt able to offer an estimate of the dhaba kitchens average per day onion usage, he says that in the past few weeks, the soaring prices have forced them to cut back by an estimated 30 to 35 per cent. Weve stopped serving free onions at the tables. Were now charging Rs 40 per serving. Of course, we understand that customers expect it to be served for free along with the pickles and chillies, but at this point, the cost is simply not something that we can bear, he says.

2019-12-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-onion-wholesale-prices-fall-but-hoteliers-still-using-onions-sparingly-6160945/,"Mumbai: Onion wholesale prices fall, but hoteliers still using onions sparingly","Several vendors said they have stopped stocking onions. (Express Photo: Narandra Waskar) Several vendors said they have stopped stocking onions. (Express Photo: Narandra Waskar)A day after bulb prices fell across the state as arrivals in the wholesale markets rose sharply, onions continued to be missing from salads and sparse in curries served at hotels and restaurants in the city. The significant dip in wholesale rates, restaurateurs said Tuesday, was yet to be reflected in the retail markets.Onion prices had touched Rs 160-170 per kg in local vegetable markets across Mumbai and its suburbs over the last week. On Monday, prices fell by 30 per cent with onion growers bringing more domestic produce to wholesale markets to get the benefit of the higher prices.At Lasalgaon wholesale market, Indias biggest onion market, prices fell to an average of Rs 4,500 per quintal Monday after it traded at Rs 6,000 per quintal last week.At Jai Hanuman restaurant, a vegetarian eatery in Andheri East, customers were served a medley of cucumber and tomato, instead of the usual raw onion, alongside other dishes. We have been buying onion for Rs 130 per kilogramme. Our stock will last another three to four days. Till then, we will not serve any free onions along with dishes, manager Diwakar Shetty said. Shetty added the prices fell only by Rs 20-30 per kg after larger establishments began to buy from the recently imported stock. It is still expensive. We will wait for onion prices to touch Rs 40-60 per kg before we start serving it as usual, he said.Crawford Market-based vendor Mohan Turkar said he continues to sell onions at Rs 12 per kg. The cost in the wholesale market is Rs 95 per kg today. But I am yet to exhaust my existing stock. It will be two-three days more before prices fall in the local market, he said.Meanwhile, several vendors said they have stopped stocking onions. Rohit Chheda, the owner of Satyam Grocery store on Veera Desai Road in Andheri, had decided not to buy a fresh stock when the prices touched Rs 100 per kg. My regular customers have stopped purchasing onions. So we stopped stocking it, he said. Nearby, Chheda Stores owner said they would restock once prices reach Rs 80 per kg. In Andheri, onion continued to be sold at Rs 120-140 per kg.At Shalimar Hotel in Bhendi Bazaar, Captain Sabir Khan said the management has instructed waiters and chefs to reduce wastage of onions. Earlier, we would put any quantity of chopped onion into parcel orders. Now we are conscious of how much we give. But we ensure that the customers dont complain. If they ask for more, we are still serving onions free of cost, Khan said. Shalimar has a chain of restaurants across Mumbai, with a central procurement unit that makes wholesale purchases for all outlets.However, some restaurants have continued to use the usual quantity of onions. Parvez Qazi, working with Joeys Pizza in Andheri West, said even with the sky-high prices, the restaurant did not alter its onion purchases for its pizzas over the last two weeks. Customers like onions in certain pizzas and we did not reduce the quantity. We continued to buy at a high price. There is a small loss incurred, he said. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-12,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/dec/12/tis-the-time-to-be-jolly-2074826.html,’Tis the time to be jolly,"Simran Ahuja ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Jonas Olssons weekend has been quite busy. Over Saturday and Sunday, the Swedish national residing in Bengaluru didnt just put up his seven-feet tall Christmas tree (complete with ornaments that have been in the family for generations) but also cooked up a storm with pepparkakor (ginger snaps), lussekatter (saffron buns) and vrtbrd (Christmas bread)  all traditional Swedish dishes without which the festive season is incomplete. The coming weekends will have making a batch of Glgg or Swedish spiced mulled wine. The days in between will also see him conducting free carol concerts with the choir he leads, across venues in Bengaluru. Its a busy time but thats exactly how I like it since it reminds me of home, where Christmas preparations begin on December 1, says the 43-year-old HR director at Volvo Group India.Like Olsson, many other members of the expat community too will be celebrating the festive season here. For Nicolas Grossemy, the festive season means quality time with family, but since they are back home in Arras, France, he is now looking forward to spending it with his friends here with a game of Secret Santa and a potluck that involves the closest substitute they could find to turkey: Roast chicken. The one thing he misses most are the Christmas markets of France. Since hot wine is popular at these markets, I am going to make some of that here. Im also going to buy some gingerbread and traditional Buche de Noel cake, says the 28-year-old co-founder of Paris Panini.And since a feast is an integral part of every festival, other expats too are whipping up traditional dishes from back home. For Frances Rao, an American who has been inBengaluru since 1991, this includes Christmas cakes, rum balls and eggnog, whereas for Faith Mbahaotu, the 23rd of December has been kept aside for preparing Jollof rice, a popular dish in Nigeria. Comprising rice, chicken or beef, tomatoes, chilli, onion, peas and carrots, Mbahaotu compares it to biryani. But the procedure is where the magic lies, says the 26-year-old student.Petra Wendelborn too celebrated the second Sunday of Advent with traditional German treats such as Christstollen, special cookies like Zimtsterne and Glhwein (a hot red wine). This is her first Christmas in the city after arriving here last year with her husband. We were surprised at the festive spirit we see. There are tree lighting ceremonies and our Indian friends have carol singing sessions, which we appreciate so much, she says, adding that in Germany, they go to church for mass, but are giving it a skip here to avoid the traffic.Though she may miss out on that part of her annual tradition, Wendelborn doesnt mind too much as she will still be spending the festival with her daughter, who is flying in from Germany soon. While she looks forward to reuniting with her family, Luiz Fernando Pizzani is all too glad to be miles away from them this Christmas. The Brazilian is a brewmaster at The Big Pitcher and says Christmas came early with him brewing a special plum cake ale for the microbrewery. Back home, I have to worry about the gifts to give and spending time with relatives, which can be slightly annoying. Of course, I miss my family but Im just looking forward to a quiet Christmas here in Bengaluru, he says."

Police filed an FIR four days after the robbery because, they said, they were waiting for a written complaint.Retired accountant Vimal Kishore Sahay, 63, and his wife Indu Bala, 60, live alone in the two-storey house; their sons live in Gurgaon and Delhi. Around 3.10am on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday, Vimal woke up and found the door to his room was jammed with a cloth. He screamed for help and tried to open the door. He sensed someones presence and his calls for help made the robbers flee, his son Abhishek, a lawyer, said.With a lot of effort, the couple managed to break open the door  only to find that the main door to the house had also been locked from the outside. My mother managed to undo the knot, which had been tied with a rope, and come out of the room. They found the house door was locked, so they went up to the terrace and called for help, Abhishek said. Neighbours finally heard them and let them out around 4.30am.They found items worth Rs 4 lakh had been stolen  two gold jewellery sets, silver anklets, a laptop and charger in a bag, two strolleys. The robbers had also taken away milk and tomatoes from the fridge.The family said it suspects there were more than two people, who planned this after keeping an eye on the couples movements and may have broken into the house earlier in the evening.My father had been to the market in the evening, which is when my mother usually keeps the door ajar. That is when someone may have entered, Abhishek said.The FIR was finally filed on Wednesday. The couple gave us a verbal complaint and we were waiting for a written complaint. That came on Monday and an FIR was lodged under sections 380 (theft) and 342 (wrongful confinement). We had been investigating the case in the meantime, Phase III station house officer Devendra Singh said. Footage from CCTV cameras on roads near the house are yet to be scanned, Abhishek said, adding that police had questioned labourers who were working on the ground floor of the house."

Read MoreCondolence MeetCHAMARAJANAGAR: A year has passed since the tragedy at Sulwadi Maramma temple took place but the families of the victims are yet to receive any help from the government.As many as 17 devotees died and 120 took ill after they consumed tomato rice served as prasad during a puja at the temple on December 14, 2018. The prasad was laced with insecticide. The conspiracy was hatched by the two accused  Immadi Mahadeva Swami of Salur Mutt and Doddaiah Thambadi  to take revenge against temple trustee Chinappi, who had reportedly come in their way in looting the temple funds. Ambika and her husband Madesha too are part of the gang.Sulwadi Maramma temple that lies in MM Hills wildlife area has been sealed after the tragedy.The government had promised land, house and jobs in the government sector for the families of victims. However, except financial assistance and treatment, nothing has been done so far, said Narasimha of Bidarahalli. Six of his relatives  Gopiamma, Salamma, Shantharaju, Shakthivelu, Ranga and seven-year-old Preetham  died after consuming the temple food.The painful memory is still fresh in the mind of Preethams father Sanmuga, a daily wage worker from Bidarahalli. On the fateful day, his wife Madamma had taken their three children including Preetham to the temple. She and Preetham ate the tomato rice. While the young boy sucumbed to the poison, his mother survived. She was ill for a long time. She has become very weak and is yet to come out of depression. Earlier, every morning we would go together in search of work . But now she feels too tired and lacks the energy to work. Because of her condition I too have stopped going to far-off places to work. This has affected our livelihood. The government had promised us land. The officials keep saying that land will be given, but we dont know when, Sanmuga told TOI.Narasimha, who was treated at Cauvery Hospital in Mysuru, said he often encounters eye-related problems and is unable to work properly. Recently, 36 survivors were given six sheep each. But the government should provide us land, he insisted.Chamarajanagar deputy commissioner BB Cauvery informed that compensation has been given to the kin of victims and survivors from the Chief Minister and Prime Minister Relief Funds. The process of giving 2-acres land near Martalli (Bidarahalli) to 58 homeless families is underway and the land will be handed over to them soon.According to officials, about 10 victims families belonging to the scheduled caste were given Rs 15.2 lakh each and seven other families were given Rs 7 lakh each. Those who survived were given help between Rs 25,000 to Re 1 lakh depending on the severity of the illness. About 28 families were given Re 1 lakh each under self-employment scheme from the department of backward classes.Villagers have organized a meeting at Sri Brahmeshwara swamy temple in Sulwadi on Saturday to condole the death of 17 villagers in Sulwadi Maramma temple tragedy. A banner with the pictures of all victims has been put up at the village as remembrance."
2019-12-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/frisky-whisky-under-the-stars/article30295684.ece,Frisky whisky under the stars,"Strobe lights, multicoloured dance floors, an ever-moving, sweaty crowd  the word nightclub is synonymous with all this.But ECRs first nightclub, The Gatsby Lounge (to be launched on December 15), nestled in the 40-acre property of InterContinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort, thwarts all conventions to remain an intimate setting, though conceived as a lounge for its club members. Be it the minimal lighting, low-cushioned seating or the music: this space, located right above the reception, calls for a relaxing evening with drinks, bar eats and the odd dal makhani mac and cheese.The interiors are sombre-lit, with small booths on the left. The bar, replete with high stools, takes up the opposite side. The space, a lounge area, transforms into a nightclub only on the weekends, post 7 pm.A detachable indoor dance floor is testimony to the same  separate panels are assembled together to form the slight elevation once the bar is functional. At other times, the floor remains carpeted. Minimal lighting, directly above the dance floor, and on the corners, comes alive when the night thickens or when a performance is underway.However, the outdoor setting is what is likely to lure the crowd. Fairy lights wound around trees, lend a soft glow. This luminescence is aided by yellow table lamps. Bottled fairy lights seal the deal: this space is ideal for dates.Designed for a crowd that likes to lounge comfortably as they sip whisky, the outdoor area also allows the party crowd to lazily look up at the sky and contemplate life.The lounge has a limited menu and executive chef Lawrence Amalraj plans to dole out a range that fuses multiple cuisines  mainly, Indian and Asian. For instance, take the curry urundai thokku peratal: a spicy lamb cutlet doused in a tangy tomato dressing, presented on a stick, on which is a lone farfalle. Another dish, features good old baingan bharta served on focaccia  as plain as it sounds, it tastes of comfort.The drink menu comprises classics as well as a few signature cocktails, in addition to imported liquor, wine, and champagne. The ginger curry leaf martini is an unusual take that will satisfy the unapologetic South Indian in you. Their take on whisky sour, called frisky whisky, is an acidic (not in an overpowering way), zesty drink made from fresh orange extract, mint and whisky.Though The Gatsby Lounge claims to be inspired by the roaring 20s in America, the music and food do little to recreate that picture. Apart from live jazz performances over the weekend, the ambient music falls into the trap of popular numbers.This, Arohi Tambe, director of marketing says, is an effort to cater to all markets. For instance, some request fusion music, and not authentic jazz, she says, adding that, in the weeks to come, they plan to host informal salsa sessions for the crowd, in collaboration with Delve studios."

Class III, IV and V students were given the duty to water the plants everyday with the help of class teachers for half-an-hour.Recently, the vegetable harvest in the school was inaugurated by Kalliyoor panchayat president R Jayalekshmi and ward member Manoj K Nair. During the function, the school was declared as the only school which sources organic produce for its midday meal programme.Vegetables that are unavailable in our garden are brought from Sangamitra, a society by the farmers of Vellayani that provides organic vegetables, said Shaji.

For some reason, the tickets Id booked on Vayudoot (remember that dodgy airline?) for the handsome sum of Rs 250 got cancelled and I couldnt re-book them. All the other flights to Goa were full by then, and I had to get to Goa for a wedding, so I jumped on a bus that took off from Dadar in the evening. It was a terrible bus. The seats were musty and cramped and the windows were dirty and the curtains smelly. The rattling promised to rearrange my insides, and so I thought the only way I could survive this ride was to get smashed and fall asleep.We reached Mahad, on the Bombay-Goa road, at about 10 pm for a dinner and evacuation stop. I headed straight to the bar to find some booze. Dark rum was the only strong alcohol they had. And although I dont really drink rum, I bought a quarter because the rum was available only in quarts and not millilitres. By the time I had decided, paid and settled down with some rum and cola, the bus revved up as if to start and my fellow passengers started clambering back in.I looked at the bus, and then at the bottle. It didnt seem right to carry the bottle on board, so I just knocked the whole quarter down in one go and jumped on. I was knocked out. Nearly 12 hours later I woke up in Mapusa, Goa. I had missed the whole ride, including a couple of stops and the breakfast halt in Kudal. I was hot, hungover and hungry.Looking out of the window, I realised the bus terminated at Mapusa and would not go on to Panaji. Too disoriented to find out more, I went off to try and deal with my hunger. Destiny led me to Caf St Francis Xavier. Its one of the oldest eateries in Mapusa. Here I had my first tryst with real sorpotel, sausage and curry rice. The sorpotel was mature and fiery, the vindaloo sour and spicy and the sausage, an acquired taste that took me a minute to acquire, all eaten with hot poi (Goan bread) a side of beef patties, croquettes and potato-and-egg chops.My life thereafter became one merry ride of vindaloos, sorpotels and chorizo. Occasionally, caldine, cafreal and xacuti. Without even looking back to see whether this small state with a vast Hindu population had another cuisine.It was at the Mandovi Hotel in Panaji, some time later, that I discovered the vast world of Hindu Goan cuisine. With dishes like Hooman, a mild and sour mackerel curry made with grated coconut paste and spices; muddoshya (lady fish), slightly different from the Christian Goan fish curry because of the spice mix; khatkhate, a mixed-vegetable and lentil stew cooked by the states Goud Saraswat Brahmins, spiced with curry leaves, ginger, black pepper, chillies and turmeric. Its a must on days of fasting when the community eats just vegetarian food.Udid Methi is another kind of curry typical of the Saraswats of Goa and Karwar. Its unusual taste comes from a combination of black gram and dried fenugreek seeds that combust excitedly with mackerel. And finally, the kaju biyaam tondak, made with fresh raw cashew nuts, coconut and no onion or garlic; you can add to it almost anything  vegetables, lentils, pulses  because the raw cashew or bibya in this dish is used as a pulse.Unless youre visiting a Saraswat Goan home, though, the Hindu cuisine is hard to find. I just discovered a whole lot of it at Goa Portuguesa in Dadar. My early advertising and theatre days in the 80s and 90s were spent guzzling alcohol, feasting on prawn-stuffed papads and gorging on choriz pav while a merry crooner with a guitar serenaded us with old nostalgic songs and merry Konkani numbers at this fun-filled restaurant. Chef Deepa Awchats menu of Goan Hindu food for me went quite unnoticed amid the haze of vinegar, pork and bread. But then I was invited to a feast last week. A feast to celebrate 31 years of Goa Portuguesa. A feat not many restaurants in Mumbai can boast of.I decide to go, for old times sake, this time determined to concentrate on the food. And Im so glad I did. Of course there was the inevitable pork sorpotel, nearly pickled and the finest Id eaten in a long time; caldine prawn curry with ukade tandool (red Goan rice), artfully flavoured with kismur (dried shrimp roasted crisp, garnished with chopped onion, coriander and spices).But it was the Goan Hindu food that stood out. Tender coconut and cashew nut sukke (juliennes of the two sauteed with tomatoes and spring onion); rajma tondak (rajma and French beans seasoned with Goan spices and simmered in coconut milk); moongacho ghati (sprouted green gram with dry coconut and cashew nut, tempered and cooked in coconut milk); green pea xacuti (cooked in a dark coconut gravy); and tisreo sukke (clams sauted in onion and freshly ground spices, garnished with grated coconut).The meal ended with Amore being belted out in the background and a serving of serradura, a simple dessert which is a combination of sweetened whipped cream, powdered tea biscuits and a chilled bowl of trifle pudding. The evening transported me back to Goa, and did it without a single drop of alcohol. Now thats a feat."
2019-12-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fashion/know-you-makeup-what-makes-collagen-essential-for-the-skin-6171647/,Know your makeup: What makes collagen essential for the skin,"Collagen provides vital protection to the skin by impeding the absorption of toxins and pathogens. Collagen provides vital protection to the skin by impeding the absorption of toxins and pathogens.Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, constituting about 35 per cent of the whole-body protein content and about 80 per cent of the skins epidermis. It is made of amino acids  glycine, proline, hydroxyproline and arginine. The human body makes its own collagen but its production slows down with age, making skin sag and joints break down.Collagen has widespread use in cosmetic surgeries and related procedures as a healing aid for burn patients, for reconstruction of bone and numerous dental orthodontic and surgical procedures. It is also used in the skincare and wellness industry for its anti-ageing and skin fortifying tendencies.A study published in Natural Ingredient Resource Center, as well as ISCD (International Society for Clinical Densitometry), was undertaken to investigate the anti-ageing effects of oral supplementation of sea-buckthorn oil, a plant-based ingredient that boosts collagen production in the body and its topical skin application. Both treatments significantly improved the skin hydration status and the overall skin elasticity of the subjects.What is collagen?Collagen is one of the most important protein compounds that form in the body and is the primary constituent of fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. In the human body, the collagen content per unit area starts decreasing at the rate of 1 per cent every year. Therefore, it is essential to stop the breakdown of collagen to delay ageing and wrinkle formation.It is also used in a multitude of food supplements as it improves skin health, provides relief from joint pain, helps prevent bone damage, aids in boosting muscle mass and also promotes a healthy heart. Collagen lends elasticity and strengthens the skin and helps in tissue and organ development. It consists of amino acids, generally found in egg whites, grouped together to form the triple helix of elongated fibrils. The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen. It was earlier used to obtain glue by boiling the skin and tendons of horses and other hoofed animals.The mineral silica, rock-forming minerals made up of silicate groups, is essential for optimal collagen synthesis as it activates the hydroxylation enzymes which help in improving skin strength and elasticity. Common sources of silica including fresh fruits, herbs and vegetables especially the edible peel of various fruits such as apples, cucumbers, carrot etc.Here are some of the essential benefits of this magical ingredient:* Collagen fortifies blood vessels and plays a vital role in tissue development. It is also present in the cornea and the lens of the eye in crystalline form.* Most of the sources for collagen extraction are animal-based such as bovine (cattle), porcine (pigs), and marine.* It also has many uses in the food industry especially in the process for producing gelatin which is used in many desserts.* Collagen is also widely used in the pharmaceutical and photographic industries.* Water is also a significant source of silicon dioxide, so make sure you keep body well hydrated.* Made by simmering animal bones in water, this process is believed to extract the collagen. When making this at home, season the broth with spices for flavour.* Besides, leafy greens such as spinach, kale, mint, coriander, beans, cashews, tomatoes, bell pepper, etc, also have enough collagen.* Vitamin C plays a major role in the production of pro-collagen hence citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are full of this nutrient.Nowadays certain plant extracts and herbs are gaining popularity as collagen builders that initiate synthesis in the skin. They are especially beneficial for vegetarians and vegans. Plant extracts also have the potential ability to scavenge free radicals and protect the skin matrix by impeding enzymatic degradation.There are both external and internal factors that lead to collagen degradation. While the Intercellular degradation is due to the proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the proteins into peptides in an acidic environment, the extracellular degradation is due to factors such as prolonged sun exposure, smoking, diet, lifestyle etc, remarks Mihir Gadani, Co-founder & COO of OZiva.Collagen deficiency in humans can be met through natural plant boosters and animal-based supplements. Otherwise, too, it has a variety of uses in industries and avenues. It is one of Mother Natures most essential and omnipresent building blocks and magical ingredient for your health and beauty, adds Gadani. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-18,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/onions-from-alwar-hit-110-per-kg-as-rain-sends-supply-tumbling-in-chandigarh/story-ZpzAUp79BAjajWxaJbyDOO.html,Onions from Alwar hit ₹110 per kg as rain sends supply tumbling in Chandigarh,"chandigarhUpdated: Dec 18, 2019 06:02 ISTOnion prices at apni mandis, which had come down to 90 per kg for the Alwar variant, and 70 per kg for those imported from Afghanistan and Turkey, have become dearer by 20 each, following the rain last week.With supply trucks getting stranded due to the downpour on December 13 and 14, the onion from Rajasthans Alwar has hit an all-time high of 110 per kg, a price that the Nashik variant was fetching in November before its supply ran out.As per Punjab Mandi Board officials, Alwar onion was almost 20 cheaper than that from Nashik.When the latters price had reached 70 per kg in November, the Alwar variety was available for 50 per kg. But as it was inferior in quality, customers still preferred Nashik onion, despite its higher price tag.However, due to the rains in North India last week, supply had been affected. Several trucks were stranded due to the hailstorms in Rajasthan, delaying arrival of fresh stocks in the city. This further caused the vegetables number to dwindle at the wholesale market in Sector 26.Officials said the wholesale price of the Alwar onion has touched 100 per kg here as well.President of the apni mandis in Chandigarh, Parlad Singh, said, Now that the weather has improved, normal supply will resume in a few days and prices will drop soon. However, the prices can continue to increase till then.BL Sharma, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, said the new crop of onions from Nashik will reach the city by the first week of January, and will significantly help bring down the onion rates.FEW TAKERS FOR AFGHANISTAN ONIONSingh said though the onion from Afghanistan was cheaper than the Alwar variety, it hadnt caught the customers fancy. Though their size, which can cross 250gm per onion bulb, captures the buyers attention, they are useless in domestic use, he added.On the other hand, the Turkish variant was smaller in size and considerably better in quality, and was thus being chosen by customers.POTATO PRICES ALSO HEAD NORTHEven though the monsoon rain had majorly affected the prices of only onions and tomatoes, the cost of potato, which was 10 per kg till November 30, has shot up by 200% to 30 per kg.Singh said, The monsoon rain had destroyed the fields of several farmers near Jalandhar, damaging the potato crop. The recent rains have also harmed the local crop. The only supply still in place is coming from Sirhind. The vegetable may become even more expensive if the local crop isnt ready soon."

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock) It can be extremely irritating to live with sinusitis, cold, flu, allergies and other symptoms of the common cold. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)December is here and winter has arrived, along with it comes seasonal flu, colds and other ailments. The weather is colder, the days are shorter and many struggles to maintain a happy, healthy mindset. Its a myth where many people believe that cold is caught by not keeping yourself warm in winter or being exposed to chilling weather.Cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract when the virus particles are inhaled. The common cold is spread through infected persons sneeze, speech and from loose particles from the nose while wiping. The virus can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with respiratory secretions, says Dr Saad Hafeez Usmani, Consultant- Internal Medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital Whitefield.Common health problems in wintersSore throat: Painful, scratchy or dryness in the throat which later leads to pain is some of the most common symptoms of sore throat. It is mostly caused due to infections and weather circumstances.Asthma: It is a lung disease, in which inflammation and narrowing of the airways occur. Sneezing, coughing, chest tightening are some of its symptoms. There are two types of asthma:Allergic: Which is caused due to exposure to an allergen, such as dust, pollen, paint dust, smoke.Non- Allergic: Caused by cold, flu, stress or extreme weather.Painful joints: Orthopedicians say that in cold weathers, the human body will conserve more heat, and more blood would be circulated to the heart and lungs. So, when this happens the arms, shoulders, knee joints blood vessels will contract leading to pain.Flu: Flu also called as Influenza, which is a severe illness caused due to contagious respiratory viruses. The symptoms vary from mild to severe which at times can result in hospitalization and rarely death. Usually, young kids or older people whose immune systems are weak are often targeted to flu.Heart attack: Elderly people are more at risk due to a drop in body temperature (hypothermia) in the colder months. The heart is affected by increased heart rate and blood pressure, where the heart needs to function harder to keep the body warm. These changes increase the risk of blood clots or thickening of the blood vessels which leads to heart attack and stroke.Possible prevention and care* Washing hands thoroughly, covering mouth and nose to avoid dust, drinking plenty of fluids, eating a healthy diet with fresh fruits and vegetables to keep the immune system strong.* Regular exercise especially such as yoga and swimming is beneficial for the long run.* Use of antibiotics and self -medication is to be avoided.* Vaccination recommended for elderly, children and people with chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes.* A constant in south Indian cuisine  Rasam and savoured in every meal, it is prepared with a base of tamarind juice, pepper, tomato, cumin and other spices. It is traditionally prepared using tamarind juice as a base, with the addition of Indian sesame oil, turmeric, tomato, chilli pepper, pepper, garlic, cumin, curry leaves, mustard, coriander, asafoetida, sea salt and water. Rasam is a classic example of traditional functional food with all its ingredients medicinally claimed for various ailments.* Ginger helps break down mucus formed around the lungs and helps in easy breathing. It even reduces inflammation in the airways and respiratory tracts. Include sliced or grated ginger in your morning water.* Rich in antioxidants, cloves have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and dental-soothing properties. Widely recognised for its medicinal and culinary qualities, these dried flower buds have a distinct flavour and intense aroma. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

2019-12-21,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2019/dec/22/harvest-of-taste-2078442.html,Harvest of Taste,"Shilpi Madan ByExpress News ServiceNext time you raise a toast to vodka with hints of elderflower, savour the special handpicked floral inclusion. Much like tender pickled pine shoots that bring in the tartish accent. Masterchefs and food lovers alike are gathering food in the wild to reconnect with nature.A taste of the earthy and the unexplored is what this brings to your plate. Chef Rohan Dsouza recently uncovered a realm of exciting finds during his trip to Copenhagen. In Scandinavian countries, certain fruits like the reindeer berry make an appearance for only a couple of weeks, owing to the extreme temperatures. Cloudberries were a golden find in the Nordic region: tastes like raspberry, visually a showstopper. They make for a fabulous inclusion in winter dessert recipes, he says.It was so simple: cooking with fresh, locallyavailable ingredients.Chef Amninder SandhuRecently Chef Vicky Ratnani went to Nagaland, and to Goa as well to ferret out the relatively unknown for possible inclusions in his dishes. I accompanied a group of bartenders to Goa and came away with pretty cool finds. They used the booty in mixology and I made use of the uncommon herbs in my dishes.Whats the most fascinating aspect about these serendipity-driven journeys? The love of the unknown that you may chance upon something undiscovered is always thrilling, confesses Chef Prateek Sadhu. Born in Kashmir, he goes on annual foraging treks in Ladakh. Last year, we stumbled upon fresh lavender. This year, we came across cloudberries, that we thought were specific to the Nordic region. That is the beauty of foraging. A few years back we found sour plum. Kashmiri cuisine never had tomatoes as an ingredient so this was often used as a souring agent, he adds.But isnt the concept of foraging journeys a bit glamorised? Forget chancing upon meaty morels (read the wild prized guchchi from Kashmir) and selling them for a whopper to Michelin-starred restaurants, that easily. Havent all of us dipped into what was around us and readily available to cook up our own concoctions? Says Chef Amninder Sandhu. Having been brought up in Jorhat in Assam, I remember going with my siblings and our uncle into the forests, plucking herbs, catching fish from the river, and then cooking it there on a makeshift bonfire. My uncle used to marinate the trout and shove it insidethe bamboo we picked up there. It was so simple: cooking with fresh, locally available ingredients.Talking about the evolution of foraging Chef Dsouza recalls, These days foraging has been romanticised as a marketing concept. We would bank on the Mandovi river in Goa for fresh finds in oysters and clams during my childhood. Then there are vegetables specific to the Western Ghats that make for brilliant flavours. The kanntam is a fabulous berry that is foraged along the ribs of the Ghats from thorny bushes. It looks a lot like blueberry, and is black on the outside and white on the inside.But Chef Rahul Akerkar is quick to point out, Going into the countryside, the woods, charting unknown territory in search of edibles is foraging. You need to go out into the wild unmapped area a la Robinson Crusoe to come up with something. Going to smaller markets to pick up obscure finds is sourcing. So, the next time you nibble on the karaunda (tart pinkish white taut berry) plucked from its thorny bush on the outskirts of Lucknow or scoop up slugs by the bucketfuls from your slushy backyard in London or relish the tartish chutney made from seasonal find kachri (wild cucumber) in Rajasthan, rejoice in your mini harvest."

The crop is cultivated in thousands of hectares in Pathikonda and Alur every Kharif and Rabi seasons.This year, it was cultivated in nearly 8,000 hectares.Every tomato farmer invests Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 per acre, including on fertilisers and farmhands. As the crop takes 10 months to yield, crop harvesting is done at least 10 times every crop season.From the first four harvests, they usually get Rs 25 to Rs 40 per kg at wholesale markets. The price decreases in subsequent harvests.Without government intervention, the price may dip further to 20 paise per kg by January, farmers feared.Bumper harvest is the main cause of decreasing rates of tomato crop. Also, this crop does not have a long shelf life. Tomatoes are regularly exported to Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra from here, officials said.Mangali Ramakrishna, a farmer from Gadderalla in Devanakonda mandal, said he cultivated the crop in an extent of five acres by investing Rs 1.5 lakh.After harvesting, the produce was transported to Pathikonda agriculture market in rented tractors. Upon reaching the market, middlemen said the prices have dipped to 50 paise per kg. If I sell the produce at the price quoted by middlemen, I will not be left with any money to repay debts, he rued.Ramakrishna urged the government to intervene and help the farmers get a marginal price of Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg.Another farmer, P Naveen Gupta from Devanakonda mandal, said he had cultivated tomato in an extent of 10 acres. This year, the yield was high compared to last year, he said."

However, there are a few enterprising individuals who have found a way to trump these setbacks.Solution? Growing food at home, something 65-year-old Ganapathy Iyer has been doing for the past nine months. Today, every inch of the 1,000 sqft terrace of his house is producing vegetables that his household needs. I am growing around 22 types of vegetables, said Ganapathy.Based in Kozhikode, Ganapathy has also begun cultivating exotic vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. With the onion price skyrocketting, I thought why not try growing some on my terrace? Ive sowed a row and expecting a good yield in four to five months, he said.According to him, the cultivation on his terrace farm is a continual process. While some plants have begun yielding, others are reaching maturity, said Ganapathy. According to him, he grows vegetables in grow bags and plastic cans that have been modified into pots.There are 200 such bags and cans on my terrace. I have begun getting yield from the ladys finger, cowpea, brinjal and ridge gourds, he said. There are various types of leafy vegetables like a particular variety of taro that has been developed for its edible leaves and stems. Besides the usually-grown vegetables, I also have cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, beetroot, tomatoes, snake gourd, bitter gourd, different types of chillies, ash gourd, bottles gourd, pumpkin and cucumber. I have herbs like mint and coriander along with curry leaves in my terrace farm, he said.Ganapathy also uses drip and wick irrigations. Also, he has used rain shelter to prevent his vegetables from rotting due to excessive rain. Ganapathy practises organic farming. I use coco peat, soil and cow dung to fill the bags and cans. To fertilise the soil, I use groundnut oil cake, he said. He uses neem seed cake to ward off pests and the rain shelter also acts as a pest deterrent. I spend a lot of my time at my terrace farm. My wife helps me out, added Ganapathy. With every inch of his terrace taken up by the grow bags and cans, he is now planning to make use of every inch of the 5.5 cents of land on which his house has been built."

Retail inflation hovered mainly in the range of 2-3.30 per cent from January to August and started to move up steadily post-monsoon as crop damage due to unseasonal rains hurt the supplies in a big way.It unexpectedly hit a pause button on cutting the key (repo) interest rate, giving more importance to prevailing inflation pressure and rising food prices over a worrying slowdown in the economy.The status quo came in after five consecutive cuts in repo rate since February, as the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, unanimously voted to hold the key repo rate at 5.15 per cent and reverse repo rate at 4.90 per cent. ""Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors.First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020,"" RBI said on December 5.ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar expects moderation in vegetable prices to a large extent by early 2020.""Healthy groundwater and reservoir levels bode well for rabi output and yields of various cereals.However, the year-on-year decline in the area sown under rabi pulses and oilseeds poses a concern, given the high inflation being recorded by some of these items,"" Nayar said.ICRA expects the CPI inflation to spike further to 5.8-6 per cent in December 2019. On the wholesale front, the 2019 inflation story was on a different trajectory with prices moving downwards from a high of 3.58 per cent in January to the lowest 0.16 per cent in October mainly on account of cheaper fuel and power.The up-tick of WPI inflation to 0.58 per cent in November was attributable to costlier vegetables, mainly onion as well as pulses.As per the government data, prices of onion in the wholesale market went up by 172 per cent in November from a year ago.On the WPI-CPI divergence, brokerage firm Anand Rathi said at 5.5 per cent in November, retail inflation was at a multi-year high while, in the same month, WPI inflation at 0.6 per cent was modest.""High food inflation contrasted with deflation in fuel and manufactured product inflation is creating this situation as the retail price index assigns much higher weights to food than does the WPI.Besides, the inclusion of services in retail but not in the wholesale index continued, as, despite being on a falling clip, services inflation was relatively elevated,"" as per Anand Rathi.CARE Ratings expects inflation to range in 4-4.5 per cent for the rest of the year (2019-20), adding the ""base effect will not be favourable in the coming months"".While the surge in vegetable prices will eventually reverse, the elevated inflation for pulses needs to be watched with caution, unless rabi sowing picks up pace, according to Nayar.""The RBI rate pause is likely to continue. The RBI targets retail inflation, which has jumped 240 basis points (bps) in the last four months and is now close to the upper end of the RBI's target zone. Consequently, despite low core and WPI inflation, as also deflation in fuel and manufactured product prices, the RBI is unlikely to cut the policy rate soon.

Approaching the restaurant, which is located on the posh 80 Feet Road of Indiranagar, the first thing that I immediately noticed was the green theme. With palm leaves standing up to the ceiling, rock walls with pastel colours, chairs made out of bamboo and plants everywhere, Flax sends out a warm vibe to customers. Immediately after this, they are greeted with a hashtag  #redoyourfood -and doodles on the wall.Deciding what to eat was a confusing activity as the menu had some impressive, healthy options to choose from. I began my culinary treat with a drink called The Game Changer, which was a mix of almond milk, coconut sugar and cinnamon powder. This drink is said to boost up your energy and acts as an appetiser. Next, I had wheat bread sticks with hummus.The bread sticks were crispy and the hummus came in three vibrant colours, which also had a lovely flavour of garlic. The combination of the two was delicious.I was having a salad craving and ordered a whole grain pasta salad which comprised arugula, spinach, tomato, corn, spring onion, whole wheat fussili, grilled paneer, olives, and sun-dried tomato with basil pesto dressing. Not only nutritious, the salad was also quite filling.I decided on a Mexican Super Bowl and my dining companion went for an Egg and Avocado Sandwich for the main course. The Mexican bowl was more than enough for two people and included healthy ingredients like mixed beans, corn, and grilled paneer. It consisted of Guacamole, salsa crudo, greek yoghurt, ragi chips, chipotle with a mango dressing. The sandwich was thick, and had a blend of egg and avocado paste, which can leave one asking for more. Also, true to its name, most of the dishes had flax seeds as an important ingredient.For desserts, I ordered the Healthy Heart Smoothie, which had blueberry, mango, flax seeds and almond milk. The smoothie was heavy and delectable. Even with a filled tummy, I couldnt help but order their Belgian chocolate ice cream. It had no added sugar and was high on protein. This ice cream also promises to be less on calories. Being a caffeine lover, I also did not miss out Flaxs special cranberry expresso, which was a good end to the meal.Apart from these delicacies, the menu includes some interestingly named dishes like Bro Dont be So Mush Sandwich, Falafel Wrap, Hummus and Grilled Paneer Wrap, and Mediterranean Chicken Bowl.Cost for two: `1,200 (approx)"

Experts in Food Science and Technology will be guiding the participants with inputs while students will catalyse the activities.The Forum would create various platforms in order to guide, mentor and share the knowledge towards building sustainable food processing in the tiny/cottage level including cluster development programmes.A CFTRI scientist, who shared this information, told The Hindu that the initiative will start with entrepreneurs in Mysuru. Depending on the response, we will consider throwing the platform open to entrepreneurs from the rest of the State, he added.Cottage and tiny food manufacturers, who are in the business of preparing food items like jams, pickles, papad, tomato puree, sauce etc., at their homes and the participants of the short-term skill development programmes held by the CFTRI can join MICROENT and benefit from the same.The Institute will be working closely with District Industries Centre (DIC) and CIIs Mysuru chapter to realize the desired objectives.The MICROENT follows similar online exercises taken up by CFTRI earlier that had received an overwhelming response.The SME Corner is an online platform that connects SMEs with CFTRI and helps them set up their food businesses. SMEs who register on the platform will receive guidance not only on setting up their food industry, but also permit them to post queries under different categories, where experts and scientists will answer them."

However, onion and potato continue to hassle consumers. The price of cabbage has come down from Rs 50 per kg to Rs 25 per kg. Similarly, brinjal, which was selling for Rs 40 per kg, is now available for Rs 20 per kg. Price of pumpkin has gone down from Rs 35 per kg to Rs 20 per kg and tomato now available for Rs 20 per kg.Tapan Parida, a Government employee said prices of vegetables have fallen by almost 50 per cent. However, the price of onion and potato has remain unchanged. I am hoping it will come down in the next two weeks, he said. Even as consumers are glad that the prices of vegetables have come crashing by almost 50 per cent, it does not augur well for farmers. The farmers said with the dip in price, they are unable to make up for their expenditure on fertiliser and irrigation.Jiban Behera, a vegetable farmer from Chandol said traders from Cuttack and Bhubaneswar procure vegetables from the district and sell them for huge profit in malls. He said exploitation by middlemen is rampant in the district. Secretary of district unit of Krusaka Sabha Gayadhar Dhal said owing to lack of cold storage and food processing plants, vegetable growers of the district are forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices."

(File) Arrivals, farmers and traders said, had improved given the favourable weather conditions in major vegetable-growing areas of Pune. (File)Written by Tiyashi DattaVegetable prices have started cooling down as arrivals have improved in wholesale as well as retail markets in Pune.Arrivals, farmers and traders said, had improved given the favourable weather conditions in major vegetable-growing areas of Pune. While prices of onion are still soaring, prices of other vegetables like okra, cauliflower and brinjal have gone down in the last month. According to data shared by Punes Agricultural Produce Market Committee, okra, which was selling at Rs 4,000 per quintal a week ago, has come down to Rs 3,000.Similarly, cost of brinjal has come down to Rs 1,200 per quintal from Rs 1,500 a week ago and Rs 5,000 a month ago. Cluster bean is retailing at a price of Rs 3,000 per quintal, a correction from Rs 5,000 a month ago.Presently, the price of tomato has also gone down from Rs 1,200 per quintal last week to Rs 1,000 this week. Though the yield of tomato is high, farmers are still facing losses due to the drop in market price. The price is at Rs 2 to 3 per kg. Farmers are suffering a lot. They need at least Rs 20 per kg to recover their cost of production, said Deepak Bhise, President, Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Bhise said a good crop was expectd in the days ahead. The transplantation of tomato will continue during the month of March and April and the yield will be high. But December and January will also see transplantation. So, there is a high chance that prices will fall again, added Bhise.Farmers planting cauliflower are also facing losses. The price of cauliflower, which was Rs 2,500 per quintal a month ago, has reduced to Rs 1,200 this week. What has worried the growers is the almost absence of cold, which they said could take a toll on the crop. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

If you ask officials from the railway depatment, theyll all narrate how Kunal has been feeding the poor and hungry every day for years. Some beggars, whom TNSE spoke to, say they consider Kunal family.Kunal recalls how his father Suresh Kamle, who was a butcher, saw a group of his friends from the Muslim community shelling out some of their earnings for welfare activities for the poor. This helped him decide to do the same. Suresh then started offering food to the poor at the vegetable market in Camp Area of Belagavi. Soon, it became a regular activity for him, which sparked a tradition that has been in the Kamle family for years.Kunal dropped out of school when he was in Class 9, and started working in a bakery. His older brother Pavan, who works in a garments shop, helps Kunal out too. Suresh passed away about 10 years ago, when Kunal was 16 years old. And now Kunal carries on his legacy. He lives in a small rented house, from where he takes catering orders from a few regulars customers, which helps him earn his living and also afford to feed as many as he can.The menu changes on a daily basis, says Kunal. Its usually two chapatis, one vegetable, tomato rice/pohe/uppitu that is distributed to the poor. Kunal cooks the food himself, with his mother Jayashris help, before packing the meals well. Then, he heads out to the railway station and bus stand and hands the food packets out to the poor.Recently, Kunal has started ensuring that the poor are also kept warm. On one of his regular rounds, one beggar asked Kunal if he could get him a bedsheet to sleep on, which Kunal shared with a social worker D R Santosh. Santosh then shared this on social media and donations started to pour in. Dozens of bedsheets and blankets were then distributed among the poor.Kunal told TNSE that just like his dad, he feels an immense sense of satisfaction by helping those in need. I will continue the practice till the next generation takes over, he says.Rehan Phirjade, an executive at the railway ticket counter, says that he has been watching Kunal distributing meals for the last several years. For some of the poor people at the station, Kunal is a permanent source of dinner. Arif Jatti, a rickshaw driver who was spotted at the station rickshaw stand, said he has seen Kunal distribute meals at the bus stand and railway station. We autowallahs have been watching Kunal for years, but cant understand how he affords to feed so many people, every day, he says.30 meals a dayKunal says that he prepares a total of 30 meals per day for the beggars, for which he spends about Rs 300. Sometimes, he makes more food than needed, and has to return home with the packets. Sometimes there will be more mouths to feed than meals prepared. But theres not much I can do as going back home and cooking more meals is not an option, he says."

It was decided that higher buffer stock of about 1 lakh tonne will be created for next year,"" the official told PTI.Cooperative Nafed, which had maintained the buffer stock of onion on behalf of the government, will continue to do so next year.It will source the rabi (winter) onion crop -- which has higher shelf life -- between March and July directly from farmers, the official added.ALSO READ: After onions, edible oils to burn a hole in your pocketThis year, onion prices rose sharply due to 26 per cent fall in kharif and late kharif (summer) production due to late monsoon and later untimely rains in key growing states especially Maharasthra and Karnataka.To check rising prices, the government took several measures to boost the domestic availability including a ban on exports, stock limits on traders besides the sale of onion at subsidised rates from its buffer stock and imports.Already, the government has exhausted its buffer stock of onion which was disposed at a subsidised rate in the local market. Now, it is selling imported ones.ALSO READ: Not just onions, now tomatoes too will pinch your pocketMMTC, which is importing on behalf of the government, has contracted about 45,000 tonnes of onion from Turkey, Afghanistan and Egypt.

Only two of the 129 voters in the village have participated in the local body polls. This, because many petitions and a handful of elections later, the way to their village remains roadless.Even as the people have had to suffer its consequences over the years, the district administration has only been able to offer reassurances that have not been acted upon yet.The village -- located 30 km from Karamadai -- is inside the forest and falls under the ambit of the Velliyankadu panchayat. It was slotted for the second phase of the local body polls and the villagers were assigned the polling booth at Aravakkadu. By the end of the day, only two had registered their votes.The decision to boycott the polls was to draw the administration's attention to the fact that they still do not have a bitumen road connecting their village to the Gopanari area. This development, as expected, brought a team of officials led by Mettupalayam Tahsildar Shanthamani to the village for peace talks.Despite their many assurances, the villagers stood firm by their decision.History repeats itselfFor this is not the first time the officials have tried to offer reassurances just to get the villagers to vote. ""We had decided to stay away from the parliamentary elections in May too. However, the revenue divisional officer convinced us otherwise. It was based on his assurance that we voted in the election then. Seven months later, there is still no road to the village. Hence, we decided to boycott the local body election, particularly given that there has been no written assurance from the district administration about laying roads,"" a villager narrates.The villagers have been finding ways to express their dissent over the years; particularly, over the past one month. A day before Christmas, the youth and students there decided to take matters into their own hands and build a path to their village. An incident in November, when medical care for a sick woman was delayed after the jeep carrying her down the hill got stuck in the muddy road, seems to have spurred them on to find their own solutions. Working with the tools they happened to have at home, they set to work to create a rudimentary path. Even as the Forest Department has repeatedly denied permission for a road, given that the village is in the reserve forest, the work of the students led to the Collector to promise that their grievance would be addressed.When the promise did not translate into work, the villagers hoisted black flags at their houses three days ago. ""Shanthamani and Forest Range Officer (Periyanaickenpalayam) S Suresh visited them with the assurance that the road will be laid only next year. However, Suresh refused to give it in writing. Hence, we decided to boycott the local body polls,"" says another villager.The hard life goes onOver the past decade, the villagers have tried their best to work with what they have. Already disadvantaged by the hilly terrain, they have learnt to rely heavily on jeeps and trucks for everyday tasks. Children going to schools and college hire trucks to get off of the hill. The few people involved in agriculture use jeeps to take the brinjals and tomatoes to the market in Gopanari, 4.5 km away. However, even these vehicles are hard to come by in the rainy season. With the hill roads turning muddy and slushy, no vehicle would dare traverse its expanse, explains one villager.He also points out that there is no power supply to the village. Hence, agriculture too is hard. They end up having to spend enormously on diesel motors, he adds.Assurances and contradictionsAfter the visit to the village on Monday, Shanthamani explained that they have sent a proposal for the road to the Forest Department, as the area is in the forest. The road is expected to be sanctioned next financial year, she added.However, sources in the Forest Engineering Department said that they have received no proposal so far. The department may still decide to lay the road of their own volition or take up a public proposal, they said.Collector K Rajamani, on his part, said that he received a representation from the villagers only a week ago. He had told them, then, that the district administration will do everything possible to fulfil their demand. It was he who sent Shanthamani to them to convince them to participate in the polls. With that having failed, he said that he will discuss the issue with the villagers after the polls."
2019-12-31,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/2010-to-2019-a-decade-of-diets/article30441175.ece,"A decade in diets: how people, industry and practitioners shaped food choices over the past ten years","We all know that if we consume too much beer, cake, pizza and cheeseburgers and all the other things that make life frankly worth living, we will add pounds to our bodies because we have taken in too many calories, says Bill Bryson in his new book, The Body: A Guide for Occupants. The author, who is neither doctor nor scientist, writes for the layperson.Its apt that he talks of the knowledge we now have of what will make us overweight or obese. Obesity itself was declared a disease in 2013; fat a noun that refers to a food group, never a person. A decade ago, In Defense of Food came out, and over the years, we had internalised author Michael Pollans guideline to eat food, not too much, mostly plants. We also got more involved in what we consumed, not leaving it just up to our doctors and dietitians to dictate to us.Power to the peopleCeliac disease or even gluten sensitivity has caused people years of suffering with anything from bloating and diarrhoea to breathing difficulty. People suffering from this and various other auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and allergies that do not have cures in allopathic medicine, have found relief from diet changes.People have stood up and talked about food, says Rachna Chhachhi, a Mumbai-based nutritional therapist and cancer nutrition coach. The reaction against gluten and dairy has happened because there has been suffering at a physical and mental level. Rachna, who reversed an auto-immune condition she was afflicted with, wrote about managing lifestyle diseases through food, in her 2014 book, Restore.We also know a great deal more, and understand the science behind food and health better, says Lovneet Batra, a Delhi-based sports nutritionist. People today know what inflammation within the body is and what causes it [packaged and refined foods, for instance], she says. This doesnt mean people wont drink Diet Coke, but they know its not a good thing to put into the body.Lovneet adds that the thought has shifted, from calories to chemicals  people want to eat organic, stay away from packaged and junk foods, and understand that nutrition is personalised.A supplemental corollarySimilarly, a decade ago, Ritika Samaddar, Regional Head, Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Max Healthcare, Delhi, was busy drawing up therapeutic diets for those afflicted with renal failure, diabetes, and heart and other problems. Today, her patients are those who look for wellness solutions. People ask for better-skin or -hair diets; women on the verge of menopause ask how they should regulate what they eat; and there are those looking at weight loss for a wedding. This proactivity and heightened awareness of wellness, combined with the availability of preventive health check-ups has meant that deficiencies too get detected.Vitamin D3, B12, and micro-nutrient deficiencies like magnesium  these have been seen a lot this decade, says Ritika. Which has led to a boom in the supplements market, including functional foods and drinks (such as those that have probiotics), and dietary supplements (from minerals and vitamins to Chyawanprash).A 2017 publication on nutraceuticals, a sector of dietary supplements, by the Confederation of Indian Industry, reads: While the Global Nutraceuticals market is growing at a CAGR of 6.5%, as per the Drug Marketing and Manufacturing Association, the Indian nutraceuticals market is growing at a much faster rate of 16%.This is also because we now have a substantial senior population: According to Sheela Krishnaswamy, a dietitian based in Bengaluru, The elderly are not able to digest or assimilate as many nutrients as they would have in younger years.Fads and feudsRachna also talks about people taking up polarised views on the two diets of the decade: keto and vegan. People with obesity and diabetes swore by either when they realised that eliminating one food group could have an impact on the body. But what they did was to feed one imbalance with another, she says.Keto, this decades Atkins and Dukan, as well as the vegan diet, both have cult-like followers who hope to convert people. Diets from previous decades did not have this going for them. For every Netflix The Game Changers (a documentary that talks of a vegan diet as best for fitness) there is The Magic Pill (a documentary that glorifies keto).Arnold Schwarzenegger as seen in Netflixs The Game Changers | Photo Credit: NetflixBoth work only for a short period, says Rachna, adding that we now know keto over a long period can impact the kidney and going vegan for long can cause chronic fatigue. This is possibly the first time that fad diets worked because our earlier eating habits were so bad, she elaborates.This decade also saw the rise of the Mediterranean diet, fuelled in India by olive oil companies that hoped to displace locally-made traditional oils. They offered junkets to influencers like dieticians and journalists to olive oil-producing countries, selling the benefits of the oil. There was no doubt of the benefits, but we didnt need it either for our bodies or our style of cooking.Back to basicsDespite this, our native foods have seen a bump up, thanks to a larger movement in revival of all thats traditional and a new-found pride in our culture itself. Theyve also been marketed well, with pretty packaging that targets adults, taking us back to our roots (Conscious Food, Kiru), or children, taking the food to them (Slurrp Farm, Akiva Superfoods).The scriptures have become the backbone of modern healing and a lot of onus is put on food. We always knew what to eat if we had a stomach upset or poor digestion, says Manjari Chandra, Delhi-based dietician. She says now with the Ministry of AYUSH, we have access to traditional healers who can tell us which texts these come from.From green juices and blueberries, we have now settled into a pattern of the flexible diet, eating local and seasonalHowever, there are some nuances here: while people may have found their roots and are willing to try out new health foods in India, they are also travelling more and experiencing world cuisine. All of this comes at a time when theres also stress on living a sustainable lifestyle and eating local and seasonal too. This has led to the growth of a number of foreign foods, like quinoa being grown in India, says Sheela. We neednt be alarmed though, because foods like tomato that do not form a part of our traditional diets have been incorporated into our cooking.This East-meets-West approach has led to the nascent stages of integrative nutrition in India. This means that a blend of traditional medical practices that use food as medicine, and nutrition and dietetics as studied in university might soon be practised.This is an evolving branch of study, and we always thought our (Ayurveda) system is very different from theirs (the Wests allopathy practice). Now we realised that theres a lot in common, says Sheela. The University of Trans-Disciplinary Health Sciences and Technology in Bengaluru, has a course for this.A change in thoughtWe have so far been following American and British guidelines which may not have been correct for us in India. For instance, internationally, it is still said that 50% of food should be carbohydrates, based on the food pyramid, says Manjari. But the 2014 book Death by Food Pyramid: How Shoddy Science, Sketchy Politics and Shady Special Interests Have Ruined Our Health talks of how this diagram has no value.Its also true that the big food industry has manipulated the West a great deal more than it did India. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that 100-percent fresh or reconstituted fruit juice can be a healthy part of the diet of children older than one year when consumed as part of a well-balanced diet.This is a reference to packaged juices, which Indian dieticians reject for regular healthy children, as we believe packaged foods are best avoided.However, as the food industry in India grows, its beginning to have a greater impact on how the government regulates it: Despite planning to, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is yet to pass the colour-coded labelling on foods high in fats, sugar, and salt (HFSS).Collectively, we have managed to talk a great deal about food and nutrition, without being able to bring down obesity levels in our cities. This is the next decades greatest worry."
