Roshne Balasubramanian and Vaishali Vijaykumar give you...Sugar cane juice pongal by Shanthi Ramachandran(Instagram @shaanthram)IngredientsRice: 1 cup (150 g) Moong dal: 1 tbsp Sugarcane juice: 2 cups (You can prepare using the stalk at home or use store-bought juice) Jaggery/palm sugar/kalkandu:  cup or required Ghee: 100 g or required amount Cashew, raisins, coconut pieces for garnishingMethodTake a pan. Add some ghee and roast the moong dal. Keep it aside. Take the rice in a strainer and wash it. Roast it in ghee for a minute in the pan.Add the sugarcane juice, one cup of milk, one cup of water and pressure-cook it on medium flame for about five to six whistles (without keeping the inner vessel) until the rice turns soft.Now, add half a cup of powdered jaggery/palm jaggery or natural brown sugar or karuppatti as per your preference.The pongal will melt but will start to thicken after cooking for a few minutes. Add two tablespoons of fresh ghee and ensure that the pongal doesnt stick to the bottom of the vessel.In another pan, add small pieces of coconut, cashews and fry it in ghee and add to the pongal.Crush a few cardamoms and add it with the skin. Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

Mix well to ensure no lumps are formed.Cover the cooker and pressure-cook for three whistles.Once the pressure is released, open and add two teaspoons of sesame oil.Serve with vadams or appalam.NoteThe water measurement was perfect for this rice kurunai. If the broken rice is little finer than the one I used, you can add three cups of water.Country vegetables sambar by Banumathi Balasubramanian(Instagram @Banumathi Balasubramanian)IngredientsToor dal: 1/2 cup Water: 2 cupTurmeric: 1/4 tsp Sesame oil: 2 tspDry red chilli: 6 Chana dal: 1 tbspCoriander seeds: 2 tbsp Fenugreek: 1 tsp Pumpkin Ash gourd Sweet potato Broad beans Chow chowField beans: 1/4 cup Grated coconut: 2 tbsp Asafoetida; a small pieceTamarind water: 2 cups Salt to tasteMethodPressure-cook 1/2 cup toor dal with two cups water and 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder.

Add in the vegetables and then add 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder. Cook for about seven minutes. Add a small piece of solid asafoetida and two cups of tamarind water extracted from a lemon-sized tamarind. Add salt. Bring to a boil. Cook until the vegetables are soft. Add in the cooked dal and the ground spice powder/paste. Add in a cup of water if needed to adjust consistency. This kozhambu should be a little thicker than regular sambar. Bring to a boil. Cook for two more minutes. Turn the heat off. Temper with mustard seeds, curry leaves and 2-3 red chillies broken to pieces in one tablespoon sesame oil. We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water. Wash the moong dal, drain water and add it to the soaked red rice. Transfer to a pressure cooker and cook for six whistles. Keep the stove in sim for another five minutes and switch off. Allow the pressure to settle down and open after 20 minutes. It would have cooked very soft. If its watery, it will thicken after cooling. Add salt and mix well. Heat a frying pan. Add ghee and oil. Add coarsely crushed pepper and jeera. Add the cashews, hing powder, ginger and curry leaves. When it splutters, add it to the pongal.

Wash well and add  cup water and two cups of milk. Cover it with a plate. Pressure-cook this for 7-8 whistles and keep it on low flame for five minutes. Switch off the flame. Once the pressure subsides, take it out and mash it well. If it is too thick, you can add some milk and mix well. Soak saffron in one tablespoon of warm milk for five minutes. In a pan, add jaggery and  cup of water. Let the jaggery melt. Filter the impurities and add it to the mashed millet mixture. Mix well and cook for two minutes on low flame. Add ghee and mix well. Add edible camphor. Roast a few cashew nuts in ghee and garnish the dish.NotesAny millet like barnyard millet, little millet or thinai works well for this millet akkaravadisal. I personally dont prefer adding cardamom powder as it will suppress the flavour, or saffron and edible camphor. The consistency of the akkaravadisal is perfect and stays intact for 4-5 hours.Kambu vella pongal or Bajra jaggery pongal by Praveen Kumar(Instagram @Awesome Cuisine)IngredientsKambu (bajra): 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Jaggery: 1 1/2 cups Ghee: 1/4 cup Cashew nuts: a handfulRaisins: a handful Cardamoms: a few Water: 6 cupsMethodDry roast the bajra until it gives out an aroma, and keep it aside.To the same pan, add the moong dal and roast for a minute.

2021-01-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-kitchen-experiment-to-find-the-best-alternative-to-raw-rice-for-sweet-pongal/article33567931.ece,A kitchen experiment to find the best alternative to raw rice for sweet pongal,"Is it thinai? Black rice? Perhaps thooyamalli, a heritage rice variety?The cooker with black rice and dal whistles, puffing steam along with a drizzle of purple-coloured water onto my kitchen walls.I wince at the thought of cleaning up: black rice, evidently, is not easy to handle. But once I open the cooker  after five whistles and 10-minutes of simmering on low flame  the glistening deep-purple rice makes me forget all else.Kavuni arisi or black rice pongal is the third variety I am experimenting with. In an attempt to make sakkarai pongal with heritage rice varieties this year, I narrow down to three: thooyamalli, kavuni arisi, and thinai arisi. The best pongal wins, which I will cook on the big day.Sakkarai pongal is a silky concoction of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee. Although raw rice is widely used, several heritage rice varieties make for a great pongal. These include iluppai poo samba, mappilai samba, neelam, Salem sanna, jeeraga samba, hand-pound raw rice, thooyamalli, kuruvai, and thinai arisi, according to Praveen Anand, executive chef, South Indian Cuisine, ITC Hotels.Millet on white backgroundPongal is a festival in which farmers offer to Nature whatever they grew on their land, explains Praveen, adding, The above varieties are grown in the Madurai belt, the stronghold of Tamil culture.Cooking time and the amount of water required, varies for each; Praveen suggests soaking the hard varieties such as mappilai samba for half an hour before cooking.Round 1Thooyamalli is from his list and the rice, slightly longer, but as thin as jeeraga samba, does a great job of becoming one with the jaggery and dal. The taste is similar to the typical raw rice pongal; the rice, a shade darker than ivory, bears a mild fragrance.Round 2Thinai or foxtail millet is technically not a rice variety. But I decide to cook it thanks to a conversation Coimbatore-based A Shrikumar, (who works for an NGO) had with an elderly man from a tribal village in the Sathyamangalam forest.I learnt that people of the Urali tribe make pongal with millets, thinai, ragi, cholam, varagu or samai, says Shrikumar. This is because they chiefly grow millets in the hills. And years ago, when jaggery was difficult to source, tribal people used honey to sweeten their pongal. They also made a curry with the vegetables they grew, to be had with pongal, he points out. They used wild tubers, broad beanswhatever they cultivated.Clockwise from left: Black rice, thinai, and thooyamalli pongal | Photo Credit: Special arrangementI cook thinai pongal in a steel wok since millets do not require pressure-cooking. The tiny round morsels yield well  in no time, they take in the jaggery syrup I spoon in. Thinai has a nice earthy fragrance that is subdued in the end result: what makes this pongal stand apart is the pleasingly grainy texture.Round 3Kavuni or black rice is the best-looking of them all. Apart from the health benefits the rice boasts, I pick it to attempt cooking a hard rice variety. Which means it requires soaking the night before to make the rice pliable. I pressure-cook it: it is easier that way. But before that, I spread the soaked rice on a piece of cloth to dry and dry roast it before cooking.I add jaggery syrup and simmer the deep-purple mix of rice and dal, but the colour remains the same. Once done, I top it with plenty of ghee-roasted cashews. The taste is unique: the rices nutty flavour fits jaggerys sweetness to the T. And the pongal is chewy, with a depth of flavour.The winner is undoubtedly black rice. It is slightly more elaborate to cook, but the end result is worth it."

You may not be able to take a holiday this year, but fortunately the elephants can. Live vicariously, at the retreat for temple elephants at Thekkampatti in MettupalayamLakshmi is unstoppable. She sways her body to the beat of Tamil songs on the radio. Swarnavalli basks in the sun drying her freshly shampooed hair, while Sengamalam, who became an Internet sensation for her famous bob-cut, is mud bathing. The oldest, Kasthuri, contently chews on koonthal panai, a variety of palm leaves from Kerala.A temple elephant carrying fodder at the camp | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY MIt is a busy morning at the nine-acre rejuvenation camp at Thekkampatti, located along the banks of the Bhavani in Mettupalayam, 50 kilometres from Coimbatore. Twenty-six elephants from 23 temples and three mutts across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are camped here for a 48-day retreat, organised by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR& CE) Trust. A circuit of CCD cameras track the movement of elephants at the camp while a solar-fence and eight watch towers are in place to prevent wild animals from entering the premises.Food for elephants at the camp | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY MAt the camp, the jumbos receive 24/7 monitoring by veterinarians and a nutrient-rich diet including varieties of fodder that includes green grass, coconut fronds, and rice balls packed with protein-rich horse gram and yellow moong.Healthcare makes a difference to their overall well-being, says T Saravanan, who is walking his elephant Swarnavalli after her bath. Along with carrot, beetroot, dates, watermelon and sugarcane, we also give chyawanprash, ashta choornam and other vitamin mixes to boost their energy levels, he adds.Where friends meet againBesides nutritious food and long walks in the jungle, the camp is also about forging friendships that last a lifetime. Swarnavalli who is from Swarnakaaleeswarar temple in Sivaganga district has found a friend in Parvathi from the Madurai Meenakshi temple.They enjoy each others company during walking and bathing. These elephants are used to human presence. The place draws crowds who come to watch the camping activities, says Saravanan, adding, We look forward to meeting mahouts. We chat up, laugh, and have a good time.Temple elephants being decorated after a shower | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY MThe animals rest in turns. Once the line-up of elephants walk back after a relaxing shower, Kumudhavalli heads to the bathing bay with her mahout A Karim Sait in tow.We scrub her clean for two to three hours and then pamper her with a relaxing bath, says Karim as he sprays water on her body to start the ritual. Karim comes from a family who have been mahouts for three generations. He says, Elephants have a lifespan of 120 years. At the camp they get special food like the koonthapanai leaves which is not available in Tamil Nadu. We are eager to learn about the routine of other temple elephants.Open spaces and regular medical check-ups are a big draw, says Prasanth Sankarankutty who takes care of the 55-year-old Kasthuri from Palani. The long walks in the mornings and evenings easily cover 10 kilometres and improve their blood circulation. I give her a head massage with oil to cool her down as their bodies generate a lot of heat. Every single elephant has an individual characteristic, like human beings, smiles Sankarankutty as he hops on to Kasthuri and starts dusting off mud from her head.Bath time at the camp | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY MThe camp is a reunion of sorts for Lakshmi (the dancer) from Renugaambal temple in Thiruvannamalai who meets her niece Kumudhavalli from Vaithamaanidhi temple in Tiruchendur. Its been an annual ritual for 13 years ever since the camp started. They were babies when we got them from Sonapur in Assam. Bonding with her sister takes her stress away and thats why you see her dancing and making merry, says M Rangan, 60, who has been a mahout for four decades.I spent my childhood at Srirangam. I was enthralled when I saw a procession of elephants. It is my love for the mammal that made me a mahout. Show them love, and they reciprocate.Elephants enjoy a bath at the camp | Photo Credit: PERIASAMY MAs our walk ends, we catch Gandhimathi from Tirunelveli and Abayambigai from Mayiladuthurai engage in a friendly duel, mud bathing themselves and making trumpeting sounds. They are thick friends, says M Ravikumar, caretaker of Kalyani from Perur temple in Coimbatore. So are Kalyani and Ramalakshmi from Rameswaram. Every year at the camp, they stand next to each other. I have been with Kalyani from when she was eight. She is 28 now. Its like bringing up a baby. When you show them love, they are always kind, says Ravikumar as he gives her trunk a warm rub."

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal."

Farmers said this was a direct effort on part of the government to control pulse price inflation ahead of state elections at the expense of farmers incomes.Lalit Patil Bahal, executive president of Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed this promotion of imports would result in the ongoing farmers movement spreading to other parts of the country.On March 19, the central government had announced its intention of allowing imports of 4 lakh tonnes of tur and 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong for the next fiscal. This was in addition of 2 lakh tonnes of tur to be imported from Mozambique and 4 lakh tonnes of urad, which was announced earlier. India annually imports 10-15 lakh tonnes of pulses, which is a steep fall from the 30-40 lakh tonnes of import the country used to report around five years ago.Traders pointed out how in the previous years, the import quotas were announced towards end of April or early May, with daal millers and processors expected to complete the imports before the domestic arrivals start in the markets. This year, the import quotas have been preponed, which traders said was because of the pulse price inflation noticed in the country. Prices of almost all pulses in the country is now between Rs 100-120 per kg in retail markets.Arrival of urad and moong, both kharif crops, in wholesale mandis is negligible, but farmers continue to bring tur to the mandi. At Laturs wholesale mandi  the largest tur market in the country  around 2,500 quintals of the lentil arrive on a daily basis. As against the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal, the average trading price of tur at Laturs market is Rs 6,800.Nitin Kalantri, a Latur-based dal miller and trader, pointed out how mandi prices dropped to Rs 6,700 a day after the import quota was announced.

Referring to the ongoing farmers agitation against the three farm laws in the country, Patil Bahal said such trade decisions would result in the movement spreading to other parts of the country.Interestingly, Patil Bahals outfit had earlier supported the laws. Anil Ghanwat, another leader from Shetkari Sanghatana, which was founded by late Sharad Joshi, is part of the three-member body constituted by the Supreme Court to study the laws.Manikrao Kadam, another farmer leader from Maharashtra, pointed out how farmers had taken to growing pulses to make the country self-sufficient in protein. If the government doesnt ensure proper prices for farmers, they will again go for other crops, he said."

Subscribe here.)Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians.Culture across the pagesChennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our communitys unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation, says Jaishri.The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies.As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March).As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration, says Jaishri.In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal), pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water), kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes.Timely evolutionOver three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. Pitla and daangar (urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time.Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get the copra taste, she says.Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine.  We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes.The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine, says Jaishri.A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa (mor molaga Thanjavur style). Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor, channa, moong and urad. Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water.The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020, says Jaishri.The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon."

This year, snuggle at home with one such universal favourite  dahi vada, with all its shapes, flavours and toppingsFood in India is decided by season, and the ingredients available in the region one lives in. The festival of colours, Holi is just round the corner and, as the temperature rises, celebrations are incomplete without food that not only tickles your taste-buds, but also cools you down.Rajani Jain, a home chef in Delhi says, What better way than cool dahi vada after spending hours outside playing Holi? The dahi (curd) cools you down and the common urad dal vadas, laced with masalas  cumin, coriander and chat masala powder  bring forth a burst of flavours. I prefer ginger juliennes on it, with anar dana (pomegranate seeds), she adds.A homemade dish of dahi vada | Photo Credit: Prabalika M BorahThere are many such preferences and not restricted to toppings alone. There are variations that give this dish an interesting spin, like vadas made with mixed lentil, moong dal, bread, oats or even with jeera butter cookies. An illustration to go with Tarla Dalals recipe, for instance, suggests vadas can be made with jeera butter cookies, slightly soaked in lukewarm water before dunking them in a pool of seasoned yoghurt. The mixed lentil variety, also called masala vada, consists of chana dal, urad dal and moong dal, all coarsely ground.The tough questionDahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas are not soft enough.According to chef Garima Poddar, dahi vadas are unique, because though they are deep fried, they melt in your mouth. She adds: A lot of people get stuck with hard vadas or bhallas. To avoid this, one can soak the fried vadas in water for a few seconds, then squeeze the water out gently by pressing them between ones palms and drop them them in dahi.Having said that, softness need not be an obsession, adds Garima, In Rajasthan, the vadas are made with a slightly coarse paste of lentils, so there is a bite to its texture.Chef Kunal Kapoor suggests that the urad batter be made with less or no water, to get soft vadas. Whisking the batter well, for quite some time, right before frying the vadas will also be helpful, he says.Experimental matchmakingA dahi vada alu dum stall in Cuttack, OdishaStreet food lovers in Cuttack, Odisha have created their own twist to the dahi vada, pairing it with alu dum in a treat exclusive to this city.The now-iconic street food dahi vada and alu dum is a fusion experiment that has clicked very well, says consultant chef Rachit Kirteeman.Homemade dahi vada, by Hina Gujral Ingredients: 1 cup dhuli urad dal (split black gram); 1 chopped green chilli;  inch peeled and grated ginger; A pinch of asafoetida; 4 tbsp water; Salt to taste; Oil for deep frying; Lukewarm water; 2 cups thick yoghurt (curd); 1 tsp chat masala; 1 tsp cumin powder (for curd); 1 tsp cumin powder (for topping);  tsp black salt; 2 tsp sugar; 2 tbsp sweet tamarind chutney; 2 tbsp coriander and mint chutney; 1/2 tsp red chilli powder; 1 tbsp chopped corianderMethod:To make the vada batter, wash and soak dal in water for six hours or overnight. Transfer soaked dal to the grinder with chopped green chillies and grated ginger. Grind dal without using water, stop mixer in between, stir with a spatula and grind again. Keep doing this at regular intervals. If it still does not turn into a smooth paste, add one or two tablespoons of water, then grind. The idea is to use minimum water. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add salt, asafoetida and whisk batter briskly for a couple of minutes or till it is light and fluffy.Deep fry the vadas over medium heat by shaping small portions of the batter into flat balls with your fingers (dampened with water), or dropping them into the oil with the help of spoons. Allow them to cook as they fry. They can be turned when they are pale golden from the base and sides. Fry until they become crisp.Soak the vadas in lukewarm water in a wide saucepan. Keep enough space for the vadas to breathe, as they expand in water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes or until soft and drain out excess water from each vada by gently pressing between your palms.To assemble, first take curd in a bowl. Add salt, cumin powder, sugar and chat masala and whisk till smooth. Dilute the curd and season it to taste.Arrange vadas in a serving bowl. Pour the flavoured curd over the vadas, so that it soaks them completely. Top with the green chutney and tamarind chutney. Sprinkle red chilli and cumin powder and chat masala to taste. Garnish dahi vada with chopped coriander leaves. Serve chilled.He elaborates, The Cuttack region of Odisha produces a lot of milk. So instead of letting it go waste, curd was made. Vada is a staple breakfast. Someone who had surplus of both curd and vada mixed it together and added the alu dum as an unusual accompaniment. Dahi vada in Odisha uses diluted curd, so when alu dum is added, it becomes a complete dish.Season to tasteAs for spicing the yoghurt, Garima says, There is no thumb rule to seasoning the dahi. The same applies to its consistency. Some like it thick and creamy, others like it slightly runny. Experiment with what works for your palate on a small quantity of dahi.One of Garimas favourite variations of dahi vada is the South Indian version, which uses a runny curd base.She says, I also enjoy the tempering on it. One can play it up with any seasoning. I have tasted it with a garnish of peri peri masala, and also read about dahi vada with Tabasco sauce.Kunal suggests creative toppings: It is a season of fruits, so there is no harm in adding chopped fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes or even melons to the whisked yoghurt."

So while your first priority for Holi should be to find safe, organic colours- like those derived from flowers-you can also reverse the effects of chemical colours on your skin through organic products. If you spent the later part of the Holi festival in rubbing off the colours from your skin but they are still around, we feel you.We got in touch with Radhika Iyer Talati, Founder of Beauty By Anahata, to share some DIY recipes that can help you give yourself healthy skin post Holi.1. On the day post Holi, massage your body and face with any natural oil, such as coconut, sesame-wheat germ, grapeseed oil or rose-almond oil. This will prevent the colours from entering your pores and sticking to your skin. On the hair add castor oil or coconut oil.2. Wipe your face, hands and feet with a mix of natural micellar water. This is often used to remove makeup as well, and there are some amazing organic brands manufacturing this product. This will ensure that the colours dont stick between your fingers and toes, and will stubborn stains on the nails.3. Use any ubtan powder to scrub your body and face. You could also make this powder at home by crushing together moong, turmeric, edible camphor, rose powder, rice, chandanam powder and orange peel. This will not only remove unwanted colour but will also remove dead skin, soften the skin and nourish it. Apply this 30 minutes before shower, scrub gently.4. For the face, use rose water (after using ubtan) to nourish the skin. Incase of stubborn colour in the eyebrows, use lemon juice mixed with wheat flour to bleach the colors off- dont rub, gently dab this.5. Use a mix of coconut milk and curd in the hair. Apply and leave it in the hair for 45 minutes to naturally condition the hair and remove the dryness of the colours. Alternatively, an organic hair scrub of neem, shikakai, tulsi, ashwagandha and other herbs would do wonders to restore natural and healthy hair."

But due to scarce rainfall in the last four months, the hopes of farmers were shattered as the crops got affected.Even after such plight, the farmers could not use machinery like water sprinklers which could have helped save the crops. Reason, lack of awareness on using such machinery and funds crunch. Only 4o of 2,198 farmers who had sown green gram in the district bought the sprinklers which were sold at a subsidised rate of `12,000 per unit by the Agriculture department.But the sprinklers too did not help as farmers alleged those stopped functioning within a couple of months. A farmer of Naugaon said the sprinkler he had bought stopped functioning within a couple of months due to which his crop on around 2.5 acre of land was spoiled.Sarat Chandra Nayak (65) of Sanpur village in Jagatsinghpur block said he does not recall facing such adverse conditions in the past. I had cultivated green gram on two acre of land and now it is tough to even recover the cost of seeds, he said. Sources said green gram crops have suffered considerable damage in Balikuda, Erasama, Tirtol, Kujang, Raghunathpur, Jagatsinghpur, Naugaon and Biridi blocks of the district.Chief district agriculture officer, Rabinarayan Mohapatra said if it does not rain in the next 5-7 days, more damage would be caused. He said the Agriculture department had spread awareness on use of sprinklers among farmers and since a few used the machine, the damage to the crop is significant this year."
2021-04-03,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rising-prices-hit-households-reeling-from-shrunk-budgets/articleshow/81880966.cms,Rising prices hit households reeling from shrunk budgets,"Coronavirus: Live updates(Contributions by Mayur Shetty, Mamtha Asokan, Avik Das, Dipak Dash, Udit Prasanna Mukherjee and Surojit Gupta)NEW DELHI: Households across the country are facing the onslaught of rising prices and are witnessing a sharp dent in their monthly spend capabilities as prices of vegetables, groceries and transport mount steadily.Price pressures have added to the burden of households dealing with job cuts, salary reductions and loss of income as the effect of the pandemic-induced lockdown still plays out across some sectors, despite a strong economic recovery.Recent data point to a hardening of both retail and wholesale price inflation rates. Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget, said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata. She said due to the pandemic, sanitisers and masks have added to expenses on health.The retail inflation data for February showed the extent of the strengthening prices. Meat and fish prices rose an annual 11.3% in February, while egg prices shot up 11.1%. Oils and fats rose 20.8%, while pulses and products rose 12.5%. In fact, prices of mutton, which hovered at Rs 500 per kg pre-pandemic, nearly doubled during the lockdown and have remained Rs 750-800 per kg a year later.Price of tur dal, which was around Rs 95 per kg in Delhi in April last year, has now soared to Rs 108 per kg. It is a similar story for other pulses such as urad and moong in cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Edible oil prices have also hardened. Mustard oil, which was selling at Rs 114 per kg in Mumbai last year, is now available for Rs 155 per kg, while sunflower, which was at Rs 105 per kg in Kolkata, is now at Rs 179 per kg.Rising fuel costs have also added to the woes of households, although of late there has been some easing. The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother. He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year. Though most of the year he has worked from home. It has hit my monthly budget as savings have gone down. A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown, he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three. He continues to work from home for three days a week. Eating out has dropped substantially. He says his grocery, fruits and vegetables purchase costs have shot up not because of high prices but due to the buying of more quantity and exotic stuff. In education, there is a saving on childrens school uniform, transport and a marginal reduction in fees as extracurricular activities and field trips are not happening due to the pandemic. He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now. The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year. This is prominent in the case of food and non-food commodities. Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households. Consumption of vegetables and fruits suddenly shot up since the outbreak of the pandemic as we were forced to stay indoors. Now, we have decided to cut short on those expenses. Post-lockdown, we are now taking short breaks to entertain us, said Sumathi Jaykumar, a self-employed Chennai resident."

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs. We have the tradition of eating hot cross buns and Kanji rice with various chutneys on Good Friday. The dish, to which no tadka is added, is prepared with rice, roasted moong dal and grated coconut. I made groundnut, onion and coconut chutneys to go with Kanji this year.Sujatha Stephen, who is a nutritionist with Yashodha Hospital, says that Easter is an auspicious festival for her family. Describing a typical Easter day at her home, she says: We start preparations for Easter after Good Friday. Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani. Kakoli Mukherjee kakoli_mukherjee@newindianexpress.com @KakoliMukherje2"

It can also be caused by bacteria through contaminated water and food. Stomach flu can wreak havoc on the system. Remember, our overall health is closely interlinked with our digestive health. Hence, stomach flu can have a deep impact on physical, mental, and emotional health, said nutritionist and lifestyle educator Karishma Chawla.Stomach flu symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramping, and abdominal pain.Here are foods that one should have and avoid when down with stomach flu:*Drinking adequate amounts of fluids is imperative to make up for the fluid loss due to diarrhea and vomiting. Fluids include plain water, infused water with herbs, electoral water, coconut water, broth, herbal tea with ginger, and peppermint. In fact, the smell of peppermint tea may help reduce nausea as well.Drink enough water to stay hydrated. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Drink enough water to stay hydrated.
