Read MoreNEW DELHI: The farmers protesting on Delhi borders for more than a month against the three agri laws on Saturday threatened to hold a tractor rally towards the national capital on Republic Day if their demands were not met. Meanwhile, the main opposition has asked the centre to withdraw the legislation and not be obstinate.Here are the key developments of the day:1. Hardening their position ahead of the next round of talks to be held with the government on January 5, protesting farmer unions said they will take out a tractor parade towards Delhi on January 26, when the country will celebrate Republic Day, if their demands were not met. Talking to mediapersons, the union leaders said time has come for ""decisive"" action as their demands have not been addressed by the government yet. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade at Rajpath on January 26. Farmer leader Darshan Pal Singh said their proposed parade will be called ""Kisan Parade"" and it will be held after the Republic Day parade. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for more than a month, demanding repeal of the three farm laws , a legal guarantee for minimum support price for their crops and two others. ""We intend to be peaceful and we told the government during the talks that it has only two options - either repeal the three laws or use force to evict us (from Delhi border points). The time has come for decisive action here, and we have chosen January 26 as the Republic Day represents the supremacy of the people,"" the union leaders said.2. A 75-year-old farmer protesting against the centre's new agri laws allegedly hanged himself at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border in Ghazipur in the morning. Sardar Kashmir Singh, a native of Bilaspur in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur district, hanged himself in a mobile toilet using a rope, police said. Deputy Superintendent of Police of Indirapuram Anshu Jain said that a suicide note written in Gurumukhi was found on him. Singh wrote in the suicide note that the government must repeal these farm laws as these are against the interests of farmers, according to a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). In the purported suicide note, Singh expressed anguish that though some people from Punjab died during the agitation, no one from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand has sacrificed his life for the cause. He also requested the Sikh community to help his family marry off his two granddaughters and to address the domestic problems being faced by his married daughter. His body was handed over to his grandchildren who too were part of the protest in Ghazipur, police officer Jain said.3. Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav termed the death of a 57-year-old farmer due to heart attack while protesting against the centre's new farm laws at the Ghazipur border as ""disturbing"", and accused the ruling BJP of being ""heartless"". In a Hindi tweet, he said, ""On the first day of the new year itself, the news of the martyrdom of a farmer at the Ghazipur border is disturbing. The farmers are sacrificing their lives in the dense fog and cold, but the ruling party is sitting heartless. The ruthlessness seen in the BJP has never been seen so far."" Mohar Singh died of heart attack while protesting against the farm laws at the Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad on Friday. A resident of Bhagwanpur Nangal village in Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh, Singh was rushed to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead, an official said. Indirapuram Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Anshu Jain had said that the farmer died of heart attack. Commenting on the incident, the state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Rajbir Singh, said all the farmers who lost their lives during the protest against the farm laws must get the status of a martyr.4. The Congress urged the government to abandon its ""obstinate attitude"" and agree to the demands of the farmers protesting the new farm laws amid cold weather conditions. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said reports of deaths of farmers while protesting at the Delhi border amid harsh winter conditions are ""disturbing"". ""According to media reports, 57 farmers have lost their lives while scores are unwell. The government is showing gross insensitivity by not acceding to the demands of the protesting farmers,"" said the Congress general secretary and its Uttar Pradesh in-charge. Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram saluted the resoluteness of the farmers. ""The government must relent and agree to keep the farm laws in abeyance pending its repeal. Any new law must take into account the needs and desires of the farming community,"" he tweeted.5. The country's rabi foodgrains production including wheat in the ongoing 2020-21 crop year is expected to be better than the previous year's record of 153.27 million tonne, according to agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. Sowing of rabi (winter) crops is underway. The rabi sowing begins from October immediately after the harvest of kharif (summer) crops. Wheat and mustard are major rabi crops. The crop year runs from July to June. Tomar said the country's agriculture sector performed well during 2020 as foodgrains production rose to a record in the kharif season with farmers working hard despite the COVID-19 pandemic and proving their relevance. ""This year, we hope better foodgrain production in the rabi season than last year (same season),"" he said. For the 2020-21 crop year, the Centre has set a target of a record foodgrains output of 301 million tonne, out of which it expects 151.65 million tonne to come from the rabi season. Further, the minister said progress to be made in the recent government initiatives including two new farm laws on marketing, formation of 10,000 FPOs (Farmer Producers Organisations ), Rs 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, will also benefit farmers and boost the sector. ""I hope farmers' hard work and the Modi government's pro-farmer policies will strengthen the agriculture sector. New reforms will also benefit the sector,"" he added."
2021-01-04,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/rain-irrigates-fields-as-farmers-continue-protest/articleshow/80087401.cms,Haryana: Rain irrigates fields as farmers continue protest,"Rain received over two days has irrigated farming fieldsAMBALA: Light rain and cold weather has come as a relief for farmers, who have been spared the work of irrigating their fields amid the ongoing agitation.It has been raining lightly in the region for the past two days, resulting in natural irrigation of wheat, mustard and vegetable fields.Over the last two days, Ambala has recorded maximum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius and minimum of 13 degrees Celsius. Scattered thunderstorm and rain has been predicted for the next two days, agriculture department officials said.Most of the farmers protesting at the Delhi borders have been attending the agitation and coming home from time to time to look after their crops in northern Haryana .Farmer Rajeev Sharma from Hasanpur village in Naraingarh area of Ambala district said, The recent rain and cold weather has come as a boost for the wheat crop, which is growing well. I come home from the protest in Delhi after about 10 days to harvest potatoes. I have also grown wheat. Another farmer, Sukhminder from Sapehra village of Ambala said, The rain has saved our hard work of irrigating fields amid the ongoing protest. The weather is pleasant for wheat and mustard and we are happy that god has irrigated our fields.Districts deputy director, agriculture (DDA) Girish Nagpal said more than about 75,000 hectares of land in Ambala is under wheat cultivation.Ongoing weather conditions are conducive enough for better yield of Rabi crops. At this stage of wheat, cold weather is also beneficial, DDA Nagpal said.He added that thousands of farmers in the state, including Ambala, are given timely information on weather through text messages on their mobile phones from Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture Universitys, agriculture meteorology department.To a query on whether the area cultivated under wheat in Ambala has declined due to the farmers agitation, an official said, There has been no decline in the area and more than about 75,000 hectares of land is cultivated under wheat. Not even one acre of land is empty in the district. Farmers are never careless about their crops. Even during the Covid-19 lockdown, farmers obtained permits, harvested wheat and cultivated paddy."
2021-01-04,https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2021/jan/04/go-beyond-existingexpenditure-in-budget-2245036.html,Go beyond existing expenditure in budget,"The Union Budget for FY22 will be presented in a few weeks, but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has partly briefed out its contents, more than once. In her own words, it will include a massive public sector investment and expenditure push on infrastructure and healthcare.This isnt anything extraordinary but an essential act, because of its welfaristic nature and the multiplier effect on the economy. But what is a matter of concern is whether the promised spending binge entails elements of the Rs 111 lakh crore infrastructure bonanza first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019. Given the governments record of repackaging programmes and outlays, such a move will end up as a tasteless reheat of past announcements and must be avoided.Theres nothing wrong in chest-beating about landmark initiatives, but the infrastructure investment pipeline didnt cut the mustard when it was rolled out as a kickstart-the-economy package in 2019 itself. To refresh the devil in the details, every year, the Centre and states spend over Rs 10 lakh crore on infrastructure; so the proposed Rs 111 lakh crore for five years didnt enthuse many.But in FY21, the sum to be spent was significantly higher than usual and it cheered up policy watchers. However, there has been little progress since then. If in December 2019, 44% of the total Rs 111 lakh crore-worth projects were under implementation and Rs 22 lakh crore or 20% were under development stage, it remained so as of December 2020.Moveover, the Centres share translates to only 39%, while an equal sum will be borne by cash-starved states. The remaining 21% has to come from the ailing private sector. One noteworthy development, though, is the creation of the India Investment Grid to handhold all greenfield and brownfield infra projects.It will resolve some of the long-standing issues including delayed permissions and land acquisition, which means project execution should be relatively better. That said, the government must think out of the box to ensure that the expenditure push in FY22 stretches beyond what has already been announced."

Signed by the company in February for a period of two years, Ganguly also endorses its mustard oil in West Bengal and soya nuggets. Bollywood star, Akshay Kumar is the companys other brand ambassador.While defending its range of cooking oils, the company said this was a temporary interruption and it would continue working with the elegant southpaw, who led the Indian national team to some of its most memorable victories as its captain.Saurav Ganguly became our brand ambassador endorsing our Fortune rice bran oil. The rice bran oil is not a medicine but only a cooking oil. There are several factors which affect heart ailments including dietary and hereditary issues, said Angshu Malik, deputy CEO at Adani Wilmar. We shall continue to work with Saurav and he will continue to be our brand ambassador. We have only taken a temporary break in our TV commercial till we again sit with Saurav and take things forward.This is a very unfortunate incident and can happen with anyone. Recently we heard about a senior IT executive collapsing on a treadmill while exercising. Does that mean the treadmill is bad? Rice bran oil is one of the world's healthiest oils. It contains natural antioxidants. Gamma Oryzonal present in rice bran oil reduces bad cholesterol and improves lipid profile, Malik added.Brand experts, however, had a different view. I do believe there are several issues at play here. There is brand Adani, brand Saurav, and finally the product, oil. The farmer agitation, the association of brand Adani with the ruling dispensation, Sourav and rumours of his political leanings, are all adding to the jamboree of discontent, said brand expert, Harish Bijoor.He urged brands to stay away from politics and religion. Both these subjects divide audiences. Brands love united audiences as all are then their potential consumers. It is, therefore, best for brands to avoid these two subjects altogether, he said.Meanwhile, Ganguly or Dada , as he is fondly called, has been reported to be in a stable condition and set to return home soon from hospital."

His invention, Phosphate Rich Organic Manure (PROM) was aimed at replacing chemical fertilizers.This is a value-added product produced by co-compositing different organic wastes with high-grade rock phosphate in fine size. This has become a useful and effective alternative to costly chemical fertilizers and the union fertilizers department too acknowledged it. He was putting in his efforts to convince the center to supply rock phosphate to farmers at subsidy price and to make farmers prepare their own Prom fertilizer by mixing farmyard manure into it. It is not just a cheaper option, it is healthy and would strengthen the soil too. This would result in a substantial reduction in the utilization of chemical fertilizers.Researches carried out on diverse crops such as wheat, soybean, mustard, groundnut, cotton, chilly, in different agro-climatic conditions unequivocally showed the effectiveness of Prom fertilizer, his colleagues in the effort said. He was conferred with National Mineral Award for his efforts in mineral beneficiation. He was in charge of the central governments phosphate research and development center and was also with several central mineral beneficiation efforts.Upon a special invitation, he went to Jordan Phosphate mines company in Jordan in 2007 and doubled the production there within a short span of time by employing innovative methods at the phosphate beneficiation plant there.DMR Sekhar studied science related to genes and wrote extensively about human evolution. He always tried to drive away prejudices from the human mind with scientific efforts and encouraged research in this direction. He founded Research Institute for Social Evolution (RISE) and gave awards and prizes to scores of social activists who registered significant accomplishments in their fight against social evils.Final rites to his mortal remains would be performed at Ongole, his native place, on Friday. He is survived by his wife, son, and daughter. Scores of people from scientific, social, and political circles expressed shock at his sudden demise and were paying their tributes to this popular scientist who preferred struggle over comforts throughout his life."

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry. Simmer till it thickens and the oil separates. Serve with hot rice.(With inputs from Meghna Majumdar)"
2021-01-12,https://www.thehindu.com/books/krish-ashoks-penguin-book-looks-at-the-science-of-indian-cooking/article33548893.ece,Krish Ashok’s non-cookbook for kitchen nerds looks at the science behind cooking,"Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking delves into the physics, chemistry and cultural context you need to know, if you would rather not take recipes literallyIn the end, it all boils down to biryani.The fermentation behind a good uthappam; the multi-layered acids in chaat; the structure of chakki-ground wheat flour. As diverse as the food offerings in our country are, the science behind them is even more so. And of the veritable army of reluctant chefs created in urban India during lockdown, at least a few must prefer learning these hows and whys, instead of the how-many-teaspoons. That is the gamble Krish Ashok and Penguin Random House have taken with their recent book Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking.With chapters covering everything from zero-pressure cooking to the science of spices and more, the title offers explanations and cheat sheets galore. Tongue-in-cheek writing coupled with scientific explanations by experts make up a large portion of this book, and the result is oddly gripping. Take, for instance, a small segment titled Mouthfeel  Ashok begins by describing the crunch of a pani puri before moving into an aside about decibels, bats and the way that ultrasound travels, and then concluding confidently: We can, it turns out, feel a good pani puri in our bones. Quite literally.I keep clarifying that a lot of what I talk about is applicable to urban Indian cooking, that has evolved in a very specific way over the last few decades. We dont always have access to fresh produce, and the quality of what we get  both meat and vegetables  is dubious, with concerns about pesticides and other things. So we tend to err on the side of overcooking, just to be safe, he says.He points out that because of a lack of inherent flavour in produce, urban Indian cuisine tends to be spice-heavy, while that in rural or small-town India has always been minimal. He adds: I would argue that it is a lot closer to Italian cooking, in that it relies on a fewer but more quality ingredients that are grown locally, giving the example of the magnificently tasty eggplants of Tirunelveli.An added segue is his observation that hinterland cooking is simplistic in technique, with fewer steps, because the rural woman has so much more to do in a day, from collecting water to tending to the fields and so on.Freedom to experimentAshok emphasises, A big part of the book is about trying to find generalised algorithms, for how to make something taste, say, Gujarati or Bengali or Malabari. And thus, free people from having to bother about authenticity: if you use paanch phoron and mustard oil, it is going to taste Bengali no matter what else you do.And what better way to look at regional variations in Indian cooking, than through the lens of everyones favourite feast  the biryani? Ashoks final chapter is dedicated entirely to that one dish, from its various layers of rice and protein to the different spices, techniques and flavour notes preferred in different regions. In this chapter, he writes, We will marshal every single food science trick we have learnt over the last 200 pages or so to make good biryani at home. Does he succeed? That is for the reader to find out.Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking is available at leading bookstores and on Amazon Kindle."

Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

Add in the cooked dal and the ground spice powder/paste. Add in a cup of water if needed to adjust consistency. This kozhambu should be a little thicker than regular sambar. Bring to a boil. Cook for two more minutes. Turn the heat off. Temper with mustard seeds, curry leaves and 2-3 red chillies broken to pieces in one tablespoon sesame oil. We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water.

Add edible camphor. Roast a few cashew nuts in ghee and garnish the dish.NotesAny millet like barnyard millet, little millet or thinai works well for this millet akkaravadisal. I personally dont prefer adding cardamom powder as it will suppress the flavour, or saffron and edible camphor. The consistency of the akkaravadisal is perfect and stays intact for 4-5 hours.Kambu vella pongal or Bajra jaggery pongal by Praveen Kumar(Instagram @Awesome Cuisine)IngredientsKambu (bajra): 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Jaggery: 1 1/2 cups Ghee: 1/4 cup Cashew nuts: a handfulRaisins: a handful Cardamoms: a few Water: 6 cupsMethodDry roast the bajra until it gives out an aroma, and keep it aside.To the same pan, add the moong dal and roast for a minute.

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack. We have come up with this authentic blend straight from our kitchen for this snack, he informs.They have six fruit roll-ups and fried onion flakes as well."

And butter","After a harrowing year, in 2021, restaurant openings look forward with optimism, featuring menus that pay tribute to the pastSandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratoryWe tear apart buttery croissants, luxuriating in sunshine and nostalgia. Sandys cheery new Besant Nagar cafe is a rose-tinted tribute to the past with its old school sandwiches, milkshakes and dcor. A bitter-sweet reminder of our pre-COVID lives.Originally planned as the first of a new line of cafs called Sandys Toasteries, the Besant Nagar space evolved through the many challenges of 2020, and finally opened recently under the familiar flagship brand instead. Now, this is a relaunch of the Sandys brand, says Sandesh Reddy, the founder, adding, We wanted to break away from what we have been doing for the past 12 years. To reinvent ourselves.In times of tumult, such as this, people crave familiarity, leaning on food that reminds them of simpler days. So, not surprisingly, Sandesh has chosen to stick with his core strength, continuing to offer uncomplicated comfort food, with a focus on popular flavours. However, proving that this is a grown up version of his first menu more than a decade ago, the plates are cleverly engineered, harnessing a global array of techniques, recipes and ingredients and influences to create deceptively simple meals. Like the steak sandwich, featuring buttery meat set between thick slices of grilled Texan toast, smeared with mustard and aioli. Or the light, breaded onion rings, steamy inside and crisp outside, topped with microgreens. Or a bowl of hummus, drizzled with olive oil and studded with sturdy chunks of falafel.Desserts are indulgent. The tiny shake shake comprises a thick chocolate shake, topped with a hunk of cake balanced on top of the glass. Of course, theres one for Instagram: Milo tiramisu, designed like a pull up dessert. Im more excited about the fact that there are cortados and Aussie lattes on the menu though: till the vaccine arrives at least we can circle the world on a cloud of caffeine.Sandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratory is at 5, 4th Main Road, Besant Nagar.The Butterfly EffectNever underestimate a sandwich. They can be wonderful things, as any midnight snacker can attest. At newly-launched Butterfly Effect on Cenotaph Road, popular Kiwi chef Willi Wilson, who was formerly executive Chef at The Park Chennai, has created a line of inventive gourmet sandwiches.The space, launched by architect Junaid Ahmed, is chic and inviting, flooded with natural light. Over a plate of smoky chicken wings, freshly fried and finished with a clingy hot and sweet sauce, Willi says the menu, built around continental and Italian favourites, focuses on food that is sustainable, quick, tasty, fresh.Of course continental food in India has come a long way from the 90s, thanks to Chefs like Willi, moving from stodgy carbs smothered in white sauce and processed cheese to bright inventive takes on classics.For the sandwiches, diners can choose between white bread, wholewheat, baguettes, ciabatta and focaccia. And while fillings include the obligatory roasted chicken, tuna-mayo and vegetable club with cheese, the cafe also offers more unusual sandwiches, including curried apple, set in creamy mayonnaise, chunky with almonds and raisins; chicken quesadilla with oozing cheese and grilled Caprese pesto with mozzarella.Watch out for the just-introduced Asian menu, featuring hawker classics like a spicy Indonesian Naso Goreng, served with egg and chicken wings. Or Willis cheeky Daddy Wus chicken, a tribute to sweet and spicy pop-Chinese food. And, a steamy bowl of creamy cajun spiced butter prawns spooned over warm rice.Restaurants are still struggling with the fallout of the pandemic, fighting hard to retain staff, follow rules of physical distancing, keep customers safe and  though all this  keep updating menus to stay relevant in a competitive market. But, despite the setbacks of 2020, the cheery burst of new openings, as well as encouraging return of diners, signal a new beginning. And what better way to do it than with comfort food that pays tribute to the past.The Butterfly Effect Caf, is at 22 Chamiers Road, Nandanam.This weekly column tracks the citys shifting culinary landscape.

2021-01-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/where-to-get-sarson-ka-saag-makkey-ki-roti-in-delhi/article33555760.ece,"Cold weather food, delivered at home in Delhi","Singla Sweets and Baa Bistro in Delhi, home deliver sarson ka saag and makkey ki rotiThe weather whispered a little word into my ears: saag. And not just any kind of saag, but a dish of mustard leaves. Winter, as we know in the north, is the time for sarson ka saag  that creamy dish that so delightfully complements makkey ki roti  or rotis prepared with maize.I studied the menus of the little eateries in and around my neighbourhood to see if anyone was known for its saag and roti. Turned out there was one, Baa Bistro, which had the dish on the menu, along with a Rajasthani thhali. I am fond of Rajasthani food, and gattey ki sabzi  a spicy dish of lentil cakes in gravy  is a particular favourite. So I licked my chops and got ready to place my order.Life is full of little disappointments: It was a rainy night, the delivery agents had called it a day, and I was told that I was not going to get my saag and roti. But, quite like a good hound, once I am on the trail of something, I dont give up easily. I went back to my research, and zeroed in on an old favourite: a small restaurant called SinglaSweets which had fed me little hillocks of bedmi sabzi in kinder times. Singla had sarson ka saag and makkey ki roti, and was delivering (Ph: 9697828888, 011-22232323).The food arrived. And it was so good that I called the owner of the shop to find out about the fare. The trick in the greens was that it was simply cooked  it had neither onions, nor garlic or ginger. It merely had a tempering of ghee and whole red chillies. The roti, again, was surprisingly soft. It was not soaked in ghee, but was nicely moist.I dipped a piece into the saag and popped it into my mouth, and went back to my village, where this was a regular part of our winter fare. I grew up on various kinds of rotis, prepared with millet, maize and gram. There were all kinds of greens too: mustard, fenugreek, and bathua, to name just a few. In the village, of course, a dollop of white butter went on top of the rotis, while the saag was topped with large quantities of ghee. Bliss.Wed also ordered a plate of malai kofta, and that was a rich concoction of cashew, cream, and paneer. But the saag was what the doctor had ordered (without the ghee of course).It rained the next day again, and the heart called out for more saag and roti. I rang up Baa Bistro (9911214567, 9930983076), and found it open.I ordered the saag-roti combo, and the Rajasthani thhali for lunch. The saag was spicy but tasty, and the rotis were thick and firm, the way most makkey ki rotis are. I enjoyed the Rajasthani dishes  especially the hot gattey and the equally spicy mangori-papad ki sabzi. There was a gulab jamun, too, which we shared.On a cold winters day, saag and roti warm up the heart. And a hot and squishy gulab jamun is like the icing  or rather the warm syrup  on top.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

friends, after-school clubs for children or doing any evening shopping beyond quick trips for essentials.Police on patrol demand valid reasons from people seen out and about.For those without them, the threat of mounting fines for curfew-breakers is increasingly making life outside of the weekends all work and no play.""At 6 p. m., life stops,"" says Champagne producer Alexandre Prat.Trying to fend off the need for a third nationwide lockdown that would further dent Europe's second-largest economy and put more jobs in danger, France is instead opting for creeping curfews.Big chunks of eastern France, including most of its regions that border Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, face 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. restrictions on movement.The rest of France could quickly follow suit, losing two extra hours of liberty that have been just enough for residents to maintain bare-bones social lives.Until a couple of weeks ago, the nightly curfew didn't kick in until 8 p.m. in Prat's region, the Marne.Customers still stopped to buy bottles of his family's bubbly wines on their way home, he said.But when the cut-off time was advanced to 6 p.m. to slow viral infections, the drinkers disappeared.""Now we have no one,"" Prat said.The village where retiree Jerome Brunault lives alone in the Burgundy wine region is also in one of the 6 p.m. curfew zones.The 67-year-old says his solitude weighs more heavily without the opportunity for early evening drinks, nibbles and chats with friends, the so-called ""apero"" get-togethers so beloved by the French that were but still feasible when curfew started two hours later.""With the 6 p. m. curfew, we cannot go to see friends for a drink anymore,"" Brunault said.""I now spend my days not talking to anyone except for the baker and some people by phone.""Imposing a 6 p.m. curfew nationwide is among options the French government is considering in response to rising infections and the spread of a particularly contagious virus variant that has swept across Britain, where new infections and virus deaths have soared.Prime Minister Jean Castex could announce a curfew extension Thursday evening, as well as other restrictions, to fight the virus in a country that has seen over 69,000 confirmed virus deaths.An earlier curfew combats virus transmission ""precisely because it serves to limit social interactions that people can have at the end of the day, for example in private homes,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says.Overnight curfews have become the norm in swaths of Europe but the 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in 25 regions of eastern France is the most restrictive anywhere in the European Union's 27 nations.Others countries' curfews all start later and often finish earlier.The curfew in Italy runs from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., as does the Friday night to Sunday morning curfew in Latvia.Regions of Belgium that speak French have a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew while in Belgium's Dutch-speaking region, the hours are midnight to 5 a.m.People out between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.in Hungary must be able to show police written proof from their employers that they are either working or commuting.There are no curfews in Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Sweden, Poland or the Netherlands, although the Dutch government is thinking about whether imposing a curfew would slow new COVID-19 cases.In France, critics of the 6 p.m. curfew say the earlier time actually crams people together more after work, when they pile onto public transportation, clog roads and shop for groceries in a narrow rush-hour window before they must be home.Women's rugby coach Felicie Guinot says negotiating rush-hour traffic in Marseille has become a nightmare.The city in southern France is among the places where the more contagious virus variant has started to flare.""It's a scramble so everyone can be home by 6 p.m.,"" Guinot said.In historic Besanon, the fortressed city that was the hometown of ""Les Misrables"" author Victor Hugo, music store owner Jean-Charles Valley says the 6 p.m. deadline means people no longer drop by after work to play with the guitars and other instruments that he sells.Instead, they rush home.""People are completely demoralised,"" Valley said.In Dijon, the French city known for its pungent mustard, working mother of two Celine Bourdin says her life has narrowed to ""dropping kids at school and going to work, then going back home, helping kids with homework and preparing dinner.""But even that cycle is better than a repeat of France's lockdown at the start of the pandemic, when schools also closed, Bourdin says.""If my children don't go to school, it means I cannot work anymore,"" she said.""It was terribly difficult to be all stuck almost 24 hours a day in the house."""
2021-01-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/akus-burgers-in-delhi-are-yum/article33586630.ece,The burger with a good mouth and hand feel at AKU’S Delhi,"In Delhi, AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. delivers burgers that come together well at different levels: the softness of the patty, the umami of the cheese, the sweetness of brown onions, and the juicy pattyOur young neighbours are great foodies, so we have detailed food conversations. I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum. They indeed are. Yummilicious, Id say.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

To know more, MetroPlus makes a visitI grab a leaf of peppermint from a bed of mint leaves and taste the intense freshness. Next, I look at thyme and smell the powerful aroma. A little away, purple basil with a beautiful, coppery glow beckon. I crush a lemon balm leaf, and take in the uplifting, mild scent.I am at Parna Farms, Coimbatores first urban hydroponic farm, located right in the heart of the city at an industrial building campus. Spread across 3,000 square feet, it grows 2,520 plants.Akhila Vijayaraghavan | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananOur fresh lemon balm leaves impart a subtle flavour and fragrance, making it especially nice for custards, jam and jellies, cakes and tea, says Akhila Vijayaraghavan, owner of the farm. The purple basil is used for colour in salads. Except maybe amaranthus and palak (spinach), you can eat all the greens we grow here raw, says Akhila pointing to varieties of lettuce, basil, bok choy, and kale.Asian water spinach (kang kong), red gongura, mustard leaves and methi (fenugreek) are some of the new additions. We also grow dill leaves, which are used as garnish for fish and meat dishes and pastas. Fresh peppermint extracts are used in baking. We constantly try new crops based on demand, after rounds of trial-and-error.Peppermint grown at the hydrophonic Farm | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananA graduate of Molecular Biology from the University of Glasgow, Akhila ran her own environmental consultancy for over 10 years before turning an urban farmer. I worked with a lot of companies, from pharmaceuticals to FMCG, and learnt that supply of quality end-product is a difficult task. Agriculture has always been one of my passions; I was interested in food crops. A herb can be used in cooking, to extract oil, extract nutrients in dry form, and maybe in alternative medicine, perfumery the possibilities are exciting, adds Akhila.She researched hydroponic methodology and educated herself on farming before diving into it. Anyone can do it, it is not rocket science, she says.Hydroponics combines both sustainability and technology. In indoor hydroponic cultivation, the control on nutrient supply ensures more quality produce, for example improved oil content in herbs, as well as better crop yield. A hydroponic mint has more methanol content than a soil-grown one. The system also uses 80% less water than conventional agriculture. The water is upcycled for reuse.At Parna Farms, greens are grown using the nutrient film technique (NFT), where a thin film of nutrient-rich water with macronutrients like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and calcium nitrate, and micronutrients like manganese and zinc nourish the roots of the plants.Seedlings at the nursery at the hydroponic farm | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananThe farm has germination area that uses coco peat to sprout plants, and a nursery where net cups (small planters) are filled with clay pebbles. There is also the grow system, which involves metal stands and PVC pipes attached to a covered nutrient tank that pumps water to the plants. We incubate the net cups in a plastic tray for a couple of weeks. Once the plant grows roots, it is transferred to the main system with higher nutrients in the water. This is where it is fully grown and harvested, explains Akhila.Hydroponic agriculture, she says, has existed for over 3,000 years, with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon being one of the often quoted examples of this technique. It is one of the more accessible forms of modern agriculture, tackling the dual problems of water scarcity and shortage of farmland. It reduces soil-borne pests and diseases.Akhila says the objective is to ensure that customers get fresh, pesticide-free produce within three hours of harvest. Though a palak bunch from here costs 130, they are willing to pay the premium to enjoy good health, says Akhila, adding, You are what you eat. In hydroponics farming, every day is a learning curve.Follow @parnafarms on Instagram to know more"

Prepared with these antioxidant-rich carrots and spices, the velvety, reddish drink helps us battle the cold in North India. Chilled to the bone in a long cold spell, I had been thinking of kanji when a book arrived at my doorstep with an ode to the drink.(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)There was no kanji at home, so I had to make do with an appetising description of it in a story called A Brief History of the Carrot by Rosie Dastgir, included in the Claire Chambers-edited anthology, Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia. He poured out two glasses that glowed in the afternoon light. Room temperature, as the aunts recipe specified. The taste of it was sour and pungent and strangely restorative, though not exactly as he remembered, it goes. Was some vital ingredient missing?Wheres the story?Chambers writes that South Asian kitchens are the engines of an entire culture. The volume seeks to capture this essence through essays and short stories. The picture that we get of Muslim South Asian food is extremely eclectic, taking in everything from taco parties to lotus root slow-cooked in yoghurt, and from khichri to barfi, the York University professor says in a recent interview.The collection is quite mouth-watering, especially since each chapter ends with a recipe. The works of fiction, however, left me a bit puzzled. These are nice food pieces, no doubt, but are they stories?Take, for instance, Jackfruit with Tamarind by Mahruba T. Mowtushi and Mafruha Mohua. The short story is peppered with aunty this and uncle that  interesting characters, all, but each of them making only brief appearances. I would have liked to know more about them, especially about Manwara aunty, for I enjoyed the comparison between her fish curry and Ammas.Amma is fussy when it comes to preparing a fish. It has to be cleaned numerous times... She then smears the pieces with turmeric and salt and lightly fries them  for a minute or two  in mustard oil. Amma has a fervid dislike of people who skip this process. Macher jhol should have a light, refreshing taste and so spices are added sparingly, the authors write, adding, Amma always complained of Manwara auntys macher jhol, which contained such inordinate quantities of vegetables and an odd assortment of greens that eating it was like walking through a virgin jungle with a machete in hand!It is always fun to read about food, but the problem is that this isnt really a story. It works well as an essay, and is eminently readable, with little descriptions of dishes after every paragraph or two. But a story needs a beginning, middle and end, and this had none.Stomach rumblingThe Hairy Curry by Asiya Zahoor does have a twist in the end. The story is about young Gulla, a Kashmiri boy who has moved to Srinagar and is working in Bibijis kitchen. The description of a lotus-stem dish is invigorating. The velvety white curry was first to touch his palate. The softness and tangy taste was a delight. Each of the spices had given their essence fully to the curry. Its starchy texture, carrying the spices that complemented each other, was delectable. The lotus stems were cooked properly yet retained a certain crunchiness.But Gulla is troubled: theres hair in the curry  a lot of it!I was drawn more to the non-fiction part, and particularly enjoyed Rana Safvis piece (Qissa Qorma aur Qalia), in which she recounts food memories and practices of Lucknow.I relished the conversation between two uncles-in-law where they complain (in chaste Urdu) about digestive problems, which persist although they have been following their doctors advice and eating vegetarian khichri. It transpires that the cook has been adding large amounts of dried fruit and meat to the dish.The problem with a book like this is that it sends you straight to the kitchen. I certainly felt like cooking khichri after reading Farah Yameens well-written story about a child and her troubled phua.One does not serve khichri without mash and chutney to someone who is loved, Yameen writes. Or without papad or pickle, in my neck of the woods. Shows that food, really, has no religion.Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia; Edited by Claire Chambers, Pan Macmillan, 450The reviewer is a food columnist."

As anyone!Even if your menstrual cycle comes up like clockwork and you one of the lucky ones, chances are, it doesn't always work according to your plans. From cramps, mood swings to the irritability and rashes, having periods can be pretty uncomfortable, especially when you already have something important on your mind. Hence, the wish to 'postpone' your periods.The big question remains- are there ways to actually postpone your periods?Medically, yes there are pills which can help delay the flow of hormones and work to postpone your periods. With the advancement of science, there are some ways for women to put their periods on hold for a while, temporary, or the long run. But opting for synthetic hormonal pills or medicines may not be everyone's cup of tea. You will be surprised to know that there are some all-natural, non-medical ways to delay your periods for a while. Remember, you may not be able to outsmart or fool mother nature, but some of these remedies listed below can definitely be worth a try during times of crisis!Here are some natural herbs and medicines which can delay your periodsKnown to detoxify the body and promote weight loss, there are some old beliefs which suggest that there is yet another use of this humble drink- delaying menstruation.In fact, a lot of researchers have found out that the highly acidic content present in the ACV solution can help delay periods-upto an extent, but there's no credible proof to support it yet.Considering it as a good beneficial drink for your body, consider having a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (in warm water) regularly for 10-12 days before your expected date.If not delay periods, drinking ACV can definitely help with the bloating and the harsh cramps which make your period woes so uncomfortable.Gram lentils, which can be found in every kitchen can also come of use when it comes to delaying your menstruation.According to some hacks, there is evidence to suggest that using fried, powdered lentils can delay period cycle.But there are some side-effects to the same. Excess consumption of lentils can lead to digestive troubles and flatulence.Using gelatin might come to be of use as a cure in emergency cases.An ancient Chinese remedy, some believe that gelatine, dissolved in warm water can push back periods by some hours, at the very least. It may not be a science-backed measure, but there are women who swear by this hack.For the ones who want relief for a long while, the gelatin treatment can be repeated again a couple of times.To use this, all you need is a couple of spoonfuls of gelatin powder or crystals mixed in a cup of warm water.Lime juice, much like apple cider vinegar is also considered to be a period postponement hack.While lime juice is hailed for its vitamin-c rich properties, the same citrus extract may also come of use in delaying your periods! Plus, it can also relieve any period complications or ease PMS pain which women experience. Some also believe that having citrusy fruits and juices also lightens up the blood flow. Make sure you have fruits, veggies and juices rich in vitamin C days leading up to your cycle.Again, do remember that having too much citrusy or acidic content can lead to gum and teeth deterioration or irritate your stomach.According to Ayurveda, using fuller's earth is not just good for better skin health, but may delay your periods too.Some ancient hacks suggest women wanting to delay periods to add about 25-30 grams of fuller's earth with a cup of warm water and have it regularly for a week before the expected date of menstruation. Some even suggest drinking the concoction for 3-4 times a day to see benefits.Do remember this is not a science-backed cure so proceed with precaution.Mustard seeds, popularly used in Indian cooking is also something a lot of women swear by in times of emergency. Soaking a spoonful of mustard seeds in water/ milk overnight and having them a week before the expected date can prove to be helpful. Antioxidant-rich chia seeds may be helpful in a similar manner.Apart from foods, there are also some other natural methods to postpone, or temporarily delay periods. Exercise and massage are some options.Since a lot of athletes often go by missing their periods due to extreme workouts they follow, it is said that rigorous exercise may postpone periods in cases. But, there is also scientific proof that suggests that exercise can regularize, instead of delaying periods.Getting a uterine massage may also be an option to consider. Not only is it very soothing and relaxing but as experts believe, it can also be a hack to delay periods or postpone cycle. This technique works best when you seek professional help.There are foods and natural techniques, apart from medicinal help you can try to postpone periods.While these methods are safe to try, they may not be the most effective or work for everyone.Again, there can be downsides of postponing your periods in the long run or consuming the foods in excess.Since they are not foolproof remedies, there can also be chances of irregular bleeding or spotting which you can expect.If you are considering halting your periods or searching for a way to deal with regular period woes, getting a gynaecologists opinion before trying out something on your own is advised. They can also devise ways and offer solutions which will help you in the longer run."

2021-02-12,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2021/feb/12/all-there-is-to-know-about-hyperthyroidism-2262844.html,All there is to know about hyperthyroidism,"Deepika Rathod ByExpress News ServiceHyperthyroidism in detail today. Hyperthyroidism is nothing but the over activity of the thyroid gland, that produces extra thyroid hormone and leads to increased metabolism. The most common type of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Graves disease.Here, the body makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much of the thyroid hormone. Excessive consumption of iodine or iodine supplements is also a common cause of hyperthyroidism.FOODS TO REDUCE THYROID ACTIVITYGluten and casein are difficult to digest and can cause irritation and inflammation in the gut lining. Avoid gluten (wheat and wheat products) and casein (milk and milk products) becomes very important to heal the gut lining and manage the condition.Consume food belonging to the Brassica family, like cauliflower, brussels sprouts, peanuts, cabbage, broccoli, kale, mustard greens, turnips, rutabagas and spinach which contain goitrogens that help the body block the ability of thyroid to use iodine and hence slows down the activity of the thyroid.Omega -3- Fatty Acids are the building blocks for hormones that control immune function and cell growth, and also help improve the ability to respond to thyroid hormones. Include fatty fish, flaxseed powder, flax seed oil, cod liver oil capsules, walnuts, chia seeds and other seeds to get a dose of omega-3- fatty acid.Protein sources also contain Lglutamine which helps in rebuilding the gut and de-inflaming the body. Opt for fish, lean chicken and free range eggs. Sattu and sprouts/whole beans combined with a cereal, also make a great protein source as the amino acid profile gets completed.The hyperactive thyroid gland can deplete the zinc in our body. Include zinc rich foods like almonds, pumpkin seeds, peanuts to replenish the zinc losses from our body.Deepika RathodThe writer is a clinical nutritionist with a focus on healthy lifestyle choices."

If we let it wither away, nobody would take the name of farmers for the next 30-40 years, he said.He said that when the government had silenced everybody, it was the BKU that had reigned in the government. The government has made numerous false allegations against us in the last 78 days. I am confident people will answer them in the coming days, Mr. Tikait said.He said that this was not the first time that farmers had protested against an incumbent government but we have never been insulted like this before. We have been ridiculed as andolanjeevi, called part of a jamaat. Panchayat is being called a jamaat. They will have to repent for this, he asserted.He urged farmers to unite and cautioned them against those in power. After 2013, an attempt was made to divide us on the basis of religion. Many among us were misled. We should give up our differences, the farmers leader said.He also appealed to farmers to make peaceful protest their weapon. Earlier, talking to reporters, Mr. Tikait said that what was happening in India had reached foreign shores. There was no foreign plot. Why did you [the government] allow things to reach such a situation? he asked.Mr. Tikait said it was the stubborn attitude of the government because of which no solution could be found and the general public was facing problems.RLD panchayatMeanwhile, responding to PM Narendra Modis statement that the minimum support price (MSP) would remain, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice president Jayant Chaudhary said on Friday, MSP is only on paper. The MSP of paddy is 1868 [per quintal] and the rate that the farmers got this year is 1,200 [per quintal]. The same happened with soybean and mustard.He was addressing a large gathering of farmers at Baldev in Mathura district. Reacting to the FIR lodged against him and 5,000 others in Aligarh on Wednesday, Mr. Chaudhary said, If they [the government] would cane us, it would give us strength. There would be no compromise on pagri (dignity), he asserted.Mr. Chaudhary said farmers wanted reforms in the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) system but the Prime Minister, through the farm laws, was ensuring that the APMC faded away. This kind of treatment is expected from a quack, not a doctor, he remarked.Giving corporates the right to hoard, he said, would allow them to determine the rate according to their interests. It will adversely affect both the farmer and the consumer. This is a simple thing that those in the government who claim to have business in their blood would very well understand, commented Mr. Chaudhary.He said it would be wrong to say Mr. Modi was ill-advised. There is no advisor to this government. Those members of the ruling party who are attached to the roots are not being able visit their villages since the farm laws were promulgated. The irony is they could not explain it to their [party] high command as their lips have been stitched. This, he charged, was the PMs obstinacy, adding, He is still not advocating your [farmers] cause. Instead, he is busy defending the big corporates.In the past, he said, governments used to listen to the Oppositions point of view. In this government, whoever criticises the BJP or Modiji, is branded as anti-national, Mr. Tikait said.Invoking the late celebrated writer in Hindi Munshi Premchand, he underlined the value of socio-political movements. Movements are nurtured by peoples sentiments and the way farmers are turning up in big numbers to participate in panchayats on their own accord, it gives me a feeling that we are alive and have not given up, he said."

The police and paramilitary forces have deployed up to 50,000 personnel, as well as barricades, barbed wire and riot-control vehicles. The United Nations is urging restraint. And each day, more farmers and tractors arrive to join the disgruntled ranks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no stranger to sparking public anger with his determination to push through reforms, but this may be his most vital stand-off yet. The farmers are demanding he repeal laws passed in September that they say will ruin their livelihoods. The government insists the new policy will benefit the growers and refuses to withdraw the legislation. After months of protests, more than 10 rounds of talks and a Supreme Court order to temporarily suspend the laws, the government says it would consider some amendments and could delay implementation by as much as 18 months. But the agitators are in no mood for compromise.Were not going anywhere. We are ready to sit here for years if needed. The government has to listen, said Balwinder Singh, 50, who normally grows rice and wheat on 3 acres of land in Punjab. He has been protesting since Nov. 26 on the Singhu border, the epicentre of the demonstrations outside Delhi. We can survive the coronavirus but not these laws.Behind the protesters fears and the government rhetoric is a reality that the country somehow needs to reshape its agricultural system or face the environmental consequences of overproduction and a fiscal calamity from ballooning farm subsidies. Get the reform right and it could raise millions of agriculture-dependent families out of poverty and propel India to the forefront of global food exports. Get it wrong and it could force tens of millions of people off their land and degrade up to 90% of the nations water supply.Its a problem so titanic that consecutive governments have shied away from making meaningful changes. Not Modi. Emboldened by seemingly unsinkable popular support, even during a devastating pandemic, his administration has weighed in. Its a classic playbook for the prime minister, whose six years in power have been marked by policy reforms that often set off national protests and occasionally thrown the country into turmoil, such as canceling 86% of circulating currency and introducing a religion-based citizenship law. But the governments willingness to compromise on the farm issue shows that this is potentially an even more delicate path one that risks alienating more than half of the nations 1.3 billion people, who rely on agriculture for a living.The two sides are poles apart. The government says the laws will overhaul the way farm goods are produced and sold in the country, opening up a decades-old system of state-run wholesale markets to more private purchases and helping producers earn more. The farmers fear the laws would give companies and large wholesalers the power to dictate prices to small land-holders, who make up the majority of producers.Its about unlocking productivity in areas like farming of cereals by applying high-quality farm inputs such as seeds, and using less water to grow the same amount of grain, said Rahul Bajoria, Mumbai-based chief India economist at Barclays Plc. The best way for the farm sector to grow is to focus more on exports, for which the country needs to improve productivity and quality control.But the nations millions of small farmers live a precarious existence and have come to trust a government support system that allows them to survive year to year with enough to get to the next harvest.Private companies won't pay us on time, said Singh, the protester. If we don't get paid on time, how will we prepare for our next crop? We will die of hunger.""The root of the conflict lies in a system that evolved over more than half a century after the Green Revolution of the 1960s slowly transformed the nation from a land of frequent famines to an agricultural powerhouse. India is now the worlds biggest exporter of rice and the second-largest producer of wheat and sugar. At the same time, a complex and inefficient system of state support, controlled markets and government welfare grew up that Modi is trying to unpick.Under the present system, the government sets minimum prices for about two dozen crops and buys large volumes of rice and wheat for its welfare programs. While traders arent legally obliged to pay the government-set rates, the sheer volume of state purchases creates de facto price support for key grains from small farmers, who sell their produce through licensed traders in designated markets. These markets were set up to open up the industry and prevent exploitation of smallholders, but over time many became effective monopolies, with traders pulling together to stifle competition. As a result, prices of rice and wheat have remained stable over years, while other crops such as soybeans, corn and rapeseed have seen sharp price swings.Farmers like the arrangement because the government provides them with a guaranteed buyer, allowing them to easily secure informal short-term loans to buy farm inputs like seeds in a country where rural banking services are often inadequate.The new rules intend to liberalize trading by allowing farmers to sell crops outside the designated markets. Modis administration has promised that the welfare support mechanism will remain, but protesters arent convinced.Many believe the reforms are designed ultimately to cut the governments food subsidy bill expected to be $33.4 billion in 2021-22 by allowing market forces to drive down prices. The current support rates reflect the cost of production plus a 50% profit, which, along with assured purchases, has encouraged farmers to overproduce some crops. With India growing more wheat, rice, sugar cane and cotton than it needs, a free-for-all could cause prices to slump.Worse still, 86% of Indias farmers cultivate plots of about 2 hectares (5 acres) or less, while the other 14% own more than half the cultivated land. In an unfettered market, large landowners with lower costs per acre and better access to funds could end up dominating markets, forcing smallholders to sell their land. Thats a shift that took decades in many developed nations as rural residents migrated to cities to work in factories. But an accelerated transition on the scale of Indias population risks a major humanitarian crisis.Jokhu Ray, who grew corn and rice in the eastern state of Bihar, has had a taste of what a free market could mean. Bihar abolished its government-managed market in 2006 and Ray says the result was disastrous for him. In the 2019-20 crop year, he could only get 10 rupees (14 cents) a kilogram for his corn, less than the support price of 17.6 rupees or the 15 rupees he got the year before. Like many others, Ray left his village to seek work elsewhere and now works on a construction site in Rajasthan.Stories like Rays have fueled farmers fears. Protesters around the country held 3-hour chakka jams at the weekend, holding up traffic. The government blocked the internet at major protest sites and deployed some 50,000 police and paramilitary, along with riot control vehicles in and around Delhi, according to local media. After violence broke out at a Republic Day rally in the capital in January, the United Nations urged farmers to keep protests peaceful.The government has shut down the Internet here out of fear, said Singh, by phone. We are not scared. We are informing people through phone calls.We are urging those involved in agitation to end protests, Modi told lawmakers in parliament on Feb. 8. We should give these agriculture reforms a chance.Farmers instead are demanding new legislation that makes it illegal to pay less than the minimum support rate, a policy analysts say would distort the market even more. Private buyers could be scared off, forcing the government to have to step in and buy even more. That would worsen a fiscal deficit that is already expected to widen to 9.5% of GDP due to the coronavirus.State-run Food Corp. of India, the nations biggest food-grain buyer, is already stretched after buying 39 million tons of wheat and 52 million tons of rice from last years crop of about 108 million tons and 118 million tons respectively. Recent bumper harvests have filled many state granaries to bursting.Raising minimum prices each year could also hit exports, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the nations Rice Exporters Association. The moment we make minimum prices a legal obligation, we are bound to lose our share in the global market. He suggested that support prices should be set close to global levels and farmers compensated if needed for any losses.And there are other, even more serious long-term consequences if India doesnt find an equitable way to reform its agriculture, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, where the protests began.Indias Green Revolution in the 1960s brought a surge in grain output in Punjab thanks to high-yielding seeds, mechanization and increased application of pesticides and fertilizers. Known as Indias bread-basket, the state supplied about one third of the 62 million tons of water-intensive paddy that the government purchased from monsoon-sown crops so far this year, according to the food ministry.States like Punjab grow more rice than they consume despite unfavorable terrain, which has resulted in a drastic depletion of their water tables, Rini Sen, an economist with ANZ Banking Group, said in a report.India has only about 4% of the worlds fresh water and farmers tap almost 90% of the groundwater available. Growers say they cant afford to switch from water-intensive crops such as rice and sugar cane unless the government ensures the same kind of price support for more sustainable crops like soybeans, mustard or pigeon peas (used to make dal).Finding a compromise that would reassure farmers they can still make a decent living while dismantling an archaic and inefficient agriculture market may be Modis hardest task to date. But as the two sides dig in for what could be a long and bitter stand-off, its one that India must solve."

2021-02-21,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-govt-to-reduce-dependence-on-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/81135902.cms,Modi govt to reduce dependence on edible oil imports,"Prime Minister Narendra ModiNEW DELHI: The Modi government is now planning to work on mission mode to reduce the dependence of the country on edible oil imports , under which it would be increasing production of edible oil from various sources along with spreading public awareness for economical consumption of oil.According to experts, the objective of this new mission of the Modi government is not only to bring self-reliance ('Aatmanirbharta') in edible oils but also to transfer money to farmers on the expenses incurred on the oil imports.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday during the meeting of the sixth governing council of the Niti Aayog also mentioned that despite being an agricultural country, India imports edible oil worth nearly Rs 65,000-70,000 crore annually. The Prime Minister said this money spent on imports could be transferred to the bank accounts of farmers in the country.We are talking about the 'National Mission on Oilseeds', on which there is a plan to spend nearly Rs 19,000 crore in the next five years. A senior official of the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare said the preparations for the mission are foolproof and would be implemented from April 1 in the upcoming financial year.India imports nearly 150 lakh tonnes of edible oil every year while domestic production is nearly 70 to 80 lakh tonnes. With the growing population of the country, consumption of edible oil would also increase moving ahead. In such a situation, bridging the huge gap between the edible oil imports and the domestic production by achieving 'self-reliance' in edible oil is a major goal. But Trilochan Mohapatra , Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), says that when work is undertaken on mission mode, there is a greater chance of achieving success in it.He said to increase the production of oilseeds in the country, along with acreage, more emphasis would be given on increasing productivity.Mohapatra told that in the eastern region of the country, there are nearly 110 lakh hectares of land, which remains vacant after taking out the paddy crop, it can increase its area by growing mustard. In addition, farmers are encouraged to cultivate pulses and oilseeds instead of crops like paddy, wheat and sugarcane in Punjab, Haryana including northern India where there is scarcity of water.Mohapatra said like paddy and wheat, if farmers get the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for oilseeds and high yield seeds are available then their interest in cultivating these crops would increase.He told that according to the study conducted by ICAR, there are 20 agro ecological regions in the country.Mohapatra said that varieties of seeds are prepared for cultivation of suitable crops in climate of a particular region, which increases the yield. He said that India imports palm oil the most, but the emphasis is now on increasing palm cultivation in the country, which would help in bringing 'Aatmanirbharta'.A total of nine oilseed crops are cultivated in India every year. Their annual production has been exceeding 300 lakh tonnes for the last four years and is increasing year by year. These include such oilseeds and oils which are used only in industries, but most of them are used as edible oils.Director ICAR-Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur (Rajasthan), P.K. Rai, said there is great potential to increase the production of oilseeds in the country and mustard can be seen as an example of this. He said that the emphasis on mustard cultivation in mission mode has increased the acreage this year and production could be between 110 to 120 lakh tonnes.Agriculture Ministry official said that in the next five years, the production of oilseeds in the country could double.Apart from seasonal crops, oil is obtained from the seeds of some evergreen trees in the country. Then, there are also secondary sources of oil. A senior Agriculture Ministry official said the goal of development has been set at every level. Four sub-missions have been made under the 'National Oilseeds Mission' which are as follows:Firstly to increase the production of oil from primary source. Under this it is planned to increase production of soyabean, mustard-rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower, sesame, safflower and ramtil.Secondly to increase the production of oil from secondary source and under it crop which is not produced mainly for oil, but oil comes from it as a by-product. For example, cotton oil, linseed oil etc.Thirdly setting up of processing units in oilseed production areas wherein the areas where oilseeds are produced, provision has been made to set up processing units so that farmers can get a fair price of their crops.Fourthly to create awareness campaign to make people aware of the benefits of economical consumption of oil.Experts point out that oil consumption is steadily increasing with the country's growing population, but a research by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), advises a person to consume 30 grams of oil daily. Adhering to this ICMR study, the annual oil consumption per capita should be nearly 11 kg of oil. Whereas according to the 2017 report, the per capita oil consumption in the country is 19.3 kg.In Video: Centre to reduce dependence on edible oil imports"

The daily wagers are charged Rs 8 per meal. Beggars relish it for free. The benefactor, Alok Kumar Ghose, is a businessman and politician, known widely for his social work.Had it not been for the ready meals and ration, consisting of mustard oil, potato, rice, pulses, my family would have gone hungry, said Asim Dhar, a daily wager.Ghose (62), a local BJP leader, offered cooked food to hundreds and thousands of the poor, including beggars, during the difficult months of the COVID-19 pandemic. He had offered ration too.Its the call of my soul that I started NaMo canteen. It has no connection whatsoever with elections or votes. Elections come once in five years but I have been doing social work for the past more than 20 years, Ghose told this newspaper.He said as a school student, he grew up struggling but was inspired by Swami Vivekanandas famous quote: Those who serve mankind and any other living beings are serving God.Mariani (in Jorhat district of Upper Assam) is a backward constituency. There are no industries, factories etc where the poor can work to eke out a living, he said.Thirty people can eat at a time at NaMo canteen. Some 30-35 beggars eat one square meal every day. Preparing each meal entails an expenditure of Rs 15. I also spend Rs 15,000 to pay the salaries of employees, Ghose said, adding, I had to keep the canteen closed during the pandemic but I offered cooked food and ration to the poor.He has plans to start another NaMo canteen provided he gets the support and cooperation of people.A party hopper, Ghose has contested all Assembly elections since 2001. He served as an MLA for two years after winning a by-election in 2004.

2021-03-01,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2021/mar/01/keep-the-flow-2270281.html,Keep the flow,"Deepika Rathod ByExpress News ServiceMarch 1, 2021, which is celebrated as Rare Disease Day aims to raise awareness about rare diseases and ways to improve our health or manage it well. Today we are going to discuss a similar rare disease that wasnt common earlier known as Polycythemia. It is a rare blood disorder that causes your body to overproduce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.This disease mostly occurs in men after 40. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells fight infection and platelets are involved in clotting the blood to stop or slow down the bleeding which indirectly helps in the healing of wounds. When too many RBC, WBC platelets circulate in our bodies, blood starts thickening and may not flow properly through the blood vessels.This increases the risk of blood clots in major arteries and veins of our body, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. If clots occur in the entire body, then they can affect other vital organs. Smaller blood vessels can be blocked by clots which may lead to headaches, vision changes, light-headedness, numbness, burning, redness and swelling.While no special diet exists to aid the treatment of polycythemia, it is recommended that you eat a well-balanced meal and limit your intake of sodium. Increased blood volume increases your risk of high blood pressure. Limiting your sodium intake can help you better manage your blood pressure and you can avoid processed foods such as bacon, meat, sausage, frozen meals, salty chips and soup to control the same. Instead, include more fresh, home food with pink salt. Here are few tips to be healthy:Eat antioxidant-rich foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables to add fibre to your body which ultimately will help in controlling blood pressure.Avoid refined foods, such as white processed sugar, bread and junk food to control inflammation as they may contain high-fat content and increase chances of blood thickening.Avoid red meat and choose lean meats like chicken, cold-water fish, pulses and beans, nuts and seeds for protein. Protein repairs the cells in our bodies.Use healthy cold-pressed coconut oil, sesame, mustard or groundnut oil or A2 ghee for cooking, which helps in controlling inflammation.Try to eliminate trans-fatty acids from your routine, found in commercially baked goods such as cookies, crackers, cakes, French fries, onion rings, doughnuts, processed foods and margarine. They can make your blood flow sluggish and can increase the chances of blood clots.Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco as they can keep the inflammation levels high and will not help the body to heal.Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day to make sure the body gets detoxified and it doesnt allow the thickening of blood.These practices can be followed daily to keep a check on your blood.DEEPIKA RATHODChief Nutrition Officer, Luke Coutinho Holistic Healing Systems.

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal."
2021-03-03,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/mar/03/turning-to-turnip-for-therapeutic-treats-2271252.html,Turning to turnip for therapeutic treats,"Roshne Balasubramanian ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: A few weeks back, Canadian cabinetmaker Damien Allard became the proud owner of three massive, recordbreaking creamy white and purple topped turnips all of which broke the Guinness record for the worlds heaviest turnip (weighing 22.9 kg, 24.4 kg and 29 kg).While we are sure that the Quebec resident has quite a lot of cooking to do with the colossal root vegetables, lets trace how the lesser-known (now record-worthy) cousin of potato, broccoli and Brussel sprouts provides plenty of nutrients while being low in calories.The turnip and its leafy greens are not only tasty but also nutritious. However, we seldom find people here adding it as a staple in their meals, notes Dhanalakshmi R, dietician, Rainbow Childrens Hospital, talking about the underground veggie variant.Gut healthAvailable at stores in the local markets and priced anything between Rs 25-Rs 30 (per 500 g), turnips are packed with fibrous goodness and can help in aiding weight loss and relieving intestinal problems. A cup of raw turnip has about 2.75 g of dietary fibre in it.This helps reduce pressure and inflammation in the colon, explains the medical practitioner, adding that the presence of high dietary fibres can also enable making bowel movements easier. The gut function is important in getting rid of toxins through bile and stool and the properties in turnips aids in maintaining a healthy digestive tract, she says.Aids in weight lossWith a high water content and low-calorie count, the consumption of the non-starchy vegetable makes people fuller for a longer period, aiding in weight loss. A 100 g of turnip has only 1.39 g of carbohydrates. So, it can be consumed by all and especially those who are on a journey to manage their weight, she says.Reduces blood pressureAccording to a study in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, foods containing (read turnips) high dietary nitrates were projected to benefit the health of the blood vessels. Rich in potassium (about 300 mg), it helps in lowering the bodys blood pressure by releasing sodium from the body. This helps the arteries dilate, she shares.For a long time, a healthy intake of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage and our star of the day, turnip, have been associated with a lower risk of cancer. Dhanalakshmi supports this link. The presence of a sulphur-rich compound called sulforaphane, a phytochemical can neutralise toxins. This plays an integral part in promoting anti-cancer activities in the body, she explains.Studies of a kind of indole in turnips, arvelxin, also suggest that it blocks pro-inflammatory compounds such as nitric oxide, aiding in reducing inflammation caused by diseases including arthritis, cancer, and high blood pressure.Immunity boosterBesides its wide profile of benefits, the vegetable is also rich in vitamin C, which is important for building and maintaining collagen, the component which provides structure to the skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of turnips can benefit the immune system and reduce hair loss prompted by iron deficiency.It can be added twice or thrice in a week in a meal, she shares. With a crispy, white inner flesh and a fresh, zesty flavour, turnips can be boiled or mashed, shredded or chopped, used as a salad garnish or added to stews and soups.NUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP GREENS (PER 100 G)Calories: 40 KcalsProtein: 3.12 gCarbohydrates: 6.16 g Fat: 0.35 g, Fibre: 2.76 gPotassium: 300 mgNUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP ROOT (PER 100 G)Calories: 21 KcalsProtein: 1.58 gFat: 0.35 gFibre: 2.75 gCarbohydrates: 1.39 gWater content: 93.1 %Vitamin C: 64.7 mgRECIPETURNIP GREEN CURRYINGREDIENTSAny dal: 2 tbspGreen chilli: 3-4Onion: 1 (chopped)Tomato: 1 (chopped)Garlic cloves: 6-7 piecesTamarind pieceTurnips (root and greens):As required (chopped)Salt: To tasteTurmeric: 1 tspOil: 1 tbspMustard, cumin, Asafoetida: As requiredMETHODPick a dal of your choice, and add two tablespoons of it into a pressure cooker and soak it in water.Add green chillies, chopped onions, tomato, garlic cloves, tamarind piece and the chopped turnip rootand greens.Add turmeric and salt to taste.

2021-03-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/streetwise-kolkata-teliapara-road-7215314/,"Streetwise Kolkata: Teliapara, a narrow lane named after city’s oil-pressers that not many know of","A stones throw from the overwhelming bustle of Jadubabu Bazaar in south Kolkatas Bhawanipore neighbourhood, is a narrow, unassuming little lane. As there are no markers for the beginning and the end of the old marketplace, you are most likely to miss the entire Teliapara Road if you are walking down without looking up at street signs.Sign up to get quick access to Indian Express exclusive and premium stories.In his book A History of Calcuttas Streets, historian P Thankappan Nair writes that this short lane was where the telis (the oil-pressers) and the kaluas (the oil-mongers) of old Calcutta had set up their homes and shops until modern methods of mass-produced, mill-made oils became the preference for the citys residents. These oil-pressers would sell everything, from freshly pressed coconut oil to mustard oil, an essential ingredient in Bengali cooking, to other less common oils in between.It is not clear when the road and the neighbourhood came to be associated with the telis of Calcutta. An entry in the September edition of the Calcutta Gazette of 1937 indicates that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had proposed a change in the spelling of the road from Teliapara to Tilipara but that never came to fruition. Even today, addresses on that road carry two variations of the roads spelling: Telipara or Teliapara.The teli community, writes K S Singh, in his book Indias Communities for the Anthropological Survey of India, derives its name from the Sanskrit word talika or taila, used for the oil extracted from sesame and mustard, thus alluding to their traditional occupation.The teli community found their jobs diminishing after the pressing and extracting of oil largely switched to mechanical production methods, forcing members of the community to turn to other avenues of income, like farming and animal husbandry.An oil shop on Teliapara road. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh) An oil shop on Teliapara road. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh)The 1837 edition of the Calcutta Review carries an interesting entry about the community. A chapter dedicated to the Territorial Aristocracy of Bengal indicates that the Brahmins had relegated the community as one belonging to lower castes.The Pandits thus referred to unanimously gave the verdict in his favour, a verdict founded on the dictum tula danda dhari taulik; ie, Telis are not common oil-men, but derive their appellation from the fact of their holding the scales for the weighment of goods, and that the word Teli is the corruption of the word Taulik, says the entry.An old building in Bhawanipore. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh) An old building in Bhawanipore. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh)It further mentions: As holding the scales and weighing the goods is a vocation common to all merchants and mahajans, the Telis came in the same category with other Navasaks or second class Sudras, and like them, were entitled to the privilege of making gifts. According to Singhs writings, because a small number in the community, spread across the country, are landless, many have applied to be recognised as Other Backward Castes.Today, not many oil-pressers remain in Teliapara. The road now houses a mix of residential properties and commercial establishments and it is impossible to discern where the next-door Jadubabu Bazaar ends and where Teliapara begins given that hawkers and pedestrians have taken over the pavements.Bound by the bazaar on one end and Turf Road on the other, the manic pulling down of the citys crumbling architectural heritage appears to have largely evaded the old buildings in and around this road. Some exceptions, however, remain.One would be hard-pressed to find hand-pressed oil in the city today. But Calcutta is a city where one comes in search of history and usually does end up finding what theyre looking for, only perhaps not in the expected form. In this case, remnants of the teli community can still be found in this lane, in the odd shops with yellow hand-painted signboards saying oil-dealer. Of course, these shop owners do not know that the road acknowledges Calcuttas teli communitys work."

Why has the Congress government done nothing about farm debt waivers as promised in election manifesto? When M L Khattar government in Haryana is offering Rs 7,000 per acre to farmers to move away from paddy cycle, procure crops like mustard, bajra and pulses, why Punjab is not helping farmers to diversify?

Why your government has not created infrastructure for cold chains, processing and storages?

This has become a new headache for the government and sources said the issue is likely to come up for discussion at an inter-ministerial committee meeting this week.The data obtained from the price monitoring cell ( PMC ) of consumer affairs ministry shows that the modal price of packed groundnut oil has increased from Rs 120 per litre on March 9, 2020 to Rs 170 on Tuesday. Similarly, the modal price of packed mustard oil has gone up from Rs 113 per litre to Rs 140 in the past one year. The modal price of palm oil has also increased by 50%, from Rs 85 to Rs 122 per litre during this period.The PMC data also shows that the modal vanaspati prices (packed) went up from Rs 80 to Rs 120 per litre in the past one year and one litre of packed sunflower oil was selling at Rs 150 on Tuesday compared to Rs 110 a year back.Officials said multiple factors are responsible for this increase in prices, which have been going up steadily except for mustard oil. They said firstly, the global supply of edible oil has decreased and there are indications of domestic consumption increasing. The second reason is Indias huge dependency on imports."

Subscribe here.)Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians.Culture across the pagesChennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our communitys unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation, says Jaishri.The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies.As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March).As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration, says Jaishri.In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal), pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water), kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes.Timely evolutionOver three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. Pitla and daangar (urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time.Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get the copra taste, she says.Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine.  We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes.The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine, says Jaishri.A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa (mor molaga Thanjavur style). Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor, channa, moong and urad. Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water.The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020, says Jaishri.The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon."

We had a meeting with 38 trade unions on March 18, and they have agreed to support us in the Bharat Bandh on Friday. All highways and markets will remain shut for the whole day, informs Paramjeet Singh Katyal of Jan Kisan Andolan led by Yogendra Yadav.To prevent confusion or delay in case of any mishaps, all 30 check points at Singhu border have been numbered, and the persons put in charge will be connected with the main control room. We are holding a meeting today to plan all the safety and security arrangements to avoid any untoward situation on this day, added Katyal.Meanwhile, all borders observed the Martyrdom Day (Shaheed Diwas) of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev on March 23. On a call by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the youth from Punjab and Haryana turned up in huge numbers at the borders. At Ghazipur border, everyone wore yellow turbans like Shaheed Bhagat Singh to pay tribute to the martyrs and show resentment against the government, added Rajan Jawla, LLB student and farmer leader from Shamli, UP. Addionally, Khalsa Aid had organised a 5km run at Tikri border, singers Ravinder Grewal and Harjeet Harman sang songs at Singhu border to keep the farmers motivated and The Particle Collective presented a play targeting the government.Matyrdom Day (Shaheed Diwas) at Ghazipur borderHoli PreparationsOn Holika Dahan (March 28), we will burn the copies of farm bills at all borders and even in other states, informed Katyal. Farmers will also burn Holika in the evening, and play with colours on the 29th. Nirmal Singh Cheema, Volunteer, Kadian Group from Jalandhar, said, Earlier, Hola Mohalla used to be celebrated at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab, but we will celebrate it here this year. Nihang Jathebandis will ride on their horses, and Gatka performances will be presented at the borders, and we will play with colours the next day.Summer TransformationGreen shade nets and bamboo huts are slowly replacing the yellow, black, and blue tarpaulins; fireplaces have made way for coolers and fans. At all three borders Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur people only start venturing out when the sun goes down. Katyal said, Singhu border is better organised because we get funds from people living in Punjab and their families living abroad. One man donated 500 coolers three days ago. We had started making pucca sheds, but the government filed four FIRs against us. So we resorted to installing iron sheds covered with green nets on the sides as these keep the places airy and prevent mosquitoes. Another alternative are bamboo huts, and we have made a lot of them.All trolleys have also been covered with mosquito nets. Similar arrangements are being made at other borders too. Bamboo huts have been made in 70 per cent of the area at Ghazipur border. Water is the main necessity in summer, so an RO with cooler has been set up here. People are donating coolers and fans. Even I donated four fans, added Jawla. But due to mustard harvest and sugarcane sowing, the numbers have gone down a bit on the borders.Work will wrap up by May 15. People are mostly spending time inside their tractors and tents, but every day one rally is being held at Ghazipur in the evening to keep the spirits of people up. Around 800-1,000 people take part in it, adds Jawla. However, the Kisan Mall is open just two days a week. Our strength is low and our tents are half empty, and so the requirement is less, informed Amarpreet Singh, Asia Pacific, Director, Khalsa Aid, India."

While rural roads are being metalled, the national highways are being four-laned.The BJP has done a lot of development work, it has made roads, toilets and houses, said Sanjib Bora, an owner of a shack restaurant next to the national highway in Chabua, Tinsukia. People here will support the BJP for this. Boras sentiment was endorsed by Dhanesh Pegu, also a roadside dhaba owner in Dhemaji district next to the recently-opened Bogibeel bridge, the longest one on the Brahmaputra river. Modi ne bahut kaam kiya hain (Narendra Modi has done a lot of work), he said.Take the Bogibeel bridge for instance, The foundation stone was laid by (H D) Deve Gowda, then (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee did some work but after that there was a Congress government both at the Centre and in the state but nothing happened. When Modi came he finished the bridge, Pegu said. Its no wonder then that from Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister Sarabanda Sonowal and state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to the ordinary BJP karyakarta (worker), development is one of the main talking points.ALSO READ: Fear, loathing and emergence of new minority politics in poll-bound AssamWhat we have done in the past five years the Congress could not do in 15, said Tutun Kar at the partys dimly-lit and sparse Nagaon district office. Assams Swachh Bharat Mission says more than 35.64 lakh toilets have been built since October 2014, with a 62% increase in households with the facility. As for housing, state culture minister Naba Kumar Doley said in May 2020 that 2.7 lakh houses have been built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.The latest data on the increase in road network is not available but according to the Assam Economic Survey 2017-18, surfaced road increased from 21,200 kms in 2011-12 to 27,003 kms in 206-17. National highways in the state increased from 2,848 kms to 3,900 kms in the same period.But the positive sentiment around the Assam governments development record is somewhat marred by the price rise. Everything is so expensive now, dal prices have gone up and mustard oil now costs almost Rs 150 (a litre). I voted for Modi the last time, I am not sure this time, said housewife Sarita Pegu in Dhemaji.Noor-ul-Islam in Nagaon concurs with Sarita on inflation. There is no doubt the BJP government has brought development but what about the price rise? If they have given us Rs 2 in our bank accounts, they have taken away Rs 98, he said.Price rise weapon in the hands of Assam CongressThe price rise has come in handy for the Congress to beat the BJP with. What has the BJP done on jobs and price rise? Their promises are embarrassingly unfulfilled, said party leader and parliamentarian Gaurav Gogoi. Gogoi isnt wrong when it comes to jobs. In some other parameters also Assam lags behind many other states, although many of them could be a legacy the BJP government inherited.According to Assam Agenda 2030, a task-at-hand document brought out by the Sonowal government in early 2018, the unemployment rate stood at 61 per 1,000 population (age 15 and above) against the national figure of 50 per 1,000 population. Poverty and hunger also plague the state. The poverty head count ratio for Assam was estimated at 27.34 percent in 2015-16. This is much higher than the all-India average of 20.74 percent, the Agenda 2030 said.Similarly, hunger remains a major problem in the state. Amongst children, the most vulnerable group in this respect, almost 30% below the age of 5 are undernourished, it said. But the BJP remains confident. We are on the way to getting more than 100 seats (out of the total 126) because of our development work, said Simanta Bora, a party leader in the district of Nagaon."

Also, this year only those farmers who have registered themselves on the Meri Fasal, Mera Byora portal are entitled to sell their crops to the government agencies, officials said.A senior official of the district administration said that every possible effort will be made to make the procurement process a smooth affair for farmers and they will be paid 100% either in their bank account or through arthiyas. Last year, the state government transferred more than 50% of the payments directly to the bank accounts of the farmers and the remaining was made through arhtiyas.To avoid problems in getting the gate passes, there will be a facility of two computer operators each at every gate, along with Saksham Yuva for assistance. Apart from four established mandis, few temporary mandis will be set up according to the needs of the farmers. The focus will be on cleaning the mandis before the season begins, along with proper facilities for drinking water, food, toilet and electricity, he said.The district is expected to have a yield of more than 5.5 lakh quintal of mustard and 7 lakh quintal of wheat. Around 22,000 farmers have already registered themselves on the portal to participate in the governments mustard and wheat procurement process.Monika Malik, the district food and supplies officer, said, We have made elaborate arrangements to ensure that the farmers and workers abide by the Covid protocol put in place. While farmers vehicles and equipment would be sanitised at the time of entry in mandis, we will also provide them with masks and remind them to adhere to social distancing norms at the procurement centres.Only those farmers who have registered themselves at the government's Meri Fasal Mera Byora portal will be allowed entry. Suitable transportation arrangements have been made to lift crops from the mandis on time. If any transporter fails to lift the crops within 48 hours, we would be ready with an alternative arrangement, she said."

The only change that we will notice is variation in the choices of colours while opting for colour-blocking. And of late, it's the pastel color-blocking that is having a moment in fashion. Recently we spotted this look on actor Kriti Sanon who wore a colour-blocked slip dress in candy hue.""The colour-blocking trend in candy colours has emerged as one of the hottest trends. From bags to scarves to outfits, you can bring back all the playful flavors of your childhood added to all the boldness of the present. This summer alert is surely bringing back retro and popping out as an iconic style mantra,"" says designer Prreeti Jaiin Nainutia from Nirmooha.Designers suggest that breaking the pastel hue with a contrasting neutral one such as teal or mustard can be a great idea. ""Candy colours are best to beat the summer heat. A soft pastel palette brings a fresh lightness to your summer wardrobe and is a great alternative to ivory and whites. They have a sweet retro appeal, which we love and we have incorporated the same in the form of candy stripes. Think of bold solid stripes, graphic patterns, or even checks in such a dessert palette! Break this pastel-ness with a contrasting neutral such as teal blue, indigo, brown, or mustard. This contrast will bring out the pastels better,"" says designer Sonam Modi from SVA Couture.Styling these colour-blocked outfits can be tricky, designer Aniket Satam suggests ways to ace the trend. ""One can team and layer solid pastel shades such as rose milk pink, butterscotch, peach, aqua, andlLaguna green in fun patterns such as cool geometric graphics, checks, etc. Offset this trend with summery white to complete this comfy yet cute summer-friendly trend. One can also channel this trend by adding pastel colour blocks in form of accessories along with an all-white summer ensemble,"" he says."

The state has recorded a deficit of 62 per cent in precipitation during March, preceded by a deficit of 80 per cent in February and 58 per cent in January. Water sources in Himachal have been drying up or running low, while shortage of rain has affected rabi crops in a state where around 80 per cent of the cultivated area is rainfed.The average yield of mustard crop in my land is one quintal, but it is not likely to exceed 8 to 10 kilogram this time. Similarly, the yield of barley will not be more than 10 to 15 per cent of the average. In case of wheat, the crop has not even developed sufficiently this time due to lack of rains, said Om Prakash Thakur, a resident of Dhami in Shimla district.According to IMDs meteorological centre at Shimla, Himachal received 41.7 millimetres of rain/snow in March against a long period average (LPA) of 110.9 mm. It was the second-largest rain deficit in the state during March in the last 10 years. The highest deficit of 67 per cent occurred in 2018, when state capital Shimla had suffered a severe water crisis in summer.This March, all 12 districts of Himachal witnessed deficiency or large deficiency in rain as per IMDs classification. Kangra, Hamirpur and Sirmaur were the most-affected, recording a deficit of 84, 79 and 77 per cent respectively, while Kullu (40 per cent), Mandi (40 per cent) and Shimla (41 per cent) recorded the least deficit.According to Pankaj Gupta, associate director of Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station at Mashobra, shortage of rain and snow this year has adversely affected temperate fruits such as apples, cherries and pears in their fruit set stage. The chilling requirements of these fruits could not be completed this winter due to lack of adequate snow and farmers have been demanding an official declaration of drought. Apples are now entering the flowering stage, but the flowering is neither expected to be profuse nor simultaneous. Plants are flowering in small patches which reduces pollination. What happens later during the fruit development stage remains to be seen, he said."

Farmers are being told that only persons who will get the message (from official web portal) can come to the mandis to sell their crops. Where will farmers go if they have already harvested their wheat and they havent got the message? Will he take his harvested crop to his home and then to the mandis? This will double his labour and transport costs. This process has been adopted by the government to harass the farmers. The government should immediately procure the crops being taken by farmers to the mandi, Hooda said.The Leader of Opposition also slammed the governments decision of reducing the moisture content in wheat from 14 to 12 per cent.Aim of this move is to avoid paying MSP and this is why government has decided to reduce the recommended amount of moisture. Also, earlier the permissible level for mixed quantity (rye, mustard, chaff, etc.) before weighing was 0.75 per cent in a quintal which has now been reduced to 0.50 per cent. This will cause heavy economic losses to the farmers. The government should immediately withdraw this decision, Hooda said.Referring to other issues including unemployment rate in Haryana, Hooda said, About 45,000 posts of teachers are lying vacant. In schools, about 50 per cent of the posts of headmasters and principal are lying vacant. According to a report, 54 per cent of the schools in the CMs district Karnal do not have head teachers. Nearly one lakh applicants who have passed HTET have been waiting for JBT recruitment for 7 years, but the BJP government in Haryana has not carried out a single recruitment in its term. Against this, more than 20,000 JBTs were recruited during the Congress term. It is clear that the government has made up its mind to hand over education completely in private hands.Hooda said if government does not recruit teachers, then number of children in schools will reduce further and this will be used as an excuse to close them. Recently, the government announced closure of 1,057 schools. Governments job is to build schools, not close them. Governments job is to provide affordable education to every child., he said, adding Haryana has once again topped the CMIE report with 28.1 per cent unemployment rate."
2021-04-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/honey-producers-feel-hybrid-seeds-sting-output-suffers-7258109/,"Honey producers feel hybrid seeds’ sting, output suffers","On manufacturing of artificial honey in India by some groups, Narpinder said the government must make NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) tests for honey compulsory so that only pure honey could be available in the market rather than having sugar-laced syrups by some big companies.WHILE FARMERS of Punjab have been fighting for respectable prices for their crops at Delhis borders for the past over four months, bee keepers of the state are fighting another battle for several years now. The yield of honey per colony has gone down manifold around 2-3 times. The reason, according to them, is that flowers of hybrid seed crops like sarson (mustard), sunflower, and berseem (fodder) etc., do not carry much nectar, because of which they are facing heavy losses.Beekeepers have been writing to the Punjab government as well as Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, to address this issue by developing varieties which carry good amounts of nectar too. They also blamed that decreasing area under flowering crops.Dharminder Singh (49), a beekeeper from Dharamgarh village in Mohali district, said: I have been into beekeeping for the past 25 years and own 600 colonies (boxes) of bees which I keep across the state  in the Shivalik ranges, and outside the Himachal, Rajasthan as per availability of the flowers with the changing seasons. But the yield of honey has come down 2-3 times in all these years.We met the scientists at PAU a number of times and apprised them about how hybrid seeds of flowering crops are hitting the yield of honey because the amount of nectar in the flowers of these hybrid crops is hardly sufficient, he further said, adding that earlier, they would collect 4-5 times the honey from a box in a single season than what they now collect from one time crop.Another beekeeper, Simarjeet Billa, said that because of low yield per colony, their income has gotten hit manifold.Hybrid seed varietiesNarpinder Singh, president of the PAU Progressive Beekeeper Association Punjab and having 600 colonies, said that in India, 80 per cent honey production takes place from the mustard flower. But in the past 15 years, the average production per colony (per box of bees) has come down from 50 kg to 15 kg during the mustard crop season, which starts from November and continues till March.He said that as per records of the National Bee Keeping Board, Indias honey production was 1.20 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, which is increasing with every passing year. Punjab produces around 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of honey but in reality, bee keepers like us are getting low yield per colony. Due to hybrid seed varieties, the duration of mustard crop has also decreased from 60 to 65 days to 50 to 55 days only, added Narpinder.Transportation expensesHe said that beekeepers are required to take the colonies from one place to another during the different flowering season. Sometimes we are going to Rajasthan during mustard crop season and some time we are taking bees to Himachal during apple flowering season We are bearing so much in transportation charges, then also keeping caretakers at the place where our boxes are kept. Government must come forward to help us in transportation charges when the yield is also going down, he said, adding that more area must be brought under flowering oil seed crops like sarson in Punjab.Artificial honeyOn manufacturing of artificial honey in India by some groups, Narpinder said the government must make NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) tests for honey compulsory so that only pure honey could be available in the market rather than having sugar-laced syrups by some big companies. Purity of honey will also provide huge opportunities to the bee keepers to expand their beekeeping, he added.Reasons for yield productionPAU scientist Dr Jaspal Singh, principal entomologist told The Indian Express, said there are several reasons for low yield and one of the major reasons is the high competition in this field. He said a honey bee can travel upto 3 km to collect nectar. Earlier, there used to be a very low number of colonies in a particular area when now the number of colonies has increased manifold. Secondly, changing weather conditions also played a big role because high temperatures during February-March led to decrease in yield. Also if a crop is not sown timely, the amount of nectar also gets decreased, he added.PAU records also revealed that oilseeds crops used to be sown on around 5 lakh hectares in Punjab in 1970s and the area has reduced to just 50,000 hectares now, while the number of colonies has increased by 3-4 times now in the state.Narpinder Singh, a national award winner in beekeeping, said a colony carries around 20,000 to 25,000 bees and a bee has a life cycle of around 40 days. In India, Italian bees are rare."

I visited various grain markets and interacted with farmers. Their condition is deplorable. Rather than facilitating the farmers, the governments experiments are causing immense harassment to them, he said.In many places, farmers who are reaching the market with their crops, are being harassed in the name of moisture, not registering on the web portal or that the server was down. The government should cooperate with farmers, and not do new experiments with them every day. The government should immediately stop its excuses and procure grains from farmers who are reaching the market with their crops, he added.Hooda also opposed decision to reduce the standard limit of moisture in wheat from 14 per cent to 12 per cent. The government has decided to reduce the moisture content so that it does not have to pay MSP to farmers. Now wheat will be purchased in the mandis where the moisture will be less than 12 per cent. Earlier, wheat with moisture up to 14 per cent was also procured, he said.Not only this, earlier 0.75 per cent mixed quantity (rye, mustard, chaff, etc.) was allowed in a quintal but this has been reduced to 0.50 per cent, or 500 grams in a quintal. Farmers will have to face heavy economic losses due to this move. The government should immediately withdraw this decision, he added.The BJP government has always had an anti-farmer attitude. The anti-farmer attitude is visible in how the government is continuously increasing input farm costs despite trying to mislead the farmers through its false assurance of doubling the income of farmers. The government has decided to increase the rate of DAP fertiliser by Rs 700. The farmers are already suffering because of rising costs of petrol and diesel. This is the first time in history when a government has enforced such a huge increase in the price of DAP and the government should take it back immediately, the Leader of Opposition said.Hooda said that the present government is extracting every penny it can from the farmers in the name of GST on fertilisers, seeds, electricity, medicines, petrol-diesel and agricultural implements, adding that the government falls silent on the issue of MSP which has forced farmers to agitate and they have launched a satyagraha to get their legitimate demands agreed.On Thursday, he visited grain markets in Ladwa, Babain and Thanesar of Kurukshetra too.Selja too attacked the BJP government for increase in DAP fertiliser prices. Price of 50 kg DAP fertiliser has been increased by 58.33 per cent. A 50 kg bag of DAP which used to cost the farmer Rs 1,200 has now been priced at Rs 1900. Similarly, the price of 50 kg bag of NPK has been increased by up to Rs 615. The price of DAP and NPK has doubled in seven years of the BJP government. Earlier a bag of urea used to be 50 kg, the prices of which were increased and the weight was reduced to 45 kg, she said."

Here are the diverse ways communities are celebrating the new year:Musical UgadiPantula Rama | Photo Credit: Special arrangementPantula Rama, Carnatic musicianDecorating the threshold with mango leaves is the first thing we do on Ugadi. I follow my mothers recipe to make Ugadi Pacchadi which has nice flavours dominating the bitterness of neem. We will be missing the family get-together and students and friends visiting home this year.Any festival in my family has limited rituals. Being a family of musicians, our major ritual is music-related to that particular festival. This year, I have been invited to do a special recording of a thematic presentation  Musicality of Telugu in Carnatic Sangeetham by the International Music Premier League, an online event for Ugadi.I remember the Ugadi celebration abroad when we were on a concert tour and took a break to celebrate the festival with my brothers family at Maryland in the US.I wish the live concerts resume soon.Lets spread the artKoeli mukherjee ghose | Photo Credit: Special arrangementKoeli Mukherjee Ghose, artistSpring cleaning, decorating the home with flowers and alpana on the floor with watered-down rice paste is something that I look forward to every year. This year, we would miss visiting the Hyderabad Kali Bari to offer our nabo borsho puja and enjoy the bhog prasad. We offer fruits and food at a nearby ashram, which houses homeless people.During childhood, my brother and I would wear new clothes and visit my dad's office in Dalhousie Street in Kolkata. The Stephen House building used to overwhelm us  the smell of the lift, the colonial courtyard with a fountain; everything is a memory now. There would be a little prayer gathering and sweet boxes with yummy goodies would be gifted to all of us. Lunch was at home with a traditional menu and my mother, a wonderful cook, would transform any vegetable, dal, and other eatables into gourmet dishes.The evening would be spent in musical concerts held in Rabindra Sadan, Birla Sabhaghar or Kala Mandir auditoriums. The pandemic has left a lasting impression on our minds. The art scene has shifted online, and I hope and pray that we have more visitors to the sites and art lovers reach out to the artists and buy their works.Culture and creativityRam mohan Holagundi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementRam Mohan Holagundi, theatre directorThe house looks colourful on Ugadi day with rangoli, mango leaves thoranam and marigold flowers. The first thing we do after puja is to eat behu bella, the sweet and sour chutney symbolic of different flavours in life.Three big mango trees in our house are a special part of festivities. We wait till Ugadi to pluck mangoes and distribute them among our friends, relatives and neighbours.The festive meal will have Kannada specialities  kosambri, bisibele baat, mavinkayya chutney and chitranna, muddipalya, saaru, holige and mosaru buttey (curd rice with seasoning).We usually have a family get-together but this time it will be a virtual one. Since we cant meet the elders in the family to take their blessings, we will connect with them over the phone.I hope art and culture will break the barriers and go beyond different traditions and communities.Arts continues to thriveVyshnavie Sainath | Photo Credit: Special arrangementVyshnavie Sainath, dancerMy grandmother instilled excitement in us for Puthandu and would encourage us to buy new clothes. Paati would also make special food and students in my dance centre add extra cheer by wishing Puthandu vazthukal.Our celebrations will be intimate this year starting with puja and my mother (dancer Rajeswari Sainath) is already on a long call with paati to get the recipes right. The pandemic has taught me many things and I want to fearlessly implement them. It has shown me that despite the fear and uncertainty, students/parents/practitioners have not given up on their art and have swiftly shifted to the online platform. It only reinforces the belief in me that arts can adapt to every situation. I pray that the year gets better and I can perform live.Combining traditionsAshwin Nair and Nikita Kak | Photo Credit: Special arrangementStand-up comedian Ashwin Nair and Nikita KakThis year we will be combining the traditions of Navreh and Vishu. Interestingly, Kashmiris and Malayalis place a thali type arrangement of food items in front of the image of KrishnaWe celebrate Navreh by filling a plate with rice, vegetables and fruits called Thaal bharun and cook favourite recipes like Teheri and dum aloo. I miss going to my home town but will connect with them virtually.As children, we were always excited to see the Vishu kani (a beautiful platter of vegetables, fruits, grains, flowers, gold, cash and clothes and jewellery in front of a photo or statue of Vishnu) and receive money from our grandparents. Growing up we realise the pleasure of seeing such prosperity and receive such gifts at the start of the year. Vishu is a time to celebrate the year, the summer solstice and usher in joy and prosperity.The pandemic has limited our interaction with family back in Kerala but we still look forward to celebrating a smaller version of Vishu at home with my wife and mother. Our sweetest memories of Vishu were being surrounded by cousins and extended family and waking up to the Vishu kani with our grandmother and receiving the kaineetam and eating a rich sadhya as children.It was a time of celebrating in every way  beautiful sights, food and the joy of receiving pocket moneySubdued festivitiesMayanand Thakur | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMayanand Thakur, theatre actorWe hoist Gudi (stick, flag, garland of flowers, mango leaves, neem tree leaves and upturned silver or copper vessel on the top) on top of a building or apartment balcony. Gudi padwa is a festival of rituals and traditional food especially a tangy chutney prepared with neem leaves and flowers, grated raw mango, jaggery, pepper and chilli powder with a seasoning of hing and cumin and mustard seeds. This chutney is tasty and also good for health as it improves digestion. Another ritual is to bathe with neem leaves- soaked water that keeps our body cool.We missed grand celebrations due to the pandemic last year and unfortunately, the celebrations will be subdued considering the situation now and keeping each others safety as a priority. My most loved quote during the pandemic is: We isolate now, so when we gather again, no one is missing.New beginningsNidarshana Saikia Das | Photo Credit: Special arrangementNidarshana Saikia Das, entrepreneurRongali Bihu is a celebration of spring and of youth, hence the Bihu dance takes centre stage. Young and old sing, dance and play instruments like the dhol and pepa mostly in the fields and underneath the trees. Thankfully, some Bihu functions still make room for mukoli Bihu (where everyone can dance together). And dancing underneath peepal trees have tiptoed into verandahs and drawing rooms during private home parties.This time of the year is ritualistically spent in Assam but these two pandemic-struck years have been exceptions and we miss the fun of Rongali Bihu in our homeland. We usually plan a get-together with our Assamese friends in Hyderabad but with rising cases, it will be a traditional meal with just the family.In Assam too, my aged parents will be home as the situation is aggravating.I belong to Nagaon, a small town and we used to make a ritualistic trip to the village to soak in traditions and make and savour traditional foods. The whole day wed have these small groups of children and young adults, dressed in traditional attires, flocking from a home to another, singing and performing Bihu dance, collecting money to have a feast at the end. Many a time the hosts would join in.It is quite a sight to soak in  be it Bihu songs celebrating spring, exquisite dance moves, unique musical instruments and of course the food. These become very important windows for our children to a culture theyre fast getting detached from.Foster friendshipsTejdeep Kaur Menon | Photo Credit: Special arrangementTejdeep Kaur Menon, IPS (Retd)We usually have a huge congregation of 10,000 people during Vaisakhi; Singers from different parts of Punjab come here to perform shabd kirtan but we will be missing it this year. The celebrations have become a personal affair. People may visit the Gurudwara on their own but congregations and huge celebrations are not allowed. During this time, I usually have a blue salwar kurta ready for the festival as blue is the colour we wear on the day to go to Gurudwara. I plan to make kadha parshad at home and share it with neighbours.My big wish is for normalcy to return lessons learnt from the pandemic. We should realise life is fleeting and spend good quality time with each other and foster friendships at home and outside.I long to see my granddaughter too play with her friends with the freedom with which we played outside.Every year I get kirpan on Vaisakhi day from the community. It is a rare honour for a woman to receive it but this year I am going to miss it."

The state government welcomed the phenomenon saying that the private players procured the oilseed at rates much above the minimum support price.After visiting eight mandis of Gurgaon, Rewari, Mahendragarh, Dadri and Bhiwani, state Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister JP Dalal told The Indian Express: The MSP of mustard is Rs 4,650 per quintal while it is being sold up to Rs 5,800 per quintal in Rewari. In other mandis too, its price is above 5,500 per quintal.The government has not purchased even a single quintal of mustard in Haryana mandis till date. We are happy with this situation when the private players buy produce from farmers above the prices of MSP. The welfare of farmers is the utmost priority of the government. If we need the agricultural produce, then we can procure it from the market, said Dalal.Mustard is mainly produced in southern Haryana apart from some areas of Hisar and Fatehabad.High global prices have made edible oil imports dearer, benefiting domestic mustard growers just when their crop is being harvested and brought to the mandis. Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare department Director General Hardeep Singh said, Mustard is used in soaps, cosmetics, personal care products and cattle feed too. We aim to increase the area under the crop also but traditionally it is restricted to southern Haryana, and Hisar.Commenting on the higher market prices of mustard, agriculture and food expert Devinder Sharma said, It gives more reasons to make MSP a legal right for farmers. If markets are willing to pay a higher price, there is no reason why a floor price by way of an MSP should not be fixed. It does not mean the state has to buy the entire produce. It only raises the benchmark for trade.A law to ensure MSP of agricultural crops is one among the main demands of farmers, who are currently sitting at the borders of Delhi as part of their ongoing agitation against three agri laws.Dalal said the Haryana farmers are happy because of higher production of mustard this time. This time, the production will be higher by 1-2 quintal per acre against the normal production of 8 quintal per acre.The minister said kapas (narma cotton) is also fetching higher prices than the MSP in Haryana mandis currently. The Haryana government is procuring 10 crops on MSP including millet, groundnut, sunflower, wheat, paddy and mustard and the farmers are getting payments directly into their accounts, he added."

Although he transitioned to a career in food and beverages from science, his new book, The Flavor Equation , goes behind the recipes to investigate the science of taste, combining his knowledge of chemistry with the mysteries of flavour pairings. The popular food columnist, blogger and recipe developer spoke toabout the Indian influences on his writing and also on mainstream American cuisine. Edited excerpts from the interview.They go hand-in-hand. Ive always felt cooking in the kitchen is just like being in a lab but with a tastier outcome. Recipe writing is just like writing experiments -- things work and sometimes they dont. Thats when you try to understand what is happening and how to fix it. A large part of recipe development is also problem-solving and creating solutions. This is where science comes in. For example, for the longest time, the paneer I made in America was too soft with a ricotta-like consistency -- a problem I never encountered in India. It turned out the calcium levels in cows milk is lower than that of buffalos milk used in India. To fix this, I simply needed to increase the amount of calcium and curdle the milk. Calcium chloride, an ingredient commonly used in cheese-making, does both these things. It gives the extra calcium and also the acid to help the milk proteins change their shape and turn into a firm block of paneer.Growing up in India, Ive been fortunate to experience and taste food from different regions as well as see and appreciate Indian ingredients and techniques for their versatility. In India, you can travel through various states and a staple ingredient like rice will morph as it moves from biryanis to fermented batters that make dosas and idlis. It gives me a sense of how ingenuity comes into play as recipes reflect adaptations to changes in geography and culture.While I dont think were exactly there yet, I do think we are on our way to seeing Indian food and ingredients in more homes than earlier. I think this is one of the most exciting times to be cooking Indian food in America because people are genuinely excited to learn about new flavours and ingredients. The works of chefs and writers like the late Floyd Cardoz, Asha Gomez, Tejal Rao, Priya Krishna, and several others are certainly helping cement the prominence of Indian cuisine in America.Cooking and for that matter even appreciating flavour, is something we learn through trial and error over time. It is experiential. Ive learnt to cook by watching my family and friends as well as through cookbooks, magazines, television shows and also working as a pastry cook in a patisserie. Flavour is a wide umbrella that not only encompasses the taste and aroma of the ingredients in our food but it also involves the interplay of our senses -- the shapes and colours of the food we eat, the different textures of food, and even the sounds food makes as we cook and eat. I remember being taught in India to pay attention to the sound of cumin and mustard seeds popping when preparing a tadka. We are constantly using all sorts of sensory cues in our cooking. And then theres the interplay of our emotions and memories that influences our perception of flavour. We love some flavours more than others, be it something we experienced in childhood or something tied into our cultures. The Flavour Equation is a book that gets into all these different facets from a nerdy-yet-fun lens with the recipes acting as enticing experiments.Living in two very different parts of the world gave me the opportunity to not only taste new food but also compare and contrast. You start to notice how people and culture define food. Often, similar beloved combinations exist throughout the world. They just get painted with different spices and are cooked in different ways -- for example, mashed potatoes and meat is a popular dish in the West but in Mumbai, potato chops provide that same degree of comforting flavours and textures where ground meat is encased in a shell of smooth, mashed potatoes before being shaped and pan-fried.My blog started out as a way for me to talk about the Indian food I didnt see in restaurants or in magazines and an opportunity to show the versatility of Indian ingredients and techniques in Western cooking. I dont see myself as an expert on Indian food since I certainly dont know all there is to Indian cuisine but I do my best to share the food I enjoy cooking at home with people. Its been a long journey but one that Ive thoroughly enjoyed. While there are plenty of common misconceptions on Indian cooking, I try to do my best through my work to show people that they can easily incorporate a lot of those flavours in their own cooking at home. Over time, Ive been fortunate to write for outlets such asandIt has certainly helped me share my food with a larger audience.There is an incomparable joy that I nd difficult to express in words when I eat ripe Indian mangoes. During ripening, the starch transforms and gives way to a soft pulp thats sweet and sour, carrying an aroma that reminds me of warm summer holidays in Goa. While mangoes are delicious as a sweet treat, they also make an excellent addition to savoury applications. The fruity, sweet avour of mangoes with lime gives this beet salad a refreshing taste. Try to use a good ripe mango without a chalky aftertaste. Its no surprise that I recommend Indian mangoes, but champagne mangoes are a good option. Youll find paneer in the cheese section at Indian grocery stores as well as most regular food markets.Paneer is not a salty cheese, so the marinade must contain a bit more salt for the cheese to absorb.The salad dressing provides a second layer of flavour as well as salt.While paneer is one of the easiest cheeses you can make at home, I prefer the store-bought variety in this application, where shape and structural integrity are important. It takes the pressure of an extremely heavyweight to bring together the protein molecules in the paneer and force them to coalesce, producing a firm, compact paneer that can hold its shape when cut and cooked. Commercial producers have equipment that generates sufficient pressure; its a little tricky to do this at home but Ive developed a method that you can use; otherwise, store-bought is perfectly fine.Whisk the ker, salt, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder, and black pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pour the marinade into a large resealable bag.Cut the paneer into approximately 1 by 2 by  in [2.5 cm by 5 cm by 12 mm] cubes and place them in the bag with the marinade, seal, and gently shake to coat evenly. Let the paneer marinate for one hour at room temperature. If you need to marinate it longer, leave it in the refrigerator.Preheat the oven to 400F [204C].While the paneer marinates, prepare the beets. Peel, trim the ends, and cut into quarters. Place the beets in a baking dish or roasting tray, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender on the inside and a knife slides through the centre with ease. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes.While the beets roast, prepare the dressing. Place the mango, ker, oil, lime juice, mustard, pepper, and chilli powder into a blender and pulse on slow speed until combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt.Grill the paneer just before youre ready to assemble the salad. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or a medium non-stick sauce pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil. With a pair of kitchen tongs, carefully lift the paneer out of the bag and cook it in batches in the hot pan until it turns golden brown and is slightly seared,two to three minutes per side.To serve, toss the arugula in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Add the pepper and season with salt. Add the warm grilled paneer pieces. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the salad dressing. Sprinkle with the amchur just before serving.Serve the remaining salad dressing on the side."

The restaurant, which boasts a food menu conceived by Michelin-starred Chef Atul Kochhar of Benares, London fame, and executed by Chef Tanvi Goswami, has just introduced an Experience Menu, curated by Kochhar, Available only on Sundays, it is a reflection of SAGAs food philosophy, weaving together the myriad flavours of the country into a nine-course meal that celebrates Indias rich culinary legacies in clean contemporary settings. Speaking of settings, the restaurant itself is stunning, sprawling over three floors and an al fresco area, with the focal point being a bar that towers up through the entire restaurant, requiring mixologists to travel up and down using lifts and pulleys.All of that spectacle is reinforced by some truly stellar cocktails, but more on those later. Going back to the food, Kochhar says, Through this menu we would like to give an experience, which is culturally rich and speaks volume of our heritage and love for food. The menu is brought to life keeping in mind different palates, touching key dishes from our a la carte offerings and also giving unparalleled dining experience. The Chefs Experience menu includes some of the best-selling dishes from the a la carte menu such as Crispy Crab, Ghee Roast Prawn, Sali Murg, Bhuna Mangsho, Edamame and Quinoa, Khari Paneer Tikka along with special dishes created for it, all washed down by a chilled glass of crisp Prosecco and live music by a violinist who traipses through the various floors and mezzanines of the space.Going with the non-vegetarian menu, we are pleased to make the acquaintance of dishes like the aforementioned crab and prawn. The fo rme r comprises a crackling soft shell crab (we recommend downing it in one bite if you have a large enough mouth and or a disdain for decorum), with dollops of saffron-spiked cream and a mustardy catsup, while the latter comes taco style, the Mangalorean prawn dish, scented with fennel and curry leaves, resting on a tortilla shell as delicate as a ballerinas ankles and just as tenacious, gamely managing to contain the shellfish as one wolfs it down.Helping us wash down this surfeit of seafood is the delicious Indo-Negroni, which gives a distinctly desi twist to the classic cocktail with cumin and citrus flavours. Next, we dally with the Himalayan Flavours (a Nepalese-inspi red Roas t Chicken Salad fired up with timur pepper and tart tomatoes) and Lentil Love (comprising slow-cooked lentils fortified with onion and garlic and served in a tart shell which gives the otherwise simple legumes a more complex texture and crumble, making it all the more welcome). We also take a dip in the Lonar Lake, a signature cocktail of SAGA that is a medley of gin, Aperol (an Italian bitter), Orgeat syrup and sparkling wine, perfumed with kaffir lime leaves.Swimming may be out this year but this is definitely something we could dive into again and again. In the interest of brevity, we shall refrain from further details, but suffice it to say that the main courses, which included Sali Murg (Parsi Chicken), Bhuna Mangsho (Bengali style goat mutton) and the Family Affair (a multi-grain khichdi for the whole family to pass around), were each delicious and individual in their own way. For desserts, there is the Petha (an ambrosial cloud of rabadi festooned with orange jelly, winter melon candy and rose) and the Pilgrims Sweet (a platter packed with plum cake, Panchamarat ice-cream, date treacle and wheat halwa). With the menu expected to change seasonally, given Kochhars emphasis of taking cues from nature, diners can keep enjoying new tastes from the country we call home.DETAILSAT: Vatika Atrium, Golf Course Road, Sector 53, GurugramTIMING: Every Sunday, 12:00pm-4:00pm, 7:00pm-11:00pmCOST PER HEAD: Rs 2,995 ++"
