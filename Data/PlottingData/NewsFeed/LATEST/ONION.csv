Some had lost jobs, some a place of stay and scores of migrant workers were seen walking kilometres to reach their hometowns.When the Covid-induced lockdown cast a pall of gloom and robbed people of their livelihood, the challenges also brought out the best of humanity . Many residents of NCR accepted the ones in despair as their own. Hundreds of families came together to feed the migrant workers and students left stranded in the big city.It was a conversation between strangers on social media that started it off. On a Facebook page where athletes often discussed their upcoming running and cycling events, the talk veered towards the migrants plight.Shaurya Roy, a businessman, got in touch with Abhishek Mishra, an entrepreneur. Together, they visited slums in Saraswati Vihar , which has about 1,500 shanties, and interacted with daily wage labourers, construction workers and domestic helpers who had lost their jobs. The Facebook page soon became a platform for the athletes to contact each other on the ground when they were out to provide aid and food.Many of the workers wanted to leave for their hometowns as they feared running out of supplies. We counselled them and assured them they would get help. We have been in touch with them ever since and provided them food, Roy, a resident of DLF-5, said.People were not well-informed about the crisis and often missed the administrations announcements, Roy said, adding that they tried to bridge this gap.Sonal Pathak, who lives in Suncity Township, similarly joined hands with five other residents of the society in March to help out more than 1,000 migrant workers and labourers who had lost their jobs at construction sites around the Golf Course Road area. With donations from more than a 100 people, Pathaks group, over a period of three months, was able to deliver food kits consisting of 10 kg rice, 2 kg flour, 500ml oil, small packets of turmeric, salt, chilli powder and 1 kg of potatoes and onions to the families of the labourers.During the lockdown, Shibal Bhartiya said being a doctor meant she was allowed to venture outside her house. She used this opportunity to help the labourers living in the citys slums. Along with her 13-year-old son and her friend Grashmi Jivani, a resident of South City-1, she distributed food to many in need. We reached out to several people via social media and raised funds. We have been providing 2kg packets of rice, pulses and soap to each family, Bhartiya, who resides in Nirvana County, said.At the same time, the doctor also tried to educate the workers about the importance of social distancing.Many families in DLF-2 have been similarly feeding migrant labourers around their societies and distributing rice and pulses. Some have set up community kitchens as well, said Gaurav Wahi, RWA president, DLF-2. In Dwarka Expressway , some residents have contributed sanitisers and hand wash to slum-dwellers in the area. We have been giving rice and pulses to construction workers, and are also providing food to our support staff, Praveen Malik, RWA president, Sare Homes, Sector 92, said."

Since then while the freight train movement has picked up in terms of speed and quantity, limited number of passenger trains are being run as the Railway Board awaits for the current situation to ease.The unprecedented crisis caused a huge revenue hole yet the railway story last year is about how the entire railway machinery was galvanised into action to move scores of migrant labour up northwards towards Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, etc., during the peak of the pandemic safely.Incidentally, Shramik Specials began from here when the maiden train from Lingampalli took off towards Hatia (Jharkhand) on May 1. In all, 243 such labour specials originating from 32 stations helped transport more than three lakh labour to over 88 stations in 15 States.We additionally dealt with another 795 Shramik special trains passing through our zone. Our staff, despite the virus threat, has provided food and drinking water to all of them besides providing security, pointed out General Manager Gajanan Mallya. The zone was also think in the action of ensuring movement of foodgrains, vegetables, fruits, milk and so on across the country to keep the feeder chains alive amid the lockdown and had introduced three Kisan Rails from the south for transporting agriculture produce exclusively.We clubbed two freight trains into one to enable faster delivery of food grains and our Doodh-Duronto for milk supply to Delhi from Renigunta station, starting from March has till date transported five crore litres, he explained. Time tabled parcel trains  to benefit small and medium freight customers to transport essential commodities  was another pioneering effort with over 600 such trains moving one lakh tonnes. Freight trains had even crossed to Bangladesh transporting dry chillies, turmeric, onions, dry, ginger etc. for the first time.Passenger services started in a trickle from May 15 and 83 pairs of regular special trains are being run with more than 3,000 trips a month. Another 78 festival specials are being operated with more than 1,300 trips for month, an average of 100 regular trains and 35 festival specials are being run, senior officials say.This is a far cry from operating over 700 trains a day before lockdown and carrying little over 363 million passengers (252 million between AprilNovember) to 4.34 million or a steep nosedive of -98.2% in 2020. It has had an impact on revenue, which went down from over 15,000 (9,00 crore between April-November) to 5,342 crore or a reduction of about 41%.On the freight front, if it was 113 million tonnes last year or 73 MTs (April-November), it is down to 56 MTs or - 21% in 2020. Mr. Mallya stated the relatively limited train services helped complete infrastructure works with 88 km of new lines, 43 of gauge conversion and 261 km of doubling/tripling/quadrupling works completed, added CPRO Ch. Rakesh."

At the Koyambedu wholesale market complex, the cost of vegetables did not exceed 25, with some greens available for just 10 per kilogram.According to market sources, a kilogram of onion and potato were sold between 20 and 22, carrot and tomato were available for 20/kg last week. Cabbage, chow-chow and beetroot were availabe for 10/kg. Beans was available for 25/kg, after price fell by 10-15. This was the lowest price in the past five months. Rates were fluctuating so much in the recent past that carrot and onion prices exceeded 100/kg due to shortage in arrivals.S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations said that arrivals to the market is expected to drop this week. ""We had huge arrivals in December that lowered the cost of all vegetables,"" he said. But, this week may see partial revision in prices since arrivals for Chennai is expected to drop as markets offering better prices in other states for the same commodity could attract additional vegetables, he added."

He noted that the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) officially announced 2021 as the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables with the idea to improve healthy and sustainable food production through innovative technology, and reduce food loss.Despite obstacles like Covid-19 and heavy rains, horticulture production was better last year. This only indicates that more farmers, mostly in Rayalaseema and upland areas of Krishna and Guntur districts, are shifting to horticulture, he observed.APSAM vice-chairman said more markets need to be explored when there is an increase in production so as to ensure that the farmers do not suffer losses.As domestic consumption cant continue to be a target, focus is on supply to other States. Apart from exploiting those markets, the horticulture department has been asked to ensure smoother and faster transportation and minimal paperwork, given the goods are perishable. To promote the horticulture produce from the State, representatives will be deployed in different markets, he added.At the same time, efforts to promote better quality produce with good demand through extension activities from horticulture and research institutions are underway.Fruits produced in 2019-20 (in lakh MT)Banana 62.97, mango 50.76, orange 22.41, papaya 18.08, lemon 6.57, muskmelon 4.05 , watermelon 3.74, guava 3.3Vegetables produced (in lakh MT)Tomato 26.67, onion 9.8, green chilli, cucumber 8.69, brinjal 4.32, bhendi 3.32"

The CIA director is a woman and women head all five of the agencys branches, including the directorates of science and technology, operations and digital innovation.But while the CIA has been diversifying for years, intelligence agencies still lag the federal workforce in minority representation. With thousands of job applicants annually, the CIA wants to do more to ensure its workforce reflects national demographics.The revamped website has links for browsing CIA jobs complete with starting salaries and requirements, sections on working at the agency, and a streamlined application process.Weve come a long way since I applied by simply mailing a letter marked CIA, Washington, D.C., said CIA Director Gina Haspel, who joined the agency in 1985. She said in a statement that she hopes the new website piques the interest of talented Americans and gives them a sense of the dynamic environment that awaits them here.Haspel has made recruitment a priority since she became the first female director in May 2018. Since then, the CIA has started advertising on streaming services, launched an Instagram account and an online onion site, a feature that makes both the information provider and the person accessing information more difficult to trace.Last year, the CIA designated its first executive for Hispanic engagement, Ilka Rodriguez-Diaz, a veteran of more than three decades with the agency. She first joined after attending a CIA job fair in New Jersey.The CIA had never been on my radar, she wrote in an op-ed in The Miami Herald after getting the job in October. I didnt think I fit the profile. After all, the spies I saw on TV were male Anglo-Saxon Ivy leaguers, not Latinas from New Jersey. Still, I went to my expert life coach, my mother, for advice. She said, No pierdes nada con ir. (What have you got to lose in going?) So, I went to the job fair. The rest, as they say, is history.Across the more than a dozen U.S. spy agencies, including the CIA, 61% of intelligence professionals in fiscal 2019 were men compared with 39% women, according to an annual demographics report compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.In fiscal 2019, the intelligence community saw an incremental increase in the number of minority professionals  26.5%, up from 26.2%. But thats still lower than 37 percent in the federal workforce as a whole and 37.4 percent in the civilian labor force, the report said.The largest minority or ethnic group at all the intelligence agencies, including the CIA, was Black or African American at 12% followed by Hispanic at 7% and Asian at 4%. Persons with disabilities represent 11.5% of the workforce at all the U.S. intelligence agencies  up a point from the year before.Even with all the challenges 2020 posed, it was a standout recruitment year for CIA. Our incoming class is the third largest in a decade and represents the most diverse talent pool, including persons with disabilities, since 2010, said CIA spokesperson Nicole de Haay."

There are over 20,000 pending cases, including over 6,000 of second appeals. We took up the matter of the absence of an online tracking system because of its official website not functioning since 2017, said S P Rai, who was part of the delegation.Read | Bihar Election 2020 Voting Highlights: Over 53% voter turnout till 6 pm; onions hurled at CM Nitish Kumars rallyA Google search does not show any official link and directs it to the central information commissions official website, which suggests a private website link.Ajay Chourasia, another other RTI activist who was part of the delegation, said the panel has maintained that it can simultaneously entertain only 20 queries of an applicant despite no such cap in the RTI Act.Santal Singh, an Aurangabad RTI activist, alleged the panel has been returning applications for second appeal on trivial pretexts such as not attaching an affidavit or self-attesting the application.The activists claimed that several applications have been pending for disposal since 2015. Vishwanath Sahani, an RTI applicant from Madhubani, said, I had sought information on the status of scholarship money distribution in schools from Benipatti block education officer. My second appeal (filed in 2015) is not taken up yet.Former Bihar Assembly Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary said, It is a matter of serious concern that the state information commissions annual report is not being tabled During my tenure, I had ensured that maximum boards and commissions did so. If the information panel is not willing to share information, what else can one expect from government departments.Former Assembly Speaker and now JD(U) minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary had said in 2019 that the Assemblys Public Undertakings Committee would take up such matters.BSIC Secretary Suresh Paswan, however, said, We are trying to sort out website issues. We have now engaged an IT manager to set things right. We are also trying to ensure that our annual reports are prepared. He said the panel met RTI applicants to help resolve their concerns."

Wondering how it works? Read on.How does GM diet promise?GM diet is known to have been formulated in General Motors Corp in 1987, to tackle weight and health issues faced by its employees. It was field-tested at John Hopkins Research Centre and then approved for distribution by the board of directors of GM Corp.According to gmdiet.in, the diet plan works on providing simple nutrients to burn calories than adding further to your body, on a seven-day schedule which would enable weight loss, body detox and giving body cleansing benefits too. The diet claims to focus on eating wisely rather than starving.GM diet menuGM diet can be both vegetarian and non-vegetarian  while the diet remains the same for both groups on the first four days, it changes as per ones food preferences on day 5,6 and 7. Heres a brief look at the diet plan:On day 1, you can eat sweets and tangy fruits like melons, to keep you full for a long time. Other fruits include strawberries, apples, watemelon, and cantaloupe.Also Read | Have you heard of cookie diet? Heres how it promotes weight lossOn day 2, you can consume all vegetables like lettuce, tomato, cabbage, onion, kale, artichoke, spinach, broccoli, and limit potato to just breakfast.Day 3 consists of both fruits and vegetables. This is the day when your body starts to lose fat in chunks. Complex carbs in fruits help you keep energized and stay focussed too. Choose a salad, boiled vegetables and ample water to keep your body hydrated, mentions gmdiet.net.On day 4, soup is recommended but more bananas and milk are to be consumed. 8 medium-sized bananas and 3 glasses of skimmed milk must be consumed over the day, as suggested by the website.Bananas are an integral part of the diet plan. (Photo: Thinkstock/Getty Images) Bananas are an integral part of the diet plan. (Photo: Thinkstock/Getty Images)Day 5 is when you can have one item among chicken, fish, or beef. This can be consumed in two meals along with six tomatoes. Vegetarians can replace meat with cottage cheese or brown rice in addition to tomatoes.On day 6, meat (or cottage cheese) and vegetables are recommended with no tomatoes.On day 7, the last day, more fruits and vegetables are to be added to the diet.Apart from these foods, GM diet focusses on drinking enough water  about six to eight glasses each day.Also Read | Should you follow keto diet for weight loss? A clinical dietitian answersIs GM diet sustainable?This diet plan involves the consumption of low-calorie or negative-calorie foods which provide fewer calories than they take to digest, thereby promoting weight loss. Besides, it emphasises drinking water which helps detoxify the body. But like most other fad diets, experts are divided in their opinion about whether this diet plan is sustainable.According to medicalnewstoday.com, the diet lacks essential vitamins and minerals that come with eating a variety of healthy foods daily. Besides, most days of the entire diet plan provide low amounts of protein, which, researchers argue, can decrease appetite and promote weight loss.Moreover, the diet can only lead to temporary weight loss. Once the GM diet plan is over, it is likely that you would regain weight once you resume your normal diet, according to Healthline.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"
2021-01-05,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/understanding-the-rationale-of-farm-protests/story-gKFfx6HP8bCjlrVNQ5yM6O.html,Understanding the rationale of farm protests,"analysisUpdated: Jan 06, 2021, 06:13 ISTThe recently enacted farm laws and the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act by the Union government has led to a standoff with no resolution in sight. Farmer organisations and several state governments had conveyed their opposition to the laws at the time of the promulgation of the ordinances. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, which exhibits disdain for efforts to build consensus through wider consultations, proceeded to push the bills through Parliament without any meaningful discussion with the Opposition parties.The disinformation campaign launched by the BJP to mislead the public that the present laws accord freedom to the farmers to sell their produce to whoever they choose/desire is far from the truth. Under the current/existing Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) model, the farmers already have the choice to sell their produce to private parties. The transactions take place at APMC mandis, which are regulated and safeguard the farmer from exploitation at the hands of the multinational companies (MNCs). The Centre is seeking to replace the existing agricultural marketing system with a handful of intermediaries who will be under no obligation to pay the minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers.The Centre has overlooked a fundamental aspect that no one size of farming pattern fits all. Our founding fathers were conscious of this ground reality and placed agriculture under the State List of the Constitution. The National Agricultural Research Project divides our country into 127 different agro-climatic zones. The different zones include varying landholding patterns, weather/climate, soil content, production patterns and water levels. The present laws fail to factor in the heterogeneity in our farming patterns and attempt to impose the Bihar model of agriculture, which has failed to yield dividends to the farmers.The vilification campaign against the arhtiyas overlooks the supportive role played by this irreplaceable cog in the agricultural wheel. It is the arhtiya to whom the farmers look to for financial support for the purchase of fertilisers, short-term loans and family needs; both enjoy a relationship of mutual trust. The midnight Income Tax (IT) raids on officer-bearers of the arhtiya association in Punjab reflects the mindset of the BJP.Such high-handed measures undertaken with an objective to browbeat and intimidate supporters of this peaceful movement have become part of the BJP agenda to quell legitimate criticism and dissent. Corporates, with their profit maximisation motive and impersonal transactional relationship, can never fill the shoes of an arhitya. The unilateral imposition of the present laws, without taking the farmers into confidence, has further widened the trust deficit between the agriculturists and big business.The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 2020, gives carte blanche to hoarders and traders to engage in predatory pricing. The statement of objects and reasons for the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, was to regulate and check hoarding of essential items and black-marketing of food produce by unscrupulous traders. The recent amendment removes cereals, pulses, oil seeds, edible oil, onions and potatoes from the list of essential items, facilitating unlimited hoarding and speculative trade.As a consequence of the recent amendment, the government can step in to regulate the stock limit for these food items only in the event of a war, famine, natural calamity or an extraordinary price rise in retail value.Unless there is a 100% price increase in retail price of the aforesaid items, the government is proscribed from intervening to check hoarding and black-marketing of food produce and cereals. This facilitates the path for exploitation of the consumers and will lead to inflationary pressures across sectors.The labelling of protesting farmers as anti-nationals has led to justifiable anguish among the farming community. Every household of Punjab and Haryana has made innumerable sacrifices for the country right from the time of the freedom movement. The role played by Punjab in defending our nations territorial integrity and in feeding the country in the time of the food crisis is well recorded in history. Thousands of ex-servicemen, who have served at our borders, are part of the farmer protests and are seeking redressal of their legitimate grievances. Over 50 farmers have lost their lives at the protest sites owing to low temperatures and difficult living conditions.We need an empathetic government with a moral compass to urgently find a solution to the satisfaction of the farmers. Engaging in dilatory tactics and subterfuge will further exacerbate the growing trust deficit between the farming community and the Centre.Vijay Inder Singla is the Cabinet Minister for Education and PWD, Government of Punjab.

The next round of talks with the Centre is scheduled to be held on January 8.Last week, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmer unions camping at the gates of Delhi to press their demands, had said that if their demands are not met by January 26, farmers would lead a tractor parade into Delhi.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border, where farmers have been camping since November 26, Yogendra Yadav, political activist and a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, said: The seventh round of talks in seven months with the government failed as they have refused to repeal the three farm laws. We will go ahead with the plan to take out a tractor march on the KMP Expressway on January 7.He said the tractors would leave from the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders, and Rewasan in Haryana, for the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways, and meet midway. This may be seen as a rehearsal of what will happen on January 26, he said.READ | Corn to onions  Burari ground, once feared as a jail, now a field for farmersHaryana Bhartiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Bains said that the tractor march was scheduled for Wednesday but it has been postponed to Thursday keeping in view continuous rains.Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava also confirmed that the tractor march has been postponed for a day.

After that we will take a call on the issue of permission, he added.Quoting the information received from farmer leaders, a senior police officer said, The farmers have dropped the plan of a parikrama (circumambulation) on the KMP Expressway too in which they had earlier planned to cover the entire stretch of 270 km on the peripheral expressway.He added: As per the new plan, now 1,000 tractors will move to Tikri border from Kundli border on the KMP expressway. In the same way, 1,000 tractors will get on the expressway at Kundli border to move to Tikri border. At the toll plaza on the expressway, they will take U-turns to return to their original places. Similar programme will take place from Rewasan village in Mewat district where a road connects the KMP. Here 200-250 tractors will get on the KMP expressway to go up to Mathura road in Palwal district to return from there. In the same way, around 200 tractors will move to Rewasan village from Palwal and will return from there.A farmer leader from Haryana, Suresh Koth, said, The tractors will move to KMP Expressway as part of rehearsal for our tractor parade scheduled for January 26.Farmer leaders have advised farmers in distant areas of Haryana to hold tractor marches in their respective areas, but still there are indications that the farmers will move to the national capital from many areas of the state. A khap leader from Jind, Azad Singh Palwa said the farmers will start moving to Delhi from the villages early morning.Its a 4-5 hour run for the tractors to reach Delhi from villages of Jind. So, we have suggested that they should move to Delhi early in the morning, he added.The leaders of farm outfits have indicated they are not going to leave Delhi borders empty handed stating this is a question of their survival.Instead of committing suicide at homes after corporates grab our land, we would prefer to struggle. We have already asked the government to shoot us or let us live by repealing anti-farmer laws, said Suresh Koth.READ | Amid rain, langar organisers at Singhu visit each tractor to deliver food: No one should go hungry, now a field for farmersFarmers sit at the back of their tractor trolley as they continue to block a highway at the Delhi- Haryana border at the outskirts of New Delhi.

We will not agree to anything less than that, said Raja Ram, general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Mahasabha. Despite the fact that the country faces rampant hunger and food insecurity and there were more than 4 lakh farmer suicides, the government says the MSP is above the market price and surplus grain is an issue. This government does not care about the BPL families, he said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various Delhi borders for over a month against the three laws. Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various Delhi borders for over a month against the three laws.Protests at toll plazas continue amid rainUndeterred in the face of severe cold and rains, the protesting farmers kept sitting at toll plazas Tuesday to raise their voice against the controversial farm laws. Senior farmer leaders including Koth and Gurnam Singh Chaduni have planned visiting the toll plazas from Wednesday to energise the farmers sitting on dharnas there. Meanwhile, a senior police officer said the Haryana Police are keeping an eye on the developments related to the farmers agitation.Farmers in Haryana are now preparing for the long haul too. As per plans, farmers will keep moving to Delhi borders in tractor-trolleys apart from planning a big movement of farmers to the national capital after every few days. As part of one such plan, the farmers will move to Delhi borders from Sirsa on January 15, said a farmer leader from Fatehabad, Mandeep Nathwan. In a similar move, thousands of farmers had moved to Delhi borders from Punjab a few days back.BKU chief visits JammuTo expand the agitation further, Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Chaduni went to Jammu to meet local farmer leaders Tuesday. Earlier, Chaduni had gone to Patna to hold deliberations with the farmer leaders of Bihar.After meeting Chaduni, J-K Zamindar Forum president Abdul Hameed Malik told The Indian Express that the BKU leaders visit to their region was meant to send a message that the farmers from Kashmir to Kanyakumari are against the farm laws.A group of farmers from Jammu and Kashmir will move to Delhi borders Wednesday to join the agitators there. We will give a memorandum to the authorities of Jammu on January 23 as part of a call given by the farmer outfits, said Malik.This is not the agitation of a particular area but the farmers across the country have joined this struggle. The farmers may belong to any caste, creed or religion but they are united in this battle. The implementation of these laws wont affect the farmers alone but common man too. The corporates may sell the pulses at the rate of Rs 400 per kg after purchasing the same at the rate of Rs 50 kg from farmers, he added.

While most farmers then decided to remain put at the borders  saying authorities wanted to push them into a corner  about 400 eventually moved to the Burari ground.Pointing to a volleyball net tied between a branch and a tent, Jagdeep Singh (24) from Punjabs Faridkot said on Tuesday, A sewadar from Delhi donated this net to us 10 days ago. Since then, some of us gather to play in the evenings. Farmers cannot sit idle, it is in our blood to do something productive. For the same reason, a number of older farmers decided to make use of the land and grow a few vegetables.Rows of 12-day-old onion plants are being cultivated not far from the 40 tractors at the site. Said Gurudev Singh Manga (42): They will take around 60 days to start yielding onions. It is symbolic of the fact that we will not move from here anytime soon.Gurudev and others from Ropar district in Punjab reached the site in the last week of November: We keep visiting Singhu and Tikri, but we will not go anywhere as it is easier to march to Delhi from here.At another corner of the site, Jaskaran Singh Kahan (58) and his family from Firozpur tend to the rows of corn, spinach, tomato and onion: There are 15 corn trees and two rows each of other vegetables. Once it becomes a bit warmer, we will grow rice and a few more vegetables. That way, we do not have to depend on resources from outside.He added that some were grown from leftover vegetables, while some seeds and plants were purchased from a nursery nearby. He said that they will be grown organically as the quality of the mud is good.While sporadic rains have been a boon for these crops, they have posed a new set of challenges. Many farmers dug trenches around their tents and tractors when they were expecting rain so water wouldnt accumulate where they sleep.For others, who have set up bigger tents with cloth on the ground, this was not an option. Pinderjeet Kaur (32), who joined her father-in-law at the protest, came to Delhi in a private vehicle along with her husband and two children. She said, Ten of us, including the children, sleep on three mattresses, which are now wet because of the rain the roof of the tents keep flying at night as well. She said nobody has given them a fresh set of mattresses and that they would have to wait for them to dry.Meanwhile, groups of farmers worked through the day to set up sheds for the two langars at the site. Jaspaal Singh (58) from Faridkot said a number of items come in from Singhu and Tikri borders. When we need something, we tap our networks there. Apart from that, people from Delhi come to our aid. The day it rained, a few sewadaars came and gave us material to set up tents, including asbestos, logs of wood, nails and hammers.As the evening set in, both langars had been sheltered from the drizzle, and farmers said they no longer had to worry about cooking in the rain."

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup)The Supreme Court will on January 11 hear a batch of pleas challenging the new farm laws as well as the issues related to the ongoing farmers protest at Delhi borders.On Wednesday, a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde observed that there is no improvement on the ground regarding farmers protests, following which the Centre conveyed to the court that healthy discussions are going on between the government and farmers over these issues.Attorney General K K Venugopal said there is a good chance that parties may come to a conclusion in the near future and filing of response by the Centre on the pleas challenging the new farm laws might foreclose the negotiations between the farmers and government.Also Read | Corn to onions  Burari ground, once feared as a jail, now a field for farmersWhile informing the bench that talks are going on between the government and farmers in a healthy atmosphere, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that these matters should not be listed for hearing on January 8.After hearing Venugopal and Mehta, the top court adjourned the matter for Monday. We understand the situation and encourage consultation. We can adjourn the matters on Monday (January 11) if you submit the same due to the ongoing consultation process, the bench said.On Monday, talks between the Centre and farmer unions remained inconclusive over two key demands  repeal of the newly enacted laws and provision of legal guarantee on the minimum support price  with the two sides drawing the hard line on their respective positions.Also Read | Amid rain, langar organisers at Singhu visit each tractor to deliver food: No one should go hungryThe talks will resume on January 8 when the two sides sit across the table for what will be the eight round of negotiations ever since the protests that brought farmers from Punjab and Haryana to the gates of Delhi on November 26.Emerging from the meeting with the unions Monday, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters, We wanted a clause-wise discussion on the laws, so that we could proceed on the way forward. The discussion was mainly centred on this. We discussed the issue of MSP briefly, but could not arrive at a decision. Therefore, the government and the unions decided to meet again on January 8 to take the discussions forward.The meeting was cordial but could not find a way forward as they (farmer leaders) were adamant on the demand for repeal of the Acts. But I hope the way the discussions took place today, meaningful deliberations will again take place at the next meeting and, possibly, we will find a solution, he said.Farmer union leaders said they made it very clear to the government that the talks will have to be on their demand for repeal of the new laws.Meanwhile, farmer unions protesting against the new agriculture laws have said they would hold a tractor march on the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways on January 7, as a rehearsal for January 26."

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry. Simmer till it thickens and the oil separates. Serve with hot rice.(With inputs from Meghna Majumdar)"

And given the learnings of the past year, many of us might be hopeful of adopting a sensible yet easy-going, new attitude towards fitness. So, as the year made us more conscious towards taking care of our body, will we re-embrace our old habits? Or will we remain the same person who wakes up with the sun and three mornings a week, heads out for a lengthy run? Well, experts tell us how the New Year health trends will be shadowed by what we learnt in 2020. Read on:Rashi Chowdhary throws light on being functionally fitHolistic and functional fitnessWhile we all kept obsessing over calories, fat and weight gain throughout these years, 2021 will change that. Now the focus would be more on holistic, emotional and spiritual well-being. Health is not just food but many other things which will be in focus. Nutrition would not just be about the calories we intake and our weight, explains celebrity nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary.Celebrity nutritionist Ryan Fernando talks about hoe plant-based protein will be crucialFocus on plant-based proteinThere has been a steady rise in the consumption of plant based diets as many health conscious individuals came to realise the benefits of proteins from plants that have lesser inflammation and also adaptogens which help in healing the body. Plant based proteins are extracted from various plants such as hemp, green peas, brown rice, peanuts, wheat and various other plant sources. Even the fiber that comes from plants, helps, in various cholesterol and indigestion problems. My advice is that the human body needs only 0.6-0.8 grams per kgs body weight and a normal diet will suffice for a normal person. Sports and fitness warriors can add 15 grams of plant protein post their workouts, recommends celebrity nutritionist Ryan Fernando.Nutritionist Kavita Devgan talks about food minimalismFood minimalismMore and more people will follow food minimalism and conscious eating for greater good of the planet. This pandemic brought forth the fact that we are in the middle of a climate emergency too, so hopefully people will start to take their responsibility towards nature more seriously and waste less food. Secondly for a good part of last year we all managed with less  less food, less variety, less options. So, a lot many of us will hopefully not go back to the eat max way of living we followed earlier, opines nutritionist Kavita Devgan.Actor nutritionist Pavleen Gujral talks about gut health and its importanceImmunity boosters and gut healthThe novel virus made us know our body better and shifted the focus on boosting immunity. And chase for better immunity will be a part of our diet, this year too. Immunity is directly related to gut health. Edibles that are good for the gut  that enhances good bacteria in intestines  is pro biotic food like garlic, onions, kimchi, yogurt, banana, whole grains among others. In 2021 gut health will be very important, says nutritionist Pavleen Gujral.Back to the rootsThe traditional remedies are here to stay and well continue our faith in them. Turmeric milk for busting inflammation, amla juice for Vitamin C, ashwagandha for its mood-boosting power, among others, are a few traditional remedies one will opt for, adds Devgan.Nutritionist Tripti Tandon throws light on the importance of outdoor walks.New Workout trendsGoing for walks is the best exercise and helps cease many problems, be it hormonal or diabetes or asthma. Even going for cycling regularly can be a workout trend in 2021, says nutritionist Tripti Tandon, adding, We learnt last year how we can manage to stay fit with no gyms, I see a bend towards this."
2021-01-08,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/high-quality-onions-from-maharashtra-flood-markets/article33532037.ece,High-quality onions from Maharashtra flood markets,"Wholesale prices of the kitchen staple is hovering around 30 a kg from a high of 90 over the last two monthsAfter a severe shortage of over three months, fresh stock of onions have flooded markets in the city, bringing a price correction, much to the relief of households and hoteliers. The wholesale price of onions that had reached 90 a kg over the last two months, is now down to 30 a kilo, said Ravi Kumar from the Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders Association. At present, onions are retailing at around 45, but a price correction over the next two weeks is expected.Onions are a staple ingredient but consumers were upset not only by the high prices but also by the low quality that was being sold. The new onions, a fresh harvest from Maharashtra, are dry and of a high quality.Shubha J., a software engineer, said that for the three months when the price of onions peaked, it had been tough cooking. We use onions almost every day. Even if you were ready to pay, there were no quality onions available in the market. Most of them were wet and sprouted, and would spoil in just a matter of days. The arrival of new onions is something to celebrate, she said.Chandrashekhar Hebbar, president, Karnataka Regional Hotels and Restaurants Association, said they were happy that good quality onions had come back with a price connection. Onions are a staple, especially in North Indian and Chinese cuisines. Even South Indian too, we had stopped selling onion dosas over the last three months, which we will reintroduce now. The ideal price for us would be at 25, a kilo, which we hope it will come down to in the next few weeks, he said.According to Ravi Kumar, a new crop has been harvested in Nashik and surrounding districts of Maharashtra, which has been flooding the States markets over the last one week. The previous crop was severely damaged due to heavy rains and floods, which had made the onions wet. Thankfully, there were no untimely rains this season, and the onions are of a good quality, he explained.After the previous crop was damaged due to floods, leading to a price escalation in the market, many farmers have planted a second crop in the State in the hope of cashing in on the rally in prices, sources said. The second crop in our State - in Belagavi, Haveri and Molakalmuru - is expected to be harvested by month end. There are crops that have been harvested in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, most of which are flooding markets in North India already. So the harvest of the crop in the State is unlikely to have a market in other States, and this will likely create a glut in the market, crashing the prices further, explained a senior onion trader at Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard."
2021-01-09,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/food-parks-the-for-crop-diversification-7139248/,Food Parks — the mega push that did mighty little for crop diversification,"Amidst the ongoing protests against the three agri laws and the demand for legal sanctity to minimum support price (MSP), experts have raised questions on the sustainability of the wheat-paddy cycle of farming and pointed that if peasants, especially those in Punjab, want to increase their income, they must opt for crop diversification  something that has remained a distant dream in the state.As then Union Food Processing Minister, Shiromani Akali Dal leader and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal  she resigned from the Cabinet last year in protest against the three agri laws  pushed for crop diversification in Punjab and got three mega food park projects sanctioned for state. The information gathered by The Indian Express, however, reveals that the food parks have not given much fillip to crop diversification.The first such project  International Mega Food Park Limited (IMFPL) worth Rs 130 crore and spread in an area of 55 acres  was set up in Fazilka district. It ran into financial trouble in 2018, nearly four years after becoming operational in October 2014 during the Harsimrats second tenure as Union Food Processing Minister.Read | Pune start-up helps farmers make crops more resilient to changing climateA functionary of the IMFPL informed that the park had been in financial trouble and National Company Law Tribunal had appointed an administrator for resurrecting the it and infuse investment by new investors.The functionary said the only facility which was currently functional there was a venture by Schreiber Dynamix Dairies Private Limited (SDDPL) and Tetra Pak South Asia Markets, manufacturing beverages using fruit concentrates.Before it ran into fiscal woes, the park housed facilities for processing milk and manufacturing milk powder (Novello brand), Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) line to freeze peas and power generation from husk, among others.On June 30, 2019, IMFPL chairman and managing director Sukhinder Singh was booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly orchestrating a fraud of Rs 33 crore  the amount it had taken as loan from the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).As per the FIR, the fraud where bills of industrial machinery were allegedly forged, was carried out by the IMFPL through its machinery supplier, Food & Biotech Engineers Pvt Ltd. The FIR also named Sukhinders wife Kanwal Sukhinder Singh, son Simarinder Singh, and others.Explained | How can Punjab achieve crop diversification?The second project of Union Food Processing ministry promoted and developed by Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) in Ladhowal in Ludhiana, as per the information gathered by The Indian Express reveals, has an occupancy of only little more than 33 per cent of the plotted area.The Rs 117-crore PAIC project, which also goes by the name of Gur Kirpa Mega Food Project, is yet to be formally inaugurated. Three players, however, had started their operations in the park between 2018 and 2019, said a government functionary.In the total plotted area of 54 acres out of the total 100 acres of the project land (which include roads, green belt and other parameters), 12 food processing units have come forward to start operations on 17 acres of land.Also Read | For farmers, agency means choiceGodrej Tyson, which is into ready to eat and cook products and frozen food; Iscon Balaji, which is into production of potato flakes; and Meat Masters, which is into frozen meat products, have already started commercial production at PAIC food park. The other nine players who have come forward to start operations there are Field Fresh Foods (sauces, mayonnaise: brand Del Monte); Sharman Jain (sweets, bakery and ready-to-eat products); Shree Sharda Shakti (bakery products); Rishika Foods (bakery products); Shri Sant (fruit murrabas, crushes); Gamut Foods (confectionery food products); Roseberg (namkeens), and A Qube (ready to eat products).In February last year, a penalty of Rs 2.5 crore was imposed on Punjab after Harsimrat, as then Union minister, alleged that the Congress government in state led by Captain Amarinder Singh was deliberately delaying the mega food park project in Ludhiana.Also Read | Corn to onions  Burari ground, once feared as a jail, now a field for farmersPAIC general manager (Projects) Japinder Bajwa, however, said that the state government had not been at fault because the penalty was based on plot occupancy. Bajwa said a cut was made by the Centre in third tranche of the grant as there was less than 25 per cent of the plot occupancy in the park at that time.Grants are released conditionally. To receive fourth grant, a minimum of 75 per cent plots should have been sold, said Bajwa, adding that state government cannot do much in that scenario and it depended entirely on market players coming forward to buy plots.Opinion | Govt must promote crop diversification by setting MSP for other crops as wellThe plot occupancy in the Ludhiana park remains around 33 per cent, despite the fact that any industrialist setting up a unit can get loan from NABARD. There is another incentive  the industry is offered 35 per cent subsidy, maximum upto Rs 5 crore, on plant and machinery.Bajwa, meanwhile, added that we are coming up with a state-of-the-art food testing laboratory, which would have certification from National Accreditation Board (NABL).The third and latest of the three projects in Punjab, Sukhjit Mega Food Park and Infra Limited (SMFPIL), was inaugurated by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in November last year, after Harsimrat quit the Union Cabinet.The 107.83-crore project is spread over 55 acres in Kapurathalas Rehana Jattan village. The land has been taken on a 30-year lease by the promoter. The Centre has so far released a grant of Rs 38.76 crore.The mega food park, among other operations, is aimed at encouraging cultivation of maize in the region, which had been a traditional maize growing belt before the crop pattern tilted towards wheat-paddy cycle.We are moving towards stabilization phase, said SMFPIL CMD Bhavdeep Sardana. We have set up a maize-based anchor unit at a cost of over Rs 100 crore. The central and Punjab governments have encouraged us to create facilities to give an alternate option to the farmers, other than paddy. The park will cater to traditional maize growing belt. The idea is to create industrial demand, said Sardana, elaborating that products lines in the park would include starches, sweeteners, starch derivates which go into food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, textiles, papers and poultry and cattle feed.Sardana, however, said that due to Covid-19 pandemic, and a policy clause, both big and small investors, respectively, were not coming forward to set up the units in the park.He added that while big investors had postponed their investment activities, the smaller ones were not going for getting plots as they are not allowed to mortgage the leased land to get loans.Due to Covid, Sardana said, there were delays in commissioning of the machinery imported from China for the anchor plant as zoom meetings were the only way where technical assistance was being sought to commission the machinery.He added that once we reach full capacity, we would be able to process 600 tonnes maize a day and more than 2 lakh tonnes per annum.Marketing of maize will be no longer a problem for farmers. They can sell in vicinity. Not only maize, they can also sell vegetables like carrot, peas, cauliflower etc if the local entrepreneurs join hands to set up such units in the park, said Sardana.Noted agri-economist and Chancellor of Central University of Punjab at Bathinda, Sardara Singh Johl said, I do not see any crop diversification happening in Punjab. Until and unless there is assurance of equal marketing and income as is the case with wheat and paddy, there are no chances of crop diversification.Johl added that while designing such mega food projects, the viability has to be seen. He added that comprehensive scheme should be in place, demand for the alternate crops should be created and businessmen and industrialists should be taken on board.Harsimrat was not available for comments despite repeated attempts."

Busting the myth are several Hyderabadis including celebs such as actor Samantha Akkineni and entrepreneur Upasana Kamineni Konidela who have taken up making their own compost and fertilisersOrganic farming is not a new trend. People in villages across the country have been practising it for years. Its the city folks like us who live in the concrete jungle who have forgotten the traditional ways of growing plants. Many say that its just not feasible to grow plants using organic methods as it requires a lot of space and is a time-consuming process.Busting the myth are several Hyderabadis who have taken their hobby of gardening one step further by not just growing plants, but also making their own compost and fertilisers. One such hobbyist with a green thumb is 64-year-old Rajyalaxmi, who started gardening around 28 years ago, after shifting to their newly-built independent house, which is little over 200 sq yards. Today, the Miyapur resident, along with her 39-year-old daughter Jyothi have succeeded in building a thriving garden in their front yard as well as a full-fledged rooftop vegetable garden.Ten years ago, the mother-daughter duo decided that it was time to get back to basics and stopped buying fertilisers and pesticides.We realised that using chemical-based fertilisers is neither good for the plants nor for those consuming the produce, says Jyothi, who quit her MNC job a couple months ago to start her own consultancy.Today, smartphones have changed the way we access information using the internet and there are a plethora of videos available on every subject on YouTube. But it was not the case couple of years ago. We started collecting newspaper articles and watching TV programmes on organic farming, and then began converting the waste generated at home into compost.While the Maddalis have come a long way and have mastered several techniques of preparing compost, theres another mother-daughter duo, who started their journey recently and are learning the art of compost making through trial and error. Tanuja Kondapalli, 35, and her mother, K Jyothi, 55, began their journey four years ago by raising four flowering plants at the balcony of their apartment in Kukatpally. Today, they have several plants on their roof-top and have inspired a couple of other families also to follow take the green route.Tanuja, who worked at the IIIT-H campus earlier, says she did not have much idea about gardening, but her mother who grew up in Nalgonda, always had a green thumb. Her grandparents had an independent house, where they used to grow various vegetables and also had several fruit bearing trees.My mom started gardening after my father passed away, it was like therapy for her. Two years ago, we thought why not set up a roof-top garden and began getting more and more plants, seeds, soil, fertiliser and pesticides. But everything was so expensive. Then, we started looking for places which would provide quality product at a reasonable price. We found a nursery, 30 km away from our place at Hayathnagar, on the city outskirts. But, going there every time was a task in itself, she adds.Instead of going to the nursery, she took the online route and started sifting through YouTube videos looking for a solution. Tanuja, who lives in a joint family, says they generate a lot of kitchen waste every day, which she has started converting into highly nutritious fertiliser. She is happy and her plants are glowing.Buoyed by their successes at home, both Jyothi and Tanuja, recently started their individual Facebook pages where they share tips on gardening and composting.

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack. We have come up with this authentic blend straight from our kitchen for this snack, he informs.They have six fruit roll-ups and fried onion flakes as well."

And butter","After a harrowing year, in 2021, restaurant openings look forward with optimism, featuring menus that pay tribute to the pastSandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratoryWe tear apart buttery croissants, luxuriating in sunshine and nostalgia. Sandys cheery new Besant Nagar cafe is a rose-tinted tribute to the past with its old school sandwiches, milkshakes and dcor. A bitter-sweet reminder of our pre-COVID lives.Originally planned as the first of a new line of cafs called Sandys Toasteries, the Besant Nagar space evolved through the many challenges of 2020, and finally opened recently under the familiar flagship brand instead. Now, this is a relaunch of the Sandys brand, says Sandesh Reddy, the founder, adding, We wanted to break away from what we have been doing for the past 12 years. To reinvent ourselves.In times of tumult, such as this, people crave familiarity, leaning on food that reminds them of simpler days. So, not surprisingly, Sandesh has chosen to stick with his core strength, continuing to offer uncomplicated comfort food, with a focus on popular flavours. However, proving that this is a grown up version of his first menu more than a decade ago, the plates are cleverly engineered, harnessing a global array of techniques, recipes and ingredients and influences to create deceptively simple meals. Like the steak sandwich, featuring buttery meat set between thick slices of grilled Texan toast, smeared with mustard and aioli. Or the light, breaded onion rings, steamy inside and crisp outside, topped with microgreens. Or a bowl of hummus, drizzled with olive oil and studded with sturdy chunks of falafel.Desserts are indulgent. The tiny shake shake comprises a thick chocolate shake, topped with a hunk of cake balanced on top of the glass. Of course, theres one for Instagram: Milo tiramisu, designed like a pull up dessert. Im more excited about the fact that there are cortados and Aussie lattes on the menu though: till the vaccine arrives at least we can circle the world on a cloud of caffeine.Sandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratory is at 5, 4th Main Road, Besant Nagar.The Butterfly EffectNever underestimate a sandwich. They can be wonderful things, as any midnight snacker can attest. At newly-launched Butterfly Effect on Cenotaph Road, popular Kiwi chef Willi Wilson, who was formerly executive Chef at The Park Chennai, has created a line of inventive gourmet sandwiches.The space, launched by architect Junaid Ahmed, is chic and inviting, flooded with natural light. Over a plate of smoky chicken wings, freshly fried and finished with a clingy hot and sweet sauce, Willi says the menu, built around continental and Italian favourites, focuses on food that is sustainable, quick, tasty, fresh.Of course continental food in India has come a long way from the 90s, thanks to Chefs like Willi, moving from stodgy carbs smothered in white sauce and processed cheese to bright inventive takes on classics.For the sandwiches, diners can choose between white bread, wholewheat, baguettes, ciabatta and focaccia. And while fillings include the obligatory roasted chicken, tuna-mayo and vegetable club with cheese, the cafe also offers more unusual sandwiches, including curried apple, set in creamy mayonnaise, chunky with almonds and raisins; chicken quesadilla with oozing cheese and grilled Caprese pesto with mozzarella.Watch out for the just-introduced Asian menu, featuring hawker classics like a spicy Indonesian Naso Goreng, served with egg and chicken wings. Or Willis cheeky Daddy Wus chicken, a tribute to sweet and spicy pop-Chinese food. And, a steamy bowl of creamy cajun spiced butter prawns spooned over warm rice.Restaurants are still struggling with the fallout of the pandemic, fighting hard to retain staff, follow rules of physical distancing, keep customers safe and  though all this  keep updating menus to stay relevant in a competitive market. But, despite the setbacks of 2020, the cheery burst of new openings, as well as encouraging return of diners, signal a new beginning. And what better way to do it than with comfort food that pays tribute to the past.The Butterfly Effect Caf, is at 22 Chamiers Road, Nandanam.This weekly column tracks the citys shifting culinary landscape.

And not just any kind of saag, but a dish of mustard leaves. Winter, as we know in the north, is the time for sarson ka saag  that creamy dish that so delightfully complements makkey ki roti  or rotis prepared with maize.I studied the menus of the little eateries in and around my neighbourhood to see if anyone was known for its saag and roti. Turned out there was one, Baa Bistro, which had the dish on the menu, along with a Rajasthani thhali. I am fond of Rajasthani food, and gattey ki sabzi  a spicy dish of lentil cakes in gravy  is a particular favourite. So I licked my chops and got ready to place my order.Life is full of little disappointments: It was a rainy night, the delivery agents had called it a day, and I was told that I was not going to get my saag and roti. But, quite like a good hound, once I am on the trail of something, I dont give up easily. I went back to my research, and zeroed in on an old favourite: a small restaurant called SinglaSweets which had fed me little hillocks of bedmi sabzi in kinder times. Singla had sarson ka saag and makkey ki roti, and was delivering (Ph: 9697828888, 011-22232323).The food arrived. And it was so good that I called the owner of the shop to find out about the fare. The trick in the greens was that it was simply cooked  it had neither onions, nor garlic or ginger. It merely had a tempering of ghee and whole red chillies. The roti, again, was surprisingly soft. It was not soaked in ghee, but was nicely moist.I dipped a piece into the saag and popped it into my mouth, and went back to my village, where this was a regular part of our winter fare. I grew up on various kinds of rotis, prepared with millet, maize and gram. There were all kinds of greens too: mustard, fenugreek, and bathua, to name just a few. In the village, of course, a dollop of white butter went on top of the rotis, while the saag was topped with large quantities of ghee. Bliss.Wed also ordered a plate of malai kofta, and that was a rich concoction of cashew, cream, and paneer. But the saag was what the doctor had ordered (without the ghee of course).It rained the next day again, and the heart called out for more saag and roti. I rang up Baa Bistro (9911214567, 9930983076), and found it open.I ordered the saag-roti combo, and the Rajasthani thhali for lunch. The saag was spicy but tasty, and the rotis were thick and firm, the way most makkey ki rotis are. I enjoyed the Rajasthani dishes  especially the hot gattey and the equally spicy mangori-papad ki sabzi. There was a gulab jamun, too, which we shared.On a cold winters day, saag and roti warm up the heart. And a hot and squishy gulab jamun is like the icing  or rather the warm syrup  on top.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Cauliflower, for instance, is selling at Rs 3.50 per kg at the weekly markets and mandis and tomato for as low as Rs 10 per kg.This is because many Haryana farmers are selling their produce directly in the Gurgaon mandis instead of the main market at Delhis Ghazipur. Since several roads are blocked in the national capital, it has been difficult for them to reach Ghazipur, from where their produce is routed to states like UP, Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan. But with truck movement severely disrupted because of the blockades  the UP Gate protest site is, in fact, right next to the Ghazipur mandi  farmers are opting to sell their produce in Gurgaon and cut their losses.In fact, prices of almost all vegetables have come down by 50 to 75% in the past 20 days. Apart from the local vegetable markets, veggies on aggregator apps and in stores inside condominiums have also been selling at a low price.According to farmers, apart from the blocked roads, the absence of a cold storage facility in Gurgaon is forcing them to sell their produce at a lower rate as they are unable to preserve the veggies. Usually farmers from Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Nuh, Jhajjar and other nearby districts of Haryana sell their produce at the Ghazipur mandi. However the blockade of arterial roads has meant that sales of fruits and vegetables have shrunk close to 50% at the capitals wholesale market for over a month now.Sellers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are unable to visit the Ghazipur mandi, which has started to hurt their business. Vegetable sales are 50% less than a month ago, said Anil Yadav, a member of the Azadpur mandi, and wholesaler at the Khandsa mandi in Gurgaon. The detour has increased the transport freight and shortage of trucks has also affected our business. Transportation of onions, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic to north Indian states has come down substantially due to the unavailability of trucks.Rajinder Kumar, a wholesaler, said vegetables are being literally dumped at the Gurgaon mandi. Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring districts were transported to Delhi. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in the mandis there, farmers are dumping the same in the wholesale market in Gurgaon. The current climatic conditions are favourable for vegetables and thus a large number of farmers in the adjoining district have been bringing huge quantities of vegetables to the local markets.The rates of onions and potatoes have also seen a dip, being sold at Rs 25 per kg and Rs 15 per kg, respectively, on Wednesday. The price of radish and carrot is Rs 10 per kg, while peas and pumpkin are being sold for Rs 25.Hemant Kumar, another wholesaler, said he has witnessed this sharp slump in vegetable prices for the first time. Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed. The oversupply in the market is only leading to drop in prices as buyers are less, he said.At present, only 6,000 trucks are moving in and out of Delhi. Earlier this number used to be around a lakh. Not only vegetables, but prices of all essential goods have been impacted, said Rajinder Kapoor, president of Delhi Goods Transport Association.Meanwhile, consumers are a delighted lot. This is the first time that I got five different veggies for less than Rs 40 a kg. I am surprised that I am able to purchase vegetables for such a low price in an expensive city like Gurgaon, said Megha Chawla, a Sector 56 resident."

However, the other members would go ahead with their task and meet for the first time on January 19. Meanwhile, the both the farmers unions and the government would hold the ninth round of talks on Friday.Here are the top 10 developments of the day:1. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) national president Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself from the four-member committee appointed by the Supreme Court to resolve the deadlock between farmers and the centre over the new agri-marketing laws. Mann's announcement came on a day when his organisation's Punjab unit decided to disassociate itself from him. Farmer unions and opposition parties too had raised doubts over the composition of the panel, insisting that its members have been in favour of the three laws in the past. Mann said he is thankful to the apex court for nominating him to the panel but would give up any position to prevent farmers' interests from being compromised. As a farmer myself and a union leader , in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions amongst the farm unions and the public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers of the country, he said in a statement. I am recusing myself from the committee and I will always stand with my farmers and Punjab, said Mann who was also an ex-MP. The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana.2. Protesting farmer leaders welcomed BKU president Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision to recuse himself from a Supreme Court-appointed committee, and reiterated that they do not want any panel and will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three contentious laws. They said the other three members of the committee should follow suit as the agitating unions had never demanded formation of any committee to resolve the impasse between farmers and the centre over the new agri laws. Some leaders also invited Mann to join the agitation against the legislation.3. The government's ninth round of negotiations with protesting farmer unions will take place as scheduled on Friday and the centre is hopeful of positive discussions, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said. ""The government is ready to hold talks with farmers' leaders with an open mind,"" Tomar told reporters. Clearing the confusion over the fate of the ninth round of talks, which was the only outcome in the last meeting on January 8, in the wake of the Supreme Court on January 11 appointing a four-member panel to resolve the impasse and a key member of the proposed committee subsequently recusing himself, Tomar said the talks between the government and the union representatives will take place as scheduled for 12 pm on January 15.4. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said the protesting farmer unions will attend the scheduled ninth round of talks with the government and asserted it is necessary to continue the dialogue to resolve the deadlock and end the agitation. Tikait also said the protesting unions will attend the meeting with union ministers on Friday. Asked if unions have any hope from the Friday meeting, Tikait said: ""Let's see what happens tomorrow. But, our meetings will continue with the government till our protest ends as it is necessary We will not oppose the meetings with the government,"" the BKU leader said when asked whether the Friday talks could be the last one if there is no solution.5. The Supreme Court-appointed panel on farm laws is likely to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus in the national capital, one of its members Anil Ghanwat said and asserted the committee will have no ""ego or prestige issue"" if it has to go to farmers' protest sites to talk to them. The panel members were scheduled to have a virtual interaction earlier in the day to discuss its future course of action, but it could not take place after ex-MP and farmer leader Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself from the committee. The existing members can hold their virtual interaction on Friday now, Ghanwat said, while asserting that he will not leave the committee unless asked by the apex court and he does not expect any other member to recuse.6. ""Truly independent"" persons should have been appointed on the committee formed by the Supreme Court to resolve the impasse over new farm laws, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has said. Speaking to reporters, Pawar, a former Union agriculture minister, said the agitating farmers do not have faith in the panel as these members were said to have supported the new farm laws of the centre in the past. ""Hence, the farmers don't think anything will come out of discussions with the committee. And I agree with them. It would have been better if independent - in a true sense independent - persons had been appointed,"" he said.7. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at the centre over the contentious new farm laws, alleging that the government was ""conspiring to destroy"" the farmers and assured that his party will stand with them. Speaking to reporters in Madurai, the Lok Sabha MP also accused the BJP-led NDA government at the centre of trying to benefit ""two or three of their friends"" on the matter. ""The government is not just neglecting them (farmers), the government is conspiring to destroy them. There is a difference. Neglecting is ignoring they are not ignoring them,"" he said in response to a query. ""They are trying to destroy them, because they want to benefit two or three of their friends. They want to give what belongs to the farmer to two or three of their friends,"" he alleged. ""They want to take the land of the farmer, produce of the farmer and they want to give it to their friends,"" Gandhi alleged. ""You are suppressing the farmers, helping a handful of businesses,"" he said. Extending his party's support to the farmers, Gandhi said the laws will indeed be repealed.8. The Punjab cabinet asserted that nothing short of a repeal of the centre's three new farm laws would break the deadlock between the Union government and protesting farmers in the matter. It also said that the Congress-led Punjab government would take all measures to protect the interests of the state and farmers. The central government is out of touch with the ground realities, chief minister Amarinder Singh said at a meeting of the state cabinet. The council of ministers also demanded that the centre make minimum support price (MSP) a statutory right of farmers, who had been ""getting extremely low prices for their produce"" for the past several days despite being responsible for feeding the nation. The state cabinet also observed a two-minute silence in the memory of farmers who have died during the agitation against the farm laws. An estimated 78 farmers have so far lost their lives.9. The Rajasthan Congress will lay siege to the Raj Bhavan in Jaipur on Friday in support of the farmers' agitation against the centre's new farm laws. The leaders and workers of the state unit of the party will observe Friday as Kisan Adhikar Diwas and gherao the Raj Bhavan from 11 am to 2 pm in support of the farmers' resentment also against the anti-farmer attitude of the Modi government, the Congress said in a statement. All India Congress Committee general secretary and Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra and chief minister Ashok Gehlot will also be present during the gherao of the Raj Bhavan, it added.10. The Trinamool Congress has claimed that the new agriculture laws will leave small and marginal farmers at the mercy of big corporates and demanded that the legislation should be immediately repealed. Prices of vegetables such as potatoes and onions have skyrocketed as these have been taken off the essential commodities list, the party's Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said, adding that the concept of MSP has been totally bypassed. The way the centre passed the farm laws shows that the Union government is anti-farmer and anti-people, she told reporters in Kolkata. ""Farmers will now be forced to sell their produce to big corporates at prices dictated by the firms. In case of a crop failure, however, these companies are not bound to buy the produce from the agriculturists,"" the MP said."

On Wednesday, the vegetable was sold at Rs 58-60 a kg in major markets like Maniktala .Onions are transported to Bengal in bulk from Nasik in Maharashtra and Bellary in Karnataka. In 2019, the vegetable touched the record price Rs 150 a kg.Asked the reason behind such rise in price, Bhola Das, an onion seller at Lake Market, said, It is not very clear to us. The supply has become a bit erratic. The wholesale rate has been very inconsistent and rising. Today a 40- kg onion bag is being sold at Rs1,800-1,900. Only four days ago it was Rs 1,400-1,500. Moreover, the quantity of damaged or rotten onions is higher in every bag.There was untimely rain in the western part of the country, where onions are produced. The rain led to the rotting of crops. There were issues over loading and unloading. A large number of farmers also joined the anti-farm law agitation in Delhi. All these had a collective impact on the supply of onions to our state, said Chandan Chakraborty, working president of Onion Merchant Association at Posta.Keeping in mind the erratic supply, the onion price is unlikely to dip before the end of February when the new onion crop of Bengal will hit the market.The price rise is all due to the gap between demand and supply, said Taraknath Trivedi, general secretary of West Bengal Federation Traders Organization (FTO).Chandan Chakraborty also hinted at nefarious nexus at some major unloading points in Dhulagarh, Posta, Sealdah and Shyambazar, where some people dictated the price to maximise their profit."

I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum. They indeed are. Yummilicious, Id say.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Chacko studied Master of Business Administration (MBA), but his love for organic farming steered him towards a career in agriculture.A native of Muhamma in Alappuzha, the 31-year-old quit his job as a plantation company manager in 2019 to follow his inner desire to become a farmer. More than a year later, he is now busy growing 22 varieties of vegetables and fruits on 36 acres of leased land at Kanjikuzhy and Muhamma.Mr. Chacko says that he wanted to practise agriculture after completing MBA in 2013, but lacked the courage to tell his parents about the wish. I joined a real-estate firm in Ernakulam and continued there for three years. In 2016, I left the job to start a buffalo farm project in association with a reputed business house in Kottayam. However, we were forced to postpone our project after the Central government came up with a new cattle slaughter rule. The firm, which has stakes in rubber and tea plantations, offered me a managerial post. I always wanted to manage my own farm and finally, I decided to follow my inner calling in December 2019, he says.After quitting the job, he carried out organic vegetable cultivation on an experimental basis on 12 acres last year with the support of his wife and other family members. Finding success in the initial efforts, he later expanded the farm project. His cherished agriculture journey is, however, not without hurdles. Up to 80% of seedlings he planted at the turn of 2021 got destroyed in heavy downpour. Over the past couple of days, he put up a show of grit and determination to replant everything.Mr. Chacko says that he has invested all his life savings in agriculture and that he could not be discouraged in the face of adversities. These are things that we have no control over. The rain has caused severe damage and I suffered losses. With replanting now completed, the farm is now running full-fledged. The only pain is that the harvest will be delayed, which will, in turn, prevent the second round of cultivation before the monsoon rains, he says, adding that he will further expand farming to 100 acres in the near future.The young farmer says his experience in business administration will come handy in marketing the farm produce. He is growing spinach, long beans, brinjal, pumpkin, potato, bitter gourd, okra, onion, shallot, sesame, green gram, cucumber, watermelon and so on in his farm. Besides, he is rearing buffalo and fish."

But all this and more is not known to all farmers and even lesser known to consumers. So to ensure that farmers and consumers benefit, more such fairs should be held in all zillas, Shankar said at the National Horticulture Fair 2021.Though guavas are a very healthy fruit for diabetics and other patients, since many also have dental issues, they do not eat it. But here at the horticulture fair, there is a new variety in which the seeds are very tender, he said.Shankar said not just availability of horticultural crops, but even their production should be eased for all farmers. All measures will also be taken to ensure that hybrid varieties are easily available in the market, he said.He said he would ask the government to include subsidy for seed procurement even for horticultural crops in the Budget so that more farmers benefit and also ensure availability of solar panels and solar vending machines.The horticulture fair, which kick-started on February 8, is on till February 12.Due to the pandemic, for the first time, farmers are not just physically participating in the fair, organised by ICAR- IIHR, but are also virtually attending it.

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The price of onions has spiked in Delhi owing to supply being less than usual from various states, including Maharashtra . Many onion producing states have reported damage to crops due to unseasonal rain towards the end of 2020.Currently, the staple is retailing between Rs 40 and Rs 60 per kg across the capital, while the wholesale rate is between Rs 10 and Rs 40. The prices of other vegetables are normal, most of which are supplied from Haryana.Traders say there has been a 50% decline in the stock of onions arriving at Azadpur Mandi, from where the vegetable is supplied to retail markets across Delhi-NCR. Normally, 50-60 trucks of onions used to come every day, but the number has dropped to 30-35 now.However, the traders said the stir by farmers at Singhu , Ghazipur and Tikri borders had not affected supply because trucks were using the peripheral expressway and entering the city through Gurugram. Some drivers were also using village roads to arrive at Azadpur Mandi.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, said, The rain in December last year damaged onion seedlings in the nurseries. The farmers had to prepare the seedlings again, which caused a delay in production.By the end of February, supply of onions from Sikar district in Rajasthan and Ujjain, Bhopal, Narsinghgarh and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh will start, which will lead to reduction in prices, added Mishra.Ram Avtar Singh, a retailer at Laxmi Nagar, said the price of onions was between Rs 25 and Rs 35 throughout January, but started to increase at the beginning of February. We are buying onions at Rs 30-40 from the wholesale market and selling at Rs 40-50, he added.Onion prices will remain high only for around 15 days and will start coming down by the last week of February. The supply from Maharashtra has been hit because the seedlings got damaged. Within the next 15 days, the wholesale and retail prices of onions will reduce, said Rajinder Sharma, an onion and potato trader.Another trader said the price would have risen further had the supply from Gujarat also been hit. The supply of onions from Gujarat is by and large normal, so that has helped cover up some shortage from Maharashtra, he added."

The venue and dates of the fest will be declared soon. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has held meetings for assigning roles of agriculture, horticulture, culture, tourism departments, Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi Municipal Corporation and Varanasi Development Authority. We will rope in hotels, restaurants, chefs and housewives.District horticulture officer Sandeep Kumar Gupta said, Tomato and onion are two vegetable that witness massive price fluctuation. When the prices start rising, there is massive hue and cry. But, mostly the price of tomato doesnt rise and farmers are compelled to sell it for Rs 3-Rs 10 per kg. Risk for tomato growers is also high as it is perishable and cant be stored for long.As per rough estimates, tomato is cultivated in over 5,000 hectare in Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Naugarh belt of Chandauli, Ghazipur and Varanasi, and on an average 350 quintal of hybrid tomato is produced per hectare, said Gupta.It is a good move of the government and will help increase local and industrial consumption of tomato which will ensure good price round the year, he added.The fest will help farmers understand the requirements of hospitality and industrial sectors and the varieties of tomatoes best suited for them.Gaurav Garg, the chief executive officer of the event management company assigned this fest, said, It will be a good event. Housewives and master chefs will be participating and cooking their own dishes, while hotels, restaurants and vendors will also showcase their tomato-based food, drink and dessert items. The event will focus on attracting agro industries. There will also be fun and entertainment as renowned musical bands will perform at the fest."

Similarly, retailers who were selling onions at 35-40 per kg have increased the rate to 50-55 per kg.There had been unseasonal rainfall in October and November last year which damaged the crops in large numbers. The onions now in the market are from old stocks as most of the new crops have been destroyed in the rains, Ashok Walunj, director of the onion-potato market, APMC, said.Because of the less production, traders are not able to export the produce. The government has lifted the ban on the export, but we do not have enough stock. The losses we are incurring are huge this year, a wholesale trader from the APMC market said.Usually during this time around 125-150 trucks of onions are expected to arrive in the market every day, but the number has gone down to 75 trucks, Mr. Walunj said. The produce is coming from some parts of Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar, he said.It is expected that the prices might further increase by 5 per kg in the coming days. Once the summer season kicks in, the prices may be stable. But it will become worse in the rainy season, Mr. Walunj added.Retailers said that people who usually bought onions in quantities had also cut down on the purchase due to the rise in the prices."

Rural inflation eased last month to 3.23%, while urban inflation stood at 5.1%.The moderation in consumer prices was driven by a broad-based softening in food inflation, with the Consumer Food Price Index rising just 1.89% in January, appreciably slower than Decembers 3.4% pace.However, core inflation, excluding food and fuel prices, was estimated to be at about 5.7% and hovering close to the same level as in December. Economists foresee a resurgence in overall inflation from February as the benefit of a favourable base effect wears off.The sequential momentum in core inflation has risen, following the highest ever WPI-core momentum reading in December, rising mobility indicators and falling COVID-19 cases, said Sreejith Balasubramanian, economist at IDFC AMC.Going forward, the base effect which helped recent lower prints, will wane in February and March and the magnitude of disinflation in vegetables would also most likely ease, while the price movement in pulses and vegetable oils needs to be watched closely, he added.The National Statistical Offices release on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for December provided some cheer as it revealed a recovery in output following a 2.1% decline in November and was stronger than the 0.4% growth seen in December 2019. The rebound was led by a 5.1% jump in electricity production, which rose for the fourth month in a row, and a 1.6% increase in manufacturing output.The NSO also revised upwards the industrial output number for September, to growth of 1% from an earlier estimate of 0.5%.There is some comfort in both the IIP growth number and CPI inflation for December and January, respectively, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings, terming the 1% industrial output growth a gentle surprise from its forecast of 0.1% growth.Our forecast of 0.1% was against the backdrop of negative growth in the core industries, but the situation has been buffered by an impressive performance of consumer goods  both durable and non-durable  with the base effect providing an upward bias, he said, adding that increases in electronics, auto and capital goods output had also helped.The December data once again reinforced the view that the uptick witnessed in September and October was due to a combination of festive and pent up demand and the recovery was still fragile, opined Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings. However, the positive aspect of the December 2020 factory output is that it has now crossed the pre-COVID level, that is the level of output witnessed in February 2020, he added.Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said that food inflation had helped soften retail inflation, but many of the non-food categories had recorded a quickening in inflation in January.Food prices have displayed a mixed trend so far in February 2021. The rise in onion prices, as well as higher crude oil prices and their transmission into retail fuel prices are areas of concern that need to be monitored. With inflation expected to resume an uptrend in February-March 2021, we do not think Januarys inflation numbers create room for an imminent rate cut, she said."

Chinnathambi. Hungry visitors come here from across the city for his dosa.Crossing into a quiet part of the locality, away from the busy Woraiyur Market, one can see steam evaporating from a hot pan. Here is Chinnathambis shop, which opened five years ago. It sells small dosas for 2 each so as to serve the poor. If idly podi is sprinkled on it, it costs 3 each. If it is made like an uttapam, dressed with onions and carrots, it is priced at 4. Small plastic stools are lined up in front of the shop, which is open from 7 p.m. till midnight.Mr. Chinnathambi had worked as a cook at a hotel nearby until five years ago. The hotel owner himself helped him set up the shop. We made a conscious decision to serve dinner. While lunch is available at pushcarts across the city, a good dinner is difficult to come by. One must not sleep on an empty stomach, he says.We manage to carry on the business since our family is involved in it; we do not do it for the profit. There are people who come with just 10 and eat three dosas and an omelette. There have been many nights when I have gone to sleep hungry, and I do not wish it upon my worst enemies, he says.Mr. Chinnathambi wakes up at 4 a.m. to soak rice and urad dal for the batter. The rice and the dal soak until 11 a.m. when it is ground. The batter is left to ferment until we are ready to open the shop, he says.In the meantime, Mr. Chinnathambi and his wife prepare coconut and kara chutney, two varieties of kurma and sambhar. His two daughters, one in Class 12 and the other in Class 10, help them. We grind 9 kg of rice every night. There have been nights when we have run out of batter and have had to buy it from nearby stores, he says.On average, over 100 customers have dinner at Mr. Chinnathambis shop every day. He makes 600 to 800 dosas a day. Among his customers are people who work through the day at the Woraiyur market and many youth. The youngsters have watched YouTube videos on my shop and come to try it out, he says. Kids living in the locality, too, rush to the shop to eat one or two dosas.They tell me that they get dinner for the price of a chocolate, he laughs."

2021-02-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rahul-at-tractor-rally-modi-gave-3-options-hunger-unemployment-and-suicide-7187660/,"Rahul at tractor rally: Modi gave 3 options – hunger, unemployment and suicide","Three days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Parliament that the Centres three farm laws merely provide an option to farmers, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that those options are hunger, unemployment and suicide.On February 10, PM Modi had said in Lok Sabha: What deterioration has occurred in any facilities (the) farmers have been enjoying? This is just another option. They are not binding Why are you opposing another option? These laws will not ban any existing mandis nor will they discontinue the MSP. We are just modernising the mandis.Addressing a Kisan Tractor Rally from a flatbed tractor in Ajmer, Gandhi said, Narendra Modi says I am giving you options. Yes he has given three options: first is hunger, second is unemployment and the third option is suicide.On the final day of his two-day visit to Rajasthan, Gandhi reached the venue at Roopangarh in Ajmer driving a tractor, flanked by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra. At both Ajmer and Nagaur, Gandhi reiterated his claims regarding farm laws.Read | Was and will be with our annadata, says Rahul Gandhi, jibes at BJPs acche dinNarendra Modi wants that this entire (agriculture) business goes into the hands of his two friends  thats the aim of these laws. But Indias farmers are saying that they will die but not ever let this happen, he said in Ajmer, accompanied by CM Gehlot, Dotasra, partys state in-charge Ajay Maken and former Deputy CM Sachin Pilot on the flatbed.And its not just a farmer who is speaking. Behind him, there is a labourer, and with him theres a small businessman. If these laws of Narendra Modi are implemented, its not just farmers wholl suffer lossesI am saying it with guarantee, and Im not just telling farmers, but small and medium businesses, labourers, and youths, hear me. When these laws are implemented, no Indian youth will get employment, he said.Gandhi asked the people to pay heed to his claims, saying that he had warned of the consequences of the pandemic too.Opionion | In Rajya Sabha, Congress listens; in Lok Sabha, it rants. India will decide which worksIn February last year, I had said that the nation will suffer immense losses. My friends in the media made fun of me, but then in their own homes, their family members became unwell. On demonetisation, I had said that this is theft from the poor  money was taken from your pocket and kept into the pockets of top two-three industrialists. For GST I had said that it is a way to kill small and middle sized businesses and steal from them, that it (the law) is to take their business from them and hand it to the top two-three industrialists of India.And now I am saying that with these three laws, the biggest business is being snatched from 40 per cent of the people of India. And the country will suffer. Hence it is not just the responsibility of farmers, but of every labourer, every youth, small businessman, and of entire India. Brothers and sisters, this business of agriculture is not just of one industrialist, it is the business of Bharat Mata.At his second rally at Makrana in Nagaur, Gandhi said that it is unlike other businesses.Look at the automobiles (industry); it is run by Mahindra, by Tata  one, two persons control the entire business, the Congress leader said, and pointed to airlines and banks to say that four-five people who control them get the entire benefit. But agriculture business is such that no single person controls it. It is perhaps the only business which is controlled by 40 per cent people of India.On his request in Lok Sabha seeking two minutes of silence for 200 martyred farmers, he said Saturday that the Speaker told me to request it in writing, and so I would like to tell you that I will give it in writing, that both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha should observe two-minute silence for the martyred farmers. At a rally on Friday, he had termed it shameful that not a single BJP MP, not a single minister, stood for even half a minute."

While a kilogram of drumstick at Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC) costs Rs 120, curry leaves was sold at Rs 60 a kg. Traders attributed the unprecedented increase to a drop in arrivals to the market.V R Soundararajan, a former member of the market management committee of KWMC and a wholesale trader, said unseasonal rain damaged crops, resulting in short supply and price rise. Harvest and ,in turn, arrivals to Chennai, have reduced. I havent seen such high prices sustain in the wholesale market in the past. Wholesale cost of curry leaves has never exceeded Rs 30 per kilogram, he said.Curry leaves, which cost Rs 80/kg last week, will be sold for Rs 60 this week. The Rs 20 drop was due to a dip in sales, Soundararajan said. Koyambedu market sources curry leaves from Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district and parts of Andhra Pradesh.Cost of drumstick too has reduced by Rs 20 and will cost Rs 120 a kg this week. The market currently gets only 100 tonnes of drumstick a day, 50% of the daily average of 200 tonnes of drumstick supplied usually. The highest the vegetable cost all of last year was Rs 60/kg and at times, dropped to Rs 15/kg. Its cost is likely to stabilise in April, when fresh yield is expected to hit the market, he added.On the other hand, costs of other vegetables barring shallots continue to remain stable. Shallots cost Rs 80/kg this week, Rs 20 more than last week. While staples potato and tomato are expected to cost Rs 20-Rs 25, grade I onions will cost Rs 40/kg."
2021-02-16,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rain-forecast-a-wet-blanket-for-rabi-crops/articleshow/80939386.cms,Maha: Rain forecast a wet blanket for rabi crops,"PUNE: The light to moderate rainfall expected over a few places in Vidarbha , Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada , over the next few days has worried farmers , who are yet to harvest a bulk of their rabi standing crops such as wheat, gram, maize, jowar, vegetables such as onions and fruit crops.The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) has forecast light to moderate rain at a few places with isolated thunderstorm, lightning, hail in Vidarbha on Tuesday and Wednesday and Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada on Wednesday and Thursday.Yogesh Thorat, the managing director of Maha FPC, a consortium of 300 farmer producer companies (FPCs) in Maharashtra, said, Around 60 to 70% of rabi crop such as wheat in parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha is yet to be harvested. What is harvested is also still lying on the fields. Similarly, standing sorghum crop in Marathwada is in the matured stage and is yet to be harvested in some places. A rain spell could cause quality deterioration issues in these crops.Thorat said already onion productivity was expected to reduce in the onion belt in Maharashtra because of the above normal winter temperatures.Vijay Thube, the director of Shashwat Krishi Vikas India, a farmers producer company in Pune district, said, Rain in January this year had already damaged many crops, and the impending spell was expected to do further damage. Most of the crops such as gram, wheat, millets are still in the fields. Even light rains are detrimental at this juncture because it is necessary wheat and other rabi crops are not exposed to moisture during the current stage, otherwise they could rot overtime.Shankar Dumre, a Junnar-based farmer owning 5-acre farm land, said, Almost 70 to 80% crop of pomegranate, maize, onion, grapes, wheat is yet to be harvested from my field. With lightning, rain and hail forecast, we expect strong winds, which can adversely affect standing crops."

2021-02-17,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2021/feb/17/gaga-over-golgappas-2264941.html,Gaga over golgappas,"Hriday Ranjan ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: The unorganised sector of maids, hawkers and daily wage workers was among the worst hit during the pandemic. But forgotten among them is the plight of street food vendors  a field that is highly dependent on crowds and their curiosity. Not enough is written about Indias unique street food culture. Indian street food is a microcosm of food cultures and histories, served in tasty, affordable portions. Idlis from south India, parathas from up north, momos from the north-east and tandoori representing Indias Mughal history. While having street food, youre essentially surfing through Indias wide array of food cultures.Its not hard to pick my favourite Indian street food variety. There are jalebis  sinfully syrupy circles of joy served hot. Or the ubiquitous chaat  unique to every place and its ingredients. But my greater weakness, the street food I would want to have on my deathbed  is the pani puri.Its hard not to pick the pani puri. It is customisable  potato, chanaa, grams, and anything else that the public demands. Unlike other delicacies, there is no time to stand and savour the flavours. By the time the juices are flowing down your throat, theres another one waiting to rush into your mouth. There is no civilised way to have pani puri  no spoons, forks, or chopsticks. The only way is by using ones opposable thumb  the one hack that made us intelligent primates.I make it a point to have pani puri in every city or town I visit. Whether it is the sweet and spicy chutneys served with boondi in Mumbai. Or Kolkata, where the mish-mash of art and culture is represented by mashed potatoes. Or in Bangalore, where carrots and onions are provided irrespective of inflation. I have had pani puri stuffed with potatoes, chanaa, grams and sprouts. I have had chutneys made of mint, tamarind, rasam, and even vodka! The pani puri is street food in the truest sense  it is handmade, served by hand, and can only be eaten using ones hands.The pandemic wreaked havoc for street food vendors. Since they operate on a small scale, daily working capital is crucial to their operations. Operating mostly from stalls, they do not qualify to sell their food through online food-delivery apps. When health, hygiene and immunity came under scrutiny, street food vendors had no option but to wind up shop and stare at a bleak future. Since most vendors are migrants from north India, the pani puri stalls near my house vanished after March 2020.So, imagine my joy when I found my friendly neighbourhood pani puri seller back at his spot. A once bustling space was now deserted. When I walked up to him, I could see familiarity mixed with relief on his face. He was wearing gloves, and the entire stall was sanitised. As he mixed his ingredients, he looked over at me tentatively, perhaps worried that he didnt live up to my imaginary standards of hygiene. The frills  onion, carrots, groundnuts  had all suffered from cost-cutting. I had my share of pani puri and just as I reached into my pocket, he pointed to a scanner in front of him. I took out my phone and transferred twenty rupees to his account.But as I was about to leave, he handed me the dry, extra pani-puri that you always get for free. As it imploded in my mouth and the flavours stormed out in celebration, I walked back home with a satisfied smile. While some things might never be the same for street food hawkers, other things remain exactly the same!"

MetroPlus hops on board for a rideIt makes a dramatic entry. Painted in blue, the train emerges from a backdrop of steam and smoke. Chugging towards me, it whistles before halting at platform Number 1 with a hiss. It is early in the morning, the air is nippy, and I am at Mettupalayam Railway Station, thrilled to ride on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) toy train, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2005. Just across the platform is the NMR museum that celebrates the history of this iconic train (see infobox). The train services were suspended from March 2020 due to the pandemic; and restarted recently, after nearly 10 months.The first-ever trip of the train was on June 15, 1899. After nine years, on October 15, 1908, it got extended till Udhagamandalam, says K Natrajan, founder of Heritage Steam Chariot Trust. The train connects Mettupalayam with Udhagamandalam via Coonoor after passing through Kallar, Adderly, Runnymede, Wellington, Aravankaadu, Ketti and Lovedale stations.Vistas unfoldAs the train starts moving in a slow rhythm, I sit back and enjoy the scenery unfolding outside my window. For the first five kilometres, it chugs along flat plains cutting through banana plantations, arecanut farms, and fields being readied for farming. A peacock shows off its plumage beside the track, unmindful of the steaming train trundling by.The rack and pinion system to climb the steep gradient | Photo Credit: SATHYAMOORTHY MTrain trivia The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is one of three Indian railways which were recognised by UNESCO as outstanding examples of hill railways. The other two are the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway that runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in West Bengal and the KalkaShimla Railway that connects the Rajs summer residency at Shimla with Delhi.Nilgiri Railway Company constructed the railway from 1886 to 1899. In January 1903, it was purchased by the government and construction between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam was completed in 1908.The train has six coaches including the first-class and general class compartments. You have to book your tickets much in advance on the IRCTC website as the train has been running full with 180 passengers.The train starts at 7.10 at Mettupalayam and takes fours hours and 50 minutes to reach Udhagamandalam.Coimbatore is the nearest city to reach Mettupalayam. From Coimbatore, it is just an hour journey in a bus.The Museum at Mettupalayam station is a walk through history of how NMR came into being. A number of old photographs taken during the construction of the railways, visits of personalities and inaugural journeys grace the wall. It houses models of of some of the oldest locomotives and coaches used on the Nilgiri mountain route, and other rare artefacts related to the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) The first loco, made at Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works Winterthur in Zurich in Switzerland, which pulled the NMR on one of its first rides on the Western Ghats in 1899, is on display.Miniatures of narrow gauge, meter gauge and broad gauge railway lines with fish plates, the LHB Coaches( that have been developed in Karpurthala and in use since 2000) designed to use higher operating speed and accomodate more passengers, coaches of Duronto, Jan Shatabdi and Rajdhani trains, Metro trains and Electrical Multiple Units, and the unique rack and pinion system are showcased. The coaches and wagons used to transport coal are also displayed.A vintage ticket machine that is used for punching the ticket and assigning a serial number can be found inside the hall. Other exhibits include old weighing machines, paraffin gas lamps and Berkefeld Filter, rious models of signalling lamps used by Indian Railways as it went through an evolution, Morse code machine and Magneto Telephone.You can also see a five-tonne manually operated crane manufactured at Bradford that was used to move defence materials by train from Mettupalayam to WellingtonAt Kallar, the first station on the route, the rack and pinion system engages and the train begins its ascent through bridges and dark, winding tunnels taking you physically along the stunning views at every single twist and turn.The railway between Mettupalayam and Coonoor was constructed using alternate biting teeth technology in rack and pinion arrangement between the rails. The rack and pinion is a striking engineering feature. It is designed to climb the steepest gradient of 1 in 12 feet, making it the second steepest climb in the world. The rack and pinion extends up to 19 kilometres which is the longest in the world, explains Natrajan.Powered by steamAt Adderly, engineers refill the water tanks and I notice that the locomotive bears the name of Nilgiri flycatcher, an endemic bird that can be seen only in the Nilgiris. As the train is powered by steam locomotives between Mettupalayam and Coonoor, it halts at regular intervals, to refill water, says S Prasanna, Station Master. It uses 4,000 litres of water every five kilometres.Workers, who conduct regular maintenance checks for the engine, tell me that the train crosses 250 bridges and passes through 16 tunnels. Each time we enter or emerge from a tunnel, passengers on board cheer loudly. When an Indian gaur shows up, striking a pose amidst the greenery, there are collective sighs all around.The signature whistling, steam and the rustic wooden coaches with long windows take me back in time to the iconic film Sadma featuring Kamal Haasan and Sridevi, where the train features in songs and key scenes.Stunning viewsThe stretch from Mettupalayam to Coonoor  the first 27 kilometres of the total 46  trundles through deep valleys, thick forests with dense greenery, and by leafy walls covered in yellow, red, and orange wild flowers that are so close, you can reach out and pluck them. As we near Runnymede, neatly trimmed green patches of tea plantations with towering silver oak trees take over. The place is so green, it tempts each of us to step down and soak up the view. A railing has been erected to mark the forest boundary and down below a stream gurgles. There are garden chairs for passengers to sit and stare. Natrajan points out that Mahatma Gandhis ashes were immersed in the nearby wild stream, at the sangamam point of two rivers along the Runnymede.At Coonoor, over sweet masala chai, onion samosas and paruppu vada, we bid goodbye to the oil-furnace-powered steam locomotive. It is detached and replaced by a diesel engine for the last leg of the journey from Coonoor to Udhagamandalam. Onward it goes through tea plantations, and the blue-green expanse of the Ooty lake. The air is cooler than before, and a whiff of eucalyptus hangs light."

Aju Mohan cannot stop gushing ever since his humorous take on the scene from Malayalam classic Manichitrathazhu has gone viral. The animators 18-second video, Gangeeeeeeee!! (Tribute to Manichitrathazhu) has clocked over one lakh views (and counting) on his Instagram page, @gebonions.In what he calls a tribute to Manichitrathazhu, Aju has given a comic twist to the scene where actor Shobana dances to the song Oru Murai Vanthu Parthaya, interchanging between her characters, Ganga, and Nagavalli, the dancer. As she dances, Aju plants the twist in the tale. The floor gives away and she falls down! Thats when you hear Gangeee, the famous dialogue in the movie by Nakulan (played by Suresh Gopi), which brings back Ganga from her possessed state.When I posted it on my Instagram page on Tuesday night (February 16), I was a bit apprehensive about how people were going to take it. But it was overwhelming to read all the comments the next day. It was like a dream, Aju writes to us over an email from Montreal, Canada, where he is working with a VFX company, Framestore.Aju Mohan | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAju says that the idea just popped up one day. Lucky, I guess! I was 11 when I saw this movie and it scared me a lot. Even now certain scenes give me the creeps. So I thought, how do I turn a horror scene into a comedy. The best way to do it was by slapstick, says the 38-year-old, a native of Thiruvananthapuram. So, according to him, what might have happened to Ganga after the fall? I believe she is cured with that fall and woke up as herself with a very sore back!It took Aju nearly a month to finish the video. The work was done in Blender, a free open source software. I am a character animator and I am not proficient in Blender. So I had to refer to a lot of YouTube tutorials to make it work. Since I had to do everything myself and I am not an expert in departments such as lighting, modelling, texturing, cloth simulation (giving a realistic touch to a characters outfits) etc...

And noting the founders gastronomic 'experiments' with Indian cuisine, it was named after scientist Madam Curie.We decided to try their delectables, and called for a home delivery. We were first impressed by their sustainable packaging - glass jars, earthenware and birchwood cutlery. And then we dug in, starting with the signature Madam Curry Paneer Tikka.Round paneer chunks marinated in soft flavours went well with masala onion and green chutney. As a hair stuck on the chutney jar was an instant mood spoiler, we sampled the complementary chutney that came in a test tube.Next appetiser: Tandoori Soya Chops with Nut Fudge and Burani Cream. Wrapped in the nut fudge made from almonds, pistachios, cashew nuts, and whipped garlic flavour cream, the smoky chops will transport you to another world for the rich flavour.For the mains, we ordered Adraki Gobhi in Peshawari Masala, Madam Dal Makhni, and Mutton Biryani. Cooked in a robust 22-ingredient masala with bell pepper and tomato-based gravy, the gobhi was spicy and will be specially relished by the Punjabis. The dal was creamy with the required amount of spices. The Mutton Biryani tasted fine but was a dampener for having smaller-thanusual chunks of meat-andbones.However, the unconventional Jalapeno and Cheese Paratha and the Hari Mirch Paratha, complemented the dal and sabzi quite well. Creamy, sugary and milky Shahi Tukda Cigars made using bread, khoya and dry fruits were a unique twist, presentationwise, to the classic shahi tukda.

In the past one month, the cost of perishable items has increased. According to traders, the hike in prices cannot be solely attributed to the fluctuating fuel prices. A gap in demand and supply of many items has also added to it.The price of shallots varies based on its quality. The cost of tomatoes has doubled. Earlier, it was around C22 per kg and now the price has crossed C40, said Biju Kumar., who runs a vegetable stall at Palayam market.Mukundesh, another trader at a vegetable shop near Sasthamangalam, said that the supply of many items has come down. The impact of the fuel price hike on essential commodities can be measured only based on the availability of vegetables. Currently, crops are scarce. However, there will be a slight rise in the base value of the commodities, said Mukundesh.Sajila J, a resident, said, The pandemic has wrecked lives and the soaring prices have added to it. Normally, I buy vegetable kits worth Rs 100 which would be sufficient for four days but now the quantity is less.Confra Consumer Forum general secretary M Sashidharan Nair said that lack of market interventions by government agencies is one of the reasons for the uncontrolled price rise. When onion prices were hiked, the government made them available at a subsidised rate. Similar efforts should be taken now, he said.What officials sayHorticorp deputy director(Marketing) Rejatha V said that the department will intervene if onion prices go up. There is a hike in the price of shallots but in Kerala, the consumption of shallots is very less. If onion prices rise, we will intervene.

As Ramesh peels carrots, cauliflower, potatoes and onions with quick strokes, leaving those watching awed, he says that he has been selling his peeler called fata fat that he claims he invented 20 years ago. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, sales have dwindled but he hopes to do brisk business at the protest site.Theatrical notesA few feet away is Sonu who shows theatrics to make passers-by stop and take note of his innovative squeezer that can be used to make juice out of citrus fruits without having to cut them or leave a mess on the table.

2021-02-20,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2021/feb/20/planting-good-health-2266463.html,Planting good health,"Deepika Rathod ByFibre is important for the body to improve one's metabolism, reduce weight or to maintain good gut health. But what is fibre and how much fibre is required by our body? Dietary fibers are found naturally in the plants (fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds) that we eat. They are parts of a plant that do not break down in our stomachs, and instead pass through our digestive system undigested.All dietary fibers are either soluble or insoluble and both of them are equally important for health, digestion, and preventing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, diverticulitis, and constipation. Soluble fibers absorb water and form a gel in our stomach, which slows down digestion.It delays the emptying of your stomach and makes you feel full, this may also help one in controlling weight. It also delays your gastric or stomach emptying which may affect blood sugar levels and have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity, which may help control diabetes.These soluble fibres if taken daily may also help lower LDL (bad) blood cholesterol by interfering with the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Soluble fibre is found in oats, beans, dates, pear, berries, flax seeds, nuts, lentils, apples, oranges, oat bran, strawberries, dried peas, blueberries, psyllium, cucumbers, celery and carrots. These foods also work well in controlling chronic diarrhoea.Insoluble fibres are considered gut-healthy fibre because they have a laxative effect and add bulk to the diet as well as motion, thus helping prevent constipation. Unlike soluble fibre, insoluble fibers do not dissolve in water, so they pass through the gastrointestinal tract relatively intact, and speed up the passage of food and waste through your gut.Insoluble fibres are found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. But be sure to also increase your liquids o minimise any gastrointestinal discomfort. While probiotics adds good bacteria into our digestive system, prebiotics act as a fertiliser for the good bacteria. Probiotics help our good bacteria to grow by improving the good-to-bad bacteria ratio.Prebiotic fibre is found in many fruits and vegetables, such as the skin of apples, bananas, pineapple, onions and garlic, gluten-free oat groats and flaxseeds.We have to consume around 25-30gms of fibre every day to make sure we work on improving our gut health. But make sure when you are increasing your fibre intake that you increase your water intake as well, to flush it out well from the body.(The writer is a clinical nutritionist with a focus on healthy lifestyle choices)"

Concerns have been expressed over the fate of the late kharif and rabi onion crop in Nashik, which are expected to arrive in the markets in the next few weeks.Hail and thunderstorms lashed various parts of the state, including the districts of Buldhana, Jalna, Nanded, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Sangli. Of the 58.74 lakh hectares of rabi acreage in the state, 20,000 hectare have sustained damage. Wheat and bajra crop, especially, have sustained extensive damage. Similarly, market-ready onion plots have reported damage. The final work of ascertaining damage is still going on.The vineyards in Nashik have not reported much damage, which has come as a relief to grape growers. Currently, the export of grapes has reached its peak ,with India reporting export of around 45,000 tonnes of grapes since the season started in January.Vilas Shinde, CMD of Nashik-based Sahyadri Farmers Producers Company, ruled out any significant damage to the market-ready crop.Jagannath Khapre, president of Grape Exporters Association, said there have been no reports of extensive damage to the standing crop.Thanks to better soil moisture, farmers in Maharashtra have also increased their rabi acreage. Crops like maize and bengal gram have seen increased acreage in the state.Maharashtra has reported a bumper crop of chana, with farmers cultivating it over 25.3 lakh hectares as against 22.83 lakh hectares last year.

Indians rediscover desi fruits,"Chef Dhruv Oberoi has come up with recipes like an amla and strawberry salad and Nilgiri passionfruit cocktail. Photo credit: Dhruv OberoiAmla and strawberry salad , shankalu chaat , guava baked into immunity-boosting pizza bases, tadgola ceviche... Indians are rediscovering local, seasonal fruit like never before, with everyone from top chefs to home chefs and caterers using it in inventive ways.For years, fruit lovers had decried the loss in local varieties as restaurants and homes embraced imported apples, oranges, kiwi et al that were available round the year. Seasonality and local diversity, two cornerstones of Indian farm produce seemed to be getting lost in the process. But post-pandemic, foreign fruit does not command as much a snob value as local desi varieties.At Delhi restaurant Indian Accent, for instance, the flavour of the season seems to be red ber or jujube along with shankalu, a tuber long popular in Bihar and Bengal as the poor mans fruit (since its taste may remind one of a pear), where it is also called mishri kand. Both these ingredients are now going into a new inventive chaat menu by Chef Manish Mehrotra, who recalls eating the tuber and berries bought from the roadside in Patna, where he grew up.In Mumbai, chef Prateek Sadhu of Masque restaurant is experimenting with apricots in his lab, after a visit to Ladakh familiarised him with chulli (the local name for the fruit) which is sundried to preserve it in winter, and reconstituted by boiling in water to create a naturally sweet dessert eaten with ice-cream!Chef Dhruv Oberoi of Olive Bar and Kitchen Delhi says theyve been getting great supplies of seasonal fruit from a number of farms directly which prompted him to come up with some unusual recipes. I have been testing a lot of fruit diversity. Some of the dishes that we have come up with include a shehtoot (mulberry) sauce to go with pork roast and amla (gooseberry) and strawberry salad that is doing really well with guests, says Oberoi, who ferments the amla to enhance its taste.Some of this gravitating towards more local fruit may be a result of greater health consciousness among diners in the wake of the pandemic. Last year, when the pandemic started, people were really seeking things like amla as immunity boosters. Though that phase is over now, perhaps people have learnt to include better quality fresh fruit in their diets in general, says Sneh Yadav of Tijara Farms, whose recent produce of small desi guava and figs sold out in record time. Since we are no longer operating our organic farmers market, we have been supplying these to customers directly, as also products that we make in the farm kitchen like grape panna, Yadav adds.What the pandemic did was also give time to people working from home to go back to the tastes of their childhood. Ankita Chavan, a young chef with The Bombay Canteen , who went back home to Vadodara has been experimenting with dishes such as tadgola (woodapple) ceviche. Now, Chavan and a colleague have teamed up to start their own catering venture where they will travel to different cities for small events.Home cooks, meanwhile, have been unearthing traditional recipes with fruit and posting these on social media, contributing to even more awareness and interest. You may find Bengali classics like Kheer Komola with oranges, an Assamese home-style dish with star fruit and prawns, Aamer luchis (maida puris with mango) and even hyper-local pop dishes such as fruit juice ki subzi, popular apparently in Bhiwani, Haryana. Abhilasha Jain, a Marwari home cook who runs a catering outfit from Gurgaon, has been cooking the latter and describes it as a mix of orange and pomegranate juice with tomatoes, onions and paneer! Whatever your preference, classic or inventive, it is definitely a fruitful time."

Today we are going to discuss a similar rare disease that wasnt common earlier known as Polycythemia. It is a rare blood disorder that causes your body to overproduce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.This disease mostly occurs in men after 40. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells fight infection and platelets are involved in clotting the blood to stop or slow down the bleeding which indirectly helps in the healing of wounds. When too many RBC, WBC platelets circulate in our bodies, blood starts thickening and may not flow properly through the blood vessels.This increases the risk of blood clots in major arteries and veins of our body, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. If clots occur in the entire body, then they can affect other vital organs. Smaller blood vessels can be blocked by clots which may lead to headaches, vision changes, light-headedness, numbness, burning, redness and swelling.While no special diet exists to aid the treatment of polycythemia, it is recommended that you eat a well-balanced meal and limit your intake of sodium. Increased blood volume increases your risk of high blood pressure. Limiting your sodium intake can help you better manage your blood pressure and you can avoid processed foods such as bacon, meat, sausage, frozen meals, salty chips and soup to control the same. Instead, include more fresh, home food with pink salt. Here are few tips to be healthy:Eat antioxidant-rich foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables to add fibre to your body which ultimately will help in controlling blood pressure.Avoid refined foods, such as white processed sugar, bread and junk food to control inflammation as they may contain high-fat content and increase chances of blood thickening.Avoid red meat and choose lean meats like chicken, cold-water fish, pulses and beans, nuts and seeds for protein. Protein repairs the cells in our bodies.Use healthy cold-pressed coconut oil, sesame, mustard or groundnut oil or A2 ghee for cooking, which helps in controlling inflammation.Try to eliminate trans-fatty acids from your routine, found in commercially baked goods such as cookies, crackers, cakes, French fries, onion rings, doughnuts, processed foods and margarine. They can make your blood flow sluggish and can increase the chances of blood clots.Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco as they can keep the inflammation levels high and will not help the body to heal.Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day to make sure the body gets detoxified and it doesnt allow the thickening of blood.These practices can be followed daily to keep a check on your blood.DEEPIKA RATHODChief Nutrition Officer, Luke Coutinho Holistic Healing Systems.

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal."
2021-03-03,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/mar/03/turning-to-turnip-for-therapeutic-treats-2271252.html,Turning to turnip for therapeutic treats,"Roshne Balasubramanian ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: A few weeks back, Canadian cabinetmaker Damien Allard became the proud owner of three massive, recordbreaking creamy white and purple topped turnips all of which broke the Guinness record for the worlds heaviest turnip (weighing 22.9 kg, 24.4 kg and 29 kg).While we are sure that the Quebec resident has quite a lot of cooking to do with the colossal root vegetables, lets trace how the lesser-known (now record-worthy) cousin of potato, broccoli and Brussel sprouts provides plenty of nutrients while being low in calories.The turnip and its leafy greens are not only tasty but also nutritious. However, we seldom find people here adding it as a staple in their meals, notes Dhanalakshmi R, dietician, Rainbow Childrens Hospital, talking about the underground veggie variant.Gut healthAvailable at stores in the local markets and priced anything between Rs 25-Rs 30 (per 500 g), turnips are packed with fibrous goodness and can help in aiding weight loss and relieving intestinal problems. A cup of raw turnip has about 2.75 g of dietary fibre in it.This helps reduce pressure and inflammation in the colon, explains the medical practitioner, adding that the presence of high dietary fibres can also enable making bowel movements easier. The gut function is important in getting rid of toxins through bile and stool and the properties in turnips aids in maintaining a healthy digestive tract, she says.Aids in weight lossWith a high water content and low-calorie count, the consumption of the non-starchy vegetable makes people fuller for a longer period, aiding in weight loss. A 100 g of turnip has only 1.39 g of carbohydrates. So, it can be consumed by all and especially those who are on a journey to manage their weight, she says.Reduces blood pressureAccording to a study in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, foods containing (read turnips) high dietary nitrates were projected to benefit the health of the blood vessels. Rich in potassium (about 300 mg), it helps in lowering the bodys blood pressure by releasing sodium from the body. This helps the arteries dilate, she shares.For a long time, a healthy intake of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage and our star of the day, turnip, have been associated with a lower risk of cancer. Dhanalakshmi supports this link. The presence of a sulphur-rich compound called sulforaphane, a phytochemical can neutralise toxins. This plays an integral part in promoting anti-cancer activities in the body, she explains.Studies of a kind of indole in turnips, arvelxin, also suggest that it blocks pro-inflammatory compounds such as nitric oxide, aiding in reducing inflammation caused by diseases including arthritis, cancer, and high blood pressure.Immunity boosterBesides its wide profile of benefits, the vegetable is also rich in vitamin C, which is important for building and maintaining collagen, the component which provides structure to the skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of turnips can benefit the immune system and reduce hair loss prompted by iron deficiency.It can be added twice or thrice in a week in a meal, she shares. With a crispy, white inner flesh and a fresh, zesty flavour, turnips can be boiled or mashed, shredded or chopped, used as a salad garnish or added to stews and soups.NUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP GREENS (PER 100 G)Calories: 40 KcalsProtein: 3.12 gCarbohydrates: 6.16 g Fat: 0.35 g, Fibre: 2.76 gPotassium: 300 mgNUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP ROOT (PER 100 G)Calories: 21 KcalsProtein: 1.58 gFat: 0.35 gFibre: 2.75 gCarbohydrates: 1.39 gWater content: 93.1 %Vitamin C: 64.7 mgRECIPETURNIP GREEN CURRYINGREDIENTSAny dal: 2 tbspGreen chilli: 3-4Onion: 1 (chopped)Tomato: 1 (chopped)Garlic cloves: 6-7 piecesTamarind pieceTurnips (root and greens):As required (chopped)Salt: To tasteTurmeric: 1 tspOil: 1 tbspMustard, cumin, Asafoetida: As requiredMETHODPick a dal of your choice, and add two tablespoons of it into a pressure cooker and soak it in water.Add green chillies, chopped onions, tomato, garlic cloves, tamarind piece and the chopped turnip rootand greens.Add turmeric and salt to taste.

Co-editor with Shilpa Shah for books by the TAPI Collection, author Tulsi Vatsal writes in Paeonies and Pagodas that the tripartite trade between India and China involving tea, cotton and opium resulted in large consignments of the commodities.The word Gara comes from the Gujarati word garo  meaning width. Surat emerged as a gara hub and it was so high in demand that the embroidery was sold by weight. Huge sums would be paid for innovative designs which extended to the pallu and all-over designs.The opium crates exported to China were brought back by the Parsi traders filled with exotic Chinese silks for their wives. Emblems from these silks depicting emblems such as the phoenix, fish, roosters and flowers resonated with the Parsis and they immediately adapted these to their wardrobe. Runners and shawls were cut into borders and attached to the sarees.Soon, running borders were locally embroidered specifically for sarees. Motifs were adapted onto lighter silks, chiffon and georgette for a flowy silhouette.The Parsi garas were a sophisticated fashion statement for the wives of successful Parsi professionals who often accompanied their husbands at official functions, and thanks to the East India House that sold fashionable fabric, this oriental embroidery was already a rage in London in the 19th century. Overtime, the symbols from the garas were also adopted into the auspicious, chalk or rangoli, which Parsis designed at their door steps for good luck.After the second World War , the demand for garas decreased. Revived in the present day, the embroidery has made a comeback with modern patterns in pretty blouses, stoles, vests, little purses along with the sarees. Designer Ashdeen Lilaowala, who has researched the art well, has included traditional flora fauna in the contemporary styling.Garas Chinese symbols have Gujarati names such as  Cheena-Cheeni meaning Chinese people and their landscapes replete with Pagodas, Knada-Papeta (onions and potatoes ) for polka dots, Margha marghi, chakla chakli for roosters, hen and sparrows; and karolia for spiders. Often the infamous Chinese bats on the garas were mistaken for butterflies, while the dragons were conspicuous because it was only allowed for the Chinese emperors clothing."

The video has not been publicly released because it's part of an ongoing investigation.The Suburban carried 19 people, and it caught fire for unknown reasons on a nearby interstate after entering the US. All escaped the vehicle and were taken into custody by Border Patrol agents.The Expedition crammed with 25 people continued on, and a tractor-trailer struck it a short time later. Ten of the 13 killed in that crash have been identified as Mexican citizens. The Border Patrol said its agents were not pursuing the vehicle before the wreck.The opening in the fence was about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the crash in the heart of California's Imperial Valley, a major farming region now at the height of a harvest that provides much of the lettuce, onions, broccoli and winter vegetables to US supermarkets.It was made of steel bollards that were built before former President Donald Trump blanketed much of the border with taller barriers that go deeper into the ground. Photos show a panel of eight steel poles was lifted out and left on the ground in the desert next to an old tire and other debris.Human smugglers have proven time and again they have little regard for human life, Bovino said. Those who may be contemplating crossing the border illegally should pause to think of the dangers that all too often end in tragedy, tragedies our Border Patrol Agents and first responders are unfortunately very familiar with.The breach occurred in a busy area for illegal crossings near the Imperial Sand Dunes where migrants often climb over an aging barrier and wait for drivers to pick them up, hoping to avoid the scrutiny of Border Patrol agents at checkpoints on highways leading to Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix.A pandemic-related measure that allows the Border Patrol to expel people without an opportunity to seek asylum potentially leads some to try to evade authorities instead of surrendering, sometimes with fatal consequences. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention introduced expulsion powers nearly a year ago under Trump, and the Biden administration has signalled no plans to lift them anytime soon.The cause of Tuesday's collision wasn't yet known, authorities said. The Expedition is built to hold eight people safely, but smugglers are known to pack people into vehicles in extremely unsafe conditions to maximize their profits.Seats in the SUV had been removed except for those for the driver and front passenger, said Omar Watson, chief of the California Highway Patrol 's border division.The crash happened in an area that became a major route for illegal border crossings in the late 1990s after heightened enforcement in San Diego pushed migrants to more remote areas.Barely a mile from the crash, there is a cemetery with rows of unmarked bricks that is a burial ground for migrants who died crossing the border.In 2001, John Hunter founded Water Station, a volunteer group that leaves jugs of water in giant plastic drums for dehydrated migrants.I was trying to figure out how to stop the deaths, said Hunter, whose brother Duncan strongly advocated for border wall construction as a congressman.Illegal crossings in the area fell sharply in the mid-2000s but the area has remained a draw for migrants and was a priority for wall construction under Trump. His administration's first wall project was in Calexico.When police arrived Tuesday at the crash site about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of San Diego, some passengers were trying to crawl out of the crumpled SUV. Others were wandering around the nearby fields. The big rig's front end was pushed into the SUV's left side and two empty trailers were jackknifed behind it.The men and women in the SUV ranged in age from 15 to 53, and those who survived had injuries that were minor to severe, including fractures and head trauma, officials said. The driver was from Mexicali, Mexico, just across the border, and was among those killed.The 68-year-old driver of the big rig, who is from the nearby California community of El Centro, suffered moderate injuries.The crash occurred around 6:15 am under a clear, sunny sky at an intersection just outside the community of Holtville, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the border. Authorities said the tractor-trailer was heading north on a highway when the SUV pulled in front of it from a road with a stop sign.It's not clear if the SUV ran the stop sign or had stopped before entering the highway. How fast both vehicles were going also wasn't yet known.A 1997 Ford Expedition can carry a maximum payload of 2,000 pounds. If it had 25 people inside, that would easily exceed the payload limit, taxing the brakes and making it tougher to steer the vehicle, said Frank Borris, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation.You're going to have extended stopping distances, delayed reactions to steering inputs and potential overreaction to any type of high-speed lane change, said Borris, who now runs a safety consulting business"

Traders shut shops after Mathadi workers refused to carry sacks weighing over 50 kg.Narendra Patil, former MLC, said traders should follow the governments notification directing farmers to store their produce in 50 kg sacks.Traders had assured us that after March 1 the sacks wont weigh over 50 kg, but they have now sought more time to resolve the issue, Mr. Patil said.Jagandas Kudekar, a farmer from Sangamner, said the markets closure has led to losses of around 40,000. It is only at Vashi APMC that we face this issue. We spend around 85 for each sack and the weight limit will lead to losses. If we earn 50,000, the expenses amount to 12,000.Ashok Walunj, director, onion-potato market, said farmers from within and outside the State bring their produce to the APMC and it is impractical to abide by the weight rule. It is nothing but a conspiracy to shut down the market, he said.Shivaji Ohal, another farmer from Sangamner, said their farms do not have weighing machines and it is not possible to weigh each sack before being loaded on to trucks. When we sell our produce at the local markets we face no such issue, he said."

(File)With the beginning of Rabi harvesting season, major Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yards in Saurashtra are awash with gram (chickpea) and some of them have been forced to regulate arrival of the commodity.As the state is poised to harvest a bumper crop, a price forecast report by the Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU) has advised farmers to sell their gram soon after harvest to government at minimum support price (MSP).Rajkot APMC has been allowing farmers to unload their gram on its yards only twice a week. Farmers are in a hurry to rush their produce to the market to take advantage of good prices at the beginning of the season. Within hours of opening the gate to chana farmers, our yard is recording arrivals of up to 18,000 quintals. Traders functioning out of our yard are unable to handle this quantity on daily basis and, therefore, we are forced to regulate the arrival, said Devraj Sakhiya, chairman of Rajkot APMC.Babulal Tejani, secretary of Rajkot APMC, said that arrivals of coriander, cumin seeds and cotton are also substantial and that is leading to space crises on the yard. Chana farmers are getting around Rs 4,500 per quintal as thanks to government policy, chana prices in domestic market are competitive vis--vis imports. But traders are facing capacity limitations, said Tejani.Read | Against the new farm laws? Not GujaratGondal and Jasdan APMCs are also regulating arrivals. Our yard is proving insufficient as arrivals of coriander, onion, cumin seeds are very big. Therefore, we may have to regulate chana arrivals now, said Pravin Somaiya, secretary of Gondal APMC.The Central government has fixed Rs 5,100 as the MSP of gram for Rabi marketing season 2021-22 which is Rs 300 higher than the previous year. But farmers are selling their crop at slightly lower rates. Farmers are selling in the open market despite realising price slightly lower than MSP as they dont have to bother about the fair average quality norms while selling in open market, Kanaiya Kishori, chairman of Dahod APMC, the biggest pulses market in Central Gujarat, said.The initial market trend is consistent with price forecast report published by Department of Agricultural Economics (DAE) of JAU on Thursday. Prices of gram during March to April, 2021, at harvest, may remain in the range of Rs 850 to Rs 940 per 20 kg (Rs 4,250 to Rs 4,700 per quintal). Hence, farmers are suggested to sell gram upon harvest (at MSP centres in APMCs) without going for storage, the report concludes.The team led by Maganlal Dhandhalia of DAE analysed monthly price data collected from Dahod APMC and the overall market and crop scenario in the country and the state to compile the price forecast report. The report states that gram production in India is estimated to be 116.2 lakh tonnes (lt)  around five per cent higher as compared to 110.8 lt the previous season. In Gujarat, farmers had sown chana in 8.2 lakh hectare (lh), more than double the 4.05 lh acreage the previous year, production is estimated to double than in 2019-2020.As per the JAU report, chana accounts for around 45 per cent of total pulses produced in India and the country imports as well as exports this crop in substantial quantities.India imported 1.86 lh gram in 2018-19 and increased to 3.71 lt in 2019-20 and also exported 1.34 lt, the report notes, adding total pulses production in India in 2020-21 is estimated to be 244.2 lt, slightly higher than 230.3 lt the previous year. But the production this year is marginally higher than the total domestic consumption requirement of 242 lt.Meanwhile, the MSP procurement in the state is set to begin from Monday."

Traders said that there is a sharp increase in the number of onion-laden trucks to the market in the past one week resulting in drop in prices.All the old stocks were cleared and fresh arrivals started pushing the price down, said G. Ibrahim, a wholesaler.He said that the cultivation of onion begins in October every year and harvesting commences in February. Onion harvested during the season is stocked and sold for 10 months during the year, he added. Many traders said that with more arrivals, the price of onion will drop further. Even we can expect the price to drop to 20 a kg, they added.On Friday, small onions were sold between 30 and 60 a kg, while big onion was sold between 20 and 40 a kg at the wholesale market.At Uzhavar Sandhai in Sampath Nagar, the small onion was sold between 50 and 55 a kg while the rice of big onion was sold at 45 a kg."

After my husband, John, fell ill, it is my earning that helped raise my three daughters and son. My husband was a fisherman and we had our own boat and nets. But all that was sold to meet his medical expenses, she says.In a chequered kaili lungi, long blouse and a thorthu thrown over her shoulder, Aleyamma is a picture of resilience. Her weatherbeaten face is wreathed in smiles as she pulls out a smaller aluminium container from the large one she keeps the fish in, turns it over and sits on it to talk about life.Hailing from a fishing community at Vettukadu, Aleyamma recalls her mother walking from the beachside village to the city, 10 kilometres away, every day. Many women in my generation followed in their footsteps. Rain or shine, we had to reach the city and back again. No buses would permit us to travel with our wicker baskets of fish. The day still starts early with Aleyamma making her way to the Vettukadu or Vizhinjam, near Kovalam, to buy the catch of the day. But now, she and two others take an autorickshaw to the city and then walk to the homes of their regular customers. Each of them has a route, and they sell the fish and clean it for the buyer.Earlier, we used to go to the Karamana river at Edapazhanji and have a bath after we were done for the day. Nowadays kind householders permit us to use the washroom on their premises and also store the fish in an icebox. In the evening, we sit by the roadside at Vazhuthacaud to sell the fish. That is when officer-goers stop by. Aleyamma is grateful that she was able to get her children educated and married. Her son and one son-in-law is in West Asia. One grandson studies engineering and another works for a company in Technopark. My children are better off than where we started from. I keep reminding them that they must save for a rainy day.Alankrita Narula, paratha seller, DelhiEvery morning, Alankrita Narula would slip out of her city-girl clothes and into a salwar kameez. She would be up at 6 am, cooking, so she could head out on to the street by 9.30 am to set up her thela (cart), calledBalaji Paranthe, in a market near her apartment building in Delhis Dwarka.After spending 13 years in advertising, Alankrita decided to quit to follow her passion. It is a clich, she says, that rolls off the tongue easier than what it takes on ground  where pushing the cart, standing next to the fire, and working in sun and rain until 5.30 pm is not easy.She began in January 2020, mostly feeding daily wagers, Uber drivers, electricians and plumbers. In the beginning I thought of just serving aaloo ke parathe with dahi and pickle. I priced it at 50. In a couple of days I realised that people want a meal, and that 50 is too much for someone who barely earns 200 a day, she says. She brought her prices down to 20, and introduced a vegetable.Her family was nervous about how she would manage on the road, but Alankrita says she has never faced a security problem. The only problem she has is from people who came by in big cars and who bargain.I do think I am privileged, so sometimes I wonder whether I should be out on the street. For someone else it may not be a choice, and it does make me feel a little guilty to eat into someone elses street food business.Elardini Gautami, vegetable vendor, HyderabadThirty-eight-year-old Elardini Gautami does not know to read or write. However, her determination to educate her daughters drives her to work hard. Her day begins at 6 am when she heads to a vegetable wholesale market with her husband on his two-wheeler. Once she is back, she arranges them in a push cart and off she goes. Elardini says, My husband is a painter. I used to work as a part-time domestic help. The earning wasnt sufficient. Especially after my daughter passed her Class X we realised it would be tough for us to send her to college.Elardini (in yellow saree) selling vegetables to a customer in herI dont want my daughters to end up as domestic help. Pushing the cart around is not easy but then I have to do it to run my home and earn enough to pay my daughters fees.Elardinis elder daughter is in college and the younger one is in Class VIII. Elardini is satisfied that her daughters do well. I send them to a private school and want them to be able to speak in English. She admits that her work is challenging. When my body doesnt allow me to push the cart, I find a convenient and safe spot and sell from there. I cannot drink much water because there are no toilets. It results in headaches and body pain. Making a living from the road is a battle, but I will take it up for my daughters.Raji Muthuraj, bhajji seller, KochiRaji Muthuraj arrives at her pushcart, parked in Vyttila, Kochi, in an autorickshaw. She and her husband Muthuraj have the supplies for the day with them. Loaded in the three-wheeler are a gas cylinder and stove, various containers filled with batter and sliced onions for vada, boiled eggs for bhajji, potato mix for bonda, raw banana and chilli for fritters, and water, oil and milk for tea, besides utensils. They arrive at 3 pm to get ready for rush hour that starts at 4 pm. By the time they get home it is 10 pm.An adjective Raji frequently uses is super  the vada is super, as is the tea and the crisp egg bhajji. Cheerful with a ready smile, Raji is popular among regulars, most of whom have been buying from her for the 10 years they have been at Vyttila. Ever since we started, 20 years ago, I have been constantly by my husbands side  day or night, rain or shine. There is no other way to do this work, she says.She is the heart of the business, which has helped them raise and educate their four children  three girls and a boy; besides getting two of those girls married. She looks after the familys finances deciding on the investments, usually chit funds, big purchases such as the television and payment of EMIs too.The last year has been very tough for us financially, like it has been for everybody else. The first 50 days of lockdown, business came to a standstill. We are behind on the payment of some of our chit fund investments, she says, adding, We bought land [near Vyttila] and built our house without a housing loan, with the money we earned, she says. The money also goes into travelling with family to places such as Tirupati, Madurai or Kaniyakumari. Only two things mattered in the end  the food we ate and the places we saw!With inputs from Sunalini Mathew, Saraswathy Nagarajan, Shilpa Nair Anand and Prabalika M Borah"

The retail cost of veggies in the city is usually 20%-25% more than what they fetch in the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC).The cost of few vegetables such as carrots and shallots, being sold for twice as much as their wholesale cost, are currently burning a hole in consumers pockets.According to market sources, the cost of tomatoes , potatoes and shallots are expected to drop by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilogram, while drumstick rates could plunge by Rs 50/kg as arrivals to the city is increasing.The cost of curry leaves has been in the Rs 50 to Rs 70 price range for a while and a bunch of coriander is available for Rs 1 to Rs 3.S S Muthukumar, president of Koyambedu Semi-Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association, said carrot and drumstick prices have plunged as it is the harvest season of the vegetables. ""Carrot is largely procured from The Nilgiris district and the city receives drumstick from Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Villupuram districts,"" he said. The prices of potato and tomato are expected to fall further, he added. The KWMC has been receiving around 500 trucks of vegetables, a 100 more than November-December last year.On Sunday, 1kg of carrot was sold at Rs 46 in retail shops in Adyar and Rs 64 in Royapettah. While shallots cost Rs 140 in Adyar, it was Rs 120 at Royapettah. Tomatoes and onions were sold at Rs 28 to Rs 30 per kilogram in both the areas."

The duo was brought to Thiruvananthapuram zoo from Nagaland in 2017.Kohima, the Himalayan bear, at Thiruvananthapuram zoo having frozen watermelon pieces | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARWith the mercury levels rising, specific care is given to the residents on the 36-acre Thiruvananthapuram zoo. The daily menu has been tweaked for most of the animals. We include fruits and vegetables that are juicy and fleshy, especially watermelons and salad cucumbers, so that residents are not dehydrated. Both animals and birds relish those, says TV Anilkumar, Superintendent of the zoo.In the 155-plus kilograms of fruits and vegetables purchased daily, there are 25 kilograms of watermelon, nine kilograms of salad cucumber, 20 kilograms of cucumber (vellari) and 25 kilograms of different banana varieties. Salad cucumber is an addition this year because the animals like it more than vellari. We have even cut down the quantity of vellari by five kilograms, adds Sangeetha Mohan, Curator at the zoo.Carnivores reduce their meat intake during the summer months. For instance, tigers normally consume seven kilograms of meat daily. It comes down to five kilograms or so, says Dr Jacob Alexander, Zoo Veterinarian. Over 86 kilograms of meat (beef and chicken) is needed on a day for the carnivorous animals including seven tigers, two lions, six leopards, 10 hyenas, two foxes and four jungle cats.Short takes The diet chart is prescribed by the Central Zoo Authority.There are over 1,200 animals belonging to 105 species at the zoo. While primates and carnivores are fed only in the morning, rest of the animals have a meal at 11.30 am and 4 pm. Carnivores fast on Mondays, a regular holiday for the zoo.Water birds, otters, gharials and turtles eat fish. Ducks and swans have rice, amaranthus, green gram and cucumber. Peacocks and pheasants eat green chillies, coriander leaves, green gram, cooked rice and big onions.Among the flightless birds, rheas prefer cabbage, carrot, poultry feed, amaranthus and rice. While ostriches have amaranthus mixed with dog food, bananas and vegetables, emus are given carrot and bananas.Rhinos have cattle feed, cucumber, carrot, long beans, onion, grass, fodder and mineral mix.Monkeys now get more fruits, especially oranges and grapes, besides their daily meal of boiled eggs (they love egg whites!), guava, apple, bananas, coconut, papayas, groundnut (husked and de-husked), tomatoes, pineapple and long beans.Bath timeElaborate arrangements are also in place to keep the animals hydrated throughout the day. Sprinklers and fans have been installed inside the enclosures of rheas and nilgais or blue bulls. We operate the sprinklers at noon and they happily soak in the water to cool off. Or they move towards the fans to get relief. Sprinklers also ensure that there is enough green vegetation in the enclosures, adds Anilkumar.Meanwhile tigers, leopards and lions have the luxury of showers and concrete water pools within their cages. They love to rest in the water. Water is let out to the enclosures of Barasingha (swamp deer) and sambar deer so that they can create their own swampy environment with puddles, adds Dr Jacob. The regular diet for deer and other herbivores is a concentrated ration with cattle feed, Bengal gram sprouts, cotton seed and green gram, salt and mineral mix, besides grass and fodder. Mineral block and salt licks are always kept in the enclosures.Parrots feeding on fruits and vegetables at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARBirds get to eat more leafy greens these days, especially green amaranthus, which they have with rice. Garlic used to be an ingredient in their diet. But we dropped it ever since they showed an aversion to its taste, Sangeetha says.Special care is being given to three ostriches, two males and female. A few years ago an ostrich had died of heat stroke. It is the courting season for the ostrich and already seven eggs have been been laid.Water kept in clay pot for green vine snake to cool off at the reptile house at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARIn the reptile house, water is kept in clay pots for snakes to coil up against when temperature goes up. The three King cobras and two anacondas have the luxury of air-conditioned enclosures. While the anacondas, Dhil and Ruth, are fed a chicken and a rabbit once a week, the cobras feast on rat snakes.While summer is a difficult time for all zoos in the country, the situation is better in Thiruvananthapuram. That is because Kerala doesnt have extreme weather conditions, be it summer or winter. So all we have to do is take measures to bring down the temperature during summer. There are enough ponds for some animals. The staff keeps a tab on the animals even at night and refill the water basins, Anilkumar says."
2021-03-23,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mgnrega-water-harvesting-conservation-structures-starting-to-pay-off/article34136368.ece,"MGNREGA: Water harvesting, conservation structures starting to pay off","Workers must be allowed to participate in the actual planning exercises of the Gram Sabha, say beneficiariesBhuban Bag is an MGNREGA worker from Bhuanpada village in Odishas Balangir district, a perennially drought-affected region. The district has one of Indias highest rates of distress migration, with lakhs of workers looking for jobs elsewhere every year.Things have changed in our village because of MGNREGA. We have been creating ponds and tanks to catch water, and digging wells to harvest the recharged water, he said in a webinar organised by the Centre for Science and Environment on the occasion of World Water Day. He held up an onion plant to the camera, showing off the fruits of his newly fertile land. During the pandemic, most of the returning workers found employment in the village itself, he said.Bhuanpada is not an isolated case. Across the country, the water harvesting and conservation structures that now make up 60% of all new MGNREGA assets are starting to pay off, according to CSE.The MGNREGA is not simply a social security scheme to generate employment for the rural poor. It may also be the worlds largest climate change adaptation scheme, said CSE director Sunita Narain.Over the last 15 years, three crore assets related to water-conservation have been created through the rural jobs scheme with the potential to conserve more than 2,800 crore cubic metres of water. On the ground, this has transformed the fate of some villages. However, challenges remain in obtaining timely payment of MGNREGA wages and ensuring village participation in the planning process.Bhuanpadas sarpanch joined Mr. Bag on the screen. The payment for MGNREGA workers still comes very late, he said, adding that distress migration could not be reversed unless timely payment was made.In Palakkad district of Kerala, women workers have managed to revive streams and rivers in the water-scarce village of Pookkottukavu, which gets only 2300 mm of annual rainfall. With hundreds of water harvesting structures being built under the MGNREGA scheme, 200 wells are now planned to make the village water-surplus. Earlier, people had to walk a long distance for drinking water. These projects have helped to reduce their difficulty to a certain extent and give them the hope that in the near future the village will be free of water scarcity. We can see the groundwater levels rising, said Vismaya Sukumaran, who works with MGNREGA.In Vasna village of Gujarats Sabarkantha district, migration has reduced by 40% because of the extensive irrigation system created through small dams constructed under the programme. Earlier, the village was completely rain-dependent, but now the ponds and tanks provide surface water for 10 months of the year. Farming is back as the main occupation, and annual family savings are up to 2 lakh, preventing the need for migration, said Ms. Narain.She emphasised the need for village workers to participate in the actual planning exercises of the Gram Sabha, rather than simply be treated as labour. Villages must also be allowed to take control of their own water security, she said, noting that catchment areas for many villages are on land controlled and owned by the Forest Department. It is important to MGNREGA to measure the sustainability impact, and not just count the number of works created or days of labour provided. The scheme must track and monitor outcomes, measuring the change in groundwater levels and village incomes, said Ms. Narain."

You dash right in, make yourself and your group comfortable while you place the order. The Punjabi Swag, a restaurant at Gachibowli offers ghar da swad with a mouth-watering menu of Punjabi, North Indian, and Tandoori dishes. During the time of the ongoing pandemic what makes a visit to this eatery worthwhile is the social distancing, the staff in masks and the use of disposable containers in which the different food items are served.The best part is that you can fold your feet comfortably on the soft gadda as your relish the morsels. We loved Dhaba Chicken Tikka cooked in white masala and served with raw onion ringlets. The taste is light and doesnt offer a blast of condiments which makes you relish the taste bit by bit. We recommend Patiala Chicken with Garlic Naan for the main course. The meat chunks are succulent with the right blend of spices. The dish that won our hearts is Dal Makhani with its velvety texture and slightly smoky yet light taste. And quite surprisingly, what makes the dish taste different from what we sample in other restaurants is that theres no use of butter. Shares Sandeep Singh the co-owner of the restaurant, studied at the Culinary Academy of India, Begumpet, under chef Sudhakar Rao, On purpose, we do not use butter in any of our dishes. Instead, we use desi ghee as we wanted to do something different from others. Thats how all their dishes are prepared with ghee.The recipes are from Punjabi homes. Sometimes we blend the methods to prepare a dish, but dont change the same entirely, adds Sandeep, whos been living in Hyderabad for the past 12 years. The chefs are from Bengal and they are still waiting for the dessert-chef to come back from Calcutta.

Srinivasan is seeking to get re-elected, has returned Congress and CPI(M) candidates several times since it came into being in 1957.Jamal Mohideen of the Congress won the first-ever election here. Only in 1984 did AIADMKs Premkumar win the seat. The DMK registered its first victory in the constituency in 1996, when Manimaran became its MLA.The constituency is compact, in that it comprises 48 wards of the Corporation, nine panchayats and a few villages and its population has a mix of various castes, including Pillaimar, Vanniyar, Naidu and Sourashtra, besides Muslims and Christians. Having a total electorate of 2,75,979, The constituency has not witnessed any tangible development worth mentioning, say its residents. Places like Kodaikanal, Sirumalai and Lord Murugas abode, Palani among others, could have been developed in a big way, they felt.Mr. Srinivasan, who has also served as a Member of Parliament, is a familiar figure. But a section of the electorate felt that he had not done much on the development front. For instance, work on the Balakrishnapuram bridge has been going on for almost seven years. Similarly, work on an underpass on the Palani-Dindigul stretch has been going on for the last six years. The AIADMK government upgraded the Dindigul Municipality into a Corporation but residents are yet to benefit from the move. No one, including the civic officials, have a clue as to when the underground drainage work would be completed in all the wards, a resident said.Many roads have been dug up and motorists have a harrowing experience navigating them. Dindigul, which connects Madurai and Tiruchi with Tiruppur, was once famous for its lock industry. However, over the years, the sector has gone silent. The elected representatives have not taken any initiative to revive it, an entrepreneur said.The city does not have a state-of-the-art bus stand. The existing Kamarajar bus stand is being used, as a result of which the roads are always congested. The promise to set up a park for weavers has not materialised. Similarly, farmers growing onion and garlic do not have any storage facility. There are around 30 to 50 small and medium leather/tannery units. They, too, have not got any support from the government, and are constantly under the scanner of the pollution control board..Even before Gandhi Market could be constructed fully, the AIADMK inaugurated it in a hurried manner. Barely a few hours before the model code of conduct came into force, it was opened. But the market has been functioning outside the premises.Speaking to The Hindu, The Minister said the Cauvery water scheme, which had been initiated by the DMK, was completed by the AIADMK. This is a major achievement. The Kudimaramathu scheme has benefited the district in a big way, and farmers are able to conserve water. . The yield of agricultural produce has increasedacross the district, he added.Most importantly, the effective handling of the pandemic brought the virus under control, he said.Admitting that ongoing development work may be posing difficulties for the residents, , he said they would improve the standard of living in the coming years. Attributing the delay in projects to land acquisition and other factors, He said the Balakrishnapuram flyover would be completed by 2021.The DMK has given the seat to its ally, the CPI(M), which has fielded N. Pandi, a veteran politician who is regarded to be accessible and people-friendly. . Having thorough knowledge of the issues facing Dindigul, He is confident of emerging the victor by a margin of at least 25,000 votes.. The DMK-CPI(M) and their allies are confident of garnering a majority of the votes in Begumpur, which has a large Muslim population. Similarly, the AIADMK is relying on votes of Pillaimars and Vanniyars. AMMK, NTK and MNM candidates are also in the fray.The battle seems to be largely between the two Dravidian alliances, but other players are confident of springing a surprise."

A friends son had got married, and the brides party was coming from Lucknow for a reception in Delhi. Now Lucknow-wallahs, as we know, are fiercely proud of their cuisine and convinced that nothing beats Awadhi food. But we Dilliwallahas have our pride, too. So we were told by the grooms family that we had to ensure the food served at the wedding reception would leave everyone licking their fingers.What does one do in a situation like this but knock at the doors of Kallan Bawarchi, one of the best ustads of Old Delhi. He agreed to take care of the food. Those who have had his korma and biryani still go ecstatic about it. The reception, I am happy to say, had a table that people recalled for years after.Kallan is no more, but his descendants havent forgotten the magic that he wielded with his karchi and degh. They are still cooking delicious Delhi dishes, as I learnt some days ago.I received a message from an outlet called Khansaama last week. They offer different kinds of non-vegetarian delicacies from the walled city, and deliver in Delhi-NCR. The food is cooked by three chefs and Kallan Bawarchis dishes are among the dishes that it offers.The food has all the flavours that Old Delhi is known for. The meat in the korma was tender, and the gravy had the mildly sweet taste of fried onions. I loved the stew  meat cooked with yoghurt and onions, and flavoured with red chillies, green chillies, black pepper, cardamom and ginger. The achari gosht  with its tangy, pickle-like taste  was noteworthy as well, and the nihari was good, too. The gravy had soaked in all the flavours of the meat and spices, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, as I dipped a piece of the sweet khamiri roti in.Mutton seekh kabab at Khansaama in Old DelhiThe seekh kabab, however, needs to be addressed. It was much too dry and rubbery. Seekh kababs can lose their taste if not eaten soon after being taken off the grill. They are best when moist, soft  and hot.Khansaama was started last year, in the midst of the pandemic, and is going strong. The kitchen, one of the owners Sameer Ahmed tells me, is in Pahari Bhojala in Old Delhi (call 9311611317 or 8595831317 for orders). The food is delivered in earthenware handis, which Khansaama tells us can be used later for plants.The rates are reasonable. A meat platter for two (1,399) consists of korma, nihari, stew, biryani, kabab, rotis and dessert. The platter for two with chicken dishes costs 1,050. The Khansaama thhali(499) consists of biryani, korma, nihari, kabab, gulab jamun, a khamiri roti and a roomali roti. You can order a full plate or a half plate: korma and nihari (499/265), biryani (500/285), mutton stew (499/265), chicken achari (380/215). The shahi tukda costs 65.I had a bit of the shahi tukda and went back into time. A community meal now seems like an event from another age.

2021-03-26,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/kong-flody-and-pig-trotter-soup/article34168314.ece,Kong Flody and pig trotter soup,"Pig trotter soup is a popular dish in the local cuisine of Shillong. It scores high both in nutritional value and tasteOne rainy afternoon in Jhargram, Medinipur, I was making my way home from work through runnels of rainwater on a muddy path with paddy fields on either side. I was cursing myself for not carrying an umbrella, and also for choosing this shortcut because it was picturesque. Suddenly, I remembered my days in Shillong where rain could come similarly unannounced, and longed for Kong Flodys pig trotter soup.Before I go any further, let me tell you a little about Kong Flody and pig trotter soup.Kong Flodys name (Kong in Khasi means elder sister) was on most peoples lips in Shillong in the early 1970s on account of her instinctive healing touch. She became a professional therapeutic masseuse almost by accident after she heard a sages prophecy and grew aware of her ability. When my mother had a severe case of frozen shoulder and muscle debilitation that did not respond to modern treatment, our neighbours suggested we call Kong Flody. Not only did she cure my mother over the course of the next six months, she also became a fast friend. Very often on my way back from college I would sight one of her daughters waiting for me at the head of the lane leading down to their house. She would whisper in her excitement, Come quickly, Mother has just taken the pig trotter soup off the fire, or, We saved some doh khlieh (pork brain salad) for you from lunch, come on.Nutritious dishPig trotter soup is a popular dish in the local cuisine of Shillong. It scores high both in nutritional value  it is recommended for pregnant women, children and the elderly  and taste. For that matter, my mother fed us trotter soup when we were children to build strong bones, but most of the time it was lamb trotter soup (tengrir soup in Bengali). It was good enough but from what I remember, it didnt have the same rich taste or flavour as pig trotter soup.Kong Flodys soup, a broth really, which we called suruwa, was cooked on a slow coal fire and left to simmer all day. There was no seasoning save salt, peppercorns and onions. By the time the soup was done, the trotters would have almost melted to the point that they could be chomped into a mash, and the marrow blended with the onion.I sat around the fire with Kong Flodys three daughters in a small, cosy kitchen with a wooden floor while she ladled out the soup in large mugs. Transparent globules of fat floated on the surface of a steaming, thickish broth. She served this with hunks of crusty white bread, which I had, while her daughters preferred to drop red rice into their mugs to be spooned up.You dipped your bread slice into the mug for a moment, lifting it to your mouth just before it threatened to fall into the soup, then sucked it up, followed by a sip from the mug. It was rich and coated your lips as you drank. And you licked your lips off roundly. I remember the three girls and me laughing at each other as we did this while Kong Flodys eyes twinkled and she beamed at us indulgently like a big mother cat.Winter treatThat rainy afternoon in Jhargram I decided to try out Kong Flodys soup. The only trouble was that I had no access to pig trotters. Well, I thought, lamb trotters would have to do. Incidentally, in the early 1980s in Jhargram when I was posted there, meat was unbelievably cheap, even for those times. Chicken and lamb sold for 13 a kilo while khashi (castrated goat) was 25. Trotters cost 25 paise each.There was radhuni pata, or wild celery, growing in patches all over the garden, so I decided to use it. In the absence of radhuni pata you could use celery stalks and leaves. This is my recipe. You could try it on a winters day.SUNDAY RECIPELamb trotter soupIngredients6-8 lamb trotters12-15 cups water2 large onions, sliced roughly1 tbsp pepper corns5 cloves garlicSalt to taste1 handful radhuni pata with stalks or two stalks of celeryMethod1. In a heavy bottomed kadhai or handi set the trotters to boil over medium heat.2. Slice the onions and chop the radhuni pata. Peel the garlic.3. Once the water starts boiling, add the garlic, peppercorns, onions and radhuni pata stalks, leaving the leaves for garnish.4. Cover the pot, reduce the heat and allow the soup to simmer. Stir it once in a while. The longer a soup simmers the better it is. When I cooked this in Jhargram, I let the soup remain on the coal stove all day. In a slow cooker this would take about the same time, say 5-6 hours. The soup should have about 6-7 cups at the end.5. Stir well to mix the soup. Add salt and white pepper. Garnish with radhuni pata or celery leaves.6. Serve with croutons, soup sticks or crusty bread.The writer is the author of the food memoir, Spiced, Smoked, Pickled, Preserved: Recipes and Reminiscences from Indias Eastern Hills."

These could lead to severe pain in the leg, making it difficult to walk. One could even lose a limb if its a severe case of clotting.If found in the arteries, clots can increase the risk of a stroke or a heart attack. Clotting in the veins can cause deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in the veins of the pelvis, leg, arm, liver, intestines or kidneys) or a pulmonary embolus (blood clot in the lungs).Why clots occurChronic InflammationInflammation by itself is not a problem. Whenever we get hurt, the wounded area swells up and becomes red. This happens because our vessels dilate, making the blood rush to heal the area. The blood also starts thickening and forming clots so we don't bleed. This process is supposed to kick in at the right time, do its job and then switch off. The problem arises when inflammation becomes chronic and doesnt switch off'.Uncontrolled blood pressureMost people take high blood pressure casually and its the very thing that should never be taken lightly. The more forcefully blood pumps, the more the arteries stretch to allow the blood flow. If this force is too high, that too for an extended period of time, it creates vascular weakness, making vascular prone to ruptures.It also causes vascular scarring, which can catch debris such as cholesterol, blood cells and plaque. This leads to an increased risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke.Gum diseaseGum disease is closely connected to heart disease and should be treated immediately. These are caused by bacteria that are capable of entering the bloodstream and damage the blood vessels or arteries, finally leading to blood clots inside the arteries.Precautionary MeasuresIt is important to seek medical advice and get the nature of the clot checked. Discuss the possible risks and drug interactions before adding supplementation to your diet or making lifestyle changes.For once, go easy on green leafy vegetables as these are loaded with Vitamin K, which cause factors, which could lead to clotting. This means that it can also affect the efficacy of anticoagulant medications like Warfarin, and promote platelet aggregation.Management through foods and lifestyleOur blood gets its volume through the water content present in it. A lack of hydration can cause blood to thicken.Apple cider vinegar may lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.Garlic and onion help reduce platelets aggregation due to the presence of an active compound called allicin, which is a vasodilator and anticoagulant. Onion on the other hand is rich in flavonoids called quercetin, which helps in dilating blood vessels.Turmeric acts as an antiplatelet medication and reduces bloods tendency to form clots.Deep breathing, especially nasal breathing, works like magic for bringing high blood pressure under control. It immediately puts us in a parasympathetic state, which helps relax the walls of the blood vessels.Note: It is important to keep your health professional in the loop before making amends to your lifestyle. Nothing mentioned above is a replacement for the medication.(The author is a Mumbai-based holistic lifestyle coach Integrative Medicine)"

A Sindhi's quintessential identity is indeed synonymous with this yellow-coloured curry.Bhavnani's aunt Kamla Thakur explains the tedious kadhi-making process in the film from start to finish, with the camera following the rigours. ""Food is something big for us, and so it made sense to weave the story around it. Kadhi is my favourite, and it was my only choice because that is a Sindhis identity,"" says Bhavnani.Sindhi Kadhi is distinctly different from other kadhis. ""It is made from tur daal. We boil it with tomatoes in a cooker, then seave and use the soup, cooking it on slow fire much like a mithai. It is nutritious as we put lots of vegetables in it,"" she says.Chef Sanjeev Kapoor couldn't agree more. ""Sindhi Kadhi is full of flavour. I like the veggies that go into it. Kadhi elsewhere uses curd, but the Sindhi one doesn't,"" he says.Same-same differentWhat sets Sindhi cuisine apart from others is its use of vegetables, spices, and cooking method. ""They use both leafy greens such as spinach, fenugreek, etc, and also other vegetables such as okra, potatoes and drumsticks,"" says Kapoor.Mumbai-based home chef Poonam Shahani, who runs Mamma's Cucina, agrees. ""We use many vegetables that arent common in other cuisines. We also use a technique to allow the food to cook in its juices called teewan, a gravy made of tomatoes, onions and spices."" When made with rice, it is Seyal Teewan; with bread, it is Seyal Dabroti; with roti, it becomes Seyal Mani.Kapoor thinks that Sindhi cooking is an amalgamation. He says, ""They have a unique cooking style and have their favourites when it comes to spices. They like to play with the base of their dishes."" But God is in the details. Chef Satyajit Kotwal of Satyajit's Kitchen elucidates that the most common type of Sindhi cooking is Daag Mein (onion-tomato-based-curry).""It brings out the sweetness of caramelised onions to provide a balanced flavour to the curries. In Seyal, the quantity of onions exceeds that of vegetables that are cooked till translucent. Saye Masale Mein uses coriander leaves, garlic, ginger and green chillies cooked with grated tomatoes and spices; the mix serves as a base in many Sindhi preparations,"" he explains.Another popular Sindhi cooking method is Daas, where whole vegetables are stuffed with a mix of grated onion and Sindhi pesto, and cooked till tender, says Kotwal.Sindhi cuisine has a lot of exciting items too. ""The accompaniments are also imperative. Dishes such as fried potatoes or fried okra, papads, dahi, sweet boondi, etc, are the common ones. Theres an array of sweets, snacks, and bread to choose from,"" says Kapoor.Cooking delightIt was a rather sweet initiation into the home-grown food business for Mumbai-based Uttamchandani siblings - Ritesh, Shirley and Sonia - who made their debut with Sev Mithai or Singharji Mithai and Mohanthaal during the lockdown. ""It was around Riteshs birthday in July last that this idea first cropped up. We were thrilled to bits, so we started it,"" says Shirley.The trio was wary of people's reaction, especially from the traditional Sindhis, but the sweets tickled their taste buds too, besides finding favour among the non-Sindhis. Ritesh attributes it to the ""curiosity factor"".Delhi's Archana Manwani loved to host non-Sindhi friends. ""It was their encouragement that led to this food business. I take orders 24 hours before the delivery. I prepare food with specially sourced ingredients, be it vegetables or spices,"" she says. Giving a rundown of her story, Shahani says, ""Not many people are aware of the range that Sindhi food offers. Also, theres a dearth of places that serve authentic range in Mumbai.""Chipping in, Sonia highlights how most upmarket eating places dont even have Sindhi foods on their menu. ""There's a mention of all but not Sindhi, and that's sad,"" says Sonia, who with Shirley and Ritesh has added many traditional Sindhi foods, and Riteshs special - jaggery Sev Mithai - to the menu.Shahani also got into the business to ""preserve her cultures flavour for those youngsters who are losing touch with their roots"".Manwani is quite keen to promote Sindhi cuisine among Delhiites. ""I approached the Director of Tourism in Delhi for a stall in Dilli Haat. But I havent got any response,"" she rues. Thakur is the go-to person for Bhavnani, be it ""Teevan, Sai Bhaji, Seyal Beeh Patata, and, of course, Kadhi"". Yes, Kadhi, because it is unlike others of its ilk."

(Representational Image)In the wake of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray indicating that a state-wide lockdown could be imminent to deal with rising cases of Covid-19, a section of farmers in the state have opposed such a move, pointing out the financial hardships it will entail. Farmers say they would face severe losses in sale of products such as milk, fruits and vegetables if markets close.While growers of non-perishable commodities like chana, tur and wheat might not face problems with disposal of their produce, a lockdown would result in huge losses to them. Last year, the nationwide lockdown in March had hit farmers hard, with many vegetable and fruit growers forced to throw away market-ready produce.Read | Maharashtra stares at lockdown as Covid-19 cases surgeSantosh Gorde, a grape and onion grower from the village of Takli Vinchur in Niphad taluka of Nashik district, urged the chief minister not to announce any such lockdown till April 15. The grape season is in its last leg and there should be no lockdown for at least the next 15 days. If the markets are closed, we will again be compelled to discard our produce, he said.Last year, Gorde and other grape farmers had sustained huge losses as the lockdown had dried up markets and prices had collapsed to Rs 10-12 per kg. Currently, farmers are selling their produce between Rs 30-60 per kg. Stay updated with the latest Pune news. Follow Express Pune on Twitter here and on Facebook here.

Vilas Shinde, CMD of Nashik-headquartered Sahyadri Farmers Producers Company, said the season has already encountered many issues and a lockdown would add to the losses. We will be operational with all the Covid-10 measures in place we cant afford another year of loss, he said.As talk of lockdown gains ground, traders from other states have stopped coming to Maharashtra to deal with farmers. Sangli-based farmer Ankush Chormule said markets for fruits like watermelon and musk melon have seen fall in sales. The government has not made any alternate market chain ready. What are farmers supposed to do if the existing markets are closed, he asked.Farmer leader and former MP Raju Shetti also spoke out against a lockdown, saying such a move will backfire on the economy. Other than fruits and vegetable growers, farmers who had invested in high-tech farming, like polyhouses or green houses, have also experienced heavy losses.Shetti said he has decided to meet state Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte on Tuesday to discuss the issue."

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Even as the pandemic required us to enjoy with only a handful of known people, Bura na mano Holi hai reverberated through the day on Monday as people splashed each other with gulal and drenched one another with pichkaris of coloured water in shades of blues, yellows, greens and reds.Along with the elaborate colourful gaiety, like all Indian festivals, the focus was on lip-smacking food. Dahi bhalla, bhaang vade, pakoda, flavoured bhang drinks and thandai... from gujiyas to malpuas, the scrumptious variety of delicacies is difficult to say no to. However, just as the after-effects of artificial colours on the skin can be harmful to the body, over-indulgence in sweets and other delicacies can also cause an upset tummy.This means it is a perfect time to detox. Detoxification helps to reduce the toxin base in the body, give the organs rest and help the body rejuvenate, says city-based clinical nutritionist, Deepika Chalasani.Detox the bodyDr Srikanth HS, senior naturopath, Jindal Naturecure Institute shares simple hacks that will go a long way towards boosting the bodys natural detoxification process.Avoid alcoholGet eight hours of sleepKeep yourself hydrated with at least three liters of waterSulphur rich foods such as onions, garlic, and broccoli help counteract the adverse effects of harmful heavy metalsReplace sugary drinks and junk food with healthier alternativesDetox drinksIndulged a little bit more than you should have? Detox drinks are fun, tasty and convenient way to reduce the bodys inflammation and toxin base, says Deepika. She recommends quick drinks that will help.Green juices: Made of moringa leaves/as gourd/cucumber, ginger and lemon/spinach, celery and coconut water with mint/bottle gourd.Anti-inflammatory drinks: Turmeric, ginger, pepper and cinnamon juice with lemon.Smoothies: Mixed greens with parsley and half banana and strawberries; cucumber with carrots, beetroot, ginger and mint with a bunch of grapes.Rejuvenate your hair and skinAll those colours can wreak havoc on your skin making it feel clogged. Hyderabad-based Dr Shuba Dharmana, CEO/Founder, Lejeune Group of Medspas tells us how to detox skin post Holi.Use an oil-based cleanser to cleanse skin using circular upward massaging strokes. Double cleanse with oil and facewash. Avoid oil-based if you have oily skin.Moisturise skin and use sunscreen to protect from further damage.Wash colour off hair with shampoo. Make a deep conditioning hair mask by mixing ripe avocado, 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp honey.For the body, use a moisturising body wash.Use a pumice stone, sponge or loofah to exfoliate.Use moisturising cream or lotion on the body after shower.Hydrate cuticles and lips with a balm.Apply Calamine lotion over irritated areas if rashes, itching or red patches develop.Soothe the eyesGulal contains chemicals such lead oxide, copper sulfate, asbestos, or silica. Liquid colours may also contain an alkali base. If these enter the eye, they can cause allergic reactions, irritation, or rarely chemical injury that may affect vision, says Dr Milind Naik, consultant ophthalmologist and eye plastic surgeon, LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. Milind recommends:Cup your palms gently and fill them up with clean water. Lower your face, and immerse the eyes into the water. Try and open your eyes, blink frequently and move your eyes around to help rinse off the colour. Another method would be for someone to hold the affected persons eyes open, and allow a gentle stream of clean water trickle over the surface of the eye from its outer corner flowing towards inner corner.Do not use contact lenses as the chemicals can retain as a depot, and leak out of the lenses causing prolonged damage to the surface of the eye. It would be a good idea to avoid contact lenses for one to three weeks until the eye is completely healed. Tamanna S Mehditamanna@newindianexpress.com@tamannamehdi"

That was not all. Since my mother, Thelma Gomez, hails from St. Andrews near Menamkulam in the capital city, she also used to make sweet hot cross buns, rich in spices like nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and all-spice powder. St Andrews had a unique culture with traces of Portuguese influence and so she used to bake the hot cross buns for Easter. My paternal grandmother, Lydia Gomez, was the one who made the Indri appam (or Pesaha appam) and kurukku, which is also called pesaha paal, says Marina, a popular cookery instructor and blogger settled in Bengaluru.Myriad optionsAs with all things food, each region and Christian denomination in Kerala has its own flavours for Lent. What is common is the simple food that is usually served on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday after the church service is over. While it is invariably kanji (rice porridge) and payar (green mung) on Good Friday, on Maundy Thursday it is the Pesaha appam, an unleavened bread made of rice flour that is cooked in many Christian households all over Kerala.Pesaha appam or kurishappam | Photo Credit: Ammu Elizabeth JohnLent is a period of fasting, prayers and abstinence for many Christian families. Although Easter eggs and bunnies are getting increasingly popular, many families continue the tradition of making or buying Pesaha appams. Although we make Easter eggs, cakes and hot cross buns, what is much in demand is the Indri appam that is served on the day of Maundy Thursday, says Reina Thomas, one of the partners of Square One Homemade Treats, a popular bakery in Thiruvananthapuram.Marina says that since cakes are easier to make, many of the ethnic snacks that were traditionally made during the Holy Week have been forgotten as they involve a great deal of time consuming, laborious stirring and cooking, mostly with rice flour. To keep the tradition going, Marina makes it a point to make the Indri appam every year.Traditional treats St. Michels Bakery, Bread Fort, Ambrosia and Square One Home Treats make the hot cross buns that many of us are familiar with because of the popular nursery rhyme about it. Michel David, proprietor of St. Michels Bakery, makes both hot cross buns and hot cross bread. He says there is a clientle for it as some families have the buns or the bread with milk on Maundy Thursday. It is available on Wednesday and Thursday at the different outlets of the bakery.Prasobhithan S says Bread Fort will also be making about 20 to 25 hot cross buns and different kinds of breads for Maundy Thursday. As Square One Homemade Treats will be closed from Thursday for Easter, their hot cross buns and pesaha appam will be available on Wednesday.Preethi Abraham, a home cook, recalls that during her childhood in Ranni, Pathanamthitta, the service on Maundy Thursday used to be early in the morning at around 3 am. The Indri appam, made with rice flour and urad dal, was steamed, either in leaves like an ela ada or in a vessel. The Cross that we got for Palm Sunday is pressed into the middle. In the evening, after prayers, the eldest in the family would bless the appam, cut it and serve it to the others for dinner. It is dipped into a syrup that we called kuruma, also called paal in some places. The paal is made with jaggery and coconut milk, says Preethi. Nowadays, Preethi cooks the paal and a friend of hers makes the appam and they share it.Wayanad-based Babu Stephen, son of YouTuber Annamma Pulivelil aka Annamma chedathi (Annammachedathi Special) explains that in their parish, the Indri appam is steamed in banana leaves while the Pesaha appam is called Kurishu appam as it has the palm leaf cross embedded in the middle.Pesaha appam (unleavened bread) and paal are made on Maundy Thursday in many Christian homes in Kerala | Photo Credit: Bindu JoyTraditions prevailAll my siblings, and our children gather at our house since my mother stays with us. After prayers, it is the kurishu appam, made with a little sugar, that is cut by the eldest in the family and shared amongst all of us. Usually, after the service, this sharing of food was done in the church. This time, in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol, all of us in our parish have been told to conduct the prayers at home after the service, says Babu.Hot cross buns | Photo Credit: PexelsIn many homes in Kollam, the dough, made of rice flour, coconut and jaggery, is filled in vayana leaves (bay leaves) folded into cones and steamed, says Jessie Ignatius, a former school teacher from Kollam. However, my mother in Thrissur used to make pulikatha appam (unfermented appam) made without yeast. It is made with rice, urad dal, shallots and coconut and made as soon as the mixture was ground. My mother used to make the kurukku with rice powder, coconut milk, jaggery, a bit of ghee and roasted cumin. I used to love the flavour of the cumin in the kurukku, she says.Marina says that some people might add a bit of jaggery to the Pesaha appam and that gives it a brownish tone. And the paal could be seasoned with cardamom too. Kalathappam, a bread made in a pot, is also made on Maundy Thursday by some families. Made of rice flour and lightly spiced, there were fried shallots and coconut in it, she says.The flavouring agents and the names might differ but not the solemnity of the occasion when families break bread together for Maundy Thursday, symbolising the Last Supper of Jesus Christ.Recipe of Pesaha AppamIngredientsRice powder: 1 cupUrad dal: 3 table spoonCoconut grated: 1 cupGarlic: 1Small onion: 2Jeera: a pinchWater: 1 to 1 cupsMethodSoak urad dal for 30 minutes and grind it into a smooth paste by adding little water.

Add salt and boil water and when it starts boiling add rice powder, little at a time and mix well. Now add the dal mixture and coconut mixture and mix well. Transfer the batter to a greased pan and place a cross made with palm leaves. Now steam for 20 minutes. Cool it and transfer to the serving dish.How to make paalMelt jaggery (200 gm) with water and strain it. Add the thick coconut milk (4 cups) and stir for few seconds, don't let it boil.

2021-04-01,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2021/apr/01/rolling-with-the-times-2284147.html,Rolling with the times,"By Express News ServiceHYDERABAD : As hotels across India struggle to maintain occupancy levels, some have managed to quickly adapt to the situation and work around it. From understanding the schedule of the IT employees in the vicinity to comprehending the psyche of their guests, they have done a host of things to stay relevant. Hotel Ibis Hyderabad at Hi-Tec City, opened its alfresco to host the Grills and Tandoor Weekend nights a month ago. Says General Manager Venu Gopal, We started this tentatively, but once our guests started coming, we decided it was time to go all out to line up some delicacies including haleem and other things that our local and outstation guests love. Many, who have stayed indoors for over a year, have started stepping out, albeit with their masks and following Covid protocols.A conversation with a guest made us host pets too recently. In March this year, Ibis Hyderabad opened its doors to pets. They invited pet owners to spend a staycation with them and on offer were special bowls, mattresses, exclusive entrance for them and their pets, a place earmarked for the pets to answer natural calls and even a vet on call. With travel again on getting clamped with increase in Covid cases, there have been enquiries for relaxed staycations and we have started offering our rooms for really affordable prices, says Venu Gopal. Interestingly, there are guests who plan their shopping at IKEA and then club it with a stay in the hotel and going back home on Sunday with their shopping haul.Executive Chef Namala Arun Kumar adds that he has planned what he calls a ghar ka khana platter for guests who could not travel to their hometown in other states are missing home. I recently made home-style Machher Jhol for a Bengali guest for New Year. And for another guest who wanted to taste fusion food, I tried Vennamudda Tart for him. The Grills and Tandoor evenings will also introduce summer cocktails and milkshakes he adds, while flaunting the haleem that Spice It, the restaurant, has for guests.The spread includes options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike with items like Paneer Tikka, Veg Shikampuri Kebab etc. However, the most popular item seems to be the Vegetarian Haleem which comes with fried onions, fried mint, cashews, lemon wedges etc. For Continental lovers, there are lip-smacking options like Ajwaini Fish Tikka, Angara Murgh Tikka, and Kesari Tangadi Kebab and of course haleem too, as precursor to with the upcoming Ramzan season which begins on April 12."

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs. We have the tradition of eating hot cross buns and Kanji rice with various chutneys on Good Friday. The dish, to which no tadka is added, is prepared with rice, roasted moong dal and grated coconut. I made groundnut, onion and coconut chutneys to go with Kanji this year.Sujatha Stephen, who is a nutritionist with Yashodha Hospital, says that Easter is an auspicious festival for her family. Describing a typical Easter day at her home, she says: We start preparations for Easter after Good Friday. Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani. Kakoli Mukherjee kakoli_mukherjee@newindianexpress.com @KakoliMukherje2"
2021-04-04,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/breakfast-most-fowl-an-easter-treat/article34222519.ece,Breakfast most fowl: An Easter treat,"After a 40-day dalliance with vegetarianism, Easter was always a time to indulgeTheres more to the Easter feast than chocolate bunnies and painted eggs. In fact, the real hero of Easter  apart from the Risen Christ himself  is the meat!As Easter is the culmination of 40 days of fasting and penitence, its only fair that the feast is one of grand indulgence. I remember how, growing up in the 70s and 80s in Madras (now Chennai), the season of Lent was a time of complete abstinence at home, when even eggs were off the menu. Stretching into 46 days (to include Holy Week), it was a time to embrace a variety of vegetarian dishes, pachchadis, pickles and vadams, which blended quite well with the onset of spring and summer. Surprisingly, this brief dalliance with vegetarianism would be quite spiritually uplifting, and I wouldnt really miss the meat  until Easter.But the dawn of Easter awakened the senses in more ways than one, and the first dish for breakfast on Easter morning was our cook Shankars green chicken kurma with soft, melt-in-the-mouth idlis. Lunch was a different story. But that kurma, with its profusion of fresh greens and succulent chicken pieces, brings back many fond memories of festivals and the coming together of family and friends. Now, with both my parents gone and community gatherings becoming increasingly rare, it is memories such as these that I find myself reliving often.Feast for the soulBack in the 80s, my family used to man one of the breakfast stalls at the CSI St. Thomas English Churchs annual thanksgiving festival, for the sole reason that our cook used to make the best chicken kurma. I still remember how, on the carnival day, Shankar would arrive at four in the morning to start his preparation, and soon the house would be filled with the aroma of fresh mint and coriander, till the chicken joined in and took it to a different level.My father was a stickler for punctuality and we would arrive at the church well ahead of time, chicken kurma, gas stove, cylinder and Shankar in tow. The freshly-made idlis, dosas and kurma would fly off the plates in a jiffy. By popular demand, we would repeat the idli-kurma treat for carol rounds and choir Sunday breakfasts. Every annual mission fundraiser sale would also feature this star dish.Fresh as a memoryRecently, I happened to delve deeper into the origin of the kurma (or korma, as it is called in the north), which has its roots in Mughlai cuisine. I was surprised to find that this particular green variant is quite popular in the Nilgiris and the surrounding hilly regions of Kongu Nadu. A staple of the tribal Badaga kitchen, the recipe is unique as no powdered masalas are used  its only whole spices and fresh herbs. And the fresher the coriander and mint, the greener the kurma. These little bits of information fit in so neatly, like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle, as our cook too was from Coimbatore.I still have Shankars recipe. I remember writing it down as he narrated it the very year I was married. Now my daughter thinks its the only worthwhile dish in my rather limited repertoire of culinary exploits. I make it only for Christmas and Easter.Sunday recipeGreen chicken kurmaIngredients1/2 coconut, grated or cut into small pieces5 sliced onions7 green chillies2 tbsp ginger & garlic paste (freshly ground)1/2 a bunch fresh mint leaves (pudhina)1/2 a bunch fresh coriander leaves2 tomatoes3 bay leaves2 inches cinnamon sticks1 tbsp fennel seeds4 cloves3 cardamoms3 star aniseCurry leaves1 kg chickenSalt to tasteMethod1.

2021-04-07,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/apr/07/swayed-by-sweet-potato-2286703.html,Swayed by sweet potato,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The humble sweet potato, in all its weird and wobbly innocuousness, often gets a poor rep. Especially when pitted against, rather unfairly, the universally loved potato. While madhura kizhangu puzhukku and sweet potato fries have persuaded many to switch camps, it doesnt exactly top the list of favourite vegetables for too many.But, maybe it should, given that theres plenty more to this unassuming tuberous root, says Yamini, clinical dietician, Kauvery Hospital. Theres a misconception that roots and tubers are not to be consumed in large quantities because of their starch content. But, when it comes to the nutritional value, the other components like micro-nutrients also have to be kept in mind.For this, sweet potato can be consumed, explains Yamini. There are two types of the sweet potato. The one which is available in India is the orange-pinkish one; the other one is purple and not commonly available here. But, both of them have the same properties and are very good for your health. It is antiinflammatory, reduces free radicals and boosts your immune, she details.Addresses anaemiaIt is very rich in ascorbic acid, fulfilling the vitamin C part. Its also a good source of iron. If cooked with jaggery, the nutritional anaemia can be treated.Potassium powerSweet potato is a rich source of potassium. This can help manage high blood pressure, its water retention properties can regulate muscle contractions and prevent kidney stones too.Starchy but goodEven though it is a starchy vegetable with a minimal amount of carbohydrates, it minimises the absorption of sugar in the body; thanks to its good fibre content both soluble and insoluble. So, even diabeticpatients can consume it once or twice a week if their sugar level is under control.Metabolism mattersThe high fibre content also helps in maintaining gut health. It enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria in your stomach; this way, it can help treat infective diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders. It helps in weight gain but portion size is the key and it has to be taken appropriately.Brain foodIt is a very good source of choline an essential nutrient that enhances the brain function.Vitamin storehouseSweet potato is also very rich in beta carotene, which is the precursor for vitamin A. This vitaminis very essential in all stages of life, playing a vital role in eye health.Rich in antioxidantsIt is filled with anthocyanins with antioxidant properties. Hence, it has to be included in everyday diet.ConsumptionA 100 grams of baked sweet potato offers 51 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of protein, 6 to 7 grams of fibre and very minimal fat. Otherwise, it is also rich in vitamin C and B6, magnesium, etc. The best way to consume sweet potato is to steam/bake it and have it with jaggery or slight seasoning. It can also be made as a regular south Indian curry or poriyal, with tomato and onions and spices.Sweet potato is not given much importance on the plate. But, you should try to include it regularly in your diet. In layman terms, it just looks like the pancreas the shape of the tuber. And Mother Nature has given it all these properties too. That depicts that it is very good for your vital organ, pancreas, she concludes."
2021-04-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dip-in-exports-pushes-onion-prices-down-7264987/,Dip in exports pushes onion prices down,"This year, exporters fear that chances of the bulb being exported are slim. (Represenational Image)Higher freight charges and newer certification norms have slowed down onion exports, which has seen average traded price of the bulb fall in wholesale markets in Maharashtra. With rabi and late Kharif onions arriving at the same time, most wholesale markets have reported arrivals of around 20,000-25,000 quintals of onions per day.Indian onions have some established markets, especially in Middle Eastern countries, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom, among others. Exports happen round the year, but the rabi crop  sown in December- January and harvested post-March  comprises majority of the export basked due to lower moisture content and longer shelf life of the bulb.But this year, exporters fear that chances of the bulb being exported are slim.Suresh Deshmukh, a commission agent operating out of Dindori wholesale market in Nashik district, cited increased certification needs for traditional markets like Indonesia and United Kingdom as roadblocks for exports to those countries. Starting this fiscal, these countries have mandated Global Good Agricultural Practices certification for export consignments. This was not necessary for onions and few farms would be eligible for this, he said.GAP certificate is given to farms which adhere to certain agricultural practices prescribed by auditing agencies. This includes adhering to a certain schedule for the usage of fertilisers and other inputs, and the certificate is granted after an audit. Vegetable and horticulture crops have mandatory certifications, which has prompted farmers to adopt these agricultural practices. According to Deshmukh and other exporters, onion farmers usually do not adhere to these practices and thus chances of them getting the certificate are slim.An unusual increase in freight charges and unavailability of containers have also stopped the flow of exports from the country. Deshmukh pointed out how freight charges, which were around Rs 3 per kg a year ago, has since then increased to Rs 6 per kg this year. Due to the global disruption in cargo movements, containers are also hard to get, which has put brakes on exports.Consequently, wholesale rates of onions in most markets in Nashik district have slumped even as farmers continue to harvest and bring their rabi and late Kharif produce. At Lasalagons wholesale market in Niphad taluka, the average traded price of the bulb is now between Rs 775-800 per quintal. Back in February, the price was around Rs 3,358 per quintal.Suvarna Jagtap, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, acknowledged that the present situation was due to lack of exports. If exports pick up, then prices can improve a lot, she said."

The top five items that India exports to Afghanistan are textile, sugar, transmission towers, tobacco and medicines.Consul General Muhammad Suleman Kakar addressed the meeting, while Commercial Head from the Embassy of Afghanistan Mohammad Mansoor Sahak made a presentation and explained growth prospects of investing on the commodities front in Afghanistan, a release from Consulate said.On Thursday, a B2B meet was organised as part of Invest in Afghanistan business series with focus on healthcare, pharmacy, agri-business, infrastructure and information technology.

2021-04-09,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/krugs-onion-chronicles/article34280117.ece,Krug’s onion chronicles,"When the Champagne maison peeled back the layers with a Chef Encounters stopover in Jaipur and some dishes to celebrate the humble bulbTheres a symmetry at the heart of Krugs annual Chef Encounters trips, which bring together their cellar master (chef de cave) and chef ambassadors (ambassades). Each trip focusses on a single ingredient and the chefs use their imagination to create dishes that elevate the simple into something striking  all to be paired with the Krug Grand Cuve and Krug Ros. In 2018, they travelled to Mallorca where fish was the focus. 2019 saw Oaxaca and its piquant pepper taking centrestage. Last year, just before the pandemic put an end to international travel, 11 chefs visited India, specifically Jaipur, to celebrate the humble onion.Julie Cavil, Krugs new chef de cave (she took on the role early last year) explains that each excursion is similar to the maisons Champagne-making philosophy, of paying close attention to the vineyards character and of respecting the individuality of each plot and its wine so as to allow each years cuve to shine.Krugs new chef de cave, Julie Cavil | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementA winning cuve2020s epicurean getaway  with names such as Tristin Farmer, executive head chef of Michelin two-star Singapore restaurant Zn, and Hiroyuki Kanda, owner-chef of Michelin three-star restaurant, Kanda, in Tokyo  had an Indian in the ranks. Chef Prateek Sadhu, the chef-partner at Mumbais Masque restaurant, is the first Indian chef ambassade for Krug. Obviously, it was a huge honour. It was so humbling just to be around all these amazing and great chefs, he exclaims, recalling celebrating Holi in Samode, eating dal baati churma in Jaipurs street stalls and enjoying flutes of Krug Grande Cuve in the midst of onion fields. His restaurant is one of the few in India to serve Krug.Given its price tag (21,462 for a bottle of Grand Cuve in Mumbai), Krug is a niche product. Mot and Chandon, which retails for about 8,163 (in Mumbai), is the front-runner in Indias Champagne market.Pink City guide Sadhu donned the role of de facto tour guide in Jaipur. I felt an unsaid responsibility and kept saying, Let me take over, let me tell you, let me do this, he recalls. After a day spent in the city, they discussed parallels in cooking in each ones culture, such as dried fish  be it bonito flakes that are an integral part of Japanese cooking or coastal Indias preservation of fish as suke. However, the highlight of the trip was introducing chefs that are on top of their game, running these top Michelin-starred restaurants to kachoris and a kite-flying experience!Distributors share that the bubbly hasnt seen the kind of growth that other segments such as spirits and beers have over the last couple of years, because every bottle, with its attendant taxes, has to be imported. As a result, Krug is targeted at HNWIs (high net worth individuals) who are willing to pay for quality.However, Sadhu, says the maisons offerings are a great fit for Indian food. By avoiding malolactic fermentation (MLF) in which the tart malic acid, naturally present in freshly-crushed grape juice, is converted to a softer-tasting lactic acid, the final pour still tastes fresh and vibrant. And therefore pairs well with the food that we serve at Masque, where the flavours are very Indian.Chef Prateek Sadhu | Photo Credit: Edouard NguyenAllium talesMeanwhile, for the brand at large, 2020 was about moving online. Cavil says, Last year, we quickly adapted to the situation with digital experiences called Krug Connect, which allowed us to continue to host events and reach out to our network of Krug Lovers while respecting social distancing. We also worked closely with chef partners to create videos, tutorials and social media takeovers so people could get to know the chefs while also having a more inspiring culinary experience at home.Plating up Sadhus Krug x onion collab was a lamb tripe dish with braised Madras onions, topped with red onion oil and katlam (a flaky Kashmiri bread). He says the idea stemmed from a dish his mother made (using tripe, chillies and praan, a wild shallot found in high altitudes).Ultimately though, it is the onion that created the best memories. Ambassade Angus McIntosh Jr, executive chef of The Farm at Brush Creek Ranch (Saratoga, Wyoming) remembers how his father would smell of onions when he would hug him after work. To this day, the scent comes back to me every time I come into the kitchen and put on my apron, he says. For Sicilian chef Ciccio Sultana, the allium brings a moment of self-identification. I like to think I identify with the onion. My homeopath even tells me I share its sulphurous character; I like to lead but I do it with love to create an environment where people enjoy what they do rather than follow orders, he concludes."

Usually, the market gets around 1,000 vehicles of agriculture produce. Now, it is expected to increase to 1,300- 1,400 vehicles.Farmers are desperate to sell their produce due to the current situation and hence they would bring produce in large quantity, officials from the market said. We can't predict the rates scenario as we can't rule out the possibility of panic buying on Monday, he added.The similar situation is expected to prevail in other wholesale markets across the district, said the officials.Vegetable markets in Kolhapur city are expected to be flooded with supply on Monday as the harvested vegetables have been piling up in the backyards of the farmers due to the weekend lockdown. The farmers will bring their produce to the citys mandis on Monday.Despite allowing vegetable and fruit vendors to operate, most markets and roadside vegetable vendors decided to observe the lockdown. The citizens, abiding by the law, too stayed indoors.As per the government orders, farming operations were allowed to continue. The farmers had expected the mandis to remain open. They had thought that citizens would be coming to buy vegetables.Eknath Pawar, a vegetable grower in Shirol, said, I went to Kolhapur to sell vegetables expecting the mandis to be open. However, most of the markets were shut. Moreover I was not allowed to sell my produce in the residential areas as police and locals said that there will be crowding if I set up shop on the society premises. I am heading to Shirol on Monday. Once the markets open on Monday, many farmers will flock to the mandis to sell their produce and the prices will crash. The lockdown has proven to be a bane for small-time farmers.Similarly, while construction activities were allowed, the shops selling construction goods and equipment were shut. Ravikant Patil, a contractor in Morewadi, said, The workers are sitting idle at the site since the last two days. The shops are closed and we need the material to resume construction."
2021-04-12,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/boss-burger-in-delhi-home-delivers/article34301990.ece,Who’s the boss (burger)?,"Boss Burger in Delhi delivers veg and non-veg bun delightsSome friends had been drooling over the burgers they had been preparing at home. They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger.Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu.All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties. Nothing like a DIY burger.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

(Source: File Photo)Chaitra Navratri 2021 Puja Vidhi, Samagri, Mantra: Chaitra Navratri is a nine-day festival, which begins on the first day of the Hindu Luni-Solar calendar. This year, it begins on April 13, 2021, and ends on April 22, 2021. This festival is also called Vasanta Navratri. All these nine days are devoted to the worship of the nine forms of Goddess Shakti. One of the most important days of the festival is Rama Navami, which is on April 21, 2021.One of the prominent rituals done at the beginning of this season is Ghatasthapna, which is the invocation of Goddess Shakti. Ghatasthapana Muhurta falls on Pratipada Tithi. The ritual can be done between 5:58 am  10:14 am, or between 11:56 am  12:46 am. Ghatasthapna cannot be performed at night, according to drikpanchang.com.Puja Samagri and VidhiA clay pot, some clean soil, seeds of seven different grains, a clay/brass pitcher, Ganagajal, sacred thread, betel nuts, some coins, five leaves of Ashoka or mango tree, raw/unbroken rice, unpeeled coconut, flowers, durva grass, some red cloth to wrap the coconut, and a lid to cover the clay pot.According to drikpanchang.com, grains are sown in the clay pot and the rest of the ingredients are added to it. The sacred thread is tied around the neck of the pot and after wrapping the red cloth around the coconut, the thread is used to fasten the wrap. The coconut is then placed in the center of the pot.After this, the Panchopachara Puja is done to invoke the goddess and which starts with the lamp offering and later, dhoop sticks are offered to the kalash, succeeded by incense and flowers.Chaitra Navratri is popularly celebrated in northern India, which begins with Gudi Padwa in the West. In the south, like in Andhra Pradesh, it starts with Ugadi. During the period of these nine days, people maintain a fast and avoid eating any meat, and some consume only light and simple food. Garlic and onions are abstained by many.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"

Final data for November 2020 was also revised upwards, with industrial output in the month shrinking 1.6% compared to a 1.9% dip estimated earlier.The base effect played a role on both the indices, said economists, as industrial output in February 2020 had hit a 16-month high, at the time, of 5.2%, while food inflation, which played a key role in driving up the overall price rise print in March, was partly bolstered by the lower price trends last year even though food prices have declined month-on-month.29-month highCore inflation jumped to a 29-month high of 5.96% in March 2021 from 3.95% a year ago and 5.88% in February due to demand and increase in commodity prices, said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research.Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Limited, termed the core inflation near 6% as unnerving but added that the decline in prices of vegetables such as onions as well as a reversal of the base effect was expected to dampen the food inflation to around 2-2.5% in April 2021.The IIP numbers suggest that the recovery in industrial volumes lacks conviction, she said.Lacklustre productionThe trend of recent months reinforces the view that the uptick witnessed in the months of September and October-2020 was more due to a combination of festive and pent-up demand and we are still far from witnessing a sustained recovery, Mr. Pant said.Growth pattern of primary and intermediate goods, two leading indicators of industrial production are pointing towards a lacklustre industrial performance in the short- to medium-run, he stressed, adding that this would necessitate continued demand support from both the government as well as the Reserve Bank."

Ali sells omelettes and bhurji pao outside Churchgate station. His last regular work day was on March 18, 2020, six days before the national lockdown was announced.Ali went back to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh in May 2020, returned to the city in August and reopened the food stall in December. With a complete lockdown looming again and restrictions already in place, Ali fears a repeat of 2020. Last week, three men working with him left for their home states of UP and Bihar, uncertain of the future after the experience of the sudden lockdown last year.Before the lockdown, Alis daily routine was to travel to Churchgate after 5 pm from his home in Navi Mumbai. He coordinated supplies of eggs, bread, onion, tomatoes, spices and set up his stall by 8 pm, just after the evening peak hour subsided and commuters stopped for a quick bite before taking trains to far-flung northern suburbs. His stall was open till the last local left the station around 12.50 am.When he shut down the stall during the national lockdown, he thought it would be a matter of days before he got back to his routine. I did not think it would be so many months, he says.After his return last August, Ali rushed to the space near the station where he had stashed his utensils, stove and a foldable table. It had all been stolen. I had to spend Rs 20,000 to buy everything again, he says.Those like Ali who earned over Rs 20,000 per month and had some savings managed to survive the lockdown, but the economic shock of the past year has set them back financially by many years.Unlike thousands of others, Ali and his wife Ishrat decided to stay put in their one-room home in Koparkhairane rather than risk travelling on foot or trucks. But they left in May when they could not afford to stay in the city. We left when they started the trains to take migrant workers back to their hometowns. We stayed at Ishrats mothers village, where there is some income due to farming, he says.In August, Ali had an accident and was told that surgery would cost over Rs 1 lakh. He returned to the city and got operated at a public hospital, taking a loan by mortgaging jewellery.After recuperating, Ali returned to Churchgate in the last week of August, but with train services operating only for essential workers and restrictions still in place, restarting the stall was unviable. I had no option but to sell small items I bought in Crawford Market. I sold earphones, mobile stands, even sanitiser bottles outside the station, he says.For Ali, the biggest concern is his sons studies. Moin, a Class V student in a private English medium school, has not attended online classes for a year as the family was unable to pay the fees, amounting to nearly Rs 1 lakh.With restrictions eased for the general public to travel on local trains in February, Ali had begun hoping for earnings to pick from March. But that hope crashed with the second wave of Covid infections and new restrictions.Ali has not decided if he should leave immediately, hoping that the spike is temporary. I cannot imagine restarting all over again for the second time, he says."

Coming on the back of a bleak, pandemic-hit year, the trading community in the market is worried the COVID-19 resurgence is primed to rob them of yet another festive shopping period.Usual sceneUsually teeming with customers on the days preceding such festivals, the Kothuval street, the KK Road, and the Sabapathy Kovil street witnessed dull activity on Monday with the vegetable and fruits stalls attracting few buyers and vehicles traversing the narrow roads with ease.Any hopes of sales picking up later by evening also turned to dust with a heavy downpour and gusty winds sending people indoors.Just when we thought we were past the worst, the pandemic has returned to haunt us again, says Krishnan, who has been running a vegetable retail stall in the market for over three decades.According to him, many traders stocked vegetables including the kani vellari (golden cucumber), an indispensable part of the auspicious Vishu Kani well in advance, anticipating brisk business. However, the last few days have not shown any encouraging signs yet. Fearing the possibility of crowding here, some of our frequent customers may have opted for shops nearer to their homes, he said.Irshad, a vegetable vendor at the KK Market, believes the purchasing capacity of the people could also have fallen with many losing their jobs or suffering salary cuts since the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in many opting for low-key celebrations.PricesWhile the prices of perishables usually rise during such festivals, they have witnessed an unprecedented dip during the last few days.Sivan, who runs SN Vegetables in Chala, pointed out the price of shallots that had touched 130 per kg few months ago has fallen to 40 per kg.Likewise, onions sold for 15 to 20 in the retail market. While some traders sell the kani vellari for 25 per kg during the Vishu season, few others offer them at a lowly 10.The price of vellarikka (cucumber) also fell by a half from 30 to 15, while pumpkins costed 15 per kg, a marked fall from its rates ranging from 30 to 40 during Vishu the previous years. Contrastingly, the price of garlic increased from 60 per kg to touch 90 per kg.The prices of banana varieties remained largely stable. While the njalipoovan costed 40 per kg, palayankodan, nendran and robusta fetched 25, 40 and 20 respectively.The trading community hoped for a marked turnaround of fortunes on Tuesday, but fear restrictions imposed by the police to prevent crowding to play spoilsport."

Last Monday, we had received 24,700 quintals of the same. Today (Monday), it was 7,938 quintals more than last Monday. This is adequate to meet Pune and Pimpri Chinchwads requirements. We expect vegetable prices to remain stable in local mandis.Rates of all vegetables and fruits remained stable. Onion was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 per kg range and potato was also sold in the range of Rs6 to Rs16 per kg. Rates of leafy vegetables were also in the normal bracket. A bunch of coriander was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 range, fenugreek was in the Rs7 to Rs12 range and spinach was in the Rs4 to Rs10 bracket.Talking about the crowd management, Garad said, We have banned domestic purchase at the market, in view of the increasing crowd here. Also, small-time vendors, who sell the produce on handcarts and set up stalls in the market, too have been stopped. Restaurants on our campus have been told to provide parcel service.Shivlal Bhosale, a commission agent, said, It will be a difficult task for the administration to control the crowd at the market as thousands of them will be working together daily. A section of the commission agents said that the APMC could resort to last years strategy of running each section on alternate days. The measure had controlled the crowd significantly in the market, a commission agent said.While another agent said last years measure would go against the farmers as they wouldnt be able to sell their harvest quickly. Many farmers could not sell their produce last year because of this system, the agent said.Wholesale rates of flowers remain stableRates of flowers remained stable in Gultekdis flower markets on Monday, said Bala Sewale, head of the flower section. There was adequate supply of all flowers. Hence, there was no change in the rates. Marigold flowers, which were in demand because of the upcoming Gudi Padwa celebrations, were sold in the range of Rs40 to Rs45 per kg, he said."

Market and a few other markets in the city.Sources in the civic body said the Corporation was mulling allowing only 50% traders to function on a day and the rest the next day as it done last year during the lockdown. The Corporation could arrive at a decision in the next couple of days.Before taking a decision, the Corporation would engage with the traders to take their opinion and seek their cooperation and also consult with the district administration, the sources said.The Corporation, on Tuesday, also held talks with representatives of traders from the M.G.R. Wholesale Vegetable Market and Anna Retail Vegetable Market to explore the possibility of shifting them to a school or college ground or another place where maintenance of physical distance would not be a problem.After the discussion, the Corporation had decided to shift the onion trade to the Mettupalayam Road bus stand.Sources in the market said the shift of onion business would ease congestion in the wholesale market as it was onion at around 700 tonnes a day that occupied more space than other vegetables.At present, tomato business functioned out of the bus stand.The sources said the Corporation was looking at the old dump yard in Eru Company, at the junction of Sanganoor Road-Mettupalayam Road, as a possible alternative location for either the wholesale or retail market.Likewise at those markets and the one on Ramar Kovil Street in Ukkadam, the Corporation had also planned to ask the traders to regulate the entry and exit of customers so that at the entry point, they could be screened for temperature, given sanitisers and checked for mask, the sources added.In a related development, the Corporation slapped  10,000 fine on traders and customers at T.K. Market and Ramar Kovil Street market."

The restaurant, which boasts a food menu conceived by Michelin-starred Chef Atul Kochhar of Benares, London fame, and executed by Chef Tanvi Goswami, has just introduced an Experience Menu, curated by Kochhar, Available only on Sundays, it is a reflection of SAGAs food philosophy, weaving together the myriad flavours of the country into a nine-course meal that celebrates Indias rich culinary legacies in clean contemporary settings. Speaking of settings, the restaurant itself is stunning, sprawling over three floors and an al fresco area, with the focal point being a bar that towers up through the entire restaurant, requiring mixologists to travel up and down using lifts and pulleys.All of that spectacle is reinforced by some truly stellar cocktails, but more on those later. Going back to the food, Kochhar says, Through this menu we would like to give an experience, which is culturally rich and speaks volume of our heritage and love for food. The menu is brought to life keeping in mind different palates, touching key dishes from our a la carte offerings and also giving unparalleled dining experience. The Chefs Experience menu includes some of the best-selling dishes from the a la carte menu such as Crispy Crab, Ghee Roast Prawn, Sali Murg, Bhuna Mangsho, Edamame and Quinoa, Khari Paneer Tikka along with special dishes created for it, all washed down by a chilled glass of crisp Prosecco and live music by a violinist who traipses through the various floors and mezzanines of the space.Going with the non-vegetarian menu, we are pleased to make the acquaintance of dishes like the aforementioned crab and prawn. The fo rme r comprises a crackling soft shell crab (we recommend downing it in one bite if you have a large enough mouth and or a disdain for decorum), with dollops of saffron-spiked cream and a mustardy catsup, while the latter comes taco style, the Mangalorean prawn dish, scented with fennel and curry leaves, resting on a tortilla shell as delicate as a ballerinas ankles and just as tenacious, gamely managing to contain the shellfish as one wolfs it down.Helping us wash down this surfeit of seafood is the delicious Indo-Negroni, which gives a distinctly desi twist to the classic cocktail with cumin and citrus flavours. Next, we dally with the Himalayan Flavours (a Nepalese-inspi red Roas t Chicken Salad fired up with timur pepper and tart tomatoes) and Lentil Love (comprising slow-cooked lentils fortified with onion and garlic and served in a tart shell which gives the otherwise simple legumes a more complex texture and crumble, making it all the more welcome). We also take a dip in the Lonar Lake, a signature cocktail of SAGA that is a medley of gin, Aperol (an Italian bitter), Orgeat syrup and sparkling wine, perfumed with kaffir lime leaves.Swimming may be out this year but this is definitely something we could dive into again and again. In the interest of brevity, we shall refrain from further details, but suffice it to say that the main courses, which included Sali Murg (Parsi Chicken), Bhuna Mangsho (Bengali style goat mutton) and the Family Affair (a multi-grain khichdi for the whole family to pass around), were each delicious and individual in their own way. For desserts, there is the Petha (an ambrosial cloud of rabadi festooned with orange jelly, winter melon candy and rose) and the Pilgrims Sweet (a platter packed with plum cake, Panchamarat ice-cream, date treacle and wheat halwa). With the menu expected to change seasonally, given Kochhars emphasis of taking cues from nature, diners can keep enjoying new tastes from the country we call home.DETAILSAT: Vatika Atrium, Golf Course Road, Sector 53, GurugramTIMING: Every Sunday, 12:00pm-4:00pm, 7:00pm-11:00pmCOST PER HEAD: Rs 2,995 ++"

And cocktails with a Chennai soulSpaces is a unique Chennai luxury. Set beside popular Besant Nagar beach, the graceful venue, wild with flowers and vibrant with the scent of the sea, is a democratic breathing space for art, theatre and experimental performances.How do you fuse a caf into a space that is so individualistic, and so fiercely loved?Very thoughtfully, says soft-spoken architect-hotelier-dancer Krithika Subrahmanian, who is perhaps the ideal person for the job with her ambitious vision for the space, supported by a meticulous attention to detail and personal history with the neighbourhood.At the entrance to her just-launched venue, Synck, she explains how she grew up in the plot next door, sitting on the balcony with my grandparents and a constant stream of visitors, listening to the music from performances at Spaces.Now, she has merged both properties, building a sprawling caf, bar and restaurant besides the performance space, without altering its energy and setting. And, in the tradition of legendary dancer-choreographer Chandralekha who envisioned and created Spaces, Krithika hopes Synck will grow beside it, into a welcoming, creative community venue. I want to invite artists I want guests to mingle, and have conversations, she says, adding, after a pause, Of course, some of that can only happen in a post-COVID world.Nevertheless, Synck has launched with an ambitious mandate. Comprising multiple ideas and moods that flow into each other, it includes a relaxed outdoor caf Svah, an intimate fine dining restaurant called Svasa and a soon-to-launch speakeasy bar, in addition to a compact theatre.As Krithika walks through the caf, pointing out the art it houses, traditional and digital, she explains why she chose to showcase progressive, vegetarian food in different formats across the property.We want to focus on taste and nutrition, she says, adding that the team is building on its strengths, leaning on experience. (She also runs award-winning hotel Svatma in Thanjavur, set in a century-old building, popular for its luxurious vegetarian menus.)The large alfresco caf, an alluring refuge for pandemic-weary open space seekers, serves fairly adventurous glocal cuisine, in addition to caf classics, from Himalayan pink salt lattes to saffron affogatos. Advertised with contemporary Wellness favourite buzzwords, the menu promises food that is organic, artisanal, progressive and inclusive.Fortunately, along with the gimmicky frills (including dal served in dinky jugs), the cooking has a serious backbone.At Svasa, dinner opens with creamy plantain stem soup, topped with crisp slices of airfried paintain tempura. The playful menu features stuffed brinjal served with Indianised arancini and enveloped in a rich velvety curry; a unique take on bisi bele bath served with a kodumpuli tart; and for dessert, a heady scoop of jasmine icecream.The Awadhi mussalam stars bright, springy broccoli instead of meat, stuffed generously with nuts. It is laced with a clingy gravy, the flavours deepened with patiently toasted onions and garlic pods caramelised to a pleasing, earthy sweetness. While the kitchen brandishes a plethora of molecular gastronomy skills and showy plating, it is the old-fashioned sincerity with which they execute the food that will be Syncks strength: their careful sourcing, and respectful treatment of produce.The highlight, however, will always be the unique proximity to Chandralekas iconic open air theatre, and joy of soaking in strains of a concert in an eddy of sea breeze.Synck is at 42, 35th Street, Besant Nagar.

2021-04-15,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2021/apr/15/in-the-spirit-of-sattva-2290169.html,In the spirit of Sattva,"Rajkumari Sharma Tankha ByExpress News ServiceAt no time in the past was so much stress laid upon inculcating good eating habits as is now, thanks to Covid-19. This pandemic has brought with it a massive awareness about eating fresh and healthy food to boost immunity and keep illnesses away.Sattvic food  a high fibre and low-fat vegetarian diet as per the principles of Ayurveda, earlier preferred by a few, is increasingly becoming a popular choice among masses. This is evident from the number of dedicated sattvic food restaurants that have cropped up in the recent past.Consisting of fruits and vegetables that are natures source of detoxification, the sattvic diet basically focuses on eating food that is provided to us by nature  seasonal fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and non-meat products. A sattvic diet is pure, natural, easy to digest and energy-enhancing, says dietician Shweta Shah.Basil Paneer Tikka, SattvikMore people than ever before are adopting a Sattvic diet. Based on Ayurvedic principles, it is even devoid of onion and garlic, says Amit Juneja, CEO, Annakoot, that opened its third outlet in Delhi last year. The Lajpat Nagar outlet not just offers sattvic Indian and Chinese dishes but sattvic freshly baked cookies as well. We began with one outlet at Preet Vihar. In a few months after opening, sensing the public demand, we opened one each at Bengali Market and Lajpat Nagar. People have enthusiastically adopted the sattvic way of living and believe in the benefits of sattvic food, reveals Juneja.India is culturally inclined to vegetarianism, and especially now with more attention towards immunity-building to beat the coronavirus, people are turning towards a green and clean diet, says nutritionists. People are moving towards sattvic as they are becoming more aware of the benefits of a healthy and a pure diet, and though we cannot ascribe an age group to it, even the younger generation now understands the impact of consuming meat on their health as well as the environment, says Ritika Arora, Director, Sattvik that opened at Select City Walk in 2007 and continues to remain popular. We had started it as a place to provide Indian vegetarian food, embodying the spirit of sattva, she adds.Innately Indian preparations like dal, rice, chapati, vegetables in basic masala are all sattvic. And since its all about the ingredients being used, a lot of dishes from different othercuisines can be made in a sattvic way. In fact, one can also make Chinese and other Asian cuisine in a sattvic way with a little imagination!Though there have been some religious communities who have been consuming only sattvic diet since generations, the pandemic brought to light the unhealthy effects of fast food, notes Juneja, adding, People now realise that food that is not freshly made with natural and pure ingredients is harmful to the body and impedes the immune system.Agrees Shah: Sattvik food can help attain not just optimum physical and mental health, but also spiritual health. It boosts digestion, improves your gut system, builds immunity and strengthens the body from within.Can it be the food of the future?Yes, definitely. With people becoming more inclined towards animal safety and environment-friendly products, we may soon see a shift in the pattern of food consumption. The pandemic has already created panic and increased self-consciousness with regards to the food we consume, says Arora. Sattvic has been here for thousands of years, and it will become more prominent with time, says Juneja, with confidence."
