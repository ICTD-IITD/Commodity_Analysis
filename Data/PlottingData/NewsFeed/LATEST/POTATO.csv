The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.Binoy Viswam is Secretary, CPI National Council, and leader of the party in Parliament.

2021-01-02,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/how-humanity-won-during-the-toughest-of-adversities/articleshow/80066325.cms,Gurugram: How humanity won during the toughest of adversities,"GURUGRAM: It was the time when dreams were crushed and despair descended on many households. Some had lost jobs, some a place of stay and scores of migrant workers were seen walking kilometres to reach their hometowns.When the Covid-induced lockdown cast a pall of gloom and robbed people of their livelihood, the challenges also brought out the best of humanity . Many residents of NCR accepted the ones in despair as their own. Hundreds of families came together to feed the migrant workers and students left stranded in the big city.It was a conversation between strangers on social media that started it off. On a Facebook page where athletes often discussed their upcoming running and cycling events, the talk veered towards the migrants plight.Shaurya Roy, a businessman, got in touch with Abhishek Mishra, an entrepreneur. Together, they visited slums in Saraswati Vihar , which has about 1,500 shanties, and interacted with daily wage labourers, construction workers and domestic helpers who had lost their jobs. The Facebook page soon became a platform for the athletes to contact each other on the ground when they were out to provide aid and food.Many of the workers wanted to leave for their hometowns as they feared running out of supplies. We counselled them and assured them they would get help. We have been in touch with them ever since and provided them food, Roy, a resident of DLF-5, said.People were not well-informed about the crisis and often missed the administrations announcements, Roy said, adding that they tried to bridge this gap.Sonal Pathak, who lives in Suncity Township, similarly joined hands with five other residents of the society in March to help out more than 1,000 migrant workers and labourers who had lost their jobs at construction sites around the Golf Course Road area. With donations from more than a 100 people, Pathaks group, over a period of three months, was able to deliver food kits consisting of 10 kg rice, 2 kg flour, 500ml oil, small packets of turmeric, salt, chilli powder and 1 kg of potatoes and onions to the families of the labourers.During the lockdown, Shibal Bhartiya said being a doctor meant she was allowed to venture outside her house. She used this opportunity to help the labourers living in the citys slums. Along with her 13-year-old son and her friend Grashmi Jivani, a resident of South City-1, she distributed food to many in need. We reached out to several people via social media and raised funds. We have been providing 2kg packets of rice, pulses and soap to each family, Bhartiya, who resides in Nirvana County, said.At the same time, the doctor also tried to educate the workers about the importance of social distancing.Many families in DLF-2 have been similarly feeding migrant labourers around their societies and distributing rice and pulses. Some have set up community kitchens as well, said Gaurav Wahi, RWA president, DLF-2. In Dwarka Expressway , some residents have contributed sanitisers and hand wash to slum-dwellers in the area. We have been giving rice and pulses to construction workers, and are also providing food to our support staff, Praveen Malik, RWA president, Sare Homes, Sector 92, said."
2021-01-02,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/jobs-houses-and-cows-chinas-costly-drive-to-erase-extreme-poverty-7129913/,"Jobs, houses and cows: China’s costly drive to erase extreme poverty","Su Zizhen, who received a home from from a poverty alleviation program with the Chinese government, in Chinas Gansu Province, China, Dec. 14, 2020. (Keith Bradsher/The New York Times) YanWhen the Chinese government offered free cows to farmers in Jieyuan, villagers in the remote mountain community were skeptical. They worried officials would ask them to return the cattle later, along with any calves they managed to raise.But the farmers kept the cows, and the money they brought. Others received small flocks of sheep. Government workers also paved a road into the town, built new houses for the villages poorest residents and repurposed an old school as a community center.Jia Huanwen, a 58-year-old farmer in the village in Gansu province, was given a large cow three years ago that produced two healthy calves. He sold the cow in April for $2,900, as much as he earns in two years growing potatoes, wheat and corn on the terraced, yellow clay hillsides nearby. Now he buys vegetables regularly for his familys table and medicine for an arthritic knee.It was the best cow Ive ever had, Jia said.The village of Jieyuan is one of many successes of President Xi Jinpings ambitious pledge to eradicate abject rural poverty by the end of 2020. In just five years, China says it has lifted from extreme poverty over 50 million farmers left behind by breakneck economic growth in cities.But the village, one of six in Gansu visited by The New York Times without government oversight, is also a testament to the considerable cost of the ruling Communist Partys approach to poverty alleviation. That approach has relied on massive, possibly unsustainable subsidies to create jobs and build better housing.Local cadres fanned out to identify impoverished households  defined as living on less than $1.70 a day. They handed out loans, grants and even farm animals to poor villagers. Officials visited residents weekly to check on their progress.Were pretty sure Chinas eradication of absolute poverty in rural areas has been successful  given the resources mobilized, we are less sure it is sustainable or cost effective, said Martin Raiser, the World Bank country director for China.Beijing poured almost $700 billion in loans and grants into poverty alleviation over the past five years  about 1% of each years economic output. That excludes large donations by state-owned enterprises like State Grid, a power transmission giant, which put $120 billion into rural electricity upgrades and assigned more than 7,000 employees to work on poverty alleviation projects.The campaign took on new urgency this year as the country faced devastation from the coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding. One by one, provinces announced they had met their goals. In early December, Xi declared that China had achieved a significant victory that impresses the world.But Xi acknowledged further efforts were needed to share wealth more widely. A migrant worker in a coastal factory city can earn as much in a month as a Gansu farmer earns in a year.Xi also called for officials to make sure that newly created jobs and aid for the poor did not fade away in the coming years.Gansu, Chinas poorest province, declared in late November that it had lifted its last counties out of poverty. Just a decade ago, poverty in the province was widespread.Hu Jintao, Chinas leader before Xi, visited people living in simple homes with few furnishings. Villagers ate so many potatoes that local officials were embarrassed when a young girl initially refused to eat yet another one with Hu in front of television cameras because she was tired of them, according to a cable disclosed by WikiLeaks.Though many villages are still reachable only by single-lane roads, they are lined with streetlights powered by solar panels. New industrial-scale pig farms, plant nurseries and small factories have sprung up, creating jobs. Workers are building new houses for farmers.Three years ago, Zhang Jinlu woke in terror when the rain-weakened mud brick walls of his home gave way. Half the roof timbers came crashing down with slabs of dirt, narrowly missing him and his mother.Officials in Youfang village built a spacious new concrete house for them, complete with new furniture. Zhang, 69, now receives a monthly stipend of $82 through the poverty program. His original house was rebuilt for him as a storage shed.This house used to be dilapidated, and it leaked when it rained, Zhang said.The government helps private factories buy equipment and pay salaries if they hire workers deemed impoverished.At Tanyue Tongwei Clothing & Accessories Co. in southeastern Gansu, about 170 workers, mostly women, sewed school uniforms, T-shirts, down jackets and face masks. Workers said that several dozen employees received extra payments from the poverty alleviation program in addition to their salaries.Lu Yaming, the companys legal representative, said Tanyue receives at least $26,000 a year in subsidies from poverty alleviation programs  out of which $500 a year was paid to each of the 17 villagers deemed impoverished.But the viability of these factories without ongoing aid is far from clear. Until the subsidies arrived, the factory frequently had trouble paying wages on time, Lu said.Inevitable questions swirl over whether some families have used personal ties to local officials to qualify for grants. Corruption investigators punished 99,000 people nationwide in connection with poverty relief efforts last year, according to official statistics. At local eateries in communities like Mayingzhen, where a heavily seasoned platter of fried donkey meat costs $7, the talk is all about who received what, and whether they really should have qualified.While the poverty alleviation program has helped millions of poor people, critics point to the campaigns rigid definitions. The program assists people classified as extremely poor at some point from 2014 to 2016, without adding others who may have fallen on hard times since then. It also does very little to help poor people in big cities where wages are higher but workers must pay far more for food and rent.According to the governments complicated criteria for determining eligibility for aid, anyone who owned a car, had more than $4,600 in assets or had a new or recently rebuilt house was excluded. People hovering just above the governments poverty line continue to struggle to make ends meet, but are often denied help with housing or other benefits.Zhang Sumei, a 53-year-old farmer, earns $1,500 a year growing and selling potatoes and had to use her savings to build her home in concrete. She says that she should have qualified for aid for the extremely poor. Farming Gansus notoriously infertile soil is hard and difficult.In this society, poor families are designated by cadres, and we have nothing. she said bitterly.The partys campaign-style approach also fails to tackle deep-seated problems that disproportionately hurt the poor, including the cost of health care and other gaping holes in Chinas emerging social safety net. Villages provide limited health insurance  only 17% of the cost of Jias arthritis medicine is covered, for example. Hefty medical bills can ruin families."

Chandrasekhar Rao has called up N. Nagi Reddy of Ranzole village and enquired about his potato crop. The conversation is reported to have continued for about five minutes.Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao asked Mr. Nagi Reddy whether the cultivated area has remained the same or had come down.The farmer replied that compared with previous years it was reduced but by and large remained at about 2000 acres whereas it used to be about 3,000 acres in that area. The seed is called Pokaraj166 variety. As we felt this is good we went for this crop in Zaheerabad area. Each plant yields about eight to 10 potatoes which weighs nearly a kilogram. Per acre yield will be 15 to 16 bags. The crop growth is very impressive. It is some 45 days since the crop was sown. Jahangeer is speaking with me once in a while, said the farmer adding that they never counted on how many plants there are per acre and added that the total yield was estimated to be between 12 and 15 tonnes.The farmer explained that while potato in white colour which is cultivated in black soil will fetch a better price of 200 per quintal, the crop grown in red soil commands a lower price of about  175 per quintal. Mr. Nagi Reddy also informed the Chief Minister that the yield would begin in 85 days and water should be stopped to the crop 15 days before harvest. The Chief Minister has invited the farmer to meet him next week."

At the Koyambedu wholesale market complex, the cost of vegetables did not exceed 25, with some greens available for just 10 per kilogram.According to market sources, a kilogram of onion and potato were sold between 20 and 22, carrot and tomato were available for 20/kg last week. Cabbage, chow-chow and beetroot were availabe for 10/kg. Beans was available for 25/kg, after price fell by 10-15. This was the lowest price in the past five months. Rates were fluctuating so much in the recent past that carrot and onion prices exceeded 100/kg due to shortage in arrivals.S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations said that arrivals to the market is expected to drop this week. ""We had huge arrivals in December that lowered the cost of all vegetables,"" he said. But, this week may see partial revision in prices since arrivals for Chennai is expected to drop as markets offering better prices in other states for the same commodity could attract additional vegetables, he added."
2021-01-04,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/rain-irrigates-fields-as-farmers-continue-protest/articleshow/80087401.cms,Haryana: Rain irrigates fields as farmers continue protest,"Rain received over two days has irrigated farming fieldsAMBALA: Light rain and cold weather has come as a relief for farmers, who have been spared the work of irrigating their fields amid the ongoing agitation.It has been raining lightly in the region for the past two days, resulting in natural irrigation of wheat, mustard and vegetable fields.Over the last two days, Ambala has recorded maximum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius and minimum of 13 degrees Celsius. Scattered thunderstorm and rain has been predicted for the next two days, agriculture department officials said.Most of the farmers protesting at the Delhi borders have been attending the agitation and coming home from time to time to look after their crops in northern Haryana .Farmer Rajeev Sharma from Hasanpur village in Naraingarh area of Ambala district said, The recent rain and cold weather has come as a boost for the wheat crop, which is growing well. I come home from the protest in Delhi after about 10 days to harvest potatoes. I have also grown wheat. Another farmer, Sukhminder from Sapehra village of Ambala said, The rain has saved our hard work of irrigating fields amid the ongoing protest. The weather is pleasant for wheat and mustard and we are happy that god has irrigated our fields.Districts deputy director, agriculture (DDA) Girish Nagpal said more than about 75,000 hectares of land in Ambala is under wheat cultivation.Ongoing weather conditions are conducive enough for better yield of Rabi crops. At this stage of wheat, cold weather is also beneficial, DDA Nagpal said.He added that thousands of farmers in the state, including Ambala, are given timely information on weather through text messages on their mobile phones from Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture Universitys, agriculture meteorology department.To a query on whether the area cultivated under wheat in Ambala has declined due to the farmers agitation, an official said, There has been no decline in the area and more than about 75,000 hectares of land is cultivated under wheat. Not even one acre of land is empty in the district. Farmers are never careless about their crops. Even during the Covid-19 lockdown, farmers obtained permits, harvested wheat and cultivated paddy."

Wondering how it works? Read on.How does GM diet promise?GM diet is known to have been formulated in General Motors Corp in 1987, to tackle weight and health issues faced by its employees.

Heres a brief look at the diet plan:On day 1, you can eat sweets and tangy fruits like melons, to keep you full for a long time. Other fruits include strawberries, apples, watemelon, and cantaloupe.Also Read | Have you heard of cookie diet?

Besides, it emphasises drinking water which helps detoxify the body. But like most other fad diets, experts are divided in their opinion about whether this diet plan is sustainable.According to medicalnewstoday.com, the diet lacks essential vitamins and minerals that come with eating a variety of healthy foods daily. Besides, most days of the entire diet plan provide low amounts of protein, which, researchers argue, can decrease appetite and promote weight loss.Moreover, the diet can only lead to temporary weight loss. Once the GM diet plan is over, it is likely that you would regain weight once you resume your normal diet, according to Healthline.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"
2021-01-05,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/understanding-the-rationale-of-farm-protests/story-gKFfx6HP8bCjlrVNQ5yM6O.html,Understanding the rationale of farm protests,"analysisUpdated: Jan 06, 2021, 06:13 ISTThe recently enacted farm laws and the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act by the Union government has led to a standoff with no resolution in sight. Farmer organisations and several state governments had conveyed their opposition to the laws at the time of the promulgation of the ordinances. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, which exhibits disdain for efforts to build consensus through wider consultations, proceeded to push the bills through Parliament without any meaningful discussion with the Opposition parties.The disinformation campaign launched by the BJP to mislead the public that the present laws accord freedom to the farmers to sell their produce to whoever they choose/desire is far from the truth. Under the current/existing Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) model, the farmers already have the choice to sell their produce to private parties. The transactions take place at APMC mandis, which are regulated and safeguard the farmer from exploitation at the hands of the multinational companies (MNCs). The Centre is seeking to replace the existing agricultural marketing system with a handful of intermediaries who will be under no obligation to pay the minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers.The Centre has overlooked a fundamental aspect that no one size of farming pattern fits all. Our founding fathers were conscious of this ground reality and placed agriculture under the State List of the Constitution. The National Agricultural Research Project divides our country into 127 different agro-climatic zones. The different zones include varying landholding patterns, weather/climate, soil content, production patterns and water levels. The present laws fail to factor in the heterogeneity in our farming patterns and attempt to impose the Bihar model of agriculture, which has failed to yield dividends to the farmers.The vilification campaign against the arhtiyas overlooks the supportive role played by this irreplaceable cog in the agricultural wheel. It is the arhtiya to whom the farmers look to for financial support for the purchase of fertilisers, short-term loans and family needs; both enjoy a relationship of mutual trust. The midnight Income Tax (IT) raids on officer-bearers of the arhtiya association in Punjab reflects the mindset of the BJP.Such high-handed measures undertaken with an objective to browbeat and intimidate supporters of this peaceful movement have become part of the BJP agenda to quell legitimate criticism and dissent. Corporates, with their profit maximisation motive and impersonal transactional relationship, can never fill the shoes of an arhitya. The unilateral imposition of the present laws, without taking the farmers into confidence, has further widened the trust deficit between the agriculturists and big business.The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 2020, gives carte blanche to hoarders and traders to engage in predatory pricing. The statement of objects and reasons for the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, was to regulate and check hoarding of essential items and black-marketing of food produce by unscrupulous traders. The recent amendment removes cereals, pulses, oil seeds, edible oil, onions and potatoes from the list of essential items, facilitating unlimited hoarding and speculative trade.As a consequence of the recent amendment, the government can step in to regulate the stock limit for these food items only in the event of a war, famine, natural calamity or an extraordinary price rise in retail value.Unless there is a 100% price increase in retail price of the aforesaid items, the government is proscribed from intervening to check hoarding and black-marketing of food produce and cereals. This facilitates the path for exploitation of the consumers and will lead to inflationary pressures across sectors.The labelling of protesting farmers as anti-nationals has led to justifiable anguish among the farming community. Every household of Punjab and Haryana has made innumerable sacrifices for the country right from the time of the freedom movement. The role played by Punjab in defending our nations territorial integrity and in feeding the country in the time of the food crisis is well recorded in history. Thousands of ex-servicemen, who have served at our borders, are part of the farmer protests and are seeking redressal of their legitimate grievances. Over 50 farmers have lost their lives at the protest sites owing to low temperatures and difficult living conditions.We need an empathetic government with a moral compass to urgently find a solution to the satisfaction of the farmers. Engaging in dilatory tactics and subterfuge will further exacerbate the growing trust deficit between the farming community and the Centre.Vijay Inder Singla is the Cabinet Minister for Education and PWD, Government of Punjab.

Even when I was in school, I was mocked for being a couch potato and became a regular victim of taunts and jokes. That was when I initially decided to lose weight. I listened to my teacher's advice and started having lemon water with honey daily. This somewhat helped me lose weight and get rid of health problems like sinus headache etc. I started doing skipping rope and eating well too.Then, in 2017, I got married. Sadly, I got distracted and soon put on weight. I forego exercising and always craved for momos, noodles and junk food! Before I knew it, I was so no longer fit.Just one day out of the blue, I promised myself that I had to get back to my old self. I just locked myself in a room and started dancing to Bollywood songs! That worked like magic and got me motivated again. Most importantly, I was never bored again. I lost 5 kilos just by dancing!"

2021-01-07,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2021/jan/07/middle-aged-and-mindful-2246458.html,Middle-aged and mindful,"Dr Prathima Reddy ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Middle age is defined as the period of life between the ages of 45 and 60 years, when one is no longer young, but not yet old. It is expected that in the next decade, 15 per cent of Indias population would be over the age of 40. This is almost 20 million people who would have specific healthcare needs in this age group. So what are the medical health issues that are more common in middle-aged women?Diabetes and hypertensionThe incidence of these two diseases which were previously thought to be more common in males is increasing in women as well, especially more in the urban areas compared to the rural areas. Both these diseases, if discovered late or left untreated, can have far reaching consequences. It is known that the incidence of heart attack in women with diabetes is 44 per cent more than men and the incidence of stroke is 27 per cent more than men. Kidney disease is also higher in adults with the above diseases.ObesityObesity, especially in the urban areas, is a rapidly growing problem. Three per cent of Indians are obese and 25 per cent are overweight. The factors that have contributed to this are better incomes, lack of exercise, increased consumption of high calorific foods and junk food. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and osteoporosis, and worsens arthritis.MenopauseThe age of menopause in Indian women is between 46-48 years. Women going through it can suffer from hot flushes, weight gain, depression and osteoporosis. The incidence of some female cancers also increases after menopause.CancerThe incidence of female cancers, especially of breast, cervix and ovary, is higher after the age of 40. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer in Indian women surpassing cervical cancer.DepressionDepression occurs more commonly in women than men. It has far reaching effects if not recognised and treated early. Changes in the hormone levels especially before a period, after delivery and during menopause can increase the risk of depression. This is apart from the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to it.What can women do to remain healthy?Eat a healthy diet comprising fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains.Eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day, excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy rootsUnsaturated fats found in fish, avocado, nuts, sunflower, canola and olive oil are preferable to saturated fats found in meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream cheese, ghee and lardRegular exercise (in addition of a healthy diet) and maintaining a healthy weight (check your BMI) will help cut down risk of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, obesity, osteoporosis and risk of fractures and possibly reduce the risk of certain cancers like breast cancer and colon cancer.Screen for breast and cervical cancer regularlyQuitting smoking, chewing of tobacco, paan or gutka, cutting down on alcohol will go a long way in reducing the risk or cancer and lung diseaseLess than 5 gm of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day should be used(The writer is director, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist, Fortis La Femme Hospital, Richmond Road)"
2021-01-08,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/jan/08/poison-on-the-plate-markets-see-rise-in-fake-food-products-2247212.html,Poison on the plate: Markets see rise in fake food products,"Asish Mehta ByExpress News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: You eat with your eyes first, goes an adage. But going just by the looks of it may prove fatal considering the extent of spurious food that have made their way into the open markets, particularly from Cuttack. The recent raids by the Commissionerate Police are a pointer to the volume of fake and sub-standard food items laced with chemicals flooding the markets.What are you consuming?From ghee, honey, turmeric and chilli powders to tomato sauce and soya chunks, the food adulteration network runs deep. The products are prepared using harmful chemicals, colours and sold to unsuspecting consumers at cheaper rates. A report suggests that spurious ghee is a heady mix of palm oil, vanaspati and yellow chemical colour; honey is prepared using water, sugar and chemical colour. For turmeric powder, the adulterators use waste rice powder and non-edible synthetic yellow colour.The list does not end here. Soya chunks are prepared using flour and ammonium bicarbonate (a levelling agent) that makes the dough light and airy besides, chilli powder is laced with non-edible aniline dyes. The innocuous ketchups that go into your noodles, rolls and fast food are prepared using cheap red, orange and green colours along with a mixture of pumpkin, potato and tomato paste. These sauces are easily available in the market and commonly used by street food vendors.Capital Hospitals Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (FMT) consultant Dr LK Behera says adulterated food can cause serious health hazards and lead to diseases like cancer. Turmeric is often adulterated by mixing wood powder and can cause obstruction in the intestine while chemicals in food products can cause cancer, gastroenteritis, liver and skin diseases, and others, he says.Profits First, Health SecondThe trade of spurious food is booming and food adulterators make a profit of 200 per cent (pc) through the illegal trade as cost of production is cheap.For example, production cost of a kg of refined honey is Rs 200 but that of adulterated honey is only Rs 40 which though sells for Rs 140 per kg in the market, says a report by Commissionerate Police. Whereas pure honey costs Rs 300 a kg and has a profit margin of 15 pc, sale of spurious honey brings 100 pc profit.Similarly, production of branded and popular tomato or chilli sauce would cost Rs 120 per kg but the spurious and low-quality costs only Rs 30. The genuine sauce costs Rs 160 per kg having a profit margin of 20 pc but the fake one is sold at Rs 70 per kg with an 80 pc profit margin.The production cost of pure turmeric and chilli powders is Rs 150 per kg and adulterated is Rs 70 per kg. Unadulterated turmeric and chilli powders are available for Rs 260 per kg with a profit margin of 20 pc and the spurious powders are sold for Rs 120 per kg having a profit margin of about 60 pc.Similarly, adulteration of clarified butter or ghee is equally profitable with the unscrupulous elements earning 40 pc profit from the business. Production of ghee costs Rs 300 per kg and a kg of the spurious stock can be prepared with just Rs 80. Pure ghee is available in the market between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the spurious counterpart is available at Rs 150 a kg.When it comes to soybeans, production cost is Rs 60 per kg as compared to Rs 30 per kg for the unadulterated item. Soybeans are sold for Rs 80 per kg in the market with 15 pc profit margin as compared to Rs 50 for the adulterated product having 40 pc profit margin. Its the high profit margin which drives these spurious food manufactures to sustain, says Cuttack DCP Prateek Singh who has gone after the adulterators in his area of operation.The Market & ConsumersThe recent raids show food adulteration mafia operates mostly out of Cuttack city and Jagatpur which are hubs of manufacturing consumer goods besides outskirts of the Millennium City where they can remain low-profile. The businesses have been flourishing as surveillance by Cuttack district administration as well as the municipal corporation is next to nothing.The consumer base, though, is spread across the region and food class. Much of the low-standard food is consumed by caterers which use the cost advantage to save on spending. Fast food makers are a big consumer base too as they pay little attention to health and hygiene; nor do their buyers.These manufacturers also focus on suburban and rural landscape of neighbouring districts where quality of packaged food is never under scrutiny due to poor surveillance of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, says an officer.Last year, Commissionerate Police alone registered 21 cases against production of adulterated food items and arrested 25 persons arrested while seizing goods worth over Rs 7.36 crore. This means the overall business of such spurious food manufacturers run into tens of crores rupees across the State, just going by the volume exposed by Twin City Police.Intensifying SurveillanceThe raids have led to alarm but also brought relief from people in general that adulterated food is being obliterated from the markets. Locals have urged police to continue raids at food manufacturing units to arrest the menace. Surveillance is the need of the hour, they said. Apparently, such illegal units continue to thrive due to complacence of the municipal corporations and district administrations. Consider this: Odisha scored only 53.15 pc in Food Safety and Standards Authority of Indias second State Food Safety Index in 2019-20.This index is based on performance of the State on five significant parameters - human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing (infrastructure and surveillance), training and capacity building, and consumer empowerment. The Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model that provides an objective framework for evaluating food safety across all States/UTs. FSSAI states that states scoring below 60 pc score need a push.Keep an Eye on PricesCuttack-Bhubaneswar Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi has urged citizens to not compromise with price while buying food items as adulterated products cost less in open markets. People must inform police if they find the price of a food product to be surprisingly low.Our raids will continue so that health is not a casualty. We have also requested Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the land allotment of the units found to be involved in manufacturing adulterated food items and take necessary action against them, said Sarangi.Food adulteration is conducted to alter the taste and quantity and can have serious impacts on an individuals health. People must be alert, Dr Behera cautions."
2021-01-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/farmers-protest-in-delhi-political-not-part-of-it-bharatiya-kisan-sangh-7138978/,"Farmers’ protest in Delhi  political, not part of it: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh","The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a farmers body associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), came out in support of the Union government on the new farm laws in Gandhinagar on Friday saying that they are not part of the ongoing farmers protest on the Delhi border as it is political in nature.The Sangh also announced a countrywide campaign on Republic Day to educate people on the new farm laws.Speaking at a press conference in Gandhinagar on Friday, Mohini Mohan Mishra, national secretary of BKS, said, We are not part of this agitation because it has given ample space to politicians to spread their agenda and these people (protestors) have no control over violence. The agitation that is going on at the Delhi border is primarily due to issues faced by the farmers of Punjab and Haryana.Mishra added, We believe that the new farm laws are for the benefit of farmers across the country especially small, landless farmers. To repeal the laws for a section of farmers (those protesting) is not a viable option. At the beginning of the farmers agitation, BKS was in dilemma as we could see many political figures hijacking the agitation. We told the agitating Kisan unions to not allow any political figures at their protests but today we all know the path this agitation has taken.Announcing its plan to conduct a national drive to educate people in villages regarding the new farm laws, Mishra said, Over 150 representatives of the BKS met in Bengaluru from January 1 to January 3 where it was decided to undertake a membership drive in one lakh villages by the end of this year, we intend to set up our committees at gram, taluka and district levels. There are many misconceptions and misunderstandings with regard to the new farm laws and on January 26, we will hold a nationwide campaign to educate people in villages on the new law.The BKS also added that it has given its own set of demands to the union government on the new farm laws and said that they will hold an agitation in the future in a peaceful manner.When the new farm laws were being introduced, BKS studied it and gave four demands to the Union government that included portal registration of traders, abolishment of tax on farming, setting up of kisan courts and bank guarantee by traders. Of these, the government accepted the first two demands and we will keep fighting for the next two in the interest of farmers. We believe that both open markets and Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC)s must be there for the farmers, said Mishra.When asked about the recent comments by Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel on the agitating farmers, calling them Khalistanis, tukde tukde gang and anti-nationals, Mishra said, This is a political fight and he has spoken politically. Farmers can also eat potatoes and not just regular citizens When Canadian PM Justin Trudeau made a speech on the agitation, we felt Khalistani supporters might be behind it."
2021-01-09,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/food-parks-the-for-crop-diversification-7139248/,Food Parks — the mega push that did mighty little for crop diversification,"Amidst the ongoing protests against the three agri laws and the demand for legal sanctity to minimum support price (MSP), experts have raised questions on the sustainability of the wheat-paddy cycle of farming and pointed that if peasants, especially those in Punjab, want to increase their income, they must opt for crop diversification  something that has remained a distant dream in the state.As then Union Food Processing Minister, Shiromani Akali Dal leader and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal  she resigned from the Cabinet last year in protest against the three agri laws  pushed for crop diversification in Punjab and got three mega food park projects sanctioned for state. The information gathered by The Indian Express, however, reveals that the food parks have not given much fillip to crop diversification.The first such project  International Mega Food Park Limited (IMFPL) worth Rs 130 crore and spread in an area of 55 acres  was set up in Fazilka district. It ran into financial trouble in 2018, nearly four years after becoming operational in October 2014 during the Harsimrats second tenure as Union Food Processing Minister.Read | Pune start-up helps farmers make crops more resilient to changing climateA functionary of the IMFPL informed that the park had been in financial trouble and National Company Law Tribunal had appointed an administrator for resurrecting the it and infuse investment by new investors.The functionary said the only facility which was currently functional there was a venture by Schreiber Dynamix Dairies Private Limited (SDDPL) and Tetra Pak South Asia Markets, manufacturing beverages using fruit concentrates.Before it ran into fiscal woes, the park housed facilities for processing milk and manufacturing milk powder (Novello brand), Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) line to freeze peas and power generation from husk, among others.On June 30, 2019, IMFPL chairman and managing director Sukhinder Singh was booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly orchestrating a fraud of Rs 33 crore  the amount it had taken as loan from the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).As per the FIR, the fraud where bills of industrial machinery were allegedly forged, was carried out by the IMFPL through its machinery supplier, Food & Biotech Engineers Pvt Ltd. The FIR also named Sukhinders wife Kanwal Sukhinder Singh, son Simarinder Singh, and others.Explained | How can Punjab achieve crop diversification?The second project of Union Food Processing ministry promoted and developed by Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) in Ladhowal in Ludhiana, as per the information gathered by The Indian Express reveals, has an occupancy of only little more than 33 per cent of the plotted area.The Rs 117-crore PAIC project, which also goes by the name of Gur Kirpa Mega Food Project, is yet to be formally inaugurated. Three players, however, had started their operations in the park between 2018 and 2019, said a government functionary.In the total plotted area of 54 acres out of the total 100 acres of the project land (which include roads, green belt and other parameters), 12 food processing units have come forward to start operations on 17 acres of land.Also Read | For farmers, agency means choiceGodrej Tyson, which is into ready to eat and cook products and frozen food; Iscon Balaji, which is into production of potato flakes; and Meat Masters, which is into frozen meat products, have already started commercial production at PAIC food park. The other nine players who have come forward to start operations there are Field Fresh Foods (sauces, mayonnaise: brand Del Monte); Sharman Jain (sweets, bakery and ready-to-eat products); Shree Sharda Shakti (bakery products); Rishika Foods (bakery products); Shri Sant (fruit murrabas, crushes); Gamut Foods (confectionery food products); Roseberg (namkeens), and A Qube (ready to eat products).In February last year, a penalty of Rs 2.5 crore was imposed on Punjab after Harsimrat, as then Union minister, alleged that the Congress government in state led by Captain Amarinder Singh was deliberately delaying the mega food park project in Ludhiana.Also Read | Corn to onions  Burari ground, once feared as a jail, now a field for farmersPAIC general manager (Projects) Japinder Bajwa, however, said that the state government had not been at fault because the penalty was based on plot occupancy. Bajwa said a cut was made by the Centre in third tranche of the grant as there was less than 25 per cent of the plot occupancy in the park at that time.Grants are released conditionally. To receive fourth grant, a minimum of 75 per cent plots should have been sold, said Bajwa, adding that state government cannot do much in that scenario and it depended entirely on market players coming forward to buy plots.Opinion | Govt must promote crop diversification by setting MSP for other crops as wellThe plot occupancy in the Ludhiana park remains around 33 per cent, despite the fact that any industrialist setting up a unit can get loan from NABARD. There is another incentive  the industry is offered 35 per cent subsidy, maximum upto Rs 5 crore, on plant and machinery.Bajwa, meanwhile, added that we are coming up with a state-of-the-art food testing laboratory, which would have certification from National Accreditation Board (NABL).The third and latest of the three projects in Punjab, Sukhjit Mega Food Park and Infra Limited (SMFPIL), was inaugurated by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in November last year, after Harsimrat quit the Union Cabinet.The 107.83-crore project is spread over 55 acres in Kapurathalas Rehana Jattan village. The land has been taken on a 30-year lease by the promoter. The Centre has so far released a grant of Rs 38.76 crore.The mega food park, among other operations, is aimed at encouraging cultivation of maize in the region, which had been a traditional maize growing belt before the crop pattern tilted towards wheat-paddy cycle.We are moving towards stabilization phase, said SMFPIL CMD Bhavdeep Sardana. We have set up a maize-based anchor unit at a cost of over Rs 100 crore. The central and Punjab governments have encouraged us to create facilities to give an alternate option to the farmers, other than paddy. The park will cater to traditional maize growing belt. The idea is to create industrial demand, said Sardana, elaborating that products lines in the park would include starches, sweeteners, starch derivates which go into food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, textiles, papers and poultry and cattle feed.Sardana, however, said that due to Covid-19 pandemic, and a policy clause, both big and small investors, respectively, were not coming forward to set up the units in the park.He added that while big investors had postponed their investment activities, the smaller ones were not going for getting plots as they are not allowed to mortgage the leased land to get loans.Due to Covid, Sardana said, there were delays in commissioning of the machinery imported from China for the anchor plant as zoom meetings were the only way where technical assistance was being sought to commission the machinery.He added that once we reach full capacity, we would be able to process 600 tonnes maize a day and more than 2 lakh tonnes per annum.Marketing of maize will be no longer a problem for farmers. They can sell in vicinity. Not only maize, they can also sell vegetables like carrot, peas, cauliflower etc if the local entrepreneurs join hands to set up such units in the park, said Sardana.Noted agri-economist and Chancellor of Central University of Punjab at Bathinda, Sardara Singh Johl said, I do not see any crop diversification happening in Punjab. Until and unless there is assurance of equal marketing and income as is the case with wheat and paddy, there are no chances of crop diversification.Johl added that while designing such mega food projects, the viability has to be seen. He added that comprehensive scheme should be in place, demand for the alternate crops should be created and businessmen and industrialists should be taken on board.Harsimrat was not available for comments despite repeated attempts."
2021-01-09,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zaki-ur-rehman-lakhvi-the-terror-mastermind/article33538780.ece,Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi | The terror mastermind,"Mumbai attack mastermind jailed over fears of FATF action over terror financingJust six days after his arrest on January 2, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the known Lashkar-e-Taiba mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes, was sentenced to a five-year jail term on terror financing charges on January 8.The speed with which the wheels of justice turned in Pakistan in the case of Lahkhvis terror financing case are in sharp contrast to the years he remained charged in the Mumbai attack case, in which he was eventually bailed out.Also read: Ahead of crucial FATF meeting, Pakistan arrests LeT leader LakhviIts evident that where Indian pressure and American prodding didnt work in ensuring Lakhvis conviction in the Mumbai terror strikes, in which 166 persons were killed, Islamabads fears about punitive action from the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, seem to have done the trick.Islamabad has been facing the heat from the financial watchdog for some time on the issue of terror financing and has called upon Pakistan to make sure it complies fully with its action plan prior to a key FATF meeting in February.Saeeds convictionLakhvis sentence is also in line with that of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeeds conviction in four terror-financing cases in November and February 2020. In October 2020, FATF decided that Pakistan would remain on its grey list, pending full compliance with its action plan.In a statement, FATF said Pakistan needed to work in four areas to address strategic deficiencies as far as terror financing was concerned. Among other things, Pakistan needed to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all [UN-mandated] 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists.Also read: U.S. welcomes arrest of 26/11 attack mastermind and LeT commander LakhviSo, here we have the context behind all the action from the Pakistani establishment relating to Lakhvi and Saeed, who prospered and thrived in the warm embrace of the Pakistani establishment for decades. They are now being treated as a public liability and, hence, the arrests and rather speedy convictions.Also, key for the Pakistan Army/ intelligence establishment is that their convictions are not in relation to an India-related terrorist case. Bending before India, or being seen to be bending before India, is not good policy for any Pakistani establishment. The fallout of an India-terror related conviction would be a hot potato to handle, given that many key figures in the Pakistani establishment said at the time of the Mumbai terror strikes that these had been conducted by India itself.Also read: India terms action against Lakhvi a farceIn Lakhvis case, the prosecution seems to have had its way with the Lahore anti-terrorism court judge. The court was informed that Lakhvi was a founding member of the banned LeT, which was proscribed in the country in 2002 due to its involvement in terrorism, while the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) has also imposed financial restrictions on him, The Express Tribune reported on Friday. The court held that a dispensary was under Lashkars charge and being used for terrorist purposes.In all, the Dawn newspaper reported that the Pakistani Punjabs counter-terrorist department had registered 41 FIRs against Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the parent wing of the Lashkar) leaders, of which trial courts had decided as many as 27 cases.Strategic decisionIts clear that a strategic decision has been taken to shut down the JuD-Lashkar combine by the Pakistani establishment. However, even during his time as an under trial detainee in Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, Lakhvi could receive guests and use the Internet, access a mobile phone and watch television. He is even believed to have fathered a child while in jail. So, the jury will have to wait and watch what kind of jail treatment awaits Lakhvi this time.The secrecy with which the Pakistani deep State operates makes it difficult to assess what exactly is happening. A recent arrest warrant for Masood Azhar, leader of the Jaish-e-Muhammad, confirms after years the presence of the wanted terrorist in Pakistan. Remember that Azhar was one of the terrorists exchanged by India in return for the passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight to Kandahar in December 1999. Given their being creatures of the Pakistani establishment, and the enduring interest in using non-State actors to foment trouble in Jammu and Kashmir, its quite likely that new outfits may have already received the blessings of the deep State. For now, Lakhvi and Saeed are in jail. Azhars fate will be keenly watched in India."

It emerged as a health crisis but went on to trigger social and economic crisis, threatening wellbeing and lives of people in most countries. Both Centre and Odisha government imposed restrictions like closure of public institutions and facilities to ensure social distancing, mobility and public transport through lockdowns and shutdowns. People were stranded on road, widespread loss of livelihood was reported as social and economic activities were paused.JSPL Foundation, the CSR arm of Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL), stepped up efforts and joined hands with the government and community, especially around its operational areas in three eastern States - Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to defeat the COVID pandemic. Guided by JSPL Chairman Naveen Jindal and under leadership of Shallu Jindal, chairperson of JSPL Foundation, the CSR arm started its on-ground services, helping the poor and vulnerable, immediately after the announcement of COVID-19 lockdown in the country.At Angul, JSPL Foundation collaborated with the district administration as well as the locals to defeat the drudgery of the pandemic. Beginning March 29, 2020, it started providing cooked food and dry ration to the needy and vulnerable under it Mission Zero Hunger initiative around all the operational locations of JSPL in three states. The Foundation provided 1,70,000 meals to street dwellers, the stranded truck drivers and migrant workforce and other poor and vulnerable people.In Angul district alone, 25,000 meals were provided. Besides, JSPL Foundation supplied dry rations for 90 days to various destitute shelters and care homes such as old age homes, child care centres, shelter homes for destitute women and homes for special children. Food materials such as rice, dal, oil, jaggery, sugar, chiwda, poha, potatoes, onions, soybean and black peas were given to them which constituted materials for about 1,30,000 meals.Besides providing food to the vulnerable, JSPL Foundation also took several measures to prevent spread of COVID-19 in and around JSPLs steel plants. It distributed more than three lakh face masks among the community members, frontline COVID-19 warriors. It also provided face cover masks and sanitary kits to all the anganwadi workers and helpers in 1,654 anganwadi centres of Angul district. In Angul district only, 1.2 lakh facemasks were distributed. Similarly, more than 70,000 families, including 30,000 in Angul, benefited by the sanitisers, soaps and phenyl distributed by the Foundation.Interestingly, these masks, sanitisers and hand wash were made by women members of Self Help Groups promoted by JSPL Foundation. Production of the masks, sanitisers, hand wash and phenyl, for which they have certified license, the women SHG members generated cash income during the wage crunch period. More than 250 vegetable and dairy farmers of Angul were supported to make regular supply of their farm produces in the local community.During the period, Asha The Hope centre run by JSPL Foundation at Angul that provides rehabilitation and support services to specially-abled children continued its support through mobile and online means. It organised video sessions and online counseling to ensure no loss of acquired knowledge and skills by the children with special needs. The therapists also provided doorstep services, benefitting about 60 specially-abled children. Asha The Hope centre at Raigarh and Patratu extended similar support services in their respective areas.JSPL Foundation also organised awareness sessions on prevention of COVID-19 in rural areas and sensitised community members on social distancing, hand washing and hygiene, need for staying at home and following lock down rules. It used various channels like radio jingles in local languages, community meetings (with social distancing), demonstrations and social media to create awareness.JSPL also provided 19 tons of oxygen for use by various COVID-19 hospitals in Angul District.The company contributed ` 25 crore to PM CARES Fund to fight the global pandemic. Besides, it also distributed more than 60,000 hot cooked meals among the slum dwellers and migrant workers in Delhi.The company supported its own employees and workers during the pandemic. Work from home, regular communication on preventive measures and self-care to fight COVID-19, arrangement of sanitisers, hand wash, mask, thermal screening etc. for employees were regularly provided. A team of doctors dedicated to each unit of the steel company were set up for supervising health of the employees."
2021-01-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/brian-kelly-the-man-who-turned-credit-card-points-into-an-empire-7140800/,Brian Kelly: The man who turned credit-card points into an empire,"Written by Jamie Lauren KeilesThey came to Dubrovnik by cruise ship or Ryanair  members of a new hypermobile class of tourist, who traveled for cheap and didnt stay long. Theyd seen its walled Old Town on Game of Thrones, and they wanted to be there themselves, so they went. Venice, Barcelona, certain beaches in Thailand  these places had all faced their own overtouristing problems, but even by this standard, Dubrovnik was extreme. On busy days, tourists could outnumber permanent Old Town residents about 6 to 1. With a main thoroughfare less than a thousand feet long, this pressure on the citys charm was overwhelming. By 2017, tourism had so overburdened the Old Town that UNESCO was threatening to revoke its World Heritage status. Mayor Mato Frankovic set out to save his city by sabotage, capping passage through the gates at 4,000 daily visitors and functionally banning new restaurants. Nevertheless, the tourists kept coming.But then, around March 2020, they stopped. After the Diamond Princess debacle, no more cruise ships appeared in the port. Airplanes were grounded, then took flight again  ending an age of quick and easy travel and ushering in a new, slower one. Pandemic travel was arduous and impeded by knotty, sometimes contradictory governmental guidelines. To travel under these conditions required an unhinged urge to take flight and a bureaucrats eye for parsing fine print. Brian Kelly, the founder of a website called The Points Guy, had both  plus a few million unused frequent-flier miles. This was how, on Saturday, Aug. 7, he found himself heading from New York to Dubrovnik, to see the walled city with nobody there.His trip began at 2 p.m. the day before, with an express nasal swab at NYU Langone Medical Center. Travelers arriving in Croatia were at that time required to present a negative coronavirus test no more than 48 hours old. Between test-processing time and travel time, the tight window posed a logistical challenge. But Kelly, as the face of the worlds most popular credit-card rewards blog, had plenty of experience interpreting strict guidelines. For 10 years, readers had come to his site for help turning terms of service into free trips. In this way, the pandemic was another day at work. That afternoon, he posted footage of his nasal swab to Instagram. Nine hours later, he shared his results: negative.The following evening, he arrived at J.F.K. ready to board a Virgin Atlantic flight to London. The business-class ticket cost him 57,500 miles, plus $724 cash. He eased his way through the TSA PreCheck line and signed into the Delta Sky Club lounge. (The airline, he knew, had a partnership with Virgin.) A bartender announced the evening special: 10,000 points for a bottle of Dom Prignon. On that day, The Points Guy  which publishes monthly cash valuations of the top 45 rewards currencies  had Delta miles trading at 1.1 cent each. Kelly did a quick calculation in his head: The deal was worth about $110. The same bottle of Dom at a restaurant might go for $250, or more. He ordered the Champagne.The flight boarded at 10 p.m. Kelly counted just 12 passengers in the 44-seat business-class cabin. Everyone was wearing a mask, and some fell asleep wearing two (face and eye). Flying during Covid is kind of like flying private, Kelly told me later. I had my own A350 plane. The transfer at Heathrow went smoothly. The flight touched down in Croatia just in time. Kelly presented his negative test results.Dubrovnik that day was near-empty and majestic, saved by disease from the lure of its own beauty. Kelly met up with his friend Mauricio, a furloughed fashion merchandiser from Miami, and they made plans to meet up with more friends and all rent a boat to hop around the nearby islands. The idea was that by the time they docked again, theyd all have been in Europe for two weeks, freeing them up to travel on to other places. This was a sort of loophole in the strict E.U. travel restrictions. Kelly knew that international travel was not, at the moment, feasible for the average Points Guy reader, but he had the points, the Covid status and the time to allow his readers to travel vicariously through him. He had no idea when the world might reopen. For now, he was content to enjoy the solitude.No cruise ships, no mass tourists, he says.Just the reigning king of cheap travel, enjoying a momentary upside to its downfall.THE SEEDS OF cheap travel were planted in the 1970s, as U.S. airline deregulation drove down the cost (and luxuriousness) of flying. The boom would not begin for another two decades, when self-book travel websites curtailed travel agents power, removing considerable friction from the market and allowing the consumer to take flight more casually. In 2018, according to the United Nations, global tourist arrivals reached a record annual high of 1.4 billion  a 56-fold increase since the end of World War II. This boom, like all booms, had its clear-cut losers (locals, the environment) and winners (home-sharing platforms, crowdsourced review sites, wanderlusting influencers).Somewhere in this mix is The Points Guy, and its domain is the set of novel currencies issued by airlines and credit cards. Points are ersatz money that you earn by spending real money, a form of currency hidden inside of another. And loyalty programs, as the broader sector is known, are businesses inside businesses. On an ordinary, nonpandemic weekday, an American might encounter half a dozen opportunities to accrue loyalty points, from morning coffee (Starbucks Rewards) to daily commute (Exxon Mobil Rewards+) to lunch break (Chipotle Rewards) to after-work errands (CVS ExtraCare points) to date night (Regal cinemas Crown Club). The degree to which loyalty programs actually increase customer loyalty varies widely from program to program. Good programs dangle a deliberate carrot, forging customer loyalty and heightening what behavioral economists call switching costs. They exploit perceived thrift and a fantasy of status to make users want to earn, and thereby spend.Within the loyalty-program space, travel and credit-card rewards are by far the most successful and well known. As one oft-cited, almost-certainly imaginary airline executive once put it, People are willing to pay anything for a free ticket. Travel rewards pose a compelling incentive  a shortcut to the playgrounds of the globalized elite. (Or, if not that, at least a chance to sit in the part of the airplane where cocktails are free.) And yet, as rewards programs have multiplied, the earned point has grown increasingly complex and fungible: A Chase Ultimate Rewards point, worth about 2 cents as I write, can also be converted to a British Airways mile, which in turn can be transferred to Iberia Plus, or cashed out for a ticket on Cathay Pacific, or used to book a rental car with Hertz. The Points Guy helps readers navigate this web.Since 2010, The Points Guy has published over 30,000 blog posts: hotel, airline and cruise-ship reviews, next to wonkish analyses of rewards-program fine print. (Some typical headlines: Why the Amex Gold Is the Perfect In Between Credit Card; How to Get to Puerto Rico on Miles and Points; Why I Canceled Bora Bora Again.) Kelly is only the face of the site; the guy is now voiced by a 30-person team of credit-card experts, aviation reporters and expats from legacy travel media. Older travel publications sell a daydream: crisp ocean vistas, street side cafes, European hamlets with more steeples than people. The Points Guy sells that daydream as a promise, upholding a sworn oath to help you maximize your travel.This is not a false promise, at least not on an individual basis. Almost anyone with a decent credit score can get a free vacation by following the protocol outlined in the T.P.G. Beginners Guide. First, forget your debit card. Your debit card has no point  pun intended. It takes without giving and spends without earning. Wouldnt you rather know that all the money you spend is like an investment toward your next trip?If the answer is yes, your next step is credit. Since the chuh-CHUNK days of the Diners Club card, the credit-card industry has evolved from a substitute for checks into a passport to total convenience. The latest credit cards, known on the market as premium cards, charge an annual fee for access to deluxe amenities: airline lounges, free TSA PreCheck, travel reimbursements and, most crucial, points. Convertible, transferable  practically alchemical  points turn diapers and caramel macchiatos into premium status, and first-class upgrades, and over-water villas at the Conrad Maldives. Points accrue passively, without apparent work, taunting the labor theory of value by simply appearing on your monthly credit-card statement.On The Points Guy Instagram feed, there is proof of all the ways that household-budget straw might be spun into travel gold: Honeymooners hold hands in lie-flat seats. Retirees see the Taj Mahal at last. A cancer survivor with a new lease on life strikes a pose at the worlds tallest indoor waterfall. Two dads with two kids take a family selfie, en route to a free getaway in Cancn. Three shades dominate the color palate: vitreous ocean blue, white sand and cleanable-seat-back-headrest navy. Here, the legroom goes on forever. All the rooms are suites, all the pools are infinite and anyone can live like a billionaire, so long as you play your credit cards right.Dont have a premium credit card yet? The Points Guy is happy to sign you up for one. This is, in fact, the sites main source of revenue. Wander the labyrinth of guides and reviews, and soon youll encounter your first sign-up bonus: 60,000 for Chase Sapphire Preferred; 100,000 points for a Capital One Venture. Why should running money through this essentially arbitrary chain of transactions produce value? Does it? The Points Guy is barely concerned with such questions. With one new card, a free trip can be yours. Just enter your address and your mothers maiden name.THE POINTS GUY is headquartered in New York City, in a midrise office building just north of Union Square. I went there to visit on Feb. 10, a month or so before the pandemic would devastate the U.S. travel industry. Stepping off the elevator, I felt no sense of impending collapse. The office floor whirred with bullish momentum. Inside a glass-walled conference room, a blogger pecked out posts from a converted airline seat, salvaged from a defunct Concorde turbojet.Kellys office was spacious and clean, appearing mostly ceremonial. In 2012, The Points Guy was purchased by Bankrate, a consumer-finance company, which in turn was acquired by Red Ventures  a portfolio of service-y sites, including Lonely Planet, CreditCards.com, Safety.com, Reviews.com and HigherEducation.com. Kelly stayed on through both acquisitions, retaining the title of chief executive and remaining the figurehead of the brand. In a typical year, he spends about four months traveling, splitting the rest of his time between two homes in the West Village and Bucks County, Pa., where he grew up. Still, when you go on vacation for a living, the line between personal and professional life can be hard to draw. (A March 2020 Business Insider article highlighted this lack of boundaries, reporting that Kelly had made passes at freelancers and snorted cocaine in front of colleagues on a business trip to the Nobu Hotel Las Vegas. Kelly and Red Ventures denied any wrongdoing.)A bank of shelves, behind a large and empty desk, showcased evidence of Kellys airport-lounge lifestyle: an unopened box of Veuve Clicquot; a scale model of a Singapore Airlines jet; two copies of Rich Bitch: A Simple 12-Step Plan for Getting Your Financial Life Together  Finally. (The author was a guest on his podcast.) In the corner of the room, on a gray sectional sofa, Kelly, in dark-wash jeans and Gucci boots, reclined into a stockpile of novelty throw pillows. One was inspired by air-traffic-control lingo (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.). Another showed a dozen smiling Celine Dions. A third, in brassy, boldface type, asked, DO I LOOK LIKE I FLY ECONOMY? At 6 feet 7 inches tall, he did not. He spoke with a frank insiderishness that made me feel as if I shouldnt, either.On TSA PreCheck: I havent waited more than five minutes in years.On the Concorde: Id rather be in a lie-flat bed for six hours than a cramped seat for three. Whose time is that valuable?On the diminishing thrills of success: The joy of a 50,000-point sign-up bonus is lost when now our corporate cards earn up to two million points a month.Kelly found points and miles as a child. One morning in 1996, his father, a health care consultant, came to him and said: Hey, I have all these frequent-flier miles. If you can figure out how to use them, well go somewhere. Kelly, age 13  closeted, gay, fabulous, by his own description  called the US Airways customer-service line, asked a few questions in his best adult voice, then hung up and told his parents, OK, were going to the Cayman Islands! (Hed first heard about the Caribbean hideaway in John Grishams best-selling thriller The Firm.) A few months later, the family of six was wheels-up on a zero-dollar flight to paradise. Thus, a devotion to miles was born.In college, at the University of Pittsburgh, Kelly earned US Airways Gold status flying to and from student-government conferences on the universitys dime. After graduation, he moved to New York and eventually wound up in human resources at Morgan Stanley, recruiting at college job fairs (and racking up airline miles in the process). The year after he started, the economy collapsed  a failure of too-imaginative financial widgets. Morgan Stanley downsized. Kelly found himself on the firing squad, waiting outside conference-room doors to escort the casualties down to the lobby. This was thankless, demoralizing work. The lifers sometimes cried. Kelly went home feeling drained. Miles and points became an escape  rewarding on some higher plane of human need. He learned the fine print of his corporate Amex card and earned a water-cooler reputation as the points guy. In spring 2010, he unveiled a simple website, where visitors could pay him for help booking vacations.This first version of The Points Guy went online just as several economic trends converged. As the economy began to improve, credit-card companies were looking for ways to regain the customers they lost during the downturn. Chase had just poached a top executive from American Express  the reigning rewards charge card at the time  and had just introduced Chase Ultimate Rewards, a new, flexible points currency designed to draw millennials into the premium-card market. Kelly added a blog to his site in June 2010, just as many other miles hobbyists were launching credit-card blogs of their own. But only Kelly was lucky enough to come across a way to turn this passion into money. In February 2011, a distant friend who had come across the site reached out and asked Kelly to meet him for dinner.I thought he was asking me out on a date, Kelly says. He was like, Lets meet up, I can help you with your blog, and I was like, OK, thats like the lamest excuse.The two sat down for a pinot grigio near the Morgan Stanley office in Times Square. The friend, it turned out, was an account manager at LinkShare (now Rakuten), which specialized in affiliate marketing  an online sales tactic in which a company pays a commission to bloggers for selling its product. If you wrote a blog post that got the top Google ranking for, say, best nonstick skillet, and put in an affiliate link to the product, you could earn money for every customer you brought in. This was a relatively novel concept in 2011. To Kelly, it seemed spammy, but what did he have to lose besides time? The friend signed him up as a Chase affiliate, and Kelly put up a blog post about the Chase United card. That first month, Kelly says, he earned $5,000 in affiliate payouts. The following month, he earned $20,000. The month after that, he earned $130,000. I dont like talking about numbers, Kelly says. But basically, it just picked up from there.At the time we sat down in his office, The Points Guy had reached a peak of about 12 million monthly unique readers. Up on the wall, a flat-screen TV reeled off a feed of metrics from the site. The blog, by then, had published 16 posts about what we then called the novel coronavirus, covering rerouted cruise ships and suspended flights from China weeks before most mainstream publications. Still, the outbreak remained a curiosity; none of the posts were cracking the Top 10.The main thing on Kellys horizon that day was a new Points Guy app, which he hoped would be released by June, after months of delays. The app, he explained, was designed to synthesize the terms of different loyalty programs, helping people choose which transactions to put on which credit card. Beyond sign-up bonuses and regular spending, a major way to rack up points is by playing the so-called category bonuses  e.g. 5x points on dining  which vary among cards and change all the time. Hardcore earners keep track of these rules in Excel spreadsheets, or by sticking Post-it Notes to their cards. The Points Guy app would make the chaos systematic, opening the hobby up to more casual earners.Mastercard now has Lyft credits. Amex has off Uber. Chase now has Lyft, too Kelly said, trailing off. It is dizzying  the amount of constantly changing promotions and targets.More dizzying than racking up points is figuring out how to spend efficiently. Most casual credit-card users think of rewards as a freebie. The Points Guy thinks in terms of cold, hard cash, and wants you to get the most freebies for your money. Beyond publishing points-to-cents valuations, the site also posts step-by-step instructions for transferring points among the currencies themselves. Most airlines and credit cards have transfer partners, and those transfer partners have their own partners. By converting points among the different programs, a traveler can arbitrage his way to better deals. This convoluted system formed incidentally, over many years, as airlines and credit cards formed ad hoc agreements. Kelly, who told me he has 25 credit cards and employs a full-time staff member to manage his and his companys rewards, admitted he still messes up the calculus. Ill post on Instagram, Im using Alaska Airlines to fly American Airlines to fly to London first class, and people will be like: Dumdum! Didnt you realize if you transfer Amex to Etihad its less miles?KELLY IS A middlemans middleman  an intermediary in an industry that exists to turn intermediation into profit. There are three major players in the travel-rewards game: credit cards (banks), airlines and consumers. Points, the set of novel currencies minted by airlines, transform their vague-but-strong mutual interests into something fungible. This web of partnerships can become tangled, but generally speaking, the system works like this:Airlines issue their own frequent-flier miles, but they dont always go directly to consumers. Just as often, the currency is sold in blocks to banks. With points in hand, a bank can then issue a co-branded credit card, like the Chase Southwest Rapid Rewards card, and use the incentives to attract high-value customers. In another version of this arrangement, a bank issues its own currency, like Chase Ultimate Rewards. These points can be redeemed for just about anything. The bank converts its own points into real dollars when buying the desired reward from a third-party vendor.Points function, in most ways, as real currencies do. When airlines devalue their points  as United did recently during the pandemic to counter the glut of unspent miles  it can cause a minor shock wave, nerfing one card or supercharging another. But because travel remains such a high-value prize, what industry wonks call an aspirational reward, the minor fluctuations have not yet destabilized the market. With points in the mix, all three players generally win: Airlines make money selling rewards; consumers enjoy the indulgence of free travel; banks recruit new customers, who more than justify the upfront cost of acquisition.Its a common misconception that premium credit cards earn money mainly through interest payments and annual fees. Their meat and potatoes are interchange fees, the surcharges levied on merchants per transaction. When you pay with your credit card in a store, the owner pays the bank a percentage of your total. For certain credit cards, this fee is low  maybe 1 to 2 percent. For premium cards, like Chase Sapphire or American Express, the fees can be higher, depending on the merchant, to cover the cost of a cards amenities. (This is partly why restaurants, which operate on thin margins, sometimes exclude American Express from the list of cards they accept.) In places outside the United States, interchange fees are generally capped, which can make rewards far less rewarding. In this way, points and miles are an all-American pastime. Only here was the margin wide enough for the coupon scheme to flourish into the kind of game The Points Guys readers play.You might rightly begin the history of points with Diners Club, the first credit card, which came into use in 1950 and, through issuing monthly statements, inadvertently established a way to track and analyze consumer spending. Credit cards would eventually become an indispensable tool for administering travel-rewards programs, but it was deregulation in the 1970s that did more to establish points currencies themselves. From the Nixon administration on, think-tank types on both sides of the aisle began to advocate for regulatory reforms that decreased federal involvement in Americas largest industries. Energy was partially deregulated in 1973. Railroads began in 1976. In 1978, Jimmy Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act, which undid federal aeronautics controls in place since 1938.Before airline deregulation, flight maps and ticket prices were set centrally by the Civil Aeronautics Board. Because this prevented airlines from competing on price, they were forced to offer fliers deluxe amenities: full meals in coach, conversation-pit seating, attractive stewardesses in Oleg Cassini suits. Under the Airline Deregulation Act, carriers were free to determine their own prices, which could theoretically increase profits, but also introduced a new quandary: What would prevent the airline market from simply becoming a race to the bottom? Frequent-flier programs emerged as a way to reward customers for staying loyal. Certainly, the business traveler would spend a little more of his bosss money if it meant getting something extra for himself.Using incentives was hardly new, says Bob Crandall, American Airlines C.E.O. at the time. Supermarkets gave out S&H Green Stamps, luring customers with prizes like free toasters. In the airline industry, experiments like Uniteds 100,000 Mile Club had already demonstrated some success, but the big impediment to administering such programs was keeping track of customers. (Who could say whether the John Smith who flew New York to London was the same John Smith who flew Houston to Detroit?) On this front, American had a technological advantage  a new computerized reservation system. So we started doing some research about what kind of rewards people would like, Crandall says. The answer, somewhat obvious in hindsight, was travel.The only thing people want more than cash, as an incentive, is travel, says Hal Brierley, a consultant who helped design Americans first program. AAdvantage, as it came to be called, debuted in May of 1981 with a wave of pre-enrollment mailers directed at the airlines top customers. From the beginning, the program was tiered, with the top prize being a free round-trip ticket. If you flew 50,000 miles in one year, Brierley says, you got a first-class trip to wherever we flew, which at the time meant Go to Hawaii. Even a business guy wants a beach in Hawaii!With haste, other airlines unveiled their own mileage programs. (I credit United for having responded to the program literally over the weekend, Brierley says.) These early miles, unlike modern points, were measures of actual distance: miles flown from A to B. Program enrollees received monthly statements, tracking their progress toward the reward. At this early stage, a free trip cost an airline almost nothing to give away. Airline seats were perishable; planes take off, full or not. By turning this so-called distressed inventory into an asset, airlines retained their most loyal customers, who more than paid them back in repeat business.Within a few years, an estimated 75 percent of all business travelers had joined at least one frequent-flier program. The programs were free; there was no risk in joining. Consumer expectations were low, and most still saw the miles as a kind of funny money. Business sections, throughout the early 80s, devoted column space to explaining terms of service  and complaining about blackout dates and mileage thresholds. One reporter deemed frequent-flier programs as confusing and as complicated as Rubiks Cube. Another critic, the former senator Eugene J. McCarthy, took to The New York Times to complain:I was rarely able to take advantage of the special reduced fares, given if one scheduled three months in advance, or agreed to go on Tuesday and return on Sunday, before noon; or to complete ones round trip within the Octave of the Feast of All Saints, or of the birth of Clare Booth Luce; or buy a ticket before the spring equinox and use it before the summer solstice or, failing in that, only after the September equinox and before the winter solstice, flying west before noon and east after sundown.The gimmick reputation of early mileage programs proved to be a hindrance, but soon a set of early adopters came to see the programs for what they were worth  or rather, what they could be worth.In 1981, when AAdvantage was introduced, Randy Petersen was 30 and working in the corporate offices of Chess King, a groovy young-mens mall retailer founded on the market-research proposition that teen males loved auto-racing and chess. Flying from grand opening to grand opening to reposition racks of nylon parachute pants, Petersen accrued a free trip to Hawaii, booked a room at the Sheraton Waikiki and ate dinner at the luau every single night. When he returned to the Chess King offices in New York, his co-workers gathered around his desk with questions about taking free trips of their own. Seeing latent demand in their barrage of inquiries, Petersen put in his two weeks notice. By 1986, he had struck out on his own as the publisher, editor and only employee of the worlds first frequent-flier magazine.The first issue of InsideFlyer looked, in Petersens words, like a bad ransom note. Typewritten commentary on airline programs mixed with photocopied offers clipped from monthly statement mailers. Its first readers were road-warrior types  guys in wrinkled suits with Hartmann luggage  who traveled enough to earn a free trip now and then, but didnt go out of their way to earn further. This all changed in 1988, with the debut of Delta Triple Mileage, one of the first industry experiments in driving consumers to actually fly more than they might otherwise. The promotion, which delivered on the promise of its name, shortened the free-ticket accrual time from a period of years to a period of months. A free trip to Hawaii, which cost about 30,000 miles, used to be an ambitious goal. Now, it could be earned in one-third of the distance  just two round trips from LAX to J.F.K.For the average business traveler, Delta Triple Mileage increased the immediate value of belonging to a loyalty program. For mileage obsessives like Petersen, taking miles off the gold standard of concrete distance transformed program membership from a static, passive interest to a game that could be played. Triple Mileage gave rise to a frequent-flying frenzy, one that could be amped up even further by learning and exploiting airline-route particulars. Back then, routes were more limited, and travelers often completed the last leg of a trip with a short flight from a hub airport to a smaller regional one. To make accounting for these brief jaunts less annoying, Delta decided to compensate all flights with a minimum of 1,000 rewards miles, even when the actual distance was shorter. Under Triple Mileage, the minimum, well, tripled. And quickly, InsideFlyer readers realized that by stacking these short flights they could mint their own free trips. Flying back and forth between two short-leg cities, a rewards ticket to Hawaii could be earned in just eight continuous hours of flying. One of the most popular ones was Dallas to Austin, Petersen says. People would do that eight, nine, 10 times in a day.In time, other airlines introduced their own multiples promotions, and around them, a mileage community was born. InsideFlyer eventually spawned its own online replacement  a message board called FlyerTalk  where mileage prodigies, including Brian Kelly, would come to hear the lore of their mileage ancestors. Most stories from this Wild West time have proved impossible to fact-check in hindsight. Back in the 80s, before the T.S.A. and security theater, the number of people that used to fly under other peoples names strictly to earn frequent-flier miles was extraordinary, Petersen says. According to his memory, one high school basketball coach enlisted a whole team to fly under his name. Back and forth all weekend, he says. Between Dallas and Austin, just so he could earn bonus miles. Thats how you push the envelope. You get greedy.ONE OF THE greatest points-and-miles hustles of the pre-broadband age was something called the LatinPass Run. In the lead-up to the new millennium, a small handful of Latin American airlines formed a consortium called LatinPass. For a while, it was doing OK, but then the big global airlines came in and started eating up all of the business travelers. LatinPass needed a competitive edge, so it turned to Bobby Booth, an airline marketer out of Miami.Booths idea was to incentivize travel with the smaller carriers by creating a million-mile prize for flying at least one international segment on each of the LatinPass member airlines in one year. There were a bunch of exceptions and fine print, stuff involving rental cars, hotels and partner airlines, all of which amounted to a brain teaser for Petersen. In 2000, he worked out a plan for how you could do it and published an article in InsideFlyer saying, Im going to do it all in one weekend. Any volunteers? Three people joined the first LatinPass Run. One was a Silicon Valley investor. One was a loan officer down in Dallas. The third was an off-duty I.R.S. agent. The foursome met up in Miami on a Friday and flew 24 hours a day  up, down, connect; up, down, connect. They got into Lima, slept on the concrete floor of the airport for two hours and then caught the first flight out to Nicaragua. There was unrest in the country at the time, Petersen recalls. Youd look at all the soldiers all around with the machine guns, and think: Weve been here. This qualifies. Im not getting off. No, no, Ill sit here for two hours while you refuel.In the end, the whole run cost about $1,100 per person. The million miles, via transfer partners, were worth at least three first-class international round trips. Petersen published the details of the run, and after that, LatinPass really took off. Youd pull into Lima last flight of the day, he says, and youd look over and see a couple of other Americans in the back, because we were all in coach, and youd kind of nod your head a little bit, like I know what youre doing.In the end, about 250 people earned the million-mile bonus  more than the few dozen the program had forecast. (One was the famous Pudding Guy, immortalized by Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love.)They ended up folding that venture just a few years later, Petersen says. Just because they couldnt handle all the redemptions.LatinPass was an inflection point in loyalty-program history, marking a moment when airlines began to give more thought to the delicate math required to maintain a strong points currency. By 2005, the global pool of frequent-flier miles was accruing 10 times as fast as the open seats that made the whole system possible. That year, The Economist estimated the value of these unredeemed miles as more than the value of all the $1 bills in circulation. Consumers had embraced the frequent-flier program, but now airlines found themselves facing pressures to give away seats that would otherwise be sold. In time, more and more programs would begin selling points to banks. By turning their loyalty programs into income streams, the airlines could afford to give away more free seats. In fact, according to Evert de Boer, managing partner of an airline loyalty consulting firm, seats purchased with airline points can generate more revenue than seats purchased with cash.Today the business of selling points is more stable and more reliably profitable than the business of actually flying people places. Over time, airline performance is very volatile, de Boer says. Something happens  say, the price of oil goes up, or a competitor comes in, dumping capacity  and it constantly goes up and down, up and down, up and down   Points, by contrast, are relatively calm. Recently, in the midst of the pandemic, American Airlines used the program as collateral to secure a $7.5 billion CARES Act loan. Delta did the same with SkyMiles to get $9 billon from private lenders. As in other parts of the American economy, airlines are finding ways to become financial-service providers. There have been transactions in the past where the loyalty program was acquired or sold at a total value exceeding that of the airline, de Boer says. Its the tail wagging the dog.EARLIER THIS YEAR, on March 8, I traveled to Washington, D.C., to attend Frequent Traveler University, a travel-hacker seminar series held several times a year around the world, most often in airport-hotel conference rooms. This iteration took place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center as part of a Travel and Adventure Show that, unfortunately, coincided with the first wave of Covid travel panic. In the main hall of the convention center, two scuba instructors floated idly in an unattended demonstration pool.I arrived at the F.T.U. conference room just in time for introductory remarks by Stefan Krasowski, a blogger who had leveraged the Delta and United mileage programs to visit every U.N. member country before his 40th birthday. Krasowski, like much of the room, was male, white, not overtly subcultural-looking. He warmed up the crowd with some lighthearted cracks about how travel hacking had affected his marriage. His wife, he said, had recently instituted a one-free-hotel-lounge-meal-per-day rule. The room laughed along in recognition.In the mileage community, almost every relationship has one obsessive and one tolerant enabler, generally known as Player 2. Marriage unlocks a higher level of the game by uniting two incomes, two credit scores and two Social Security numbers. Several obsessives I spoke with joked that getting access to a spouses credit card was one of the best days of his or her life. Krasowski told the room that one of the most common questions he gets was, What can I do about spouses that are interested in the spending, but not the earning? He and his wife had begun taking an annual spousal harmony trip. She lays out the parameters, and he has to deliver: Fourth of July weekend, Australia. Business class, single connection preferred, Korean Air.My first seminar of the day was called Awards Worth MS-ing for. MS, or manufactured spending, was popularized through FlyerTalk. The technique has since established itself as the foremost earnings tactic of hard-core milers. The seminar was hosted by Nick Reyes, a self-declared rabid points and miles collector, with an open-collar shirt and a neatly trimmed goatee. He approached the lectern, took off his fedora and rubbed some sanitizer on his hands. As someone struggled to set up the projector, he stalled for time by telling the crowd that hed named his first son Conrad, after the Hilton luxury hotel chain. (He had already collected several complimentary Conrad-branded stuffed animals from his previous stays.)If you were to name your child after a hotel brand, which would you pick? he asked.The crowd tossed off suggestions: Regis (in homage to the St. Regis hotel chain), and Bonvoy (after the recently-merged Starwood-Marriott-Ritz-Carlton rewards program).Soon the PowerPoint presentation was up and running. Manufactured spending, Reyes explained, is a tactic in which you buy a cash equivalent using a credit card, earn credit-card rewards points for the purchase and use the cash value to pay off the bill. A simple example might entail using your Visa credit card to buy a Mastercard prepaid gift card and then repaying the bill through an online bill-pay app (perhaps even using the gift card itself). This is a tidy way to print points, but rarely are MS schemes so obvious. Bill-pay apps, gift cards and other cash abstractions tend to come along with all kinds of piddly fees. In order for an MS scheme to turn a profit, the earning must exceed the cost of manufacture.One of the earliest MS schemes, at this point a foundational legend of the points-and-miles community, was the dollar-coin bonanza. In 2005, in an attempt to overcome the struggling Sacagawea dollar  and to piggyback off the recent state-quarter craze  Congress passed the Presidential $1 Coin Act, introducing a new series of coins. The first, featuring George Washingtons face, went into circulation around Presidents Day 2007. For the next few years, by congressional mandate, a new president was minted every season  Adams, Jefferson, Madison and so on.Nearly every venue of American consumer life is set up to dissuade the use of coins, and so the new series was a failure. In order to get the currency into circulation, the U.S. Mint started a new direct-ship program, allowing consumers to buy the coins online and have them mailed out free of charge. Before long the Mint started to notice strange buying patterns, as travel hackers discovered the program, used their credit cards to buy millions of coins, and delivered the packages straight from their mailboxes to the bank. This hustle generated an untold number of mileage millionaires, and even more big-fish tales for the points-and-miles community. Heres one: At the first Frequent Traveler University in 2010, held at a Sheraton near La Guardia Airport, attendees broke for lunch together at a nearby Chinese restaurant, only to discover that the business was cash only. When the bill finally arrived, the waitress was surprised to discover a table piled high with golden coins. (Eventually, the Mint halted the bonanza by disallowing credit-card orders altogether.)In my second talk of the day, called simply Manufactured Spending, a software engineer named Mike Graziano ran through a list of other bygone MS tactics, like paying yourself through the Amazon Pay portal or prepaying a Visa Buxx debit card. In the course of my reporting, I heard of others too: paying yourself through a Square credit-card reader; overpaying your taxes with a credit card and waiting for the I.R.S. to refund you; issuing short-term microloans to the developing world using a website called Kiva. One travel hacker I spoke with divided MS schemes into two categories: pajama spend, which you could do from your computer, and real-world spend, which took in-person work. Manufactured spending was getting harder, as credit-card algorithms became smarter at catching hackers. Increasingly, the profitable schemes involved arduous real-world effort, like driving between Walmart locations to buy money orders at a discount. Some hackers I read about online build these pit stops into their real-job commutes, as a kind of second shift. Others, a small percentage, make travel-hacking (and other arcane arbitrage schemes) a full-time occupation  reselling their points in secret online markets, against the credit-card terms of service.Staying ahead as a manufactured spender means staying alert, and attuning yourself to particular ways that abstract financial innovations can be layered. There are new financial products popping up every day, Graziano assured the crowd. Bill-pay apps are Silicon Valley-backed companies. Generally they are moving very quickly, and we are not on their radar when they put these products out. When you see that, do not hesitate.Legally speaking, travel hacking is not a crime, though it does lead to conflict with vendors and credit-card companies, many of which have instituted rules against MS schemes. A bank or airline has a lot of leeway to decide what abides by its programs rules and what does not. Even if a travel-hacking scheme does not outright violate the terms of service, a company can simply decide the technique transgresses the spirit of its program. In cases like these, your rewards balances might be seized. Card issuers even institute long-term bans.Every travel hacker I spoke with had a different relation to the morality of the hobby. Credit cards and airlines are not sympathetic victims, and this fact could be used to justify almost any ethical position. Some drew the line at exploiting credit unions. Others stopped at misrepresenting their own identities, or reselling points online for cash. Pretty much every player at this level disliked Brian Kelly and The Points Guy for one reason or another, including, but not limited to: being a sellout, beating them to the punch, getting in bed with the credit-card companies, advocating for suboptimal deals, masquerading as a consumer advocate, taking credit for a community he did not create and giving a face to a subculture that would rather remain anonymous.Kelly admits these travel hackers are not his target audience. I dont want to have to go around to 10 different Targets to buy different gift cards to get points, he says. People called me a sellout in the beginning, like, Oh, youre just doing this for the masses. And yeah  I am. Thats the point. He didnt start The Points Guy to keep his deals a secret. That was a business decision early on, and thats why I think weve been able to grow it. We are very open about the fact that we have to make money. I have 100 employees. I cant pay their salaries in Amex points.I left Washington on March 8 and arrived back home in New York City just in time to watch it shut down. That Thursday, Broadway went dark, and a prohibition on gatherings of more than 500 people was announced. In the following weeks, the schools were closed; the citys daily Covid deaths reached a peak of more than 800, by some counts. The Points Guy, with its fluency in bureaucratic jargon, pivoted almost exclusively to parsing the daily-changing crisis plans. (Some sample headlines: Everything You Need to Know About the U.S. European Travel Ban; Heres How to Figure Out if You Qualify for a Flight Refund; How to Cancel an Airbnb if Your Reservation Is Affected by Coronavirus.)Over the months that followed, I checked in with Kelly periodically as he bounced around the world, from Palm Springs, Calif., to Antigua to Mexico City  getting massages, dining out at restaurants, updating his Instagram story throughout. When we last spoke, in November, he had just returned from two weeks in French Polynesia, where he stayed at the Conrad Bora Bora Nui and swam with humpback whales. Now back home in Pennsylvania, he was once again looking forward to the release of the Points Guy app, which had been kicked down the road to mid-2021. Im still confident it will change the way people think about points, he said.While writing this article, my own perspective on miles and points certainly changed. Through day-to-day spending  and expenses, which were later reimbursed by The New York Times  my rewards balances began to grow. At press time, I have: 3,815 in AAdvantage, 4,735 in Delta SkyMiles, 5,600 in Marriott Bonvoy, 44,485 in Southwest Rapid Rewards and 65,482 in Chase Ultimate Rewards. I hoped to end this story in a faraway place, relaxing on my own plot-concluding free vacation, but who knows when this might be possible? The more I sit home daydreaming about travel, the more skeptical I feel about the sorts of trips that points and miles tend to produce.As corporate partnerships have grown increasingly enmeshed, rewards have come to form a worldwide hamster tube, connecting Sky Club lounges to Ritz-Carlton lobbies to Wolfgang Puck Expresses to Uber Black cars. This elite global habitat  part of our world, but also apart from it  is suggestive of our stratified economy at large, one that stays aloft through financial novelties and unfettered access to cheap money. A major reason points-and-miles trips exist is because airlines turn a more stable profit by minting their own currencies than by selling actual airline seats. The flight seems almost ancillary to the financial transaction it enables  a trend across the whole economy, where the selling of goods or services serves to enable the collection of data, the absorption of venture capital funds or the levying of hidden transaction fees. In this scheme, posting to social media, or collecting points and miles, or ordering a taxi or a gyro on your phone, is merely a gesture to keep the whole process in motion. The real moneymaking happens behind the scenes, driven by a series of exchanges where value seems conjured from nothing at all.But of course, value always comes from somewhere. If you trace the thread back on any one of these businesses, its always the same deal: The poor underwrite the fantasies of the middle class, who in turn underwrite the realities of the rich. When credit cards charge high interchange fees, they pass the cost of loyalty programs on to merchants, who in turn pass it back to customers by building the fees into their sticker prices. Those who pay with credit can earn it back in points. Those who pay with debit or cash wind up subsidizing someone elses free vacation. According to a 2010 policy paper by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the average cash-using household paid $149 over the course of a year to card-using households, while each card-using household received $1,133 from cash users, partially in the form of rewards. It remains a regressive transfer to this day.Almost a year into the pandemic, weve seen travel plummet to practically premodern lows. According to the United Nations World Tourism Barometer, international tourist arrivals dropped 93 percent year-over-year last June, the beginning of the summer tourism season. The ripple effect was quick and vast, manifesting itself in idiosyncratic ways: Carbon emissions dipped; the Mona Lisa sat alone for four full months, probably her longest solitude since she was painted. In famously overtouristed Venice, reduced canal traffic and the disappearance of tourist wastewater output contributed to what one study called unprecedented water transparency. The decline in export revenue from international tourism has been, according to one estimate, eight times more severe than the loss the sector experienced following the global financial crisis. Hundreds of millions of people are out of work. The United Nations predicts travel will begin to rebound as early as the third quarter of 2021. McKinsey says we might return to pre-Covid levels by 2023. Rebound, to me, is a strange way of describing whatever the next tourist wave might look like. In any case, Ill keep holding on to my points."

To celebrate the Uttarayan/Makar Sankranti (the harvest festival of Gujarat) in Chennai, I decided to prepare some traditional dishes and offer it to those from the city, says home chef and author Parul Bhatt. Along with this, Parul will also be preparing methi muthiyas (dumplings/fritters made with chickpea flour and fenugreek leaves with spices) and adding it to the undhiyu, to give it a rustic crunchiness. I will also be adding fresh herbs, green chillies, garlic and lots of coriander, she tells. The preparation of the dishes takes almost 24 hours and due to its laborious nature, Parul suggests that orders be placed well in advance. From peeling, stuffing vegetables to grinding spices, its a multilayer process. Moreover, the mixture for the dishes are slow-cooked with oil and takes anything between three to four hours, she explains. Parul will also be offering crunchy bites of fresh and flaky matar kachoris as part of the Uttarayan menu. Orders to be placed before 12 pm on January 13. The dishes will be delivered within 48 hours by January 15. Price: The undhiyu, muthiyas and kachoris are priced from Rs 200 onwards (minimum order of 250 grams).

Im looking out for these authentic Rajasthani dishes like ragi roti and a few sabzis that are traditionally made for Sankranti. Theres fresh, green lentils and koda ki sabzi. Dal baati churma is also a big hit, she shares. Preetis menu is not without staples  be it the Rajasthani gujiya, mathri, paneer butter masala, pav bhaji, rasamalai and malpua. But, she goes a step further to ensure that every dish has her signature in it from start to finish. As the name goes, its about 100 per cent health. I dont use aluminium or non-stick; its only iron, earthenware and brass vessels for cooking. I dont use refined oil. And when I say paneer butter masala, paneer is made at home; when I put pav bhaji on the menu, I should make sure that I can make pav that day and its also the non-yeast kind. When I say dal baati churma, I should make sure that I have the right flour and I dont use readymade atta; I use khapli wheat. Its that kind of a kitchen, she elaborates. Usually, Preeti prepares a weekly menu and sends it out via WhatsApp. Orders are to be placed a day in advance. Price: On request For more details, call or WhatsApp: 9150312794"

We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water.

2021-01-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-flying-samosa-7143881/,The flying samosa,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it a flying saucer? No, mon ami, it is a flying samosa. Epic journeys are not new to this deep-fried snack  the sambosa arrived in India from central Asia in the 12th or 13th century, carried to the northern plains by waves of migration and invasions. But even by those exalted historical standards, a samosa that takes off in a helium balloon in an attempt to reach space is one spicy little wayfarer. The voyage began when the owner of an Indian restaurant in Bath, UK, thought of launching a samosa into space. Off it went, with a GoPro camera and a GPS tracker for company. The tracker bungled and so no one knows how high it went, but the contraption was finally retrieved from a field in northern France.Food travels. And it is in the nature of kitchens, whether royal or commoner, to reject atmanirbharta and the tyranny of unchanging recipes. In its earliest avatars, the samosa was a fried tidbit, stuffed with meat and dried fruit, served to the rulers of the 13th century Sultanate of Delhi. A 15th century royal recipe book from the Malwa Sultanate lists khoya, ground wheat, and deer meat as samosa fillings. Qeema samosas have not gone out of fashion in the southern states. But in contemporary India, the samosa is as plebeian as it gets, being served at street corners and chaat kiosks, the perfect accompaniment to tea and rainy days; its filling (aloo) so commonplace it found a place in a Lalu Prasad Yadav slogan.But even the potato, an import from the Americas that took root in our soil through British colonial efforts, is a reminder that natives and invaders, insiders and outsiders, are, ultimately, ingredients stirred into a complex history of human migration. Just like the samosa that found its way into a restaurant in Britain run by an Indian-origin man, and, after a little space odyssey, in a field in France."

Cauliflower, for instance, is selling at Rs 3.50 per kg at the weekly markets and mandis and tomato for as low as Rs 10 per kg.This is because many Haryana farmers are selling their produce directly in the Gurgaon mandis instead of the main market at Delhis Ghazipur. Since several roads are blocked in the national capital, it has been difficult for them to reach Ghazipur, from where their produce is routed to states like UP, Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan. But with truck movement severely disrupted because of the blockades  the UP Gate protest site is, in fact, right next to the Ghazipur mandi  farmers are opting to sell their produce in Gurgaon and cut their losses.In fact, prices of almost all vegetables have come down by 50 to 75% in the past 20 days. Apart from the local vegetable markets, veggies on aggregator apps and in stores inside condominiums have also been selling at a low price.According to farmers, apart from the blocked roads, the absence of a cold storage facility in Gurgaon is forcing them to sell their produce at a lower rate as they are unable to preserve the veggies. Usually farmers from Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Nuh, Jhajjar and other nearby districts of Haryana sell their produce at the Ghazipur mandi. However the blockade of arterial roads has meant that sales of fruits and vegetables have shrunk close to 50% at the capitals wholesale market for over a month now.Sellers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are unable to visit the Ghazipur mandi, which has started to hurt their business. Vegetable sales are 50% less than a month ago, said Anil Yadav, a member of the Azadpur mandi, and wholesaler at the Khandsa mandi in Gurgaon. The detour has increased the transport freight and shortage of trucks has also affected our business. Transportation of onions, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic to north Indian states has come down substantially due to the unavailability of trucks.Rajinder Kumar, a wholesaler, said vegetables are being literally dumped at the Gurgaon mandi. Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring districts were transported to Delhi. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in the mandis there, farmers are dumping the same in the wholesale market in Gurgaon. The current climatic conditions are favourable for vegetables and thus a large number of farmers in the adjoining district have been bringing huge quantities of vegetables to the local markets.The rates of onions and potatoes have also seen a dip, being sold at Rs 25 per kg and Rs 15 per kg, respectively, on Wednesday. The price of radish and carrot is Rs 10 per kg, while peas and pumpkin are being sold for Rs 25.Hemant Kumar, another wholesaler, said he has witnessed this sharp slump in vegetable prices for the first time. Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed. The oversupply in the market is only leading to drop in prices as buyers are less, he said.At present, only 6,000 trucks are moving in and out of Delhi. Earlier this number used to be around a lakh. Not only vegetables, but prices of all essential goods have been impacted, said Rajinder Kapoor, president of Delhi Goods Transport Association.Meanwhile, consumers are a delighted lot. This is the first time that I got five different veggies for less than Rs 40 a kg. I am surprised that I am able to purchase vegetables for such a low price in an expensive city like Gurgaon, said Megha Chawla, a Sector 56 resident."

However, the other members would go ahead with their task and meet for the first time on January 19. Meanwhile, the both the farmers unions and the government would hold the ninth round of talks on Friday.Here are the top 10 developments of the day:1. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) national president Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself from the four-member committee appointed by the Supreme Court to resolve the deadlock between farmers and the centre over the new agri-marketing laws. Mann's announcement came on a day when his organisation's Punjab unit decided to disassociate itself from him. Farmer unions and opposition parties too had raised doubts over the composition of the panel, insisting that its members have been in favour of the three laws in the past. Mann said he is thankful to the apex court for nominating him to the panel but would give up any position to prevent farmers' interests from being compromised. As a farmer myself and a union leader , in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions amongst the farm unions and the public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers of the country, he said in a statement. I am recusing myself from the committee and I will always stand with my farmers and Punjab, said Mann who was also an ex-MP. The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana.2. Protesting farmer leaders welcomed BKU president Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision to recuse himself from a Supreme Court-appointed committee, and reiterated that they do not want any panel and will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three contentious laws. They said the other three members of the committee should follow suit as the agitating unions had never demanded formation of any committee to resolve the impasse between farmers and the centre over the new agri laws. Some leaders also invited Mann to join the agitation against the legislation.3. The government's ninth round of negotiations with protesting farmer unions will take place as scheduled on Friday and the centre is hopeful of positive discussions, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said. ""The government is ready to hold talks with farmers' leaders with an open mind,"" Tomar told reporters. Clearing the confusion over the fate of the ninth round of talks, which was the only outcome in the last meeting on January 8, in the wake of the Supreme Court on January 11 appointing a four-member panel to resolve the impasse and a key member of the proposed committee subsequently recusing himself, Tomar said the talks between the government and the union representatives will take place as scheduled for 12 pm on January 15.4. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said the protesting farmer unions will attend the scheduled ninth round of talks with the government and asserted it is necessary to continue the dialogue to resolve the deadlock and end the agitation. Tikait also said the protesting unions will attend the meeting with union ministers on Friday. Asked if unions have any hope from the Friday meeting, Tikait said: ""Let's see what happens tomorrow. But, our meetings will continue with the government till our protest ends as it is necessary We will not oppose the meetings with the government,"" the BKU leader said when asked whether the Friday talks could be the last one if there is no solution.5. The Supreme Court-appointed panel on farm laws is likely to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus in the national capital, one of its members Anil Ghanwat said and asserted the committee will have no ""ego or prestige issue"" if it has to go to farmers' protest sites to talk to them. The panel members were scheduled to have a virtual interaction earlier in the day to discuss its future course of action, but it could not take place after ex-MP and farmer leader Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself from the committee. The existing members can hold their virtual interaction on Friday now, Ghanwat said, while asserting that he will not leave the committee unless asked by the apex court and he does not expect any other member to recuse.6. ""Truly independent"" persons should have been appointed on the committee formed by the Supreme Court to resolve the impasse over new farm laws, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has said. Speaking to reporters, Pawar, a former Union agriculture minister, said the agitating farmers do not have faith in the panel as these members were said to have supported the new farm laws of the centre in the past. ""Hence, the farmers don't think anything will come out of discussions with the committee. And I agree with them. It would have been better if independent - in a true sense independent - persons had been appointed,"" he said.7. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at the centre over the contentious new farm laws, alleging that the government was ""conspiring to destroy"" the farmers and assured that his party will stand with them. Speaking to reporters in Madurai, the Lok Sabha MP also accused the BJP-led NDA government at the centre of trying to benefit ""two or three of their friends"" on the matter. ""The government is not just neglecting them (farmers), the government is conspiring to destroy them. There is a difference. Neglecting is ignoring they are not ignoring them,"" he said in response to a query. ""They are trying to destroy them, because they want to benefit two or three of their friends. They want to give what belongs to the farmer to two or three of their friends,"" he alleged. ""They want to take the land of the farmer, produce of the farmer and they want to give it to their friends,"" Gandhi alleged. ""You are suppressing the farmers, helping a handful of businesses,"" he said. Extending his party's support to the farmers, Gandhi said the laws will indeed be repealed.8. The Punjab cabinet asserted that nothing short of a repeal of the centre's three new farm laws would break the deadlock between the Union government and protesting farmers in the matter. It also said that the Congress-led Punjab government would take all measures to protect the interests of the state and farmers. The central government is out of touch with the ground realities, chief minister Amarinder Singh said at a meeting of the state cabinet. The council of ministers also demanded that the centre make minimum support price (MSP) a statutory right of farmers, who had been ""getting extremely low prices for their produce"" for the past several days despite being responsible for feeding the nation. The state cabinet also observed a two-minute silence in the memory of farmers who have died during the agitation against the farm laws. An estimated 78 farmers have so far lost their lives.9. The Rajasthan Congress will lay siege to the Raj Bhavan in Jaipur on Friday in support of the farmers' agitation against the centre's new farm laws. The leaders and workers of the state unit of the party will observe Friday as Kisan Adhikar Diwas and gherao the Raj Bhavan from 11 am to 2 pm in support of the farmers' resentment also against the anti-farmer attitude of the Modi government, the Congress said in a statement. All India Congress Committee general secretary and Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra and chief minister Ashok Gehlot will also be present during the gherao of the Raj Bhavan, it added.10. The Trinamool Congress has claimed that the new agriculture laws will leave small and marginal farmers at the mercy of big corporates and demanded that the legislation should be immediately repealed. Prices of vegetables such as potatoes and onions have skyrocketed as these have been taken off the essential commodities list, the party's Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said, adding that the concept of MSP has been totally bypassed. The way the centre passed the farm laws shows that the Union government is anti-farmer and anti-people, she told reporters in Kolkata. ""Farmers will now be forced to sell their produce to big corporates at prices dictated by the firms. In case of a crop failure, however, these companies are not bound to buy the produce from the agriculturists,"" the MP said."

Inflation in the primary articles group contracted for the first time in five months at 1.6% in December, while wholesale food inflation declined 1.1% during the month compared with 13.3% in the same year earlier month.Arrival of fresh supplies helped ease prices in cereals and vegetables. Cereals contracted an annual 6.5%, while vegetable prices fell 13%. Onion prices, which had been on fire earlier, contracted 55% in December, while wheat prices dipped 11%. Inflation in potato prices persisted and rose 38%, third consecutive month of elevated prices.The trajectory of the WPI data was similar to the retail inflation data , which was released earlier and showed a sharp moderation in December on the back of softening of food prices and improved supplies. The WPI data also showed that core inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose to a 24-month high of 4.2%, which economists said injected an element of uncertainty over the trajectory of WPI in the months ahead. Wholesale prices will continue to see a moderate pick-up in the coming months, especially in manufacturing, owing to firming up of global metal prices following the opening up of the economy, said Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at Care Ratings ."
2021-01-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/eight-winter-superfoods-diet-immunity-skin-7145095/,You should have these eight winter superfoods for health,"Winter brings a divergent change in the weather after the wet monsoon and scorching heat of summer. The changing weather necessitates a modification in nutrition as well. Especially this year, our dietary habits can be a decisive differentiator for our health and immunity. Working from home has become the new norm, resulting in far lesser physical activity and a lot more opportunities for eating. It can lead to weight gain, joint problems, vitamin D deficiency, constipation, and so on, says Pradeep Singh, wellness and nutrition expert, and certified dietitian.To add to that, winter brings with it dry skin and hair fall, which are also causes of concern. Therefore, enriching our diet with superfoods may help deal with all these problems and provide you with immunity, good skin, great digestion, and overall holistic health, he tells indianexpress.com.But what are these superfoods, and how do they benefit us? In a nutshell, superfoods are those edibles that contain a high nutritional value and provide us with a variety of health benefits.Below, he shares eight such superfoods that you should be eating this winter.Garlic: If youre a fan of garlic, winter is the time for you to have it. Garlic is a great source of selenium, germanium, and sulfhydryl amino acids, which help in boosting immunity. It is also a natural antibiotic and is effective in preventing urinary tract infections, lowering blood pressure, preventing bronchitis and pneumonia. This makes garlic one of the best winter diet additions.Cinnamon: Everybodys kitchen has this ingredient for sure. Usually shelved with cloves, nutmeg, and other spices, cinnamon is a great source of iron and calcium. It is essential for the production of healthy red blood cells and can also help in reducing spikes in blood sugar levels. A simple way to incorporate it into your diet would be, adding it to your morning cup of coffee or tea.Traditional Indian spices and herbs which are known to boost immunity find more takers in the COVID-19 times. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Traditional Indian spices and herbs which are known to boost immunity find more takers in the COVID-19 times. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Almond and walnuts: Just like blankets warm you up in winters, these nuts can warm you up on the inside. Both almonds and walnuts lower bad cholesterol, control blood sugar levels, and reduce inflammation. Walnuts are a great source of Omega-3, while almonds are rich in Vitamin E, antioxidants, and magnesium. So if youre craving a light snack, dont hesitate to pick up a few almonds and walnuts to munch on in between meals.Sweet potatoes: Sweet potatoes are great comfort food. They are also a rich source of fibre, Vitamin A, and potassium. If you want to go easy on the calories and high on the nutrients, sweet potatoes are the answer in winter. It can help with relieving constipation, building immunity, and reducing inflammation.Mustard greens: Mustard greens, just like other green leafy vegetables, are among the most nutritious foods you can eat. These greens are rich in fibre, and vitamin C, which is much needed during winter to help fight infections. Plus, it helps lower cholesterol and improves liver health.ALSO READ | 5 superfoods to boost your immunityCitrus fruits: By now, weve all heard that citrus fruits are synonymous with vitamin C. So, not mentioning them as a winter food would leave the list incomplete, and for a good reason. Fruits such as oranges, grapes, and lemons are jam-packed with minerals and phytochemicals. Therefore, including them in your winter diet is a must if you want to develop a super-strong immune system.Carrots: Carrots are rich in beta-carotene that gives them their bright orange colour and makes them rich in vitamin A. The high level of fibre they contain also means you can include carrots in your weight loss diet. They are also beneficial for regulating cholesterol levels. As an added benefit, they have high amounts of antioxidants, vitamin K, and improve overall eye health.Pea protein: Arguably the most complete plant protein, pea protein, is made from yellow split peas. Unlike beans or rice, it contains all the amino acids that your body requires. Its also a great alternative to whey or soy, especially if youre allergic or sensitive to either of the two. Plus, its a go-to protein source that will warm you up this winter if youre a vegan.Apart from winters, these foods should become a part of your daily nutrition regime as they will help you become fit and maximise your healthspan. A combination of these foods will yield clear skin, healthier hair, improved digestion, increased metabolism, and overall higher energy levels, he says.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"
2021-01-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/akus-burgers-in-delhi-are-yum/article33586630.ece,The burger with a good mouth and hand feel at AKU’S Delhi,"In Delhi, AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. delivers burgers that come together well at different levels: the softness of the patty, the umami of the cheese, the sweetness of brown onions, and the juicy pattyOur young neighbours are great foodies, so we have detailed food conversations. I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum. They indeed are. Yummilicious, Id say.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

2021-01-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/following-his-inner-call-to-manage-the-field/article33594031.ece,Following his inner call to manage the field,"Philip K. Chacko studied Master of Business Administration (MBA), but his love for organic farming steered him towards a career in agriculture.A native of Muhamma in Alappuzha, the 31-year-old quit his job as a plantation company manager in 2019 to follow his inner desire to become a farmer. More than a year later, he is now busy growing 22 varieties of vegetables and fruits on 36 acres of leased land at Kanjikuzhy and Muhamma.Mr. Chacko says that he wanted to practise agriculture after completing MBA in 2013, but lacked the courage to tell his parents about the wish. I joined a real-estate firm in Ernakulam and continued there for three years. In 2016, I left the job to start a buffalo farm project in association with a reputed business house in Kottayam. However, we were forced to postpone our project after the Central government came up with a new cattle slaughter rule. The firm, which has stakes in rubber and tea plantations, offered me a managerial post. I always wanted to manage my own farm and finally, I decided to follow my inner calling in December 2019, he says.After quitting the job, he carried out organic vegetable cultivation on an experimental basis on 12 acres last year with the support of his wife and other family members. Finding success in the initial efforts, he later expanded the farm project. His cherished agriculture journey is, however, not without hurdles. Up to 80% of seedlings he planted at the turn of 2021 got destroyed in heavy downpour. Over the past couple of days, he put up a show of grit and determination to replant everything.Mr. Chacko says that he has invested all his life savings in agriculture and that he could not be discouraged in the face of adversities. These are things that we have no control over. The rain has caused severe damage and I suffered losses. With replanting now completed, the farm is now running full-fledged. The only pain is that the harvest will be delayed, which will, in turn, prevent the second round of cultivation before the monsoon rains, he says, adding that he will further expand farming to 100 acres in the near future.The young farmer says his experience in business administration will come handy in marketing the farm produce. He is growing spinach, long beans, brinjal, pumpkin, potato, bitter gourd, okra, onion, shallot, sesame, green gram, cucumber, watermelon and so on in his farm. Besides, he is rearing buffalo and fish."

""I am sure I missed a fewothers,"" he says.Engaging in tobacco cultivation (Photo | George Poikayil)Narayanan prefers to call himself a conservator first, then a farmer. He has more than three varieties of most of the vegetables mentioned above. He even has seven varieties of the hibiscus plant. But his biggest contribution to farming is he is the proud owner of 90 varieties of indigenous beans and peas. He cultivates each of the varieties to conserve them. ""Earlier farmers were conservators too. But now they depend on the market every sowing season. I thought we should not lose out on the indigenous varieties in the mad rush for hybrid ones,"" he says. ""For there will be new varieties only if the old survives.""Recognising his effort, the Kerala Agricultural University has nominated him for the Plant Genome Saviour Farmer Reward instituted by the Ministry of Agriculture's Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority.Narayanan is not just a farmer. He is an accredited journalist with an evening daily in Kasaragod, a theatre artiste, helps publish work of rural talent, and a sought-after social worker. ""I rest only when I hit the bed at night,"" he says.He does not employ workers. He is helped by his mother P Shantha and wife Sreeja P. At 5 am, the trio hits the field to harvest and water the plants on seven acres. At 7.30 am, he leaves for his office and returns at 4 pm. After a cup of tea, he changes to lungi and wears his headlamp, and hits the field again with his mother. ""I water plants every day and it can go on till 10 pm. That is why I farm round the year,"" he says.In 2018, he lost 13 varieties of rice in the flood. ""All of them were indigenous varieties from Wayanad,"" he says. He started conserving beans on a largescale in 2016 when the United Nations General Assembly declared it as the International Year of Pulses. Pulses are beans and peas that are harvested dry. ""When I read it in newspapers, I thought of finding out how many varieties of beans are there in Kerala and why not conserve them,"" he says.He had 10 varieties of beans with him in 2016, and he started getting new varieties from his farmer-friends and agriculture scientists from faraway places such as Rajasthan and Assam. ""Unlike conserving mangoes and jackfruit varieties which can be planted and forgotten, I have to grow beans every year to conserve them,"" he says. He grows around 20 to 30 varieties at a time and labels them properly. ""Growing all of them together will be hard to maintain and increases the risk of cross-pollination,"" he says.Narayanan sells his vegetables but not seeds. ""I will have seeds of any of the vegetables I grow to give away free of cost to at least 25 farmers. I want the varieties with me to be grown by many,"" he says.The okra with him is at least 30 cm long. He has 12 varieties of plantain and seven varieties of lemon.He has nudged at least 80 women and children in his neighbourhood to set up kitchen gardens. He, too, has changed track and started selling value-added products such as turmeric powder and curd chilli and bitter gourd crisps (kondattam). ""Selling turmeric will fetch you around Rs 90 per kg. But if I turn itto powder, people buy it for Rs 400. And they know it won't be yellow powder but turmeric power,"" he says.With all these efforts, he makes just around Rs 2 lakh from selling vegetables. ""My model should not be replicated if you want to make money. But then, the little money I make does not end up in hospital either. Even my mother is supremely fit ... payar pole,"" he says."

Accompanying her will be her 14-year-old granddaughter Karnaaz Kaur and thousands of women, including another Balwinder Kaur, 55, of Chak Fateh Singh Wala village of Bathinda district and her seven-year-old granddaughter Navnoor Kaur.Women will be in charge at the protest sites across Punjab as well as at Delhi borders on Monday.Women members of BKU Ugrahan will stage dharnas at Dhanaula village of Barnala district, which is a native village of BJP leader Harjeet Singh Grewal, and Kathera village of Fazilka district, native village of Surjeet Kumar Jyani.Balwinder of Behman Diwana said, Our family does farming on about 12 acres of land. In a farmers family, everyone is a farmer. The whole family works together to earn livelihood. Hence, every women living in a village is a farmer only.Balwinder of Chakfateh Singh Wala said, We need not have separate land to prove that we are independent women farmers. My husband died more than a decade ago during farmers struggle. Our entire family is associated with this movement which is now every households struggle to fight for our existence.Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of BKU Ugrahan, said, Women units of Sangrur, Barnala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Mansa and Patiala will go to Dhanaula village while women units of Bathinda, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Muktsar, Faridkot, Moga, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur will go to Kathera village. When we started struggle against farm laws, our union had district bodies in 13 districts of Punjab and now it has district bodies in 16 districts of Punjab. Jalandhar, Tarn Taran and Fatehgarh Sahib are the new districts from where membership has been done in large numbers.Women will stage a march in the villages first of all and then will be holding a protest rally. Harinder Kaur Bindu, vice-president of BKU Ugrahan, said, Though Jyani claims to be chairman of eight-member BJP panel to coordinate with farmer unions and Grewal is one of the panel members, they have only defamed the farmers rather than putting up a strong case before the Union ministers for Punjabs farmers. Their role needs to be condemned. Hence, rallies have been planned in their villages.Bindu was among few women leaders who drove a tractor on January 7 on Eastern Peripheral Expressway. She hails from Bhagatuana village of Faridkot district of Punjab. I have ploughed the fields manually. I learnt how to drive a tractor in early 2000. Though I am fully involved in union works, my family is into farming. Hence, I know all the processes, she said.Paramjeet Kaur Pitho is another woman leader of BKU Ugrahan who knows how to drive a tractor. She is block president of Rampura Phull and lives with her parents at Pitho village after her husbands death about a decade ago. She grows vegetables and potatoes apart from sowing wheat and paddy. I work manually in fields as well. Farming can no longer be associated with men alone. It is a familys job. Hence, every village woman is a farmer, she said. Pitho and Bindu will be managing the stage at Tikri border on Monday.Sukhdev Singh said, As protest against farm laws started, we realised how important women and children are in this struggle. They have been protesting aggressively. Women from every house have been moving out. Not only farmers, but women from other fields also will be part of Monday protest. Protest against farm laws is no longer limited to villages now. It is every households talk now."
2021-02-11,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/feb/11/pressure-that-pleases-the-palate-2262302.html,Pressure that pleases the palate,"Anushree Madhavan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Imagine this. You are in a foreign land, in a small apartment with not many vessels to cook in, and you are craving for a bowl of piping hot sambar saadam. What do you do? If you are someone like B Ramakrishnan, or Ramki as he is fondly called, you would resort to the One Pot One Shot (OPOS) cooking method.After all, it was this craving for sambar while in Bahrain that led the masterchef of the OPOS methd on this journey, nearly 15 years ago. Since the success of his first book  OPOS Cookbook: 5 Minute Magic  in 2018, Ramki has upgraded his recipes for his recent launch The Complete OPOS Cookbook. Here, he introduces the concept of pressure baking, cold pressure deep fry and other new techniques.Journey in the kitchenFor Ramakrishnan, cooking is a science and every recipe is a problem to be solved. My journey into cooking is similar to what each one of us has gone through. Cooking is like drawing a freehand circle that is taught by your mom. How much ever you practise, you will not be able to draw as precisely as your mom can. And it takes a lot of experience and skill to draw a freehand circle. Traditional cooking is like that because there are a lot of variables involved.Even if you follow every single step precisely, the results will be different for your mom and you. There are things that you have to learn by experience  when to add what ingredients, when it is cooked, etc. And this is why cookbooks do not do a good job of teaching cooking. This is why many of us who learn cooking from a cookbook give up on this art out of frustration. The result we get is nowhere near what is shown in the book, he details. Ramki also had his tryst with cookbooks while in the Middle East.And he was on the brink of giving up on cooking when he realised that the problem was not with him but with the cookbooks. I am an engineer. If I have to design a car or a gear box, the solution is straightforward  take a manual and follow the instructions. They are precise, and no subjectivity involved. When I was trying to learn cooking from a cookbook, I found the instructions were contradictory, confusing, and very subjective.Two books teach different ways to make sambar and each book claims theirs is the proper method. When I realised the problem is with the instructions in the cookbook, I was trying to figure out how cooking can be made into a science, and recipes into scientific experiment where there is no subjectivity. You dont look for kai manam or kai pakkuvam in a scientific experiment, do you? So, I wanted to convert an art into science, he elaborates.I ntroducing OPOSFor everyone to get the same results while making a recipe, Ramki realised that the equipment had to be the same  like with your Chemistry experiments. Rice is the perfect example. The steps to cook rice in Chennai or Himalayas is the same. It is not subjective. Even a child can follow that. My idea was to make all recipes similar to cooking rice.But for cooking, the equipment, heat source, cooking conditions, and even geography matters. So I had to standardise the equipment, he explains. And soon he and his team of OPOS chefs from all over the world, who discuss recipes virtually, decided on working with a two-litre pressure cooker to get to solve the problem in hand. This formidable team has proven that all kinds of Indian dishes  from Mysore pak to malai kofta can be cooked using the OPOS method.Bettering the processWhile choosing a pressure cooker leveled the playing field, there were some glitches reported by most chefs. We found that a lot of vegetables turned mushy and colourless when cooked in a pressure cooker using OPOS method. It lost all its taste and texture. And people were willing to use a cooker to cook dal, pongal or potato where the texture and consistency is not important, but refused to use it for vegetables, he shares. In their learning process, they discovered that to retain the colour, taste and texture of the vegetables, they need to cook it like a stir-fry that a Chinese master would make.We realised the key to doing that is to cut out all water and cook them on very high heat. This was the mantra that took us around 15 years to discover  high heat, low time, no water. You have to cook all the vegetables on very high heat for a very short time, in their own juices. When cooked so, the results were mindblowing, he narrates. Hence, they began the deskilling process and came up with the pressure baker, which is a pressure cooker that is redesigned to work on very high heat, without water. We designed this pressure baker and got Butterfly and Prestige to manufacture it according to our design specifications.If you try using a normal pressure cooker to cook vegetables without water, a lot of mishaps can happen. We gave a presentation to companies and explained to them the difference between pressure cooking and what we are trying to do. It is not easy convincing companies that have been manufacturing pressure cooker for 50 years to ask them to change their design. Fortunately, we were able to convince them. With the equipment and these recipes, instead of drawing a freehand circle, we have given everyone a compass. Now, a perfect circle is even possible for a child. That is what OPOS has done to all recipes, he says proudly. The pressure baker can handle any kind of recipe as this is just a cooking technique.The taste testWhen you cook anything beyond five minutes, everything is lost, he says. In every single traditional recipe, vegetables get completely massacred. Even in restaurants, what you eat is dead carcasses of vegetables. And the only way to eat that is by covering it with loads of masala, he explains. With the OPOS technique, you completely do away with the unwanted masalas. While the pressure baker is ideal to master the art of cooking using the OPOS technique, Ramki does have a solution to those who dont own one. For OPOS, standardisation is important.So, to cook the basic recipes that we have given in the book, use a two or three-litre pressure cooker because all the vegetables need to cook within five minutes. For a small family, a two-litre cooker is enough; for a slightly larger family, use a three-litre one. But, if you are cooking for more people, do not use a bigger cooker, instead cook twice or use two pots, he advises. In the two years since the last book was released, Ramki has been able to master the technique of caramelisation and invent a method called cold pressure frying, where you can deep fry without using a drop of oil.Deep frying or shallow frying is extremely injurious to health. Once the oil starts boiling it produces a lot of toxic chemicals. Even a simple thalipu you do at home creates a lot of smoke. This technique, done inside OPOS pressure cooker, eliminates oil smoke and oil breakdown. We didnt know this in 2018. The techniques keep evolving. Three years down the line we, will need a completely different set of recipes, he shares.Cooking talesRamkis house in Chennai does not have a kitchen. All he needs is a tabletop, a heat source and his pressure baker, and he is good to go. I cook in my balcony, my living room or even out of the boot of my car! There is no smoke or pollution; I take the kitchen wherever I want, he says. He has even taken it to high altitudes to cook for the Indian army in Akhnoor, on the India-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir. It was mind-numbingly cold. The squadron of soldiers was surprised to see me with a backpack and one cooker. When I said I am going to cook a feast for them they didnt believe it. We managed to feed 40 soldiers in one hour.They were shocked as they often live on frozen food. We showed them how easy it is to cook fresh food and they just loved it. One of my most prized possessions is a citation from the army and a medal. It was a heart-touching experience, he reminisces. Now that he and his team have demystified and deskilled every single Indian cuisine, standardised the themes and recipes, the OPOS chefs are on a journey to take on global cuisines.We are working on a Singapore cookbook, Southeast Asian cookbook, Continental, Mediterranean, etc. People staying in those places are working on these recipes and coming up with a book. We also want to set up a chain of restaurants based on this concept  chef-less kitchen-less restaurants, he signs off.Now wouldnt that be something to watch out for?

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The price of onions has spiked in Delhi owing to supply being less than usual from various states, including Maharashtra . Many onion producing states have reported damage to crops due to unseasonal rain towards the end of 2020.Currently, the staple is retailing between Rs 40 and Rs 60 per kg across the capital, while the wholesale rate is between Rs 10 and Rs 40. The prices of other vegetables are normal, most of which are supplied from Haryana.Traders say there has been a 50% decline in the stock of onions arriving at Azadpur Mandi, from where the vegetable is supplied to retail markets across Delhi-NCR. Normally, 50-60 trucks of onions used to come every day, but the number has dropped to 30-35 now.However, the traders said the stir by farmers at Singhu , Ghazipur and Tikri borders had not affected supply because trucks were using the peripheral expressway and entering the city through Gurugram. Some drivers were also using village roads to arrive at Azadpur Mandi.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, said, The rain in December last year damaged onion seedlings in the nurseries. The farmers had to prepare the seedlings again, which caused a delay in production.By the end of February, supply of onions from Sikar district in Rajasthan and Ujjain, Bhopal, Narsinghgarh and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh will start, which will lead to reduction in prices, added Mishra.Ram Avtar Singh, a retailer at Laxmi Nagar, said the price of onions was between Rs 25 and Rs 35 throughout January, but started to increase at the beginning of February. We are buying onions at Rs 30-40 from the wholesale market and selling at Rs 40-50, he added.Onion prices will remain high only for around 15 days and will start coming down by the last week of February. The supply from Maharashtra has been hit because the seedlings got damaged. Within the next 15 days, the wholesale and retail prices of onions will reduce, said Rajinder Sharma, an onion and potato trader.Another trader said the price would have risen further had the supply from Gujarat also been hit. The supply of onions from Gujarat is by and large normal, so that has helped cover up some shortage from Maharashtra, he added."

Similarly, retailers who were selling onions at 35-40 per kg have increased the rate to 50-55 per kg.There had been unseasonal rainfall in October and November last year which damaged the crops in large numbers. The onions now in the market are from old stocks as most of the new crops have been destroyed in the rains, Ashok Walunj, director of the onion-potato market, APMC, said.Because of the less production, traders are not able to export the produce. The government has lifted the ban on the export, but we do not have enough stock. The losses we are incurring are huge this year, a wholesale trader from the APMC market said.Usually during this time around 125-150 trucks of onions are expected to arrive in the market every day, but the number has gone down to 75 trucks, Mr. Walunj said. The produce is coming from some parts of Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar, he said.It is expected that the prices might further increase by 5 per kg in the coming days. Once the summer season kicks in, the prices may be stable. But it will become worse in the rainy season, Mr. Walunj added.Retailers said that people who usually bought onions in quantities had also cut down on the purchase due to the rise in the prices."

But each seeks to convey a different meaning as the farmers protest nears the three-month mark.One has been placed on police barricades beyond which layers of security arrangements and razor wire seek to box farmers in. The other has been placed by farmers on a makeshift, mini garden they created last week in response to, and in peaceful defiance of, these very arrangements.Protected by green fencing on all sides, the small patch of land  which they dug up, added soil brought from various villages, and sowed potatoes, sugarcane, and flowers  serves as a symbol of all arable land in the country that they take turns to water and cultivate.Police have used the sign to warn us against moving towards the Capital, which they want to protect through all these barricades and sharp wires. Our sign is to ward off the evil eye of corporates and the ill wishes of the government, said Meghraj Malik, a farmer from Meerut.Peace loversFarmers are peaceful by nature. The government does what it does best by pointing guns at us and we reply the only way we know how to  by tilling the soil. Our answer will become louder with every inch the crops grow, said Om Prakash Awana from Kasna in Uttar Pradesh.As the noonday sun grows hotter by the day, efforts beyond rotational participation are being made to make the farmers feel as less inconvenienced as possible.In addition to setting up more surface-level roadside tenements where the elderly can rest and increasing the number of bathing sites, water is being provided even at medical camps. Oranges too are being distributed to keep participants hydrated.It is not that farmers arent used to the heat. We face all kinds of weather head-on in the fields. But the elderly need to be taken proper care of wherever they are, said Ishwarchand Bidhuri from Dasna as he proceeded to hammer a nail onto two bamboo stalks to prepare a resting camp.Days are getting hotter and summer is not even here yet; but no matter what happens, we will not cede an inch till the three black laws are repealed by the Centre, he added."

While a kilogram of drumstick at Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC) costs Rs 120, curry leaves was sold at Rs 60 a kg. Traders attributed the unprecedented increase to a drop in arrivals to the market.V R Soundararajan, a former member of the market management committee of KWMC and a wholesale trader, said unseasonal rain damaged crops, resulting in short supply and price rise. Harvest and ,in turn, arrivals to Chennai, have reduced. I havent seen such high prices sustain in the wholesale market in the past. Wholesale cost of curry leaves has never exceeded Rs 30 per kilogram, he said.Curry leaves, which cost Rs 80/kg last week, will be sold for Rs 60 this week. The Rs 20 drop was due to a dip in sales, Soundararajan said. Koyambedu market sources curry leaves from Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district and parts of Andhra Pradesh.Cost of drumstick too has reduced by Rs 20 and will cost Rs 120 a kg this week. The market currently gets only 100 tonnes of drumstick a day, 50% of the daily average of 200 tonnes of drumstick supplied usually. The highest the vegetable cost all of last year was Rs 60/kg and at times, dropped to Rs 15/kg. Its cost is likely to stabilise in April, when fresh yield is expected to hit the market, he added.On the other hand, costs of other vegetables barring shallots continue to remain stable. Shallots cost Rs 80/kg this week, Rs 20 more than last week. While staples potato and tomato are expected to cost Rs 20-Rs 25, grade I onions will cost Rs 40/kg."

From edible packaging to hyper-focus in design and utility, chefs and restaurateurs are truly thinking out of the box.Butter Delivery is our new delivery only brand that is an ode to everything Butter, says Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants, adding, Comprising only 10 dishes it is the shortest menu in the world and includes the ubiquitous butter chicken, dal makhani, paneer makhani and a special version of a tandoori chicken made with butter. The packaging for all things butter is environmentally-friendly, made from paper craft material while the white boxes are corn starch material.Avantika Sinha Bahl, owner of Kampai says that packaging of food is equally important as the taste is. We have tried to be as innovative with our packaging while staying as sustainable as possible by using paper packaging, and recyclable materials. We have used the colours of paper in accordance with the colour theme of the outlet. Also, we have carefully made the size of the plates in accordance with portion sizes of food.Chef Harangad Singh, who recently started his cloud kitchen Parat, says, The success of a cloud kitchen depends equally on the taste of food and the way in which food reaches the customer. We are very particular about packaging and are using boxes made from sugarcane husk and spoons made from potato starch. The edible packaging trend is here to stay.And one of the key players in providing the innovative packaging is RR Consulting which has become a one-stop-shop for all packaging arrangements. The company, which began in 2004, has gone on to boast an enviable line of clients, spread across different industries like hospitality, pharmaceuticals, fashion, education, IT, personal care, liquor, and then some.Among these are The Taj Group of Hotels, Foodhall, Vistara, Cinepolis, Maruti Suzuki, Haldiram and SBI.In the culinary world, maximum people eat with their eyes. Wonderful looking food makes individuals need to devour the food as well as to accept that the food really tastes better. Similarly, packaging assumes a key job in the business diagram of the item. The bundling of an item should be sufficiently engaging to the customers for them to end up purchasing the item, concludes Hitesh Rao, Co-founder, RR Consulting."

After listening to the Prime Ministers address in Parliament, the farmer is feeling insulted and has become more resolute in his stand against the farm laws, he said.A large number of farmers turned up for the panchayat yet again. The protests have emerged from the grassroots, but strangely Mr. Modi is keeping his eyes shut to their [farmers] demands, Mr. Chaudhary said.Whenever there is a challenge, people unite and give birth to a new leader, a new movement, he said.Mr. Chaudhary reminded how his grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh had argued in his book  Indias Economic Policy: The Gandhian Blueprint, published in 1978  that those who were running the country didnt know the social and psychological make-up of the farmers. People with urban upbringing make laws for rural India. Even if they have the farmers interest in mind, they are not practical. This is proving to be true in 2021, he said.Benefit of capitalistsThe Prime Minister said in Parliament that one should not insult the capitalists. This in a country where there is still inequality, where a large section of the electorate is still poor. It shows the PM knows everything. The laws are made for the benefit of his capitalist friends, said the RLD leader.Raising the issue of a farmer from Aligarh who recently killed himself, Mr. Chaudhary said: They seek vote in the name of Ram, but they are not concerned about Ramjilal who ended his life after facing humiliation at the hands of officials for his inability to pay electricity bill.He recalled that the government had promised to develop 22,000 Gramin Hats (rural marketplaces). I could not find one in this region that is known for potato cultivation. The Shanta Kumar Committee had said in 2015 that only 6% of farmers could sell their produce at MSP. The goal should have been to increase procurement by increasing the number of government mandis, he said.Mr. Chaudhary feared that the government would sell the Food Corporation of India as well as it is running losses. They are busy selling everything and the farmers will have to suffer, he said.He also took the U.P. government to task for not increasing the State Approved Price of sugarcane for the third consecutive year."

2021-02-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sukhpal-singh-interview-contract-farming-7191898/,Dr Sukhpal Singh: ‘Land leasing provisions under present laws worry farmers the most’,"Despite having three sets of contract farming laws being enacted in the past less than two decades, including the 2020 Act, the basic fear among the farmers is that their land will be snatched by companies with whom they enter into contract. Government, however, claims that farmers land is protected under provisions of the new Act.An expert on contract farming, Dr Sukhpal Singh, Professor, Centre for Management in Agriculture (CMA), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, having an experience around 3-decade on CF, shares his views on the farmers fear, why contract farming is needed but not a successful operation and how a small farmer can use it to enhance his income. Excerpts from his interview with The Indian Express.Why is contract farming needed?For contracting agencies, contract farming (CF) is the only alternative to buying from APMC mandi or private wholesale market, or buying directly from farmers without contract, as corporate farming (wherein corporate agencies undertake farming operations on owned or leased land for their consumptive use or for commercial purpose) option is not available in India. This is so because under the Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, non-agriculturists cant own agricultural land, and under the Land Leasing Act, cant even lease in agricultural land, both Acts being at the state level.So, if a company wants to procure desired quality raw material or farm produce in adequate quantity at reasonable cost which may not be available in the open market or sometimes not even grown by farmers e.g. processing variety (chips grade) potatoes in India before the Pepsi came in, then CF was the only option in India which Pepsi used.But, many times, corporate farming even if allowed, is not a viable option given that we are in the age of vertical coordination (buying from others) rather than vertical integration (making in-house). For farmers, CF can bring benefits of not only assured market and price but also new technology, seeds, extension, diversification and such other non-price benefits.Dr Sukhpal Singh, contract farming expert Dr Sukhpal Singh, contract farming expertWhen was contract farming started in India, Punjab?Contract Farming has been in practice in India since the 1960s in the seed sector wherein both public and private entities have been using this mechanism to get certified seed produced, and in other farm produce in many states like Punjab and Haryana since the 1990s with the PepsiCo undertaking tomato, chilly and potato contract farming. Pepsi was brought in for attempting crop diversification when contract farming was not even legal in India.When were the first rules governing CF framed?CF has been permitted in most states as per the model APMC Act 2003 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare (MoAFW) wherein three new channels of farm produce buying and selling i.e. direct purchase, contract farming and private wholesale market were made legal, which most states adopted in a few years, with the exception of one or two states, and later, under the separate model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation, APLCF&S (P&F)) Act, 2018. Punjab was the only state which, in 2013, framed a separate Act on contract farming instead of providing for it under the APMC Act which it had not amended adequately until 2017. However, a separate Contract Farming Act was never operationalised, and it was also not needed as all other states had provided for CF under the APMC Act itself.How has been the experience of CF so far?There is a widespread practice of contract farming across crops, states and agencies (public, private and multinational) in India covering dozens of crops and livestock products with hundreds of contract farming projects or schemes, for domestic processing or for export, and there have been dozens of studies over the last 20 years on its performance and experience.Default by both sides (companies and farmers) has been an issue and contract farmers in various parts of India have faced many problems like undue quality cut on produce or no procurement of produce, delayed deliveries at the factory, delayed payments, low price, poor quality inputs, no compensation for crop failure and even stagnation of contract prices over time, besides contract agreements being in favour of the contracting agencies. Also, the exclusion of small holders remains a key challenge as contracting agencies prefer larger farmers to reduce their transaction costs. Further, contract production of the same crop is generally higher cost than open market production as certain recommended practices have to be followed as far as input use and crop management is concerned which also leads to resource constrained small producers being excluded. The companies also put minimum land and other resources as the criteria for farmers being eligible to produce under contract.If contract farming has not been successful in areas, what have been the reasons?Poor regulation and lack of an enabling policy are the major reasons. There is no policy to support smallholder inclusion e.g. lower cost credit or encouragement to group contracts. Thailand had used CF as a mechanism to achieve agricultural development by including it in their 5-year plans and then bringing state support like extension and credit for making it spread across crops and farmers besides promoting group, not individual, contracts.Now that there have been three sets of Acts including two independent Acts on it (the central Act 2020, Model CF Act 2018 and APMC Act 2003), why are farmers still worried about their land being snatched by the sponsors. Is their fear genuine?It is land leasing under CF laws which worries farmers the most. The model APMC Act 2003 had protected farmer land clearly. Even if famer committed default, the contracting agency could not lay claims to farmer land or other assets. But, since the model ALPCF&S (P&F) Act, 2018, the land leasing has been made part of the contract farming definition which is not correct as contract farming can never include land leasing. This is one of the reasons for fear among farmers.The 2020 Act protects farmers land when it states in Section 14: No farming agreement shall be entered into for the purpose of (a) any transfer, including sale, lease or mortgage of the land or premises of the farmer. But, some other provisions are at a departure from this provision. For example, the dispute resolution section clause 14(7) states: The amount payable under any order passed by the Sub-Divisional Authority or the Appellant Authority, as the case may be, may be recovered as arrears of land revenue. However, then again, it states in the next clause (15), Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14, no action for recovery of any amount in pursuance of an order passed under this section, shall be initiated against the agricultural land of the farmer.But, still it means it can be recovered from other assets and properties of the farmer.The biggest problem is that in the 2020 CF Act, contract farming has been mixed up with corporate farming. Land Leasing Acts at the state level are still intact though may not remain for long going by what Karnataka, Rajasthan and Punjab are planning in terms of opening up land lease markets. The way production agreement is defined also raises doubts whether land leasing is also a part of contract farming. The mix up between contract and corporate farming in the Act is so significant that the Rajasthan Amendment Bill, 2020 assumes that leasing is a part of contract farming.How can farmers land remain safe under CF?For safety of farmer land ownership under CF, it is important to exclude land leasing from the definition of contract and it should be written clearly in the Act that no recoveries other than from farm produce can be made from famers even if they default.How can a farm friendly CF model be achieved which can help small farmers in an effective manner to enhance their income?Better and more effective regulation is the first step to protect famer interest and to ensure that they benefit from contract farming engagement. Further, since Indian farmers are mostly marginal or small, they cant deal with large buyers on their own even if they are brought under contract farming by some companies. Therefore, group contracts should be encouraged by policy incentives to make the mechanism inclusive and effective for farmers. The government can facilitate such contracts through credit and extension support to such small farmer groups like in Thailand. Also, we have thousands of Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) now which are very business-like entities of farmers and they can play a role in making contract farming deliver the objectives of farmer income enhancement by facilitating contract farming with smallholders, and also undertaking contract farming on their own. But, these entities have been treated as farmers in the Act despite the fact that no FPC undertakes production. They should have been defined as sponsors in the agreement as they do buy from their members and non-members and also undertake or facilitate contract farming. They should have been given better treatment in the new Acts.Finally, the 2020 CF Act has left the very basic aspects of CF like acreage, quantity and quality, timing and place of delivery besides price for the contracting parties to decide for inclusion into the CF agreement. But, these should have been mandatory aspects of the contract agreement like in the model CF under the model APMC Act of 2003."

But forgotten among them is the plight of street food vendors  a field that is highly dependent on crowds and their curiosity. Not enough is written about Indias unique street food culture. Indian street food is a microcosm of food cultures and histories, served in tasty, affordable portions. Idlis from south India, parathas from up north, momos from the north-east and tandoori representing Indias Mughal history. While having street food, youre essentially surfing through Indias wide array of food cultures.Its not hard to pick my favourite Indian street food variety. There are jalebis  sinfully syrupy circles of joy served hot. Or the ubiquitous chaat  unique to every place and its ingredients. But my greater weakness, the street food I would want to have on my deathbed  is the pani puri.Its hard not to pick the pani puri. It is customisable  potato, chanaa, grams, and anything else that the public demands. Unlike other delicacies, there is no time to stand and savour the flavours. By the time the juices are flowing down your throat, theres another one waiting to rush into your mouth. There is no civilised way to have pani puri  no spoons, forks, or chopsticks. The only way is by using ones opposable thumb  the one hack that made us intelligent primates.I make it a point to have pani puri in every city or town I visit. Whether it is the sweet and spicy chutneys served with boondi in Mumbai. Or Kolkata, where the mish-mash of art and culture is represented by mashed potatoes. Or in Bangalore, where carrots and onions are provided irrespective of inflation. I have had pani puri stuffed with potatoes, chanaa, grams and sprouts. I have had chutneys made of mint, tamarind, rasam, and even vodka! The pani puri is street food in the truest sense  it is handmade, served by hand, and can only be eaten using ones hands.The pandemic wreaked havoc for street food vendors. Since they operate on a small scale, daily working capital is crucial to their operations. Operating mostly from stalls, they do not qualify to sell their food through online food-delivery apps. When health, hygiene and immunity came under scrutiny, street food vendors had no option but to wind up shop and stare at a bleak future. Since most vendors are migrants from north India, the pani puri stalls near my house vanished after March 2020.So, imagine my joy when I found my friendly neighbourhood pani puri seller back at his spot. A once bustling space was now deserted. When I walked up to him, I could see familiarity mixed with relief on his face. He was wearing gloves, and the entire stall was sanitised. As he mixed his ingredients, he looked over at me tentatively, perhaps worried that he didnt live up to my imaginary standards of hygiene. The frills  onion, carrots, groundnuts  had all suffered from cost-cutting. I had my share of pani puri and just as I reached into my pocket, he pointed to a scanner in front of him. I took out my phone and transferred twenty rupees to his account.But as I was about to leave, he handed me the dry, extra pani-puri that you always get for free. As it imploded in my mouth and the flavours stormed out in celebration, I walked back home with a satisfied smile. While some things might never be the same for street food hawkers, other things remain exactly the same!"

As Ramesh peels carrots, cauliflower, potatoes and onions with quick strokes, leaving those watching awed, he says that he has been selling his peeler called fata fat that he claims he invented 20 years ago. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, sales have dwindled but he hopes to do brisk business at the protest site.Theatrical notesA few feet away is Sonu who shows theatrics to make passers-by stop and take note of his innovative squeezer that can be used to make juice out of citrus fruits without having to cut them or leave a mess on the table. His gadget, priced at 20 has found many takers, which has come as a relief after the lockdown slump.I buy my stock from Sadar Bazaar and sell them across the city. I have been coming to the protest site for the past few days and have found more takers than anywhere else in the city, he said.A family that has travelled from Yamunanagar to show solidarity with the farmers after eating a meal of rice and dal at a langar says the innovative products add an interesting touch to the protest. We have been coming here often to show solidarity. The last time we came here, we were treated to a popcorn langar and now we have seen some interesting products. For people to keep coming back to show solidarity, these are interesting changes, says Harkeerat Kaur a visitor.It is not only wandering vendors who are looking for a change of fortunes at the protest site but also those with permanent shops. Akhilesh, who has a sticker shop, says: Earlier, we used to make stickers that said Jai Mata Di or other message stickers popularly stuck behind trucks. But now there have been no takers so we have started making and selling stickers related to the farmers protest.He says that he has made the designs using a software and sells them for a profit of 10 to 15. He keeps changing the designs so that farmers dont get bored of his patterns."

Foodwrap is a pure vegetarian home catering enterprise that the mother-daughter runs from their home in Jubilee Hills since 2014. This is not just a business, but its our passion project, asserts Abhipsa who quit her job at a call centre to start this kitchen with her mother. And the passion surely transcends into the delicious food that they make. Specialising in Marwari cuisine, giving healthy twists to regular food is what sets them apart.For instance, the Rajkachori that I had was made in fresh, crisp poori stuffed with dhokla made with spinach and topped with sev, coriander and tamarind chutney and curd. The green dhokla gave the chaat a splash of colour and a unique twist to this street-food. Abhipsa says, Some people do not prefer aloo, so we add dhokla.Abhipsa ans Nirmala TulshanThe Marwari lunch that followed was a simple meal that had the quintessential tastes of ghar ka khana, without any added colours, preservatives or extra oil. The paneer badami was not spicy, was a little sweet in light tomato gravy topped with slivers of almonds. It paired well with hara bhara parathas made of wheat. The nutritious rotis were soft and thankfully, not oily. The meal also had a mix of dal chawal  typical tuvar daal in a flavourful tadka mixed with white rice.Two types of home-made pickles  one with red chillies and the other made with potatoes and green peas! Yes, you read right, and it was lip-smacking. Fluffy and tangy dahi vada and gaund laddoo ended the meal. The healthy laddoo made of jaggery had a nice crunch, and we couldnt stop at just one. The USP of our food is that each and every component is made at home and we dont compromise on the quality of the ingredients, shares the duo that runs this with five other staff.Not just sticking to traditional Mawari food, they also make international dishes such as spinach rice with veg augratin, pastas, burgers, etc. On the range of food, she says, We started with daily meals and chaats to fill the gap for good ghar ka khana, which became an instant hit. We moved on to making homemade dry snacks like bhel, jhaal muri, mathris, and flavoured bhujiyas. Abhipsa credits her mother Nirmala for these recipes.Always open to adaptation, she adds, We customise our starters; whip up new dishes and tweak the old ones of my mothers recipes. As they do not have a fixed menu and also do on-site catering, orders have to be placed two days in advance. Food is delivered in leak-proof packaging using local courier services. Going forward, she says, We want to make the best vegetarian dry snacks and home-cooked food, and adds, Happiness is homemade.She can be reached at: abtulshan@gmail.com Tamanna S Mehdi tamanna@newindianexpress.com @tamannamehdi"

The daily wagers are charged Rs 8 per meal. Beggars relish it for free. The benefactor, Alok Kumar Ghose, is a businessman and politician, known widely for his social work.Had it not been for the ready meals and ration, consisting of mustard oil, potato, rice, pulses, my family would have gone hungry, said Asim Dhar, a daily wager.Ghose (62), a local BJP leader, offered cooked food to hundreds and thousands of the poor, including beggars, during the difficult months of the COVID-19 pandemic. He had offered ration too.Its the call of my soul that I started NaMo canteen. It has no connection whatsoever with elections or votes. Elections come once in five years but I have been doing social work for the past more than 20 years, Ghose told this newspaper.He said as a school student, he grew up struggling but was inspired by Swami Vivekanandas famous quote: Those who serve mankind and any other living beings are serving God.Mariani (in Jorhat district of Upper Assam) is a backward constituency. There are no industries, factories etc where the poor can work to eke out a living, he said.Thirty people can eat at a time at NaMo canteen. Some 30-35 beggars eat one square meal every day. Preparing each meal entails an expenditure of Rs 15. I also spend Rs 15,000 to pay the salaries of employees, Ghose said, adding, I had to keep the canteen closed during the pandemic but I offered cooked food and ration to the poor.He has plans to start another NaMo canteen provided he gets the support and cooperation of people.A party hopper, Ghose has contested all Assembly elections since 2001.

Ashok Behera of Iswarpur village is worried that he would not be able to cover the input cost if the price remains unchanged.Abani Swain of Bahakandia village said he had availed a loan of Rs 1 lakh for growing potato on his four acre of land and has sustained a loss of around Rs 40,000.Absence of cold-storage and food processing units in the district have only made matters worse for the farmers, whose overall input cost including fertiliser and irrigation was much higher this year. Left with little option, several farmers of the district are resorting to distress sale of the tuber.The two primary reasons for this are lack of market linkage and unavailability of cold storages, said Sarafat Ali, a vegetable seller of Kendrapara town, adding he is procuring potato for Rs 5 per kg from the farmers and selling it for Rs 7 per kg.In a bid to make Odisha self-sufficient in potato cultivation, the State government had launched the State Potato Mission in 2015-16 for production, storage and distribution of the tuber.The scheme was implemented through the Directorate of Horticulture under Agriculture Department. Under the scheme, the department was supposed to extend incentive to farmers for undertaking large-scale cultivation of potatoes in clusters.This apart, the farmers were to be given incentive for production of seed potatoes and support for setting up of adequate number of cold storages.However in 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report stated that the State government failed to utilise a single penny of the Rs 20 crore sanctioned in 2017-18 for promotion of Potato Mission.Due to the apathy of the State government towards the mission, a large number of farmers are in deep trouble, alleged farmers leader and president of Krusaka Sabha, Umesh Chandra Singh.Assistant director of Horticulture department, Kanda Jena said the district needs more cold storages to ensure the farmers do not resort to distress sale of the tuber."

While she enjoyed baking special cakes for friends and family while growing up, she never really had time to take her hobby seriously. It was when she moved to India with her family  her husband Ariel Seidman is the Deputy Consul General of Israel to South India  that she found time on hand to pursue her otherwise weekend hobby.An accountant by profession with a masters from Bar Ilan University, Israel, Seidman worked in different positions related to finance for 17 years, with her last stint being at an industrial company. as the CFO. When I moved here in 2018 for my husbands job, I was not working for the first time, and had free time to take my hobby seriously. So I really perfected techniques of working with various ingredients, cake wrapping, jelly injecting, decorations and more, says Seidman (38), who feels India is what made her take baking one step ahead.The move also opened doors to another interest  yoga. Never having visited the country before, Seidman had imagined India as the city of Delhi: a big metro, hot weather, spicy food, pollution, women in sarees and yoga everywhere. I found the last two to be true. Before we moved here, I wanted to know Bangalore better. So I came here without my family for a few days. Thats when I found yoga, which became my new passion, says Seidman, who will be finishing a master course in it very soon.Her day usually starts early with an hour of yoga practice, and a few times a week, Seidman goes out for a run at GKVK, Cubbon Park or around the Dollars Colony neighbourhood. Its an old hobby, which I feel goes alongside with my yoga practice, says Seidman, who home schools her daughters, Lia (7) andEmma (3).Since Seidman bakes as a hobby, and not business, this gives her the chance to try, fail and try again. Requests usually start with an idea or request from friends  something light with flowers or very chocolaty with a princess. Its about finding the right combinations of ingredients and flavours, and putting it together. As I rarely make the same cake twice, its a combination of art and baking, says Seidman. In the past few years, she has also started watching YouTube videos of bakers and chocolatiers and started trying to make more sophisticated products. Fancy cakes, praline, and cookies have come off the oven with her taking several workshops to perfect different techniques.But the biggest challenge she finds is baking gluten-free sweets that no one can tell are any different. My daughter has a celiac disease so our house is all gluten-free. As this is not very common in India, I find that I have to bring a lot of ingredients from Israel and other countries in Europe or the US. However, when it comes to flours, India actually has a lot to offer in the gluten-free area, as a lot of millets and different kinds of dal can easily be found, she says, adding, I always need to find substitutes for maida, and this usually means mixing various kinds of flour (millet, rice, buckwheat, quinoa, potato, dal, corn, teff, oat and more) to get the balance that will give the right flavour, texture and smell. This balance wont be the same for different products (such as cake and puri). Finding the right combination for every product is a huge task.To check out her work, visit @sweetart_linoy on Instagram"
2021-03-03,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/mar/03/turning-to-turnip-for-therapeutic-treats-2271252.html,Turning to turnip for therapeutic treats,"Roshne Balasubramanian ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: A few weeks back, Canadian cabinetmaker Damien Allard became the proud owner of three massive, recordbreaking creamy white and purple topped turnips all of which broke the Guinness record for the worlds heaviest turnip (weighing 22.9 kg, 24.4 kg and 29 kg).While we are sure that the Quebec resident has quite a lot of cooking to do with the colossal root vegetables, lets trace how the lesser-known (now record-worthy) cousin of potato, broccoli and Brussel sprouts provides plenty of nutrients while being low in calories.The turnip and its leafy greens are not only tasty but also nutritious. However, we seldom find people here adding it as a staple in their meals, notes Dhanalakshmi R, dietician, Rainbow Childrens Hospital, talking about the underground veggie variant.Gut healthAvailable at stores in the local markets and priced anything between Rs 25-Rs 30 (per 500 g), turnips are packed with fibrous goodness and can help in aiding weight loss and relieving intestinal problems. A cup of raw turnip has about 2.75 g of dietary fibre in it.This helps reduce pressure and inflammation in the colon, explains the medical practitioner, adding that the presence of high dietary fibres can also enable making bowel movements easier. The gut function is important in getting rid of toxins through bile and stool and the properties in turnips aids in maintaining a healthy digestive tract, she says.Aids in weight lossWith a high water content and low-calorie count, the consumption of the non-starchy vegetable makes people fuller for a longer period, aiding in weight loss. A 100 g of turnip has only 1.39 g of carbohydrates. So, it can be consumed by all and especially those who are on a journey to manage their weight, she says.Reduces blood pressureAccording to a study in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, foods containing (read turnips) high dietary nitrates were projected to benefit the health of the blood vessels. Rich in potassium (about 300 mg), it helps in lowering the bodys blood pressure by releasing sodium from the body. This helps the arteries dilate, she shares.For a long time, a healthy intake of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage and our star of the day, turnip, have been associated with a lower risk of cancer. Dhanalakshmi supports this link. The presence of a sulphur-rich compound called sulforaphane, a phytochemical can neutralise toxins. This plays an integral part in promoting anti-cancer activities in the body, she explains.Studies of a kind of indole in turnips, arvelxin, also suggest that it blocks pro-inflammatory compounds such as nitric oxide, aiding in reducing inflammation caused by diseases including arthritis, cancer, and high blood pressure.Immunity boosterBesides its wide profile of benefits, the vegetable is also rich in vitamin C, which is important for building and maintaining collagen, the component which provides structure to the skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of turnips can benefit the immune system and reduce hair loss prompted by iron deficiency.It can be added twice or thrice in a week in a meal, she shares. With a crispy, white inner flesh and a fresh, zesty flavour, turnips can be boiled or mashed, shredded or chopped, used as a salad garnish or added to stews and soups.NUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP GREENS (PER 100 G)Calories: 40 KcalsProtein: 3.12 gCarbohydrates: 6.16 g Fat: 0.35 g, Fibre: 2.76 gPotassium: 300 mgNUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP ROOT (PER 100 G)Calories: 21 KcalsProtein: 1.58 gFat: 0.35 gFibre: 2.75 gCarbohydrates: 1.39 gWater content: 93.1 %Vitamin C: 64.7 mgRECIPETURNIP GREEN CURRYINGREDIENTSAny dal: 2 tbspGreen chilli: 3-4Onion: 1 (chopped)Tomato: 1 (chopped)Garlic cloves: 6-7 piecesTamarind pieceTurnips (root and greens):As required (chopped)Salt: To tasteTurmeric: 1 tspOil: 1 tbspMustard, cumin, Asafoetida: As requiredMETHODPick a dal of your choice, and add two tablespoons of it into a pressure cooker and soak it in water.Add green chillies, chopped onions, tomato, garlic cloves, tamarind piece and the chopped turnip rootand greens.Add turmeric and salt to taste.

Co-editor with Shilpa Shah for books by the TAPI Collection, author Tulsi Vatsal writes in Paeonies and Pagodas that the tripartite trade between India and China involving tea, cotton and opium resulted in large consignments of the commodities.The word Gara comes from the Gujarati word garo  meaning width. Surat emerged as a gara hub and it was so high in demand that the embroidery was sold by weight. Huge sums would be paid for innovative designs which extended to the pallu and all-over designs.The opium crates exported to China were brought back by the Parsi traders filled with exotic Chinese silks for their wives. Emblems from these silks depicting emblems such as the phoenix, fish, roosters and flowers resonated with the Parsis and they immediately adapted these to their wardrobe. Runners and shawls were cut into borders and attached to the sarees.Soon, running borders were locally embroidered specifically for sarees. Motifs were adapted onto lighter silks, chiffon and georgette for a flowy silhouette.The Parsi garas were a sophisticated fashion statement for the wives of successful Parsi professionals who often accompanied their husbands at official functions, and thanks to the East India House that sold fashionable fabric, this oriental embroidery was already a rage in London in the 19th century. Overtime, the symbols from the garas were also adopted into the auspicious, chalk or rangoli, which Parsis designed at their door steps for good luck.After the second World War , the demand for garas decreased. Revived in the present day, the embroidery has made a comeback with modern patterns in pretty blouses, stoles, vests, little purses along with the sarees. Designer Ashdeen Lilaowala, who has researched the art well, has included traditional flora fauna in the contemporary styling.Garas Chinese symbols have Gujarati names such as  Cheena-Cheeni meaning Chinese people and their landscapes replete with Pagodas, Knada-Papeta (onions and potatoes ) for polka dots, Margha marghi, chakla chakli for roosters, hen and sparrows; and karolia for spiders. Often the infamous Chinese bats on the garas were mistaken for butterflies, while the dragons were conspicuous because it was only allowed for the Chinese emperors clothing."

In the coming days, the farmers are anticipating that the price may go down further spelling further misery, said secretary of district unit of All India Krusaka Sabha, Padmalav Das.The dip in price has affected farmers of Derabisi, Mahakalapada, Garadapur, Pattamundai, Aul, Rajkanika and Rajnagar blocks. Absence of cold storage adds to the problem of farmers. This apart, absence of market linkage and availability of better quality tomatoes sources from Andhra Pradesh have only added to the farmers problems.Secretary of district unit of Krusaka Sabha, Umesh Chandra Singh said officials of Agriculture and Horticulture departments along with elected representatives must visit the villages to witness the predicament of farmers. The authorities should fix a support price for tomatoes so that the farmers can recover their losses, he said, adding if no steps are taken soon, the farmers will take to the streets as a mark of protest."

It is only at Vashi APMC that we face this issue. We spend around 85 for each sack and the weight limit will lead to losses.

While the number of people experiencing side effects are low, what should you do if you do feel some mild symptoms like fever or body ache after getting the vaccine?We all reach out for our comfort food like a hot cup of tea or a bowl of soup when we feel under the weather. In this article, we will tell you the best thing to have after getting a COVID jab.Chicken soup is one of the best foods you can have after getting the COVID vaccine shot. (Sorry vegetarians! Have a warm vegetable soup!)As per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, one may experience some adverse side effects of taking the COVID 19 vaccine.As per experts, these side effects are a result of the inflammation that is happening within your body. Your body reacts to the spike protein and is working to fight off the stimulated infection. Fever, sore arms, body ache are some of the common symptoms when your immune system is fighting something.Thus, it is recommended to eat immunity-boosting foods to support a speedy recovery. It is especially recommended to have foods that have high water content. The CDC recommends having plenty of water, as fluids are important for recovery after getting the COVID 19 vaccine. This means anti-inflammatory foods that can hydrate you can help immensely with recovery.If you are feeling under the weather after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, broth-based soup like chicken noodle, minestrone or simple bone broth soup is great for you. If your soup has other immune-boosting foods like kale, beans, lentils, potato, broccoli, it's even better.If you are a non-vegetarian and you have to pick a soup after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, chicken soup is your best bet. According to the CHEST Journal, the chicken soup actually does have beneficial medicinal impact and has a mild anti-inflammatory effect. While it's unclear exactly which particular element is helpful, all the classic elements including chicken, carrots, celery, parsley, salt and pepper all help fight inflammation.Bone broth has amino acids called glycine and arginine, which have a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, if you don't feel like eating anything, you can simply sip on a cup of bone broth."

Understood to possess several health benefits  like keeping cholesterol and diabetes in check, taking care of stomach and heart ailments  is it really meant for everyone?Rashi Chowdhary, a diabetes educator, has answers for you. In an Instagram post, she wrote that keeping genetic differences in mind can help us appreciate more of a balanced approach rather than completely giving up the proteins weve eaten comfortably for years.READ | Vegan diet vs Mediterranean diet: Which is better for weight loss?View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rashi Chowdhary (@rashichowdhary)READ | Healthy living: This is why FSSAI recommends a plant-based dietShe explained how the production of vitamin A  aka retinol  is affected because we have a genetic difference. When we eat, our body produces two types of vitamin A: beta carotene, found in plant foods like most orange and yellow foods like mango, oranges, yellow peppers and sweet potato. Secondly, retinol is solely found in eggs, meat derived from animals. The retinol version of vitamin A is super important for your immune system, skin, eyes, reproductive health and dental bacteria. If youre only eating a plant-based diet, be prepared that beta-carotene cant do the magic that retinol does.Why is beta-carotene enzyme important?In order to convert the beta-carotene produced from our food to vitamin A or retinol, our bodies produce a gene coding known as the BCMO1. If youre blessed with great BCOM1 enzymes then your body can work well on a plant-based diet. However, not everyone has these genes!She also mentioned that some people have slower versions of the BCMO1 gene while others are blessed with a stronger version. If by any chance this is the case with you, your body may not be able to convert the appropriate amounts of beta carotene to retinol to meet the requirements. Having said that, the best option is to get yourself tested, she suggested.For those who regularly consume animal meat, the diabetes educator said their body directly absorbs retinol from the meat and does not need the BCOM1 gene. This is why there are fewer cases of those with vitamin A deficiency present.The key to switching to a 100 per cent plant-based diet is by making a connection between what you eat and how you feel and do it for a while till you yourself know what works for you.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"
2021-03-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/all-things-lime-and-lemony/article34002191.ece,All things lime and lemony,"Azuma Kara is the new address for Oriental meals in South DelhiI dont have a green thumb, but there is one plant on my balcony I have taken good care of  and thats my potted lemongrass. The stalks are green and tall, and wave out to me cheerily when I am anywhere around it. I get its fragrance, and look at the plant a bit sorrowfully. I am sorry, but one day you are going to get added to my soup, I tell the plant.And when it does, it will greatly enhance the flavour of the soup -- just like the lemongrass that gave zest to the tom yam soup I had a few days ago. The soup had been tempered with Thai herbs, and the presence of lemongrass in it was unmistakable. I scooped out the small shrimps in the broth and, with that, started quite a memorable Oriental meal delivered by a new outlet called Azuma Kara. Based in Shahpur Jat, it delivers food with the help of Swiggy and Zomato, and its own delivery service. It is open every day of the week, from 12pm to 12am (Ph no: +917827906772)I opened the elegantly designed menu card on the net, and found that it had some of my favourite dishes. I am greatly fond of Thai food  and cant have enough of the flavours that kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal add to the cuisine. So even though the menu has Japanese and other kinds of cuisines, I stuck (more or less) to my favourite Southeast Asian region. I asked for chicken Thai herb dim sums and Prawn kaffir lime dim sums ( 390 each), char sui bao pork ( 490), Thai green curry chicken ( 680), pad Thai noodles ( 280) and lemongrass tiramisu ( 380).The tom yam prawn soup ( 340) was hearty, if a bit salty. It was pleasantly aromatic, and I had it with a crusty piece of bread. I moved on to the dim sums. The filling in the dim sum casings were robust  the chicken with Thai herbs had a nice flavour, as did the prawn with kaffir lime leaves. I then had a piece of the bao  and enjoyed the pork belly filling on spicy mayo.I am a green curry fan, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The chicken had soaked in the tastes and aromas of the herbs  especially the lemongrass  and I had it with some sticky rice and vegetable pad Thai. The icing was the lemongrass tiramisu  the herb gave the soft and cheesy dessert a delicious kick and aftertaste.The menu is an interesting one, and I am not surprised, for the chef at Azuma Kara was earlier at Blue Ginger, known for its Vietnamese cuisine, in Taj Palace. It has Vietnamese summer rolls on the menu, and the soup list includes cauliflower miso soup and Thai coconut soup (both  350). On the sushi list are rolls with mango and avocado, salmon and tuna ( 460-890). Among the interesting dishes are its one-meal bowls  spicy tuna poke bowl ( 690), tofu poke bowl ( 620), massaman pork curry with sticky rice and Asian greens ( 840) and Peruvian potatoes, wild mushroom and winter truffles ( 940).But I was happy with my dishes. In these troubled times, it was nice to get the old familiar fragrance of Thai herbs in my food. The lemongrass plant in the pot  still intact  seemed happy as well. It gave me a whiff of its heady scent when I stepped out to the balcony the next morning.(The writer is a seasoned food critic)"
2021-03-07,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/digging-in-for-the-summer/article34009812.ece,Digging in for the summer,"In a bid to handle the heat, protesting farmers at Delhis borders are setting up trolley colonies and semi-permanent structures that have been fitted with desert coolers and air conditionersProtesting farmers at Delhis borders are relying on their innovative skills to tackle the impending summer, and encouraging empathetic collaboration to ensure a good harvest back home.The agitation against the three contentious farm laws began over 100 days ago. At the start, roads leading up to the protest sites were packed with tractors. But the numbers have dipped slightly as the machines are needed back in the villages for harvest season. The number of trollies, however, has increased and they are at the core of the changing landscape at the protest sites.Innovations range from RO purification-enabled submersible water devices, 500-litre water storage tanks filled with buttermilk, air-conditioned semi-permanent structures with their own sewerage system, trollies with desert coolers, and trenches to keep water from entering tents during the monsoon.Trolley colonies have sprung up around semi-permanent structures laden with wet jute bags that will cool the air through portable fans, and submersible pumps are being installed along NH 9 to help create bathrooms for women protesters.At the Singhu border protest site, trollies have been fitted with desert coolers and even air conditioners. A dental clinic near the main stage has started distributing medicines from inside a semi-permanent structure and is also fitted with an air conditioner.Fans are being brought to the Tikri and Ghazipur border protest sites to cool the tents. Multiple 500-litre water tanks are replenished several times a day with lassi or buttermilk at the Tikri border and, like in Ghazipur, more bathing areas have also been created there. Both sites have also received additional washing machines.Summer planSemi-permanent tents are being pitched not only to counter the heat but to also provide accommodation for farmers staying at the Singhu border without trollies. Ply-based and ready-made structures that can accommodate around 10-15 people have also been procured.Meanwhile, several patches of vacant land along NH 9 have been cleared of shrubbery and rocks to make way for trollies covered with tarpaulin and plastic sheets parked in a rectangular pattern  each seemingly constituting a separate room surrounded by porous green cloth  forming mini dwellings with elderly farmers resting on mattresses placed in the middle. The vacant plots are covered in trees that provide some relief from the sun.Rohtash Kumar from Bhiwani said semi-permanent structures such as sheds for tractors, and trollies laden with supplies, are coming up along the highway. The already-erected tents will see slight modifications as the mercury rises.Some of our tents have multiple arrangements, including a kitchen and sleeping area. Then, there are the larger tents, which are used to store vegetables and other edibles... We are covering the tin ceilings of sheds for our vehicles with jute bags, and will put cardboard ceilings on the smaller tents for the summer. The larger ones will be covered by jute sheets which will be kept wet around the clock and have fans to keep the edibles cool, he said.Luvpreet Singh from Fatehabad led the way to a large tractor colony that has been set up on a recently-cleared vacant plot. The encampment is preparing for the arrival of women protesters. The owner of the land is a farmer like us. Not only did he give us permission to use the plot but also allowed us to build semi-permanent structures, Mr. Singh said.Suresh Goswami from Jind in Punjab, who has been camping along the NH 9 since late November last year, said large fans that are used on farms will be placed next to the semi-permanent structures. They will be covered with wet jute sheets to keep them cool. Since it is proving slightly difficult to gather water on a daily basis, we have made arrangements to ensure our own water supply by installing submersible pumps. Around a dozen have been set up and we will instal a total of 50 by April. We will not leave till the laws are repealed, he said.Community harvestThe number of tractors is about the same as when the agitation started but sometimes tractors do need to go back to villages since the fields are being watered for the fourth time before the harvest, said Virender Singh from Hisar, whose tent is among the many occupying the divider on NH 9 near the Rohtak bypass.We have assigned duties for this. For example, one brother waters the fields and then comes here on the family tractor so the other can go back. If the family tractor is not available for some reason, a trolley  sometimes even two  take its place here, he added.Gurdeep Singh from Patiala said though the harvest season was still a month away, farmers were in the process of making adjustments and arrangements so they did not face issues once the harvest began.Village panchayats have played a significant role in helping households reach an understanding regarding the pooling and sharing of resources, he said, adding: Once the harvest begins, farmers will be sharing their resources with each other to ensure the process is completed smoothly. Each village has sent around 50 tractors and trolleys. There are hundreds that are still in the villages and that should suffice for the season.Manjeet Singh Shergill from Bahal village said their goal to get the controversial laws repealed necessitated willingness to be able to fight for a long duration. Usually, each household has at least two tractors and trolleys. In case a family faces some kind of a shortage due to the protest, other villagers are more than willing to share. Had there been a logistical issue, we would not have brought tractors here in the first place, Mr. Shergill said.Jatvinder Singh from Hoshiarpur said only half of the tractors and trollies in his village had come to the protest. In our village, we have around 200-250 tractors and trolleys. Out of that, only about 100 are here. We have also started putting up tents as there is uncertainty over how long this will continue, he said, adding: In case some of us are required to take back our trolleys for a few days, with the tents installed, there accommodation will be sorted.There is a sense of community sharing in the villages and there were enough resources back home for the upcoming harvest, Ramandeep Singh from Patiala said, adding: Recently, a farmer from our village found himself without a tractor which he required for harvesting potato. His neighbours arrived with seven tractors to compensate for the one tractor that is stationed at the Singhu border protest site.Sukhjeet Singh Sidhu from Ajrawar village said people were more than ready to help each other out given the ongoing agitation. Currently, it is harvest season for potato and sugarcane. Once those farmers are done, they will replace us at the borders. There are a large number of trolleys in our villages, it is unlikely that we will need to take back the trolleys stationed at the protest sites, he said."
2021-03-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/lucknow-two-workers-killed-in-ammonia-gas-leak-in-cold-storage-unit-7218594/,Lucknow: Two workers killed in ammonia gas leak in cold-storage unit,"Two labourers working in a potato cold-storage unit here died and two were seriously injured after inhaling ammonia gas that leaked following an explosion in a pipeline late on Saturday night. The incident occurred in the Itaunja police station area.The injured were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of King Georges Medical University (KGMU) Trauma Centre. Their condition is improving gradually, according to the police.Sources said the control valve of a pipeline carrying ammonia to the Vindeshwari cold-storage facility exploded, causing panic. Four labourers working in the unit at the time inhaled the ammonia. The deceased were identified as Sitapur residents Mishrilal (28) and Dharmendra (27), while Paramanda and Vinod were injured and moved to KGMU. About half-a-kilometre of the area around the facility was cordoned off as a precautionary measure as the fire department brought the gas leak under control.We have registered an FIR against the cold storage owner, identified as Santosh Pandey, and manager, who is yet unidentified, under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC. As per the information there was an explosion in the oxygen supply and caused a leak of ammonia gas, said Bakshi ka Talab Circle Officer (CO) Hirdesh Katheriya.Lucknow (Rural) SP Hirdesh Kumar said experts were trying to figure out why the explosion occurred. Action would be taken based on their report, he added.After coming to know about the incident, our main focus was on the treatment of the injured. Based on the statement of those injured, and findings by the experts we will come to know more about the incident. We will be taking further action based on that. As of now, we know that there was a leak of ammonia gas that is used in cold storages. The death was caused by the inhalation of the same. There were four labourers present on the premises at the time of the incident and they came in contact [with the gas], said the SP.Ammonia is used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. In cold-storage facilities, it is stored for industrial use in liquid form under high pressure and low temperature. It adversely affects human beings who come in contact with it. It can cause irritation in eyes, skin, nose and throat even in moderate amounts. Ammonia interacts immediately upon contact with available moisture in skin, eyes, oral cavity or respiratory tract to form the very caustic ammonium hydroxide that disrupts cell membrane lipids. It ultimately leads to cellular destruction. The gas is toxic and affects lungs, with a possibility of causing chemical pneumonitis  inflammation of the lung caused by aspirating or inhaling irritants."
2021-03-08,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/importance-of-vitamin-c-for-women/articleshow/81375341.cms,Importance of Vitamin C for women,"Women across the world play multiple roles to adapt to the modern way of living in the society today. While they continue to juggle to do their best in the personal and professional front, one thing that often gets ignored is their health. Women tend to miss out on some of the most beneficial supplements in the daily grind, also, due to lack of awareness about their benefits. Take, Vitamin C, for instance, the immunity boosting, and often misunderstood vitamin. It is water soluble, hence, your body cannot store it. This is precisely why you need to consume it every day through food and other supplements, for it to have the required effect in the body. Dietary recommendations for Vitamin C are often not met because of poor lifestyle, various diseases, smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.Now, while most properties of Vitamin C help both genders the same, especially in boosting immunity, there are some that work particularly well for women. As women multi-task around the clock, lead hectic lifestyles and often fall prey to many lifestyle diseases, supplements like Vitamin C balance what their diets could be missing, lets take a closer look at the advantages of Vitamin C for women.This water-soluble nutrient acts a powerful antioxidant is needed for the development and maintenance of arterioles, scar tissues and cartilage. Collagen is a substance that is naturally produced by the body. However, the production of this substance diminishes as people grow older. Vitamin C plays an integral part in the production of collagen which therefore decreases wrinkles and the symptoms and signs of aging.Due to the needs of the developing foetus and the growing infant, vitamin C requirements are enhanced for pregnant and lactating women. The Vitamin C status of pregnant women is often lower than non-pregnant women, presumably due to active transfer of Vitamin C to the foetus. Women with complications of pregnancy can have much lower vitamin C status l. Supplementation of pregnant women with Vitamin C can potentially decrease the risk of pregnancy-related complications.Stress can affect various processes in the body like hormone production, the menstrual cycle, and fertility in women and men as well as digestion and immune function. When your body is exposed to stressful stimuli, the body makes the body makes it the priority over many other important processes. Vitamin C helps in dealing with typical indicators of physical and emotional stress. It also decreases the level of stress hormones. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women but is often underestimated and undiagnosed. Incidences of abnormally high blood pressure can be lowered by the regular intake of Vitamin C.Vitamin C supplements can help improve the absorption of iron from the diet. Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as plant-based sources of iron, into a form that is easier to absorb. As a result, it may help reduce the risk of anaemia among people prone to iron deficiency.Vitamin C supplements have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. These supplements may reduce the impact of known risk factors for heart disease such as high blood levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.Vitamin C can elevate your estrogen levels and lower progesterone levels. This causes the uterus to contract and the lining of the uterus to break down, leading to the onset of menstruation.The daily intake of Vitamin C depends on the country you are residing in. In India, you need 65-115 mg of Vitamin C depending on your age.66 mg/day68 mg/day65 mg/day80 mg/day115 mg/dayCitrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of Vitamin C. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe. Not all fruits and vegetables have equal levels of Vitamin C. For instance, bananas and apples are quite low in Vitamin C whereas oranges, strawberries, tomato, kiwi have a higher content. Vitamin C supplements are available as tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, and effervescent tablets. Not all Vitamin C supplements are created equal. To better ensure quality and safety, choose supplements that have been tested and certified by an authorised certifying body, such as the FSSAI (The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India).Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that must be obtained from the diet or supplements. Vitamin C plays an important role in strengthening your immune system thus enabling you to lead a healthy life."
2021-03-08,https://www.thehindu.com/society/india-push-cart-vendors-breadwinners-womens-day-2021/article34018253.ece,A spotlight on India’s women breadwinners who #ChooseToChallenge tough streets,"This Womens Day 2021, we talk to the breadwinners who have carved their own niche in the name of both street cred and strengthAleyamma John, fishmonger, ThiruvananthapuramBalancing the large aluminium vessel heavy with fresh fish on her head is a skill Aleyamma John has perfected over 45 years.At 26, I began selling fish door-to-door to make ends meet. After my husband, John, fell ill, it is my earning that helped raise my three daughters and son. My husband was a fisherman and we had our own boat and nets. But all that was sold to meet his medical expenses, she says.In a chequered kaili lungi, long blouse and a thorthu thrown over her shoulder, Aleyamma is a picture of resilience. Her weatherbeaten face is wreathed in smiles as she pulls out a smaller aluminium container from the large one she keeps the fish in, turns it over and sits on it to talk about life.Hailing from a fishing community at Vettukadu, Aleyamma recalls her mother walking from the beachside village to the city, 10 kilometres away, every day. Many women in my generation followed in their footsteps. Rain or shine, we had to reach the city and back again. No buses would permit us to travel with our wicker baskets of fish. The day still starts early with Aleyamma making her way to the Vettukadu or Vizhinjam, near Kovalam, to buy the catch of the day. But now, she and two others take an autorickshaw to the city and then walk to the homes of their regular customers. Each of them has a route, and they sell the fish and clean it for the buyer.Earlier, we used to go to the Karamana river at Edapazhanji and have a bath after we were done for the day. Nowadays kind householders permit us to use the washroom on their premises and also store the fish in an icebox. In the evening, we sit by the roadside at Vazhuthacaud to sell the fish. That is when officer-goers stop by. Aleyamma is grateful that she was able to get her children educated and married. Her son and one son-in-law is in West Asia. One grandson studies engineering and another works for a company in Technopark. My children are better off than where we started from. I keep reminding them that they must save for a rainy day.Alankrita Narula, paratha seller, DelhiEvery morning, Alankrita Narula would slip out of her city-girl clothes and into a salwar kameez. She would be up at 6 am, cooking, so she could head out on to the street by 9.30 am to set up her thela (cart), calledBalaji Paranthe, in a market near her apartment building in Delhis Dwarka.After spending 13 years in advertising, Alankrita decided to quit to follow her passion. It is a clich, she says, that rolls off the tongue easier than what it takes on ground  where pushing the cart, standing next to the fire, and working in sun and rain until 5.30 pm is not easy.She began in January 2020, mostly feeding daily wagers, Uber drivers, electricians and plumbers. In the beginning I thought of just serving aaloo ke parathe with dahi and pickle. I priced it at 50. In a couple of days I realised that people want a meal, and that 50 is too much for someone who barely earns 200 a day, she says. She brought her prices down to 20, and introduced a vegetable.Her family was nervous about how she would manage on the road, but Alankrita says she has never faced a security problem. The only problem she has is from people who came by in big cars and who bargain.I do think I am privileged, so sometimes I wonder whether I should be out on the street. For someone else it may not be a choice, and it does make me feel a little guilty to eat into someone elses street food business.Elardini Gautami, vegetable vendor, HyderabadThirty-eight-year-old Elardini Gautami does not know to read or write. However, her determination to educate her daughters drives her to work hard. Her day begins at 6 am when she heads to a vegetable wholesale market with her husband on his two-wheeler. Once she is back, she arranges them in a push cart and off she goes. Elardini says, My husband is a painter. I used to work as a part-time domestic help. The earning wasnt sufficient. Especially after my daughter passed her Class X we realised it would be tough for us to send her to college.Elardini (in yellow saree) selling vegetables to a customer in herI dont want my daughters to end up as domestic help. Pushing the cart around is not easy but then I have to do it to run my home and earn enough to pay my daughters fees.Elardinis elder daughter is in college and the younger one is in Class VIII. Elardini is satisfied that her daughters do well. I send them to a private school and want them to be able to speak in English. She admits that her work is challenging. When my body doesnt allow me to push the cart, I find a convenient and safe spot and sell from there. I cannot drink much water because there are no toilets. It results in headaches and body pain. Making a living from the road is a battle, but I will take it up for my daughters.Raji Muthuraj, bhajji seller, KochiRaji Muthuraj arrives at her pushcart, parked in Vyttila, Kochi, in an autorickshaw. She and her husband Muthuraj have the supplies for the day with them. Loaded in the three-wheeler are a gas cylinder and stove, various containers filled with batter and sliced onions for vada, boiled eggs for bhajji, potato mix for bonda, raw banana and chilli for fritters, and water, oil and milk for tea, besides utensils. They arrive at 3 pm to get ready for rush hour that starts at 4 pm. By the time they get home it is 10 pm.An adjective Raji frequently uses is super  the vada is super, as is the tea and the crisp egg bhajji. Cheerful with a ready smile, Raji is popular among regulars, most of whom have been buying from her for the 10 years they have been at Vyttila. Ever since we started, 20 years ago, I have been constantly by my husbands side  day or night, rain or shine. There is no other way to do this work, she says.She is the heart of the business, which has helped them raise and educate their four children  three girls and a boy; besides getting two of those girls married. She looks after the familys finances deciding on the investments, usually chit funds, big purchases such as the television and payment of EMIs too.The last year has been very tough for us financially, like it has been for everybody else. The first 50 days of lockdown, business came to a standstill. We are behind on the payment of some of our chit fund investments, she says, adding, We bought land [near Vyttila] and built our house without a housing loan, with the money we earned, she says. The money also goes into travelling with family to places such as Tirupati, Madurai or Kaniyakumari. Only two things mattered in the end  the food we ate and the places we saw!With inputs from Sunalini Mathew, Saraswathy Nagarajan, Shilpa Nair Anand and Prabalika M Borah"
2021-03-08,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cost-of-veggies-likely-to-drop-this-week/articleshow/81382840.cms,Chennai: Cost of veggies likely to drop this week,"Representative imageCHENNAI: The wholesale cost of most veggies are likely to drop this week, bringing down costs in neighbourhood retail shops along. The retail cost of veggies in the city is usually 20%-25% more than what they fetch in the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC).The cost of few vegetables such as carrots and shallots, being sold for twice as much as their wholesale cost, are currently burning a hole in consumers pockets.According to market sources, the cost of tomatoes , potatoes and shallots are expected to drop by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilogram, while drumstick rates could plunge by Rs 50/kg as arrivals to the city is increasing.The cost of curry leaves has been in the Rs 50 to Rs 70 price range for a while and a bunch of coriander is available for Rs 1 to Rs 3.S S Muthukumar, president of Koyambedu Semi-Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association, said carrot and drumstick prices have plunged as it is the harvest season of the vegetables. ""Carrot is largely procured from The Nilgiris district and the city receives drumstick from Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Villupuram districts,"" he said. The prices of potato and tomato are expected to fall further, he added. The KWMC has been receiving around 500 trucks of vegetables, a 100 more than November-December last year.On Sunday, 1kg of carrot was sold at Rs 46 in retail shops in Adyar and Rs 64 in Royapettah. While shallots cost Rs 140 in Adyar, it was Rs 120 at Royapettah. Tomatoes and onions were sold at Rs 28 to Rs 30 per kilogram in both the areas."
2021-03-22,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2021/mar/22/chamber-of-secrets-2279792.html,Food Review: Chamber of secrets,"Shantanu David ByExpress News ServiceWhen the Indian Hotel Company Limited (IHCL, or Taj group to friends) got to renew the contract for the Taj Mahal Hotel on Man Singh Road, there must have been a collective sigh of relief within the corridors of power that traverse New Delhi. Not only is the erroneously called Taj Man Singh a fixture of the Capitals landscape, but it is also home to The Chambers, a private members club dating back to 1982. Many a landmark deal has been struck over its menu, and the destinies of millions decided over dessert.Crust on ToastAlways only accessible to members, in its new avatar post renovation, The Chambers now comprises a new restaurant (Rayasina), seven meeting rooms, The Chambers Lounge, a whiskey bar, and a cigar lounge, sprawling over two floors of the iconic hotel. The Chambers, for those able to access it, is present across seven marquee Taj hotels in six cities including Dubai, and will soon have cream-of-the-crop up in London and Bengaluru. Membership to one means access to the rest, with newly updated technocrats, scions of business houses, and a select other few in line to become members. And yes, it is transferable to your descendants.Not being a member, yet an invitee, I begin the meal with a splash of Stranger & Sons Gin and tonic water (the restaurant has a gin cart with a plethora of spirits, mixers and garnishes), which goes down as smoothly as do the starters: Treacle Cured Salmon and Crab on Toast. Needless to say, there is something to whet and satiate every appetite. Crab on Toast is my favourite; the carelessly placed medallion of chicken liver pate accompanying it reminding me of the benefits of success. Forget goodie bags, Id like more sweet yet salty salmon, elevated by pickled cucumber, red radish and mandarin segments.Continuing the acquaintance with Strangers, I gravitate towards the Nossoto, and a Double Baked Cheddar Cheese Souffl, both dishes having such a powerful flavour profile that I cant help circling back to these.The Nossoto is, yes, a risotto, but made with pine nuts and pecorino, its utter umami broken up by citric grapefruit segments. The souffl, the double baked cheese one, gives you a perspective on decadence, in that theres no such thing as too much: the souffl, drenched in truffle oil and accoutred with pickled mushrooms and charred leeks, hits every flavour note.Speaking of bittersweet symphonies, lets go to the mains: Grilled Sea Bass with Admiral Sauce; Curry Grilled Lamb Chop; and an Olive Dust Chicken designed to simultaneously beguile the senses. The last comes with a potato gratin shaped into a chicken breast and soaked in the fowls natural jus, attended by crisp-yet-tender pieces of chicken.Thats why I stumble into the lamb chops, accentuated by quenelles of green pea mash and more. Indignantly stripping the meat off the bones, I go out to sea. Thank you Admiral (sauce) for your service, and thank you chef (meet him later this week in this publication) for the flaky fish and the lavishly scattered shrimp that festoon it.For dessert, we dabble with the Raspberry and Yoghurt Semifreddo, the Tasting of Coffee, and Chocolate Cheese Center. The first is an orchestra of flavours and textures, a dessert sans saccharine sweetness; while secundo is every coffee aficionados dream dessert. Then theres the price de resistance: three types and textures of chocolate shaped into a solid bar, with parmesan custard running through its middle. Enough said?"

(Express Photo)Claiming to puncture the Oppositions false propaganda, Sangrur MP and president of the Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party, Bhagwant Mann, on Tuesday presented the statement made by him in the Parliamentary Committee against farm laws and accused opposition parties of trying to create confusion among the people by spreading lies about AAP. Making public minutes of Parliaments Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution, Mann challenged former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to now make public the statements made by them in the Cabinet meeting and high-powered committee, respectively on the controversial farm laws.The Parliamentary Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution had recently submitted a report to the Centre recommending implementation of the Essential Commodities Act, 2020. It is one of the three agriculture laws that is being opposed by farmers who are protesting at Delhi borders.Mann said that the proposal put forward by the government in these laws would give impetus to hoarding, adding that removing onions and tomatoes from essential commodities list will make life difficult for the poor. He added that with the implementation of this Act hoarders would stockpile goods and later sell them at exorbitant prices.Mann said that he raised the issue in the meeting of the standing committee that Punjab was producing a large quantity of potatoes and farmers could not afford to keep potatoes in cold stores. He said that after this, the hoarders sell the potatoes at higher prices when there is a shortage of potatoes.Read | Kejriwal, Mann hand in glove with BJP govt at Centre: SADChallenging Harsimrat Kaur, Mann said , Now she should also make public proceedings of the meeting of June 5, 2020.Mann said that Congress and Akali Dal were in turmoil and to discredit the Aam Aadmi Party, the opposition parties are therefore engaged in spreading false propaganda."
2021-03-24,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/remember-when-we-made-dalgona-coffee/article34150146.ece,A year in lockdown: How the pandemic changed the way we cook and dine,"Our last unmasked night out at a restaurant was a year ago. The pandemic, and a year at the sink, has changed how we cook and dineThis time last year we were dreaming of butter in ransacked grocery aisles. Panic buying tinned food, stockpiling flour and hunting down biscuits in a desperate attempt to hold on to familiar comforts. Telling ourselves we just need to get through the next few weeks till things settle. Little did we know...Remember your last unmasked restaurant dinner? That final heady cocktail in our pre-pandemic, hedonistic sanitiser-free lives? The last packed nightclub, alive with strobe lights and sweaty with dancers, none of whom had ever quarantined.A time before QR-code menus, temperature checks and vaccination selfies.It has been a year since Indias first lockdown, and the pandemic has changed the way we live, and hence naturally, the way we eat.First, we washed dishesMarch 2020 was a haze of grocery runs, YouTube cooking classes and scrubbing kadais between Zoom meetings.Perhaps TikTok food trends best explain how the year influenced our cooking. First came sourdough, demanding skill, patience and basic ingredients  ideal for a time when ambulance sirens shrieked outside our windows and we craved a challenging distraction from ominous daily COVID-19 graphs.Then came Dalgona coffee, channelling our excess energy into whipping sugar, milk and instant coffee into a fragrant froth. Now, as life begins to resume familiar patterns, a quick, elegant nature cereal is trending: pomegranate seeds, berries and ice cubes in a bowl with coconut water.What they all have in common is a focus on quality ingredients. Through the first few months of lockdown, when fresh vegetables were in short supply, people began to explore ways to be more self sufficient, foraging through their backyards and starting kitchen gardens.Dalgona Coffee | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphotoParanoia around infected surfaces forced us to scrub our bags of rice, potatoes and apples with equal vigour, as well as cook instead of ordering in. Classes from mothers, grandmothers and chefs on Instagram demonstrated basic techniques and demystified regional ingredients, even as Facebook and WhatsApp groups buzzed with generously shared family recipes and cooking hacks.One year later, we are all more comfortable in the kitchen. It helps that lockdown triggered a wave of food start-ups supplying high quality sauces, pickles and masala for home cooks making it easier to put together both family meals and dinner parties.It also led to a dramatic rise in dishwasher sales.Now, the joy of masked diningCovid baby restaurants surprised everyone, including their promoters. Launching a restaurant is always risky. In a world bristling with fear, you would think it would be riskier. However, after many months of home cooking and solitary dining, customers are embracing new openings with excitement. So these spaces, opened soon after lockdown, bustle with a cheery camaraderie bolstered by a year of confinement.Eager to venture out again, buoyed by savings accrued from a year at home, people are congregating at restaurants to work, reunite with friends or just linger over coffee.The romance with home chefs was short. Of course, there was a rise in talented, motivated ones, who steadily cooked their way through the pandemic, drawing a loyal audience. But, in the surge of 2020, many put profits over passion, cutting costs on ingredients and raising prices arbitrarily. Quality is often inconsistent and packaging haphazard, although they do seem to strive tirelessly when it comes to updating Instagram.We also saw a surge in dark kitchens, as customers embraced takeaway, all of varying quality. Given the current levels of competition, many of last years food start-ups will not survive through 2021. The survival of the fittest will come into play, so the ones that do stay open will be a dependable, valuable addition to the citys foodscape.The pandemic has devastated the hospitality industry, with restaurant closures and job cuts. However, the last few months have seen an encouraging number of restaurant openings, capitalising on low rents, lower overheads and a large pool of talented manpower available because of last years closures.In response to the lockdowns, they are designed to be bright, filled with sunshine and colour. Menus focus on comfort over style, and local ingredients over imported exotica. Service is less formal, prioritising warmth over ritual. And customers, largely, are less demanding, grateful to be out again.After a year of uncertainty, restaurants remind us about the joy of social interaction, even if it does come with masks, temperature guns and sanitiser."

Nandu is back, but Banita and the children are still in their native village.As the country marked one year of the day  March 24  when it went into a hard lockdown with just over 500 positive cases, several migrant workers who lost their jobs and later left in Shramik trains to their native places from Punjab are now back in the state even amid an unfolding second wave.Vijendera (27) from Madhya Pradesh, who along with his wife and three small children had left for his native place, which was over 1200 km from Jalandhar, on a bicycle last year, is now back in the city. His wife Basmati Devi and children  Nandini (6), Muskan (3) and Sanjna (one)  are back too. While he is working as a labourer at a construction site, his wife has found work in potato fields.We came back to Jalandhar in December last year because there was no work in the village, said Vijendera, adding that if this time lockdown is imposed he would prefer to stay back.There was no clarity about anything that time as I was penniless, and my family in MP had sent me Rs 5,000 to purchase ration as no one had given us anything and everyone was very scared, he said, adding that he has come here again to ensure good education for his children.Opinion | Post-lockdown misery of Indias migrant workersNandu Mistri (40) is also back from Chak village of district Palamu in Jharkhand.Nandu had left for his village during lockdown along with wife Banita Devi (30) and then his 26-day old twin sons and a daughter in the first Shramik train from Jalandhar.

The stalks are green and tall, and wave out to me cheerily when I am anywhere around it. I look at the plant a bit sorrowfully. I am sorry, but one day you are going to get added to my soup, I tell it.When it does, it will greatly enhance the flavour of the soup  just like the lemongrass that gave zest to the tom yam soup I had a few days ago. The soup had been tempered with Thai herbs, and the presence of lemongrass in it was unmistakable. I scooped out the small shrimps in the broth and with that, started quite a memorable Oriental meal delivered by a new outlet called Azuma Kara. Based in Shahpur Jat, it delivers food with the help of Swiggy and Zomato, and its own delivery service. It is open every day of the week, from 12 noon to 12 midnight (phone: 7827906772).I opened the elegantly designed menu card on the net, and found that it had some of my favourite dishes. I cant have enough of the flavours that kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal add to Thai food. So even though the menu has Japanese and other kinds of cuisines, I stuck (more or less) to my favourite Southeast Asian region. I asked for chicken Thai herb dim sums and prawn kaffir lime dim sums (390 each), char siu bao pork (490), Thai green curry chicken (680), pad Thai noodles (280) and lemongrass tiramisu (380).The tom yam prawn soup (340) was hearty, if a bit salty. It was pleasantly aromatic, and I had it with a crusty piece of bread. I moved on to the dim sums. The filling was robust  the chicken with Thai herbs had a nice flavour, as did the prawn with kaffir lime leaves. I then had a piece of the bao and enjoyed the pork belly filling on spicy mayo.Char Siu Bao at South Delhis Azuma Kara | Photo Credit: Special arrangementI am a green curry fan, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The chicken had soaked in the tastes and aromas of the herbs  especially the lemongrass  and I had it with some sticky rice and vegetable pad Thai. The icing was the lemongrass tiramisu. The herb gave the soft and cheesy dessert a delicious kick.The menu at Azuma Kara is interesting, and I am not surprised, for the chef here was earlier at Blue Ginger, known for its Vietnamese cuisine, in Taj Palace. It has Vietnamese summer rolls on the menu, and the soup list includes cauliflower miso soup and Thai coconut soup (both 350). On the sushi list are rolls with mango and avocado, salmon and tuna (460-890). Among the interesting dishes are its one-meal bowls: spicy tuna poke bowl (690), tofu poke bowl (620), massaman pork curry with sticky rice and Asian greens (840) and Peruvian potatoes, wild mushroom and winter truffles (940).In these troubled times, it was nice to get the old familiar fragrance of Thai herbs in my food. The lemongrass plant in the pot  still intact  seemed happy as well. It gave me a whiff of its heady scent when I stepped out to the balcony the next morning.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

You work your guts out and then to have it all just washed away in the blink of an eye.""Costigan, 40, a road maintenance worker whose farm is in the Hollisdale community about a five-hour drive north of Sydney, said he's thankful that so far he's managed to avoid yet another disaster the plague of mice that is affecting some farms in the region.Maybe, he hopes, the floods will help wash them away.Australia has always been a land of harsh weather, where droughts and fires form part of the nation's psyche.But experts say that global warming is likely making recent weather events more extreme.The raging wildfires that burned through until early last year killed at least 33 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes.""These events are expected,"" said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales.""But climate change has put them on steroids.""She explained that, paradoxically, a warming atmosphere can worsen both droughts and floods.The extra heat can suck more moisture from the ground during droughts.But warmer air can also hold more moisture, she said, so that when it does rain, it pours.Some towns in New South Wales have set 50- or 100-year records for rainfall over the past week.The floods have killed two men in separate incidents, both of whom were trapped in their cars, and have forced more than 20,000 people from their homes.Dale Ward this week was trying to clean out the rental apartment she owns, and where her daughter and their family live, in the town of Windsor.She said she was mopping up sludge after about 1 foot (30 centimeters) of water coursed through, destroying a box of photos and other memorabilia.""It's like someone dropped three tons of dirt in your house, and then dropped a bucket of water over the top,"" she said.Ward estimates it will take at least a month to get the place habitable again, with plumbers and electricians needed to get everything fixed.Elsewhere, people are still dealing with the plague of mice.Last year in eastern Australia, months of rain doused wildfires and ended a drought that had crippled the region for more than two years.That led to bumper crops on many farms, and an explosion in the mouse population.Pompy Singh, the manager of the Spar supermarket in the town of Gulargambone, said they started to notice the number of mice increasing before Christmas.They used to set one or two traps a day, he said.They started buying much larger traps and setting many more of them until they had 20 set all the time.Suddenly they were catching 100 or 200 mice each day.The critters began eating through everything, getting into the lettuce, the potato chips, the dog food, even the tobacco.Singh said they started storing everything in refrigerators or sealed containers.Still, he said, the mice kept coming.Some days, they were catching up to 600.Even the fridges kept breaking down as the mice chewed through the wiring.Singh said the numbers of mice seem to have decreased somewhat since the floods hit, although they're still catching plenty.And Australia's troubles may not yet be over.Some experts have been warning people to check their shoes and clothes for deadly spiders, as swarms of them seek refuge from the floodwaters by moving into residential homes.Meanwhile, Costigan said he intends to rebuild.He's spent too much time putting up fences on his farm many of which survived the flooding and making other improvements to give up now.He adds that he moved his small herd of cattle to higher ground before the floods hit and they all survived.Costigan said he feels lucky his farmhouse is insured and is also thankful to family members and neighbours who have contributed to an online fund to help his family rebuild.He said these kind of troubles all come with living in Australia, and even perhaps explain why the British initially treated the continent as a place to send their prisoners.""They thought it was hell on earth,"" he said.""What they didn't realise is that it's a beautiful part of the world."""

A Sindhi's quintessential identity is indeed synonymous with this yellow-coloured curry.Bhavnani's aunt Kamla Thakur explains the tedious kadhi-making process in the film from start to finish, with the camera following the rigours. ""Food is something big for us, and so it made sense to weave the story around it. Kadhi is my favourite, and it was my only choice because that is a Sindhis identity,"" says Bhavnani.Sindhi Kadhi is distinctly different from other kadhis. ""It is made from tur daal. We boil it with tomatoes in a cooker, then seave and use the soup, cooking it on slow fire much like a mithai. It is nutritious as we put lots of vegetables in it,"" she says.Chef Sanjeev Kapoor couldn't agree more. ""Sindhi Kadhi is full of flavour. I like the veggies that go into it. Kadhi elsewhere uses curd, but the Sindhi one doesn't,"" he says.Same-same differentWhat sets Sindhi cuisine apart from others is its use of vegetables, spices, and cooking method. ""They use both leafy greens such as spinach, fenugreek, etc, and also other vegetables such as okra, potatoes and drumsticks,"" says Kapoor.Mumbai-based home chef Poonam Shahani, who runs Mamma's Cucina, agrees. ""We use many vegetables that arent common in other cuisines. We also use a technique to allow the food to cook in its juices called teewan, a gravy made of tomatoes, onions and spices."" When made with rice, it is Seyal Teewan; with bread, it is Seyal Dabroti; with roti, it becomes Seyal Mani.Kapoor thinks that Sindhi cooking is an amalgamation. He says, ""They have a unique cooking style and have their favourites when it comes to spices. They like to play with the base of their dishes."" But God is in the details. Chef Satyajit Kotwal of Satyajit's Kitchen elucidates that the most common type of Sindhi cooking is Daag Mein (onion-tomato-based-curry).""It brings out the sweetness of caramelised onions to provide a balanced flavour to the curries. In Seyal, the quantity of onions exceeds that of vegetables that are cooked till translucent. Saye Masale Mein uses coriander leaves, garlic, ginger and green chillies cooked with grated tomatoes and spices; the mix serves as a base in many Sindhi preparations,"" he explains.Another popular Sindhi cooking method is Daas, where whole vegetables are stuffed with a mix of grated onion and Sindhi pesto, and cooked till tender, says Kotwal.Sindhi cuisine has a lot of exciting items too. ""The accompaniments are also imperative. Dishes such as fried potatoes or fried okra, papads, dahi, sweet boondi, etc, are the common ones. Theres an array of sweets, snacks, and bread to choose from,"" says Kapoor.Cooking delightIt was a rather sweet initiation into the home-grown food business for Mumbai-based Uttamchandani siblings - Ritesh, Shirley and Sonia - who made their debut with Sev Mithai or Singharji Mithai and Mohanthaal during the lockdown. ""It was around Riteshs birthday in July last that this idea first cropped up. We were thrilled to bits, so we started it,"" says Shirley.The trio was wary of people's reaction, especially from the traditional Sindhis, but the sweets tickled their taste buds too, besides finding favour among the non-Sindhis. Ritesh attributes it to the ""curiosity factor"".Delhi's Archana Manwani loved to host non-Sindhi friends. ""It was their encouragement that led to this food business. I take orders 24 hours before the delivery. I prepare food with specially sourced ingredients, be it vegetables or spices,"" she says. Giving a rundown of her story, Shahani says, ""Not many people are aware of the range that Sindhi food offers. Also, theres a dearth of places that serve authentic range in Mumbai.""Chipping in, Sonia highlights how most upmarket eating places dont even have Sindhi foods on their menu. ""There's a mention of all but not Sindhi, and that's sad,"" says Sonia, who with Shirley and Ritesh has added many traditional Sindhi foods, and Riteshs special - jaggery Sev Mithai - to the menu.Shahani also got into the business to ""preserve her cultures flavour for those youngsters who are losing touch with their roots"".Manwani is quite keen to promote Sindhi cuisine among Delhiites. ""I approached the Director of Tourism in Delhi for a stall in Dilli Haat. But I havent got any response,"" she rues. Thakur is the go-to person for Bhavnani, be it ""Teevan, Sai Bhaji, Seyal Beeh Patata, and, of course, Kadhi"". Yes, Kadhi, because it is unlike others of its ilk."

Tell us more.The book recreates a journey on the Buddha's trail along the Lahore-Taxila-Peshawar-Kabul-Bamiyan-Balkh-Samangan route. These splendid cities were once centres of trade and scholarship. Their ruins today remind us of the glorious heritage of India.My travels were aimed at experiencing first-hand the connectivity of Buddhist sites falling along this great heritage route running through northern India and the foothills of the Himalayas. The book gives an idea of Gandharas architectural wealth stored in the museums of Pakistan and Afghanistan.You have written extensively on the Silk Road. What draws you?I was fascinated by the story of the Silk Road. The myriad goods that were traded, of marvellous art that flourished, of faiths that travelled along the trade highways I was amazed to find that Indian goods, traders, artisans were in great demand as far as the Caspian and the Black Sea. The travels undertaken by Chinese and Korean pilgrims to India between the fourth and eighth century CE also inspired me greatly.Could you share some anecdotes while travelling and writing this book?In Kabul my friends suggested that if I wanted to work undisturbed, I should cover myself. And so, whether I was in Kabul, going to the National Museum, or visiting the Bagh-e-Babur at Charbagh, or sitting on a charpoy over an icy stream at Paghman Darrah I never ventured out without the cosy comfort of the burqa.At the remote village of Aibak near Samangan I circumambulated the great stupa of Top-e-Rustam, along the pradikshana path as a Muslim, clad in a burqa. I explored every nook of the forsaken monastery of Aibak, unnoticed. But not everything was smooth-sailing.At Kakrak valley, east of Bamiyan, I found a bunch of women tilling a potato field and making cow dung cakes. It prompted me take a couple of photos. No sooner had I clicked a few shots that a volley of stones was thrown at me and I had to quickly escape.The one city in your journey that has stayed with you.Bamiyan, because of its wondrous beauty, pleasant weather and architectural wealth. Even though the Buddha colossi are lost to the Taliban, there is much to see in the beehive of caves. Remnants of beautiful paintings and stucco figures can be traced.The people are warm and friendly, the food delicious and the antique bazaars, especially the Titanic, is where you can spend hours looking at ancient carpets, coins and birch bark manuscripts.What next?My next work is yet another travelogue. It is based on the Buddhist cities lying along the Asian highway through Bangladesh. It involves a journey from the northern regions of Rajshahi right up to Coxs Bazaar in Chittagong.In ShortWhat are you reading right now?Anton Chekhovs Grief from his collection The Stories.Had you not been an authorA teacher, for sure.One book you could not finish?Emily Brontes Wuthering Heights. I have read and re-read it, but still feel it is unfinished."

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

Nevertheless, U.S. exporters continue to encounter significant tariff and non-tariff barriers that impede imports of U.S. products into India.According to the report, the US goods trade deficit with India was $23.8 billion in last year, a 1.7-per-cent increase ($389 million) over 2019. The goods exports to India were $27.4 billion, down 20.1 per cent ($6.9 billion) from the previous year. Imports from India were $51.2 billion, down 11.3 per cent.India was the US 12th largest goods export market in 2020.Exports of services to India were an estimated USD 24.3 billion in 2019 and imports were USD 29.7 billion. Sales of services in India by majority US-owned affiliates were USD 33.1 billion in 2018, while sales of services in the US by majority India-owned firms were USD 18.3 billion, the report said.US foreign direct investment in India (stock) was USD 45.9 billion in 2019, a 8.1 percent increase from 2018, it said, adding that the countrys direct investment in India was led by professional, scientific and technical services, manufacturing and wholesale trade.The annual report provides a detailed inventory of significant foreign barriers to US exports of goods and services, investment, and e-commerce.The first report of the Biden Administration said that since 2014, the Indian government promoted the Make in India campaign, a drive to build the countrys manufacturing capacity in part by cutting barriers to foreign investment and introducing regulatory reforms.As part of the campaign to encourage domestic production, India has raised duties on two broad groups  an assortment of labour-intensive products; and electronics and communication devices, including mobile phones, televisions, and associated parts and components, it said.The report alleged that Indias tariff regime was also characterised by large disparities between the World Trade Organization-bound rates and most-favoured-nation-applied rates.Indias WTO-bound tariff rate averaged 50.8 per cent, while its applied MFN tariff for 2019 averaged 17.6 per cent.Indias bound tariff rates on agricultural products are among the highest in the world, averaging 113.1 percent and ranging as high as 300 percent. Applied agricultural tariff rates are also high, averaging 38.8 percent, it said.While Indias applied tariff rates for certain agricultural products are lower, the rates still present a significant barrier to trade in agricultural goods and processed foods (e.g., poultry, potatoes, citrus, almonds, apples, grapes, canned peaches, chocolate, cookies, frozen French fries and other prepared foods used in quick-service restaurants).In addition, while India has bound all agricultural tariff lines in the WTO, nearly 30 percent of Indias non-agricultural tariffs remain unbound, the report said."

I think the citys medical facilities have the wherewithal to cope with the dramatic case surges. The focus should be on enhanced sample testing, increased vaccination, and continuously improving and streamlining the medical infrastructure, Mr. Mohol said.He said that currently Pune city witnessed a robust sample testing of 16,000 a day, while the capacity of the re-opened jumbo COVID-19 facilities had been ramped up from 400 to 500 beds.Additionally, we are planning to add 5,000 more beds across all COVID-19 care centres. About 20-25% of these beds would be converted into oxygen beds to tackle critically ill patients, Mr. Mohol said.Earlier, Baramati MP Supriya Sule had tweeted that the Pune administration had opened 174 vaccination centres to achieve its ambitious target of one lakh vaccinations and that the inoculation drive was progressing apace and in a satisfactory manner.Opposition to lockdownMeanwhile, Mr. Mohols fellow party member Pravin Darekar, the BJPs Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, reiterated his parts stance of fierce opposition against the ruling Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government were a lockdown to be imposed over Maharashtra.It appears that there is no coordination whatsoever between the three parties [Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress] over the decision to enforce a lockdown. The Chief Minister ought to have acted earlier to check the renewed surge in casesthe BJP will vehemently oppose any decision that affects ordinary citizens, Mr. Darekar said.The BJP is seeking to exploit the alleged differences between the tripartite MVA as the spectre of an imminent lockdown looms large amid alarming case and fatality spikes across Maharashtra.Senior Congressmen like Prithviraj Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat, too, have expressed their disapproval over another lockdown while stressing that it must be carefully calibrated, and that relief must be provided to daily-wage earners in form of direct cash transfers.In a riposte to Mr. Darekar, Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut said that nobody ought to politicise the lockdown issue at the moment.I do not think that the decision to implement a lockdown or not ought to be a political hot potato. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi was compelled to impose a countrywide lockdown last year. There are times when governments do not have a choice but to take stern measures to preserve human life. So, I do not think this is a matter for playing politics over, Mr. Raut said."
2021-04-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/mamata-banerjee-narendra-modi-election-commission-7257738/,"Player blaming umpire (EC), something wrong with (Mamata) game, says PM","Prime Mnister Narendra Modi Saturday criticised West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee saying her questioning the credibility of the Election Commission, security forces and EVMs was a sure sign of her impending defeat.Addressing a public meeting at Tarakeshwar in Hooghly district, Modi said: On the cricket field, if a player keeps raising questions about the umpires decisionsyou can assume that theres a problem with (his/her) game.Didi used to believe in the same security forces and Election Commission but she is defaming them today. The same agency and EVMs were good when it helped you to come to power in Bengal for 10 years, he said.Modi said he will come to West Bengal after May 2 (the counting day) to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the new Chief Minister who will be from the BJP.The two phases of phases of polling have sealed the outcome of the election. The more phases of the elections are held, the more Didi will get annoyed. Didi, you are facing defeat. It is time to accept. Election khela noy (not a game). Democracy khela noy. Didir khela sesh hobe (Didis game will come to an end), he said.I will tell the new Chief Minister that I will send money from Delhi. Please use them as soon as possible. I will also ensure that farmers get their arrears which Didi stopped. Every farmer will get Rs 18,000 in his account before Durga Puja, he added.The PM continued, Didi, you must trust the people of Bengal. They have said that you will have to leave Nabanna (state secretariat) with your Taka Maar Company (TMC).Talking about Singur which had seen Tata Motors shifting its Nano plant to Gujarat from there, Modi said, TMC cheated the people of Singur with its anti-land acquisition movement. Today, people in Singur are directionless. There is no industry in Hooghly which was once known as industrial belt. Farmers dont have cold storage to keep their produce especially potatoes. They are fed up with the syndicate raj which has flourished under the TMC.Referring to Banerjees claims that those who attend BJP rallies are paid to do so, Modi said: Stop insulting the people of Bengal by saying they are being paid to attend our rallies. People of Bengal are self-respecting people. They cannot be bought.Later, at a rally in Sonarpur in South 24 Parganas, Modi said Banerjee has conceded defeat from Nandigram and is planning to contest 2024 Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi.After sensing her defeat from Nandigram, the TMC decided to field Didi in two seats. Now they are talking about Mamata Didi fighting Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi. This proves that Didi has conceded her defeat in Bengal and is looking for a place outside the state, said Modi.Ridiculing Banerjee, the PM added, There (Varanasi) you will get to see a lot of chotiwala and tilak sporting people. You will also get to hear Har har Mahadev along with Jai Shri Ram. I will advise you that dont get angry with UP people and Varanasi people. They have given me a lot of love and they will also give you a lot of respect. They will not call you an outsider or a tourist or tourist gang.On Thursday, Modi, at a rally, had asked if Banerjee was filing her nomination from a second seat. In response, TMC MP Derek OBrien asserted that she would win Nandigram and not contest from any other seat. TMC MP Mahua Moitra said Banerjee will contest from Varanasi which is PM Modis Lok Sabha constituency and advised him to get his armour on."

Singur, which has great symbolic and political value in the States politics, is going to election in the fourth phase of polling on April 10. The Trinamool Congress government and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have described the return of land to farmers unwilling to have it acquired as one of the biggest achievements of her government.Addressing a public meeting at Haripal in Hooghly district, in the constituency bordering Singur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of using Singur for its political gains and then leaving its people in a lurch.People are aware more than me what kind of deceit was done at Singur Today, there is no industry at Singur, no jobs at Singur and the farmers are troubled by land sharks, Mr. Modi said, addressing a public rally at Haripal.Days before the PM raised the issue of Singur, Ms. Banerjee on March 31 held a public rally at Singur after the campaign for Nandigram drew to a close. The CM had also said that she had given thought to contesting from Singur because of its history of struggle, like in Nandigram, against land acquisition.At Singur, TMC Minister Becharam Manna is contesting against four-time MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya, formerly of the TMC, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) days before his candidature from the saffron party was announced. Though the local BJP had objected to the 89-year-old-veteran, who is known as mastermoshai (teacher), Mr. Bhattacharya said it was a fight for his prestige. I was disowned by the party, he said, expressing strong reservation over the nomination of Becharam Manna as the TMC candidate from the seat. The mastermoshai remains a respected figure but many people are unable to reconcile his change of political affiliations. The BJP had a lead at Singur in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but its the States ruling party that may be helped by the last-minute defection, feel political experts.I cannot understand how mastermoshai can contest from Singur as a BJP candidate. I respect his age. We had got him elected four times from here, the Trinamool Congress chairperson has said. Ms. Banerjee recounted her 26-day strike against forcible land acquisition at Singur, and also the police atrocities and excesses at the Block Development Office during the Left front regime.The Supreme Court in 2016 had turned down the land acquisition at Singur during the Left front regime, and in September same year, Ms. Banerjee returned the land to the farmers. The 997-acre plot at Singur that was at the heart of the debate over industry and agriculture has changed significantly since 2006 and many farmers have complained that they could not even identify their plots. After removing concrete from the land for three to four years, farmers like Vivekananda Das have managed a satisfactory yield of potato this season. But the farmers claim that they have to spend a large sum of money to make their land tillable again.It was the resistance at Singur that enabled Ms. Banerjee to make a remarkable political comeback and assume power in the State in 2011. Sensing unease among the people, the TMC government and Ms. Banerjee are promising to bring industry to Singur, which has been the BJPs poll plank. On Saturday, the party was quick to react to Mr. Modis barb by asking why the Tata Motors car factory at Sanand in Gujarat had been closed.The Left parties are also hoping to recapture lost ground by fielding 27-year-old Srijan Bhattacharya who, unlike the earlier Left candidates, is not riding a Nano car to campaign in the constituency but at times gives a hand to potato farmers working in the field. Like Nandigram, which witnessed a high pitched electoral contest, Singur, which has seen life come full circle from industry to agriculture and then back to industry, is once poised for a prestige battle."

2021-04-07,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/apr/07/swayed-by-sweet-potato-2286703.html,Swayed by sweet potato,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The humble sweet potato, in all its weird and wobbly innocuousness, often gets a poor rep. Especially when pitted against, rather unfairly, the universally loved potato. While madhura kizhangu puzhukku and sweet potato fries have persuaded many to switch camps, it doesnt exactly top the list of favourite vegetables for too many.But, maybe it should, given that theres plenty more to this unassuming tuberous root, says Yamini, clinical dietician, Kauvery Hospital. Theres a misconception that roots and tubers are not to be consumed in large quantities because of their starch content. But, when it comes to the nutritional value, the other components like micro-nutrients also have to be kept in mind.For this, sweet potato can be consumed, explains Yamini. There are two types of the sweet potato. The one which is available in India is the orange-pinkish one; the other one is purple and not commonly available here. But, both of them have the same properties and are very good for your health. It is antiinflammatory, reduces free radicals and boosts your immune, she details.Addresses anaemiaIt is very rich in ascorbic acid, fulfilling the vitamin C part. Its also a good source of iron. If cooked with jaggery, the nutritional anaemia can be treated.Potassium powerSweet potato is a rich source of potassium. This can help manage high blood pressure, its water retention properties can regulate muscle contractions and prevent kidney stones too.Starchy but goodEven though it is a starchy vegetable with a minimal amount of carbohydrates, it minimises the absorption of sugar in the body; thanks to its good fibre content both soluble and insoluble. So, even diabeticpatients can consume it once or twice a week if their sugar level is under control.Metabolism mattersThe high fibre content also helps in maintaining gut health. It enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria in your stomach; this way, it can help treat infective diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders. It helps in weight gain but portion size is the key and it has to be taken appropriately.Brain foodIt is a very good source of choline an essential nutrient that enhances the brain function.Vitamin storehouseSweet potato is also very rich in beta carotene, which is the precursor for vitamin A. This vitaminis very essential in all stages of life, playing a vital role in eye health.Rich in antioxidantsIt is filled with anthocyanins with antioxidant properties. Hence, it has to be included in everyday diet.ConsumptionA 100 grams of baked sweet potato offers 51 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of protein, 6 to 7 grams of fibre and very minimal fat. Otherwise, it is also rich in vitamin C and B6, magnesium, etc. The best way to consume sweet potato is to steam/bake it and have it with jaggery or slight seasoning. It can also be made as a regular south Indian curry or poriyal, with tomato and onions and spices.Sweet potato is not given much importance on the plate.

We will pursue politics of development, dialogue and cooperation, instead of confrontation, he said.The roadshow that started from Dulepara More took an hour to reach Singur police station as chants of Jai Shri Ram pervaded the air.Shah was joined by 89-year-old Rabindranath Bhattacharya, the BJP candidate for Singur who recently quit the Trinamool Congress. Bhattacharya has represented Singur four times as TMC MLA.Bhattacharyas induction and nomination had caused a lot of resentment among BJP old-timers in Singur.Later in the day, Shah had lunch at the home of a rickshawala at Domjur in Howrah after winding up a roadshow there. He was accompanied by BJP candidate for Domjur Rajib Banerjee, another TMC turncoat.Speaking to mediapersons, Shah said that the BJP was confident of winning 63 to 68 seats in the first three phases of elections held in West Bengal so far.Polling has been completed in 91 of the 294 Assembly seats in the state, which will see five more phases of elections.He also claimed that BJP will win over 200 seats in West Bengal and gain leads in the rest of the five phases.Asserting that Mamata Banerjees departure is assured, he said at Mallick Fatak in Howrah, She is such a big leader, so her departure should also be with a big margin.The home minister also promised to wipe out hooliganism and political violence if his party came to power.Later in the day, Shah held a roadshow in Kolkata where he was accompanied by Union minister Babul Supriyo, who is contesting from Tollygunge.Shah said that a BJP government in the state will make its border security strong enough to ensure that no one can cross over into it illegally.With inputs from PTI"
2021-04-08,https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2021/apr/08/poor-rains-bring-optimism-african-locust-outbreak-will-fade-2287475.html,Poor rains bring optimism African locust outbreak will fade,"By Associated PressBARAKA (KENYA): In a convoy of pickup trucks fitted with spray guns, soldiers zoom through Baraka' s hills leaving a trail of dust and bemused villagers in its wake.The vehicles brake when the soldiers see the enemy: billions of invading desert locusts that have landed in a twitching swarm where a forested area meets farmland.The deployment of soldiers among the usual agriculture officials is a testament to the seriousness of the threat as East Africa's locust outbreak continues well into a second year. The young locusts arrive in waves from breeding grounds in Somalia, where insecurity hampers the response.It's the beginning of the planting season in Kenya, but the delayed rains have brought a small amount of optimism in the fight against the locusts, though farmers still worry about their crops.The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization says the locust swarms have been spotted in the Rift Valley  which produces Kenya's staple foods of maize, wheat and potatoes.But the FAO says that as a result of the poor rains in Kenya and neighboring Ethiopia, the swarms in both countries are remaining immature. Their numbers also continue to decline due to ongoing control operations.Without rainfall, the swarms will not breed, severely limiting the scale and extent of their threat, the FAO says in a recent update.For this reason, there is cautious optimism that the current upsurge is winding down in the Horn of Africa, especially if poor rains limit breeding this spring in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, followed by equally poor rains during the summer in northeast Ethiopia.""Last year, authorities managed to contain what was seen as the biggest locust infestation in Kenya in 70 years, largely through coordinated aerial spraying which covered vast territories quickly.Many of those swarms were in uninhabited areas. This year the swarms have presented a different challenge by landing in more inhabited areas. That means spraying is out of the question because it could adversely affect people and livestock, says Ambrose Nyatich, a livelihood recovery expert with the FAO.So the delayed rains are a benefit  in part.Desert locusts pose an unprecedented risk to agriculture-based livelihoods and food security in the already fragile Horn of Africa region amid economic crises, drought and conflict, FAO says.A typical desert locust swarm can contain up to 150 million locusts per square kilometer, according to the East African regional body, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. An average swarm can destroy as much food crops in a day as is sufficient to feed 2,500 people.Farmers like Hannah Nyokabi in the community of Baraka  which means blessing in Swahili  find themselves in a difficult situation. Poor rains might lessen the locust threat but will almost certainly mean a poor harvest.Things have gone very bad. If you look at the farm there is nothing,"" she said. We have children who are in school, and we were depending on the farm for their fees.""Another farmer, Anne Wa Mago, 60, called a poor harvest better than nothing.We are lucky (the locusts) arrived when we had not planted, otherwise they would have wiped out our produce, she said, motioning at thousands of the voracious insects crowding a tree branch.Groups of school children, some still in uniforms, ran around the farms snatching the locusts from the air or the ground.To them, the swarm that recently arrived, almost blighting the sun, is a windfall like no other. A kilogram of locusts fetches money from a non-governmental organization that wants to turn the insects into livestock food.This is money that has come to our doorstep, said 16-year-old John Mbithi. Anne Wangari, 12, said she had collected 35 kilograms before leaving for school.But Nyatich with the FAO warned against using locusts for food because they could have been sprayed with insecticide.""The initiatives that were being conducted by some organizations to try and use locusts for fish feeds or animal feeds is something that should be looked into in terms of how can we regulate it going forward maybe in the future, Nyatich said."

Check out the foods you should eat and avoid,"Suffering from a stomach bug? Here's what to do. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Stomach flu, also known as gastroenteritis, is usually caused by any virus that may attack the gastrointestinal system. It can also be caused by bacteria through contaminated water and food. Stomach flu can wreak havoc on the system. Remember, our overall health is closely interlinked with our digestive health. Hence, stomach flu can have a deep impact on physical, mental, and emotional health, said nutritionist and lifestyle educator Karishma Chawla.Stomach flu symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramping, and abdominal pain.Here are foods that one should have and avoid when down with stomach flu:*Drinking adequate amounts of fluids is imperative to make up for the fluid loss due to diarrhea and vomiting. Fluids include plain water, infused water with herbs, electoral water, coconut water, broth, herbal tea with ginger, and peppermint. In fact, the smell of peppermint tea may help reduce nausea as well.Drink enough water to stay hydrated. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Drink enough water to stay hydrated. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)*Indulge in low fibre bland foods with no spices or excess oil. One can experiment with khichdi made with white rice and moong dal. Its easy on the stomach and has good protein content.*Have eggs as they are easy on the stomach and rich in protein, making them a great snack. Eggs are also a good source of B vitamins and selenium, which are important nutrients for the immune system.*Lean meat is better tolerated than high-fat meats. Hence one can opt for chicken but stop having it if it does not suit the stomach.*Can try soups without any mixers such as cornstarch or cream. One can rather try arrowroot. Broth-based soups are also great as they provide plenty of fluids with electrolytes.However, avoid:*Fried food items which are difficult to digest. They can aggravate stomach flu symptoms.*Spicy foods as these may trigger nausea and vomiting.*High sugar foods and fruit juices which may worsen diarrhea.*Caffeinated drinks can interfere with sleep. Caffeine can also compromise digestion and increase bloating.*Raw foods can be difficult to digest.Some home remedies for stomach flu include enough rest. One can also use acupressure/acupuncture points and a heating pad/warm hot bag on the stomach to ease cramping.Some food ideas that can be incorporated:Breakfast: rice flour chilla with eggsMid-morning: fruitLunch: moong dal khichdi with white rice and broth-based soupEvening meal: Fruit/mashed potatoesMoong dal is more than a comfort food. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Moong dal is more than a comfort food. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Dinner: soup and khichdi or egg riceEnsure a good amount of fluid to replenish water loss and help the body heal.Following a good gut health protocol is the best way to avoid stomach flu. Indulge in anti-inflammatory whole foods, colourful nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables, medicinal herbs and spices such as ginger, turmeric, and garlic. foods such as bone broth, high-quality fat such as coconut oil, olive oil, ghee, and protein such as eggs, lean meat, dals and pulses. Crowd out processed foods, refined flour, and sugar, said Chawla.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"
2021-04-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/after-going-free-of-lgbt-a-polish-town-pays-a-price-7268867/,"After going ‘free of LGBT,’ a Polish town pays a price","Written by Andrew HigginsWhen local councilors adopted a resolution two years ago declaring their small town in southeastern Poland free of LGBT, the mayor didnt see much harm in what appeared to be a symbolic and legally pointless gesture.Today, hes scrambling to contain the damage.What initially seemed a cost-free sop to conservatives in the rural and religiously devout Polish borderlands next to Ukraine, the May 2019 decision has become a costly embarrassment for the town of Krasnik. It has jeopardized millions of dollars in foreign funding and, Mayor Wojciech Wilk said, turned our town into a synonym for homophobia, which he insisted was not accurate.A French town last year severed a partnership with Krasnik in protest. And Norway, from which the mayor had hoped to get nearly $10 million starting this year to finance development projects, said in September that it would not give grants to any Polish town that declares itself free of LGBT.We have become Europes laughingstock, and its the citizens not the local politicians whove suffered most, lamented Wilk, who is now lobbying councilors to repeal the resolution that put the towns 32,000 residents in the middle of a raucous debate over traditional and modern values.Wojciech Wilk, mayor of Krasnik, Poland, at his office, March 29, 2021. (Kasia Strek/The New York Times) Wojciech Wilk, mayor of Krasnik, Poland, at his office, March 29, 2021. (Kasia Strek/The New York Times)The situation also illustrates the real-life consequences of political posturing in the trenches of Europes culture wars.When Krasnik declared itself free of LGBT, it was joining dozens of other towns in the region that had adopted similar measures with strong support from Polands governing right-wing Law and Justice party and the Roman Catholic Church.The declarations, part of the partys efforts to rally its base before a presidential election in 2020, did not bar gay people from entering or threaten expulsion for those already present. Instead they vowed to keep out LGBT ideology, a term used by conservatives to describe ideas and lifestyles they view as threatening to Polish tradition and Christian values.Cezary Nieradko, a 22-year-old student who describes himself as Krasniks only open gay, dismissed the term LGBT ideology as a smoke screen for homophobia. He recalled how, after the town adopted its resolution, his local pharmacist refused to fill his prescription for a heart drug.Nieradko recently moved to the nearby city of Lublin, where the regional council has also adopted a free of LGBT resolution but whose residents, he said, are generally more open-minded.Jan Albiniak, the Krasnik councilor who drafted the resolution, said that he had nothing personally against gay people, whom he described as friends and colleagues, and that he wanted to contain ideas that disturb the normal, regular way our society was functioning.He said he had drafted the resolution after watching an online video of abortion rights activists screaming at Christian men in Argentina. Although that had nothing to do with LGBT issues or Poland, Albiniak said the video showed that we are dealing with some sort of evil here and can see manifestations of demonic behavior around the world that must be stopped.In response to a rash of anti-LGBT resolutions across Polands heartland, the European Union, of which Poland is a member, as well as Norway and Iceland, have said they will cut funding to any Polish town that violates Europes commitment to tolerance and equality.The European Parliament also passed a resolution last month declaring all 27 countries in the bloc an LGBT Freedom Zone, although like the Polish resolutions declaring the opposite, the declaration has no legal force.All the posturing, however, has begun to have concrete consequences.Krasniks mayor said he worried that unless his towns free of LGBT status is rescinded, he has little chance of securing foreign funds to finance electric buses and youth programs, which he said are particularly important because young people keep leaving.My position is clear: I want this resolution repealed, he said, because its harmful for the town and its inhabitants.That will be an uphill struggle.Faced with the loss of foreign grants, several other Polish towns that declared themselves free of LGBT or adopted a family charter trumpeting traditional values have in recent months changed their mind. But the 21-member council in Krasnik, having voted last year against repeal, recently rejected an appeal by the mayor for another vote.Only one member has openly voiced a readiness to change sides.I made a mistake, said Pawel Kurek, who abstained on the original vote but now says the resolution was foolish and should be rescinded.On a national level, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chair of Law and Justice, told the newspaper Gazeta Polska last week that Poland must resist LGBT ideas that are weakening the West and against all common sense.Underlying the stalemate in Krasnik are the political and demographic realities in a region where many young people have left to find work abroad or in Warsaw, the capital, and where the Catholic Church remains a powerful force.While many older people like their town being free of LGBT, young people who have remained are appalled. Amanda Wojcicka, a 24-year-old convenience store worker, said the idea was embarrassing.But Jan Chamara, a 73-year-old former construction worker, said he would rather live on a diet of just potatoes than give into economic pressure from outside to repeal the resolution.I dont want their money, said Chamara, who said he had never seen gay people in Krasnik but still felt precautions were necessary. We will survive.Krasnik has acquired such notoriety that a French minister responsible for European affairs said he wanted to visit the town recently to show his opposition to discrimination during an official visit to Poland. The official, Clment Beaune, who is gay, called off the visit to Krasnik after what he described as pressure from Polish officials not to go, a claim that Polands foreign ministry said was untrue.When Krasnik and other towns adopted free of LGBT resolutions in early 2019, few people paid attention to what was widely seen as a political stunt by a governing party that delights in offending its foes political correctness.But that changed early last year when Bartosz Staszewski, an LGBT activist from Warsaw, began visiting towns that had vowed to banish LGBT ideology. Staszewski, a documentary filmmaker, took with him an official-looking yellow sign on which was written in four languages: LGBT-FREE ZONE. He put the fake sign next to each towns real sign, taking photographs that he posted on social media.The action, which he called performance art, provoked outrage across Europe as it put a spotlight on what Staszewski described in an interview in Warsaw as a push by conservatives to turn basic human rights into an ideology.Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has accused Staszewski of generating a fake scandal over no-go zones that dont exist. Several towns, supported by a right-wing outfit partly funded by the government, have filed defamation suits against the activist over his representation of bans on ideology as barring LGBT people.But even those who support the measures often seem confused about what it is that they want excluded.Asked on television whether the region surrounding Krasnik would become Polands first LGBT-free zone, Elzbieta Kruk, a prominent Law and Justice politician, said, I think Poland is going to be the first area free of LGBT. She later reversed herself and said the target was LGBT ideology.For Wilk, Krasniks mayor, the semantic squabbling is a sign that it is time to drop attempts to make the town free of anyone or anything.But Albiniak, the initiator of the resolution, vowed to resist what he denounced as blackmail by foreigners threatening to withhold funds.If I vote to repeal, he said, I vote against myself."

It is an established fact that in some women, pregnancy alters how the body fights some viral infections,"" he said.""Though evidence for coronavirus is still insufficient, it is for this reason that pregnant women are advised to be extra cautious during this pandemic,"" he added.ALSO WATCH:Ranjan warned that decades of progress in reducing child deaths will be jeopardised unless action is taken to protect and improve quality care services for mothers and newborns, and coverage of lifesaving interventions is expanded.""WHO advises that mothers should continue to share a room with their babies from birth and be able to breastfeed and practice skin-to-skin contact  even when COVID-19 infections are suspected or confirmed - and should be supported to ensure appropriate infection prevention practices,"" he said.""The risk of a new-born getting COVID-19 from their mother could be reduced, especially when the mother takes steps (such as wearing a mask and washing hands) to prevent spread before and during care and breast feeding of the new-born,"" he added.According to Ranjan, breastfeeding is particularly effective against infectious diseases because it strengthens the immune system by directly transferring antibodies from the mother.""There is an urgent need to protect life-saving interventions, such as Kangaroo Mother Care, threatened by the pandemic, and to be ready to recover and build back better,"" he said.""As a global health community, we need to act to protect the most vulnerable and prevent reversals of hard-earned gains in new born survival, as well mitigate the wider impact on women and families,"" he added.Kangaroo mother care involves close contact between a mother, and a new born baby.Ranjan said especially for babies born preterm or at low birthweight, kangaroo mother care (early, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a parent and exclusive breastfeeding) is particularly critical.Dr. Loveleena Nadir, senior consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at Fortis La Femme, Rosewalk Hospital and Apollo Cradle Royale said the risk of COVID-19 infection in mothers and newborns is the same as in general population but since pregnancy is a immunocompromised state, one is more prone to any kind of infection.Noting that better nutrition helps prevent COVID-19, she said a fibre rich plant based diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes support the growth and maintenance of beneficial gut microbiota which helps in building immunity.She further suggested that super foods like eggs, lean meat, lentils, broccoli, spinach, bananas, sweet potatoes, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, figs, avacados, yogurt, mixed nuts, garlic, ginger and citrus fruits can be accommodated into the diet to increase immunity."
2021-04-12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/farm-produce-likely-to-flood-market-yard-today/articleshow/82021099.cms,Pune: Farm produce likely to flood Market Yard,"The vegetable market at Mahatma Phule MandaiPUNE: The Market Yard in Gultekdi , which is the biggest wholesale market in the city, is expected to get excess intake of vegetables and fruits due to closure of the market for the last two days due to the weekend lockdown imposed by the state government.Datta Bibve, head of onion and potato section, said, We expect to get more number of vehicles on Monday. Usually, the market gets around 1,000 vehicles of agriculture produce. Now, it is expected to increase to 1,300- 1,400 vehicles.Farmers are desperate to sell their produce due to the current situation and hence they would bring produce in large quantity, officials from the market said. We can't predict the rates scenario as we can't rule out the possibility of panic buying on Monday, he added.The similar situation is expected to prevail in other wholesale markets across the district, said the officials.Vegetable markets in Kolhapur city are expected to be flooded with supply on Monday as the harvested vegetables have been piling up in the backyards of the farmers due to the weekend lockdown. The farmers will bring their produce to the citys mandis on Monday.Despite allowing vegetable and fruit vendors to operate, most markets and roadside vegetable vendors decided to observe the lockdown. The citizens, abiding by the law, too stayed indoors.As per the government orders, farming operations were allowed to continue. The farmers had expected the mandis to remain open. They had thought that citizens would be coming to buy vegetables.Eknath Pawar, a vegetable grower in Shirol, said, I went to Kolhapur to sell vegetables expecting the mandis to be open. However, most of the markets were shut. Moreover I was not allowed to sell my produce in the residential areas as police and locals said that there will be crowding if I set up shop on the society premises. I am heading to Shirol on Monday. Once the markets open on Monday, many farmers will flock to the mandis to sell their produce and the prices will crash. The lockdown has proven to be a bane for small-time farmers.Similarly, while construction activities were allowed, the shops selling construction goods and equipment were shut. Ravikant Patil, a contractor in Morewadi, said, The workers are sitting idle at the site since the last two days. The shops are closed and we need the material to resume construction."
2021-04-12,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/boss-burger-in-delhi-home-delivers/article34301990.ece,Who’s the boss (burger)?,"Boss Burger in Delhi delivers veg and non-veg bun delightsSome friends had been drooling over the burgers they had been preparing at home. They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger.Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu.All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties. Nothing like a DIY burger.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

I had no option other than paying the cut money. How could I build a house with concrete walls with my monthly earning of Rs 4,500, Ali says.BJP has been making relentless attacks on the Mamata Banerjee government on the issue of cut money.But the campaigns electoral impact seems to be missing in this minority-dominated region of north Bengal comprising two districts North Dinajpur and Malda where 21 Assembly constituencies are located. Whom will you vote for?Do we have an option? We have to vote for those who have given us half a house. If they (BJP) come to power, we will be driven out of the country, says the father of three, who migrated from Bangladesh 35 years ago.Extreme polarisationSensing adverse impacts of the Citizenship Amendment Act and lukewarm impact of TMCs alleged corruption on the regions minority vote bank which forms around 50 per cent of the total electorates, BJP is trying to hard sell the Hindutva rhetoric.This region is set to experience an extremely polarised election on the line of religion. BJP faced largescale agitations over its choice of candidates, which is also a factor that might fetch TMC electoral dividend.Asgar Ali, a graduate in philosophy, is more concerned about his future than BJPs Hindutva or TMCs minority appeasement.Practically, I dont see a reason to vote for either. Joblessness is an issue among the youth like me which the TMC government failed to address in 10 years. Many from our area secured jobs of teachers in primary schools after paying bribes ranging from `10 lakh to `15 lakh. On the other hand, BJP leaders never hesitate to issue statements which not only hurt us but also makes us feel insecure, he says.JP supporters during Union Home Minister Amit Shahs roadshow in Nadiadistrict on SundayThe 27-year-old, a face of Bengals educated and jobless young voters, finds no reason to support the LF-Congress alliance as it would mean wasting his valuable vote.My political allegiance might be towards TMC. At least, they would be opposing CAA, which poses as a threat to us, says the resident of Chakulia, another minority-dominated pocket in North Dinajpur.The electoral landscape in Bengals concentrated minority pockets was not as polarised during the 2016 elections.Though BJP is painting Mamata as anti-Hindu, Muslim voters had shown that she was not their preferred choice in the previous Assembly elections.In the districts of Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur, which have a minority population of over 50 per cent, the CPI(M)-Congress alliance had won 31 seats out of 43. But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, TMC secured lead in 23 Assembly constituencies.Debasish Biswas, professor of economics in Raiganj University and a political observer, described TMCs surge in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as a fallout of BJPs aggressive Hindutva campaign.The minorities, who did not vote for TMC in the 2016 Assembly polls, extended their support to them in 2019. It is a direct impact of NRC and CAA, which Mamata Benerjee also described as a threat to the minority community, he observes.How lotus bloomedAsim Biswas, a farmer in his 40s, said most of the Hindus had migrated from Bangladesh and CAA is promising citizenship for them.When Muslims of this region united, Hindus, too, decided to come under the umbrella of BJP. Thats why BJP secured lead in this Assembly seat in the 2019 elections despite TMC winning the seat in 2016, says Biswas, who has shifted allegiance from CPI(M) to BJP, like many others across the state.They are a massive factor behind the saffron camps rise in Bengal. In Raiganj, the headquarters of North Dinajpur which is infamous for hooligaism, shootouts and gang rivalries, TMC is trying to dent Congresss vote bank after winning the civic body, which was ruled by the grand old party since 1950.The TMC also erected two statues of Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi, the late Congress stalwart from the region.A considerable number of Congress workers still carry Dasmunsis legacy. Congress has no chance of doing well in this region. Our attempt is to woo Congress supporters, said Kanhaiyalal Agarwal, TMCs candidate from Raiganj."

Last Monday, we had received 24,700 quintals of the same. Today (Monday), it was 7,938 quintals more than last Monday. This is adequate to meet Pune and Pimpri Chinchwads requirements. We expect vegetable prices to remain stable in local mandis.Rates of all vegetables and fruits remained stable. Onion was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 per kg range and potato was also sold in the range of Rs6 to Rs16 per kg. Rates of leafy vegetables were also in the normal bracket. A bunch of coriander was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 range, fenugreek was in the Rs7 to Rs12 range and spinach was in the Rs4 to Rs10 bracket.Talking about the crowd management, Garad said, We have banned domestic purchase at the market, in view of the increasing crowd here. Also, small-time vendors, who sell the produce on handcarts and set up stalls in the market, too have been stopped. Restaurants on our campus have been told to provide parcel service.Shivlal Bhosale, a commission agent, said, It will be a difficult task for the administration to control the crowd at the market as thousands of them will be working together daily. A section of the commission agents said that the APMC could resort to last years strategy of running each section on alternate days. The measure had controlled the crowd significantly in the market, a commission agent said.While another agent said last years measure would go against the farmers as they wouldnt be able to sell their harvest quickly. Many farmers could not sell their produce last year because of this system, the agent said.Wholesale rates of flowers remain stableRates of flowers remained stable in Gultekdis flower markets on Monday, said Bala Sewale, head of the flower section. There was adequate supply of all flowers. Hence, there was no change in the rates. Marigold flowers, which were in demand because of the upcoming Gudi Padwa celebrations, were sold in the range of Rs40 to Rs45 per kg, he said."

Although he transitioned to a career in food and beverages from science, his new book, The Flavor Equation , goes behind the recipes to investigate the science of taste, combining his knowledge of chemistry with the mysteries of flavour pairings. The popular food columnist, blogger and recipe developer spoke toabout the Indian influences on his writing and also on mainstream American cuisine. Edited excerpts from the interview.They go hand-in-hand. Ive always felt cooking in the kitchen is just like being in a lab but with a tastier outcome. Recipe writing is just like writing experiments -- things work and sometimes they dont. Thats when you try to understand what is happening and how to fix it. A large part of recipe development is also problem-solving and creating solutions. This is where science comes in. For example, for the longest time, the paneer I made in America was too soft with a ricotta-like consistency -- a problem I never encountered in India. It turned out the calcium levels in cows milk is lower than that of buffalos milk used in India. To fix this, I simply needed to increase the amount of calcium and curdle the milk. Calcium chloride, an ingredient commonly used in cheese-making, does both these things. It gives the extra calcium and also the acid to help the milk proteins change their shape and turn into a firm block of paneer.Growing up in India, Ive been fortunate to experience and taste food from different regions as well as see and appreciate Indian ingredients and techniques for their versatility. In India, you can travel through various states and a staple ingredient like rice will morph as it moves from biryanis to fermented batters that make dosas and idlis. It gives me a sense of how ingenuity comes into play as recipes reflect adaptations to changes in geography and culture.While I dont think were exactly there yet, I do think we are on our way to seeing Indian food and ingredients in more homes than earlier. I think this is one of the most exciting times to be cooking Indian food in America because people are genuinely excited to learn about new flavours and ingredients. The works of chefs and writers like the late Floyd Cardoz, Asha Gomez, Tejal Rao, Priya Krishna, and several others are certainly helping cement the prominence of Indian cuisine in America.Cooking and for that matter even appreciating flavour, is something we learn through trial and error over time. It is experiential. Ive learnt to cook by watching my family and friends as well as through cookbooks, magazines, television shows and also working as a pastry cook in a patisserie. Flavour is a wide umbrella that not only encompasses the taste and aroma of the ingredients in our food but it also involves the interplay of our senses -- the shapes and colours of the food we eat, the different textures of food, and even the sounds food makes as we cook and eat. I remember being taught in India to pay attention to the sound of cumin and mustard seeds popping when preparing a tadka. We are constantly using all sorts of sensory cues in our cooking. And then theres the interplay of our emotions and memories that influences our perception of flavour. We love some flavours more than others, be it something we experienced in childhood or something tied into our cultures. The Flavour Equation is a book that gets into all these different facets from a nerdy-yet-fun lens with the recipes acting as enticing experiments.Living in two very different parts of the world gave me the opportunity to not only taste new food but also compare and contrast. You start to notice how people and culture define food. Often, similar beloved combinations exist throughout the world. They just get painted with different spices and are cooked in different ways -- for example, mashed potatoes and meat is a popular dish in the West but in Mumbai, potato chops provide that same degree of comforting flavours and textures where ground meat is encased in a shell of smooth, mashed potatoes before being shaped and pan-fried.My blog started out as a way for me to talk about the Indian food I didnt see in restaurants or in magazines and an opportunity to show the versatility of Indian ingredients and techniques in Western cooking. I dont see myself as an expert on Indian food since I certainly dont know all there is to Indian cuisine but I do my best to share the food I enjoy cooking at home with people. Its been a long journey but one that Ive thoroughly enjoyed. While there are plenty of common misconceptions on Indian cooking, I try to do my best through my work to show people that they can easily incorporate a lot of those flavours in their own cooking at home. Over time, Ive been fortunate to write for outlets such asandIt has certainly helped me share my food with a larger audience.There is an incomparable joy that I nd difficult to express in words when I eat ripe Indian mangoes. During ripening, the starch transforms and gives way to a soft pulp thats sweet and sour, carrying an aroma that reminds me of warm summer holidays in Goa. While mangoes are delicious as a sweet treat, they also make an excellent addition to savoury applications. The fruity, sweet avour of mangoes with lime gives this beet salad a refreshing taste. Try to use a good ripe mango without a chalky aftertaste. Its no surprise that I recommend Indian mangoes, but champagne mangoes are a good option. Youll find paneer in the cheese section at Indian grocery stores as well as most regular food markets.Paneer is not a salty cheese, so the marinade must contain a bit more salt for the cheese to absorb.The salad dressing provides a second layer of flavour as well as salt.While paneer is one of the easiest cheeses you can make at home, I prefer the store-bought variety in this application, where shape and structural integrity are important. It takes the pressure of an extremely heavyweight to bring together the protein molecules in the paneer and force them to coalesce, producing a firm, compact paneer that can hold its shape when cut and cooked. Commercial producers have equipment that generates sufficient pressure; its a little tricky to do this at home but Ive developed a method that you can use; otherwise, store-bought is perfectly fine.Whisk the ker, salt, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder, and black pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pour the marinade into a large resealable bag.Cut the paneer into approximately 1 by 2 by  in [2.5 cm by 5 cm by 12 mm] cubes and place them in the bag with the marinade, seal, and gently shake to coat evenly. Let the paneer marinate for one hour at room temperature. If you need to marinate it longer, leave it in the refrigerator.Preheat the oven to 400F [204C].While the paneer marinates, prepare the beets. Peel, trim the ends, and cut into quarters. Place the beets in a baking dish or roasting tray, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender on the inside and a knife slides through the centre with ease. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes.While the beets roast, prepare the dressing. Place the mango, ker, oil, lime juice, mustard, pepper, and chilli powder into a blender and pulse on slow speed until combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt.Grill the paneer just before youre ready to assemble the salad. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or a medium non-stick sauce pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil. With a pair of kitchen tongs, carefully lift the paneer out of the bag and cook it in batches in the hot pan until it turns golden brown and is slightly seared,two to three minutes per side.To serve, toss the arugula in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Add the pepper and season with salt. Add the warm grilled paneer pieces. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the salad dressing. Sprinkle with the amchur just before serving.Serve the remaining salad dressing on the side."

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)The Holy month of Ramadan has officially begun in India (from April 14) and will continue for 30 days  till May 13. During this period, devotees observe day-long fasts or roza that require them to avoid food and water. Hence, it is only natural to feel tired and hungry by the evening meal for Iftar.However, instead of straightaway opting for foods that might make you feel bloated, it is important to first replenish the lost liquids to prevent dehydration.The first meal after a long fast should be small and include foods that give instant electrolytes, fluid, and some sugar. This is why traditionally Iftar includes a lot of drinks, fruits, dates, etc. The best way to replace lost fluids and electrolytes is to break your fast with coconut water or salty lemon water with a small amount of quickly absorbed fruit sugar from two dates, prunes, dry figs or fresh fruit, mentioned nutritionist Rashi Chowdhury in an Instagram post.ALSO READ | Ramadan 2021: Date, sehri and iftar timings, prayer time table, significance, and fasting rulesWhat is a perfect Sehri or pre-dawn meal?According to lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho,Foods that quench thirst such as cucumber, zucchini, buttermilk, curd, melon, bananaComplex carbohydrates to keep one feeling full and energetic including oats, jowar, ragi, sugar-free muesli, whole wheatProteins for repair and growth including egg, pulses, sattu and nutsGood fats for satiety, vital functions, hormones and fat-soluble vitamins including cold-pressed oil of your choice, organic A2 ghee, avocadoWhat should you have when breaking the fast?What can help?Take a prayer break or a quick workout session before you have your bigger meal, said Chowdhury.For your main meal or dinner, your plate should have 30 per cent clean carbs, 30 per cent good proteins, and 30 per cent of high fibre vegetables. Carbs could be sweet potato or rice or millets like jowar, bajra, amaranth. Get your proteins from meat, chicken, fish or daal (please soak the lentils for 12 hours before cooking), mentioned Chowdhury.According to Coutinho, khichdi, a meal with a combination of dal and rice, pot meals, and well-cooked farm-fed chicken are dinner meals that are easy on the gut.However, the key lies in portion control.Its very important to watch your portion of fruits as you wouldnt want to overdo it if youre diabetic, have PCOS, insulin resistance or youre trying to lose weight, she mentioned.What to avoid?Avoid sugar, desserts and fruit juices that will raise your blood-sugar immediately. This is going to mess up with your insulin levels, especially when you fast the next day, leaving you with cravings and low energy levels, mentioned Chowdhury.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"

2021-04-15,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/apr/15/de-stressing-naturally-2290027.html,"De-stressing, naturally","Dr Vinoda Kumary ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: How many times has it happened that we feel stressed and a brief deep breathing exercise helped us release that stress for some time, if not forever? We all must have tried doing this at some point. Breathing exercises being an inalienable part of yoga, gives an indication of how yoga, being a major component of naturopathy, can play a pivotal role in containing mental stress.Practising yoga regularly and consuming the right type of naturopathic diet can help manage chronic stress and anxiety to a large extent. Stress is the human bodys natural response to a difficult situation. When the body perceives a threatening situation, the mind activates its fight or flight response. This activation mechanism results in the release of stress hormones that helps us deal with difficult situations in everyday life. However, when this stress response remains chronically activated, it predisposes the person to a series of health issues, including anxiety, depression, weight gain, sleep deprivation and even heart disease.Garudasana (Eagle Pose) byS Ezhilarasi, PhD scholar, MAHERStress also makes it difficult to control blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Unfortunately, mental stress has emerged as the epidemic of our times. In a survey conducted by a health insurance provider a few years back, 89% of the respondents in India said they were suffering from stress as against the global average of 86%, as reported in a national daily. This is unfavourable news for a country that is facing an overwhelming burden of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.Therefore, it is essential that our healthcare approach incorporates stress management as a key element of preventive healthcare. Naturopathy and yoga can play a vital role in better management of stress and its beneficial effects. Yoga reduces the impact of stress by easing respiration, reducing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure. It increases the bodys ability to react to stress more easily by stretching the muscles and releasing tension. Similarly, as prescribed by a naturopathic doctor, the right choice of food can enable the body to balance the nervous system quickly. Our body needs many micronutrients when we are stressed out and we can only get them mostly through plant-based diets.Regular practice of yoga and the adoption of naturopathic remedies can also help people with severe anxiety to reduce their dependence on drugs for various ailments, mostly stress-related ones.Asanas for alleviating anxietyGarudasanaThis is also known as the Eagle Pose. Our shoulders and hips are the points in our body that are known to carry a lot of stress. This asana works on these points to release that stress and make one feel liberated. One has to concentrate while performing this asana fully.SukhasanaThis asana lengthens the spine and opens the hips. It helps one in calming down and reducing anxiety. Sukhasana is also known as the lotus pose, where one has to sit cross-legged with chest open and spine straight. While sitting in this position, one has to maintain the physical balance.UttanasanaThis asana is known to calm the brain and stimulate the kidneys and liver. It helps in stretching the hips, calves, and hamstrings. While performing this, one has to stand straight and bend forward until one touches ones feet with the palm. Take deep breaths while holding the position and one is bound to be in a relaxed state of mind.Plant-based foods & herbs to manage stressSweet potatoesRich in carbohydrates, sweet potatoes are full of nutrients like vitamin C and potassium. It helps in reducing the cortisol levels in the body. Notably, cortisol is the main stress hormone that is released by the adrenal gland when the body is dealing with a stressful situation.ChamomileChamomile is a herbal remedy used by the traditional medicinal system for its calming and stress-busting effect, since centuries. This herb has a mind-relaxing ability as it contains flavonoids, phenolic, and antioxidants that help reduce stress while also soothing the effects of stress such as headache and anxiety. Consuming chamomile tea on a regular basis can help cope with stress much better.BlueberriesOut of the several health benefits that blueberries have is, it works as a mood booster. Blueberries are rich in flavonoid, which has antioxidants and reduces stress-related inflammation.AshwagandhaAshwagandha is a widely used herb in Ayurvedic medicine for its multifarious medicinal qualities. This is also a mentally relaxing and rejuvenating adaptogen that helps the body cope with stress and its effects, such as anxiety and poor sleep. This herb contains a series of medically beneficial chemicals such as anolides, sitoindosides and alkaloids that help prevent oxidative stress and provide a series of health benefits. A study published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine in 2012 concluded that Ashwagandha root extract significantly helped improve resistance towards stress. Both yoga and other components of naturopathy are effective ways to deal with chronic stress and reduce its effects on the body and mind.BroccoliThis nutritious vegetable contains sulforaphane, a sulfur-based compound that has neuroprotective properties. Eating it regularly can have a calming effect on the brain, and it also works as an antidepressant.(The writer is the deputy chief medical officer at Jindal Naturecure Institute)"
