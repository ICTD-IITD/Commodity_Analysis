The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.Binoy Viswam is Secretary, CPI National Council, and leader of the party in Parliament.

2021-01-03,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-junked-apmc-act-in-06-but-it-hasnt-benefited-farmers/articleshow/80078630.cms,"Bihar junked APMC Act in '06, but it hasn't benefited farmers","Bihar's farmers got the 'freedom of choices' in selling their produce 14 years ago with the scrapping of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act in the state in 2006, but that has not yielded better prices for them, an analysis of price trends before and after the scrapping of the Act shows. The gap between farm harvest prices and MSP for three major crops - paddy, wheat and maize - has either widened or remained at the same level.What's more, it appears that low harvest prices have caused agricultural wages in Bihar to remain suppressed as compared to Punjab and Haryana and resulted in labour migration from the state.The analysis of farm harvest prices and MSP for wheat in Bihar from 1998-99 to 2016-17 shows that for nine harvest seasons from 1998-99 to 2006-07, the harvest price remained above MSP in three, from 90% to 100% of MSP in three, and below 90% of MSP in three. During the same period, the prices in Punjab remained above MSP in three seasons and 90% or more of MSP in the remaining six seasons. In Haryana, the prices remained above MSP in five seasons and 90% or more of MSP in the remaining four.Farm harvest prices collated by the agriculture ministry are averages of wholesale prices at which the farmer sells to the trader at the village site.Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on farmers protestIn the ten marketing seasons between 2007-08 and 2016-17 (the latest data available), not a single season saw prices in Bihar go beyond MSP. Prices remained 90% or more of MSP in four seasons and fell even below that level in the remaining six. In Punjab, on the other hand, there were two seasons when prices went beyond MSP, while only one saw them fall below 90% of MSP. Similarly, for seven seasons during this period, farmers in Haryana sold wheat at higher prices than MSP, while two seasons saw prices at between 90% and 100% of. Data was not available for one marketing season in Haryana.The trends are in harvest prices for paddy. Paddy is cultivated in both autumn and winter in Bihar and the higher of the two prices is taken for this analysis. Haryana is excluded from this comparison because the cultivation of high-quality rice in the state has pushed farm harvest prices to a much higher level than the MSP.In Bihar, in the nine harvest seasons between 1998-99 and 2016-17, only one saw prices nearly on a par with MSP (99.5% of MSP), for three prices were within 80-90% of MSP and for the remaining five farmers got 70-80% of MSP. In the ten seasons between 2007-08 and 2016-17 after APMC act was abolished, prices were within 70-80% of MSP in three and between 80-90% of MSP in the remaining six.This raises questions about the claim that farmers are trapped in the MSP and APMC mandis system and opening up the market leads to corporates and private buyers giving higher prices. It also helps explain the farmer anguish over uncertainty of MSP and distrust of 'free markets'.In Punjab, for the 16 marketing seasons for which data is available since 1998-99, the paddy harvest price fell below MSP (96.6%) only once and remained higher than the MSP in the rest.The patterns hold even in maize which unlike paddy and wheat doesn't have government procurement and is sold mostly to private buyers. In the nine seasons before the abolition of the APMC act, there were two when maize was sold higher than MSP in Bihar. In the ten seasons after abolishing the mandis, again only two saw prices go beyond MSP. For the last four seasons, it has remained below 90% of MSP. In contrast, farmers in Punjab sold maize above MSP in 14 of the 18 seasons for which price data is available. Prices fell below MSP only four times but remained between 90% and 100% of it. In Haryana, prices never fell below MSP.Data on average daily wages of male ploughman or field Labour (data for female labour was not available for all the years) between 2005-06 and 2017-18 shows that the lower price of output might have suppressed agricultural wages in Bihar. In 2006-07, the average wage in Bihar was 79% of wages in Punjab and 66.8% of wages in Haryana. Today, farm labour in Bihar earns 61% of what it could in Punjab and 50-60% of wages in Haryana, the latest figure being 59.1%."

Centre limits rice procurement from Chhattisgarh,"indiaUpdated: Jan 04, 2021, 11:27 ISTThe Centre on Sunday allowed the Chhattisgarh government to deliver 24 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under central pool during Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21. However, sources from the state government say that is down from the 60 lakh MT that they were assured. The state government fears that the central government will ask the state to discontinue Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana.The state government hopes that the remaining rice will also be taken later. But the worrying thing is that the central government has made a condition that the state government will not give any kind of bonus with the purchase of crops right now or in future. Actually, the Centre has objections with the state governments Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana. The BJP leaders of the state have complained to the Centre that the Congress government is giving bonus to the farmers. Whereas the truth is that after the central governments condition of not giving bonus, the state started the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana and announced to give it per acre instead of crop, said a senior official in the Chief Ministers Office (CMO).Another source from the government said that we are apprehensive that the central government will ask to discontinue the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana in the future.Actually the central government is not okay with cash going in the pockets of farmers. They want the farmer to keep going through Modi jis 500 rupees per month plan.The BJP state unit pointed out that the directive about not giving bonus have been issued to the Madhya Pradesh government as well.There is federal structure and every state has to follow it because we follow constitution. The central government has issued such directions to Madhya Pradesh also which is BJP ruled state. The Chhattisgarh government is doing politics by saying that state BJP unit has complained about Nyay Yojana or bonus, said Sacchinand Upasane, senior BJP leader and spokesperson.Meanwhile, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel thanked the Centre and also hoped that the permission for more procurement would be granted further in the central pool.CM Baghel had recently spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone and requested to ensure issuance of final order from the Centre to lift rice after custom milling from the state for the central pool.The Centre had earlier given in principle approval to take 60 lakh MT rice from the state in the central pool.As per a letter issued by the Government of India on Sunday, The Government of India has decided to allow 24 lakh MT of rice to be delivered to FCI under central pool during KMS 2020-21 which is equivalent to the quantity as allowed in previous years to Chhattisgarh.The Centre had categorically stated that it could not purchase excess paddy procured by the states by giving bonus and incentives in direct or indirect form citing the clauses of procurement scheme agreement.A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Government of India, State Government and Food Corporation of India in both DCP (decentralized procurement scheme) and non-DCP States for procurement of paddy from farmers under central pool, the letter stated.As per Clause No.3 of MoU of DCP State, In the situation of state giving any bonus/ financial incentive in direct or indirect form, over and above minimum support price (MSP), if the overall procurement of the state is in excess of the total allocation of the state made by the Government of India under TPDS (Targeted Public Distribution System)/ OWS (Other Welfare Schemes), such excess quantity shall be treated to be outside the Central Pool.The Chhattisgarh government had also published an advertisement/press release on December 17, 2020 detailing the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana that they would procure paddy from the farmers at Rs 2,500 per quintal during KMS 2020-21 by paying Rs 10,000 per acre which is a form of indirect incentive over and above the MSP which is as good as bonus on procurement of paddy, it said."

This year the staple, a variety developed by Professor Jaysashankar Telangana State Agriculture University (PJTSAU), was grown in an extent of 25 lakh acres after it was introduced a few years ago.As many studies had shown good result, the variety is being cultivated in other states too. West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even Rajasthan are growing the rice variety, Dr Jagedeeswar, research head, PJTSAU, said.With many journals endorsing the scientific quality of its low glycemic index, several states have shown interest in the variety. Researchers claim other state were growing this variety in 10 lakh acres.Telangana Sona has many qualities like having good yield and there is no compromise on taste. It is good for those who prefer fine variety of rice, Dr Pavin Rao, University vice-chancellor said. Looking at the potential of the variety, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has also shown interest in exporting this variety to other states and countries.Interestingly, the Telangana Sona variety is being marketed by small-time traders as the healthy rice variety. The packaged Telangana rice is now available for Rs 100-145 per kg in the market. Ironically, farmers get only between Rs 40 and Rs 45 a kg.The fine varieties, including Telangana Sona, bagged good price in the later part of the season with a rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal. However, by then, many farmers had already sold their produce at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,888. Farmers who wait get good price as Telangana and AP are the only states in the country where cultivation of the fine varieties of rice also happens in the rabi season  officials said."
2021-01-05,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vietnam-buys-indian-rice-for-first-time-in-decades-report/articleshow/80108017.cms,'Vietnam buys Indian rice for first time in decades',"Farmers collect winnowed rice grain after a harvest on the outskirts of Srinagar. (File photo: Reuters)MUMBAI/HANOI: Vietnam, the worlds third biggest exporter of rice, has started buying the grain from rival India for the first time in decades after local prices jumped to their highest in nine years amid limited domestic supplies, four industry officials told Reuters.The purchases highlight tightening supplies in Asia, which could lift rice prices in 2021 and even force traditional buyers of rice from Thailand and Vietnam to switch to India - the worlds biggest exporter of the grain.Indian traders have been contracted to export 70,000 tonnes of 100% broken rice for January and February shipments at around $310 per tonne on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, the industry officials say.For the first time we are exporting to Vietnam, BV Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association, told Reuters on Monday. Indian prices are very attractive. The huge price difference is making exports possible.Dwindling supplies and continued Philippine buying have lifted Vietnamese rice export prices to a fresh nine-year high.Vietnams 5% broken rice is offered around $500-$505 per tonne, significantly higher compared to Indian prices of $381-$387.The shrinking supplies will heighten concerns about food insecurity with sub-Saharan Africa among the areas where import demand has been increasing due partly to population growth.Chronic and acute hunger is on the rise, impacting vulnerable households in almost every country, with the Covid-19 pandemic reducing incomes and disrupting supply chains, according to the World Bank.StockpilingTraders said the global pandemic has also prompted Vietnam and other countries to stockpile rice.Vietnam announced last year it would stockpile 270,000 tonnes of rice to ensure food availability amid coronavirus-driven supply chain disruptions worldwide.Traders in Vietnam said the rice from India had been stockpiled in government reserves since 2016-17 and its relatively cheap price reflected low quality.The rice quality is so poor that it is not good for direct consumption for humans, but only for producing animal feeds and beer, said a rice trader based in Ho Chi Minh City.Vietnams total paddy output in 2020 fell 1.85% to 42.69 million tonnes, equivalent to around 21.35 million tonnes of rice, preliminary data from the governments General Statistics Office showed.The countrys rice exports in 2020 were forecast to have fallen by 3.5% to 6.15 million tonnes.Robust demand from Asian and African countries has also been lifting Indian prices but they are still very competitive due to ample stocks, said Nitin Gupta, vice president of Olam Indias rice business.Vietnam could make more purchases as long as the price difference remains, Gupta said.In December, the worlds biggest rice importer China started buying Indian rice for the first time in at least three decades due to tightening supplies from Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam and an offer of sharply discounted prices.In 2020 India exported a record 14 million tonnes of rice, provisional data from the trade ministry showed."

Krishne Gowda from Karnatakas Chikkamagaluru district, as he picks coffee berries that dropped from the trees following the unseasonal rain.From his five-acre farm at Attigere near Kottigehara in Mudigere taluk, he was expecting 200 bags of coffee this year. But the recent rain has taken away 150 bags. My loss would be around 6 lakh, he says. Like him, hundreds of farmers have lost their crops in the last four-five days due to heavy untimely rain. Many lost the beans kept for drying. Bapu Dinesh, also a coffee planter, said sudden rain washed away coffee beans spread on the drying yards.The farming community in Mudigere have already gone through difficult times in last two years. The area witnessed heavy rains and landslides in 2019 and 2020.Bhaktesh, a paddy grower, had spread the harvested paddy on the ground for drying a week ago. A day after, rain started, he said. He was expecting a yield of at least 15 quintals. I will hardly get three-four quintals now.A majority of paddy growers in the region cultivate the crop for consumption and not for the market. Now, they are forced to purchase rice from the local market.Unseasonal rain in the Malnad and coastal belt in the last week has hit processing of arecanut too. Once the harvested arecanut gets drenched, its prices fall, say farmers in the region."
2021-01-13,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ftcci-seeks-more-support-measures-for-rice-exports/article33571408.ece,FTCCI seeks more support measures for rice exports,"Govt. urged to buy paddy and auction it to exporters following Taiwan model of implementing MSPExport of rice from Telangana has a natural disadvantage of connectivity or rather lack of it  connectivity of water way  compared to several other paddy-growing States in the country and its making a big difference in a bulk commodity business like rice which is a low-margin export, the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry has felt.In a report prepared on Rice Exports from Telangana  Opportunities and Way Forward submitted to Vice-Chairman of the Telangana State Planning Board B. Vinod Kumar here on Wednesday, the Chambers, however, suggested that rice exports from Telangana could be made more viable with supportive measures. Stating that Telangana is a landlocked State and the transport charges for shipment from the nearest port are costing high to the exporters, the report suggested that the State could bat for CONCOR (container corporation) subsidy scheme, which is extended to a few dry ports in the country. However, the subsidy is not extended to the inland container depot (ICD) at Sanathnagar.Underscoring the fact that price competitiveness is key to export marketing, the trade and industry body felt that the CONCOR subsidy scheme should be extended to Telangana too and the State government must take it up with Railways for the same.Global marketsFurther, the report suggested that there is every need to establish ICDs in Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts, both of which are over 150 km away from Hyderabad, emerging as major rice belts and the two ICDs at Sanathnagar and at Thimmapur in Mahabubnagar districts are far away from the rice belts.Stating that international markets are agnostic for a product such as rice and always go by the landed cost, the report pointed out that all the rice exporters have been unanimously contending that implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has been adding to distortion of the paddy market with artificial increase in the price of paddy. Besides, new areas growing paddy within the country such as Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkand, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have added to high price variation amongst States.Unless the price disadvantage is addressed, low procurement of rice by exporters cannot increase, the FTCCI report said. It has strongly suggested to give subsidy to rice exporters to make the price on a par with other States.The Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry asked the State government to address the price variation by following Taiwan model in implementing MSP, wherein the government would buy paddy and auctions it to exporters to buy at market price. The system will reduce the burden on market variations but also clears the inventories, the report noted."

Thomas Isaac, presenting the 2021-22 budget on Friday, announced that the base price of rubber will be hiked to 170 a kg from April 1. Likewise, the procurement price of paddy will go up from 27.48 a kg to 28 and that of coconut, from 27 to 32.Currently, the base price of rubber stands at 150 a kg. The assistance of the Central government is essential for raising the support price of rubber from 170 to 200, Dr. Isaac noted. A support price similar to that of coconut will be introduced for coffee cultivators in Wayanad in 2021-22, he added.The government intends to issue an additional 10 kg of rice at 15 to 50 lakh families having blue and white ration cards, he said.In 2021-22, at least 1,500 crore will be invested jointly by various departments, local bodies, and agricultural agencies in the agricultural production sector. The State can achieve self-sufficiency in egg, vegetables, and milk production in two-three years, he said.116 crore for paddyThe Budget has provided 116 crore for paddy cultivation. Out of this, 60 crore is allocated for providing financial assistance to farmers at the rate of 5500 per hectare. The local bodies will provide an additional support of 5,000 to Rs.10,000. An amount of 40 crore has been earmarked for providing royalty at the rate of 2,000 per hectare to farmland owners.The Budget has earmarked 80 crore for the development of vegetables and tubers and 75 crore for replacing old coconut palms with shorter, high-yield varieties.The government intends to create two lakh job opportunities in the agriculture sector, Dr. Isaac said. Three lakh women are employed in 70,000 farm collectives of Kudumbashree at present. During 2021-22, the number of collectives will go up to one lakh, providing employment to an additional 1.25 lakh people, he said.The Budget provides 385 crore for animal husbandry and 50 crore is earmarked for a calf-care scheme to be jointly implemented with local bodies. The Dairy Development Department will get 96 crore."

The health infrastructure has been allotted a massive amount of 3,122 crore through KIIFB, he said, also welcoming the continuation of the Karunya scheme.There are many positive steps for helping NRKs, especially those who have returned to the State recently. The assurance of 10% return on investment through the Pravasi Dividend Scheme is highly welcome which will help a large number of NRKs to have an assured income, he said.One of the areas which has not received attention from the Finance Minister is the health tourism sector, which has huge potential for generating jobs and revenues for the State, he added.K. Harikumar, president of the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said recommendations by the chamber such as revival of sick MSMEs, promotion of innovation with a larger role for K-DISC, support for status, reduction of VAT on CNG and LNG to 5% and support for the plantation sector found place in the budget proposals.The decision to invest 50,000 crore for three industrial corridors, with Kochi as one of the major hubs for activities, definitely deserves appreciation, he said.The impetus provided to the start-up sector will boost entrepreneurs. The governments dedicated Venture Capital fund to support start-ups in their expansion projects will go a long way in generating more jobs and opportunities. The governments decision to raise the base price of rubber, paddy, and coconut to 170, 28 and 32 respectively indicates its concern for the plantation sector. According to the latest economic review, coconut occupies the largest area with 29.3% coverage followed by rubber with 21.28%. Rice comes third with 7.37% of the total cropped area, he said.He also welcomed the decision to withdraw flood cess and not to impose further taxes.Merchants ignoredHowever, Kerala Merchants Chamber of Commerce rued that traders were ignored in the budget. Besides giving concession in registration fee of land for industrial purposes, there was nothing else for the business community, chamber president G. Karthikeyan and general secretary K.M. Vipin said.They said the announcement of huge allocations for welfare projects and more development projects could only be seen as with an eye on the forthcoming Assembly elections. Even the demand for a 5-lakh health insurance for merchants licensed by local bodies and with an annual turnover of less than 40 lakh was not heeded, they said.FICCIIncreased allocation of funds and thrust on development of digital economy, knowledge society, innovation society, and start-ups are appreciated, said Deepak L. Aswani, co-chair, FICCI Kerala State Council.Allocation of 55,000 crore for three industrial corridors in the State will accelerate infrastructure development. Reduction of State VAT to 5% will be a great boost for LNG-related projects. Reduction of stamp duty and registration to 4% and 1% respectively will be a great boon to real estate and construction industry. Increased allocation of funds for infrastructure and marketing activities of the tourism sector at 117 crore and 100 crore will be a great help for the tourism sector, which has been severely affected by the pandemic and is now slowly on the revival path, he said."

With this the purpose of fixing the support price for paddy would not be served.Deputy Commissioner R.Girish met the protesters and assured them that he would consult the officers and ensure the farmers get the price fixed by the government. Later, he also instructed the Deputy Director of Food and Civil Supplies E. Puttaswamy to visit the procuring centre at Palya to enquire about the allegations.Six centresThe district administration has set up six centres to purchase paddy from the growers in the district. The Karnataka Cooperative Marketing Federation procures paddy through rice mills. As many as 12 rice mills have been identified to purchase paddy in the district. The support price fixed for paddy is 1,868 per quintal.Mr. Puttaswamy, Deputy Director of Food and Civil Supplies, told The Hindu, The rice mill staff at Palya had deducted a few kilos in some bags citing the poor quality of paddy. However, we have resolved the issue.The rice mills would procure paddy considering its quality, cleared by the graders, appointed by the Agriculture Department. The paddy procured has to meet the standards set by the Central Government, which purchases paddy for public distribution, he said.The procuring will be done till March 7. As many as 2,575 farmers have registered their names to sell paddy at the support price. The officers are expecting 86,339 quintals of paddy in the district. The rice mills will have to supply 67 kg of rice per quintal of paddy procured from farmers, the officer said.Eom/"

Two-and-a-half-months on, the farmers still want a complete repeal of the laws while the government continues to stand in stout defence of its agri reforms.But what is the story all about? Who are its main protagonists? And how did so many people  including international celebrities like Rihanna  get involved in a row between the government and farmers. Here's a look:The entire logjam between the government and farmers rests on the following three legislations:* Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020* Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance* Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020The government introduced the laws to deregulate the agriculture markets, allow farmers to directly sell their produce to private players (even enter into contracts with them) and remove stock limits on certain crops unless under extraordinary circumstances.But the farmers see them in a different light.They fear that the laws could end up dismantling the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC)  or the mandis  and create a scenario where the Minimum Support Price(MSP)-based procurement will cease to continue.Consequently, they believe that large corporates will mop up their produce at cheaper rates as small & marginal farmers, with limited means, will be unable to strike the right price for their crops.Here's a chart to understand this better:The farmers have categorically said that they will not settle for anything less than a complete rollback of the laws.Even the government's offer of pausing the implementation of the laws for 12-18 months did not cut ice with them as most of the farm unions remained firm on their original demand.In addition to this, the farmers now want a legal guarantee to ensure the continuation of the MSP system.The government has taken an equally firm stand on the new laws, saying that repeal is not possible.Agriculture minister Narendra Tomar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have asserted that there is not a single flaw in the laws pointed out by either the protesting unions or the opposition parties backing them.The government did, however, try to make several concessions to end the impasse.During its negotiations with farmers, the government offered to provide a written assurance on MSP, said it's willing to stay the implementation of laws for 12-18 months to iron out differences and expressed willingness to discuss the laws in detail (""clause-by-clause"") to address each and every concern of the unions.The issue of MSP-based procurement lies at the heart of the farmers agitation.The government has said the laws have nothing to do with the MSP system. This is a fair argument since state procurement was always an administrative decision and never written in the laws.The ministers maintain that the new laws will not affect the old regime and MSP-based procurement will continue like it always did.""MSP tha, hai aur rahega,"" PM Modi said in Parliament recently in an attempt to assuage the concerns of the protesting unions.But the farmers remained unconvinced.""The country doesn't run on trust but on laws and Constitution,"" farmer leader Rakesh Tikait quipped in response to Modi's ""assurance"".Since the laws don't mention MSP at all, the farmers believe the system will be abolished once private players flood the markets and the mandis become obsolete.MSP acts as a safety cushion for farmers growing specific types of crops  23 to be exact.It's the minimum price at which the government procures these crops from the farmers. This price is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) on an annual basis.The Food Corporation of India (FCI)  the main state-run grain procurement agency  largely buys only paddy and wheat at MSP and sells them at highly subsidised prices to the poor.Since Punjab and Haryana farmers primarily grow wheat and paddy, they depend heavily on the MSP system.And there's the data to back all this.In 2018-19, only 12% or 97 lakh of Indias over 8 crore paddy farmers benefitted from procurement operations.However, a closer look reveals that the numbers are skewed heavily in favour of Punjab and Haryana - which are seen as the country's granaries.More than 95% of paddy farmers in Punjab and about 70% of farmers in Haryana were covered under procurement operations. On the other hand, the figures are abysmally low for states like Uttar Pradesh (3.6%), West Bengal (7.3%) and Bihar (1.7%).In her Budget speech earlier this month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government's payment on wheat procurement increased to Rs 62,802 crore in 2019-20, a significant rise from Rs 33,874 crore in 2013-14. She added that nearly 43.36 lakh wheat growers have benefitted from the MSP procurement in 2020-21.Similarly, the MSP payment on rice procurement increased to Rs 1,41,930 crore in 2019-20 and an estimated Rs 1,72,752 crore in 2020-21 from Rs 63,928 crore in 2013-14.Thus, the mere possibility of the MSP system going away has rung alarm bells in the two north Indian states.As the talks between the farmers and government failed to yield any result, the Supreme Court intervened and stayed the implementation of the laws for two months.It ruled that MSP-based procurement should continue until further orders and farmers; landholdings should be protected.While we may not stifle a peaceful protest, we think that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present ... the bench said in its order.Holding that judges are not experts on agriculture or economics, the CJI-led bench also ordered the formation of a four-member expert committee to hold consultations with various stakeholders and submit a report during the period.One member of the committee  BKU president Bhupinder Singh Mann  later recused himself from the panel.The farmers didn't welcome the top court's decision to form a committee, claiming that all its members have backed the government's agriculture reforms.The Supreme Court said that the panel would proceed with or without the farmers' participation and strongly deprecated attempts to besmirch the reputation of members by branding them as biased.So far, the panel has held seven meetings with various stakeholders, which included talks with some representatives of the farmer unions. However, there is still no breakthrough in sight.Even as the farmers continued their protracted siege at Delhi borders, causing inconvenience to commuters, both the government and the Supreme Court lauded the peaceful nature of the agitation.But this changed on January 26.The symbolic tractor parade by farmers on Republic Day descended into chaos and anarchy as the protesters breached barricades ahead of time, clashed with police personnel at various places in Delhi and stormed into the iconic Red Fort.The waving of the religious flag from the ramparts of Red Fort evoked national condemnation and came as a body blow to the hitherto nonviolent agitation.The unions immediately distanced themselves from the violence and alleged widespread conspiracy to sabotage the movement. Nonetheless, the movement did suffer as a fallout of the violence, with some unions withdrawing from the agitation.And just when things appeared to be fizzling out, BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait made a tearful appeal to stir the sentiments of the dejected protesters.In pictures: Key protagonists of farmers agitation""I will commit suicide but won't end protest until the farm bills are repealed""  with a single statement, Tikait turned the tide in favour of the farmers and became the new face of the agitation.Thousands of protesters joined in overnight, coalescing at the Ghazipur border to rally behind the agitators. The mass support even forced the UP government, which had ordered the farmers to vacate all the protest sites, to soften its stand.But with memories of Republic Day violence still afresh, the government and security forces too responded in equal measure.Concrete barricades, nails, trenches, cemented walls, additional forces ... the Delhi Police fortified the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur protest sites to prevent the protesting farmers from forcing their way into the national capital.In pictures: 5-layer security in Delhi after R-Day violenceInternet was banned at the protest sites as well as adjoining areas and border movement completely halted.The action by the government and security agencies expectedly drew criticism from farmers, who alleged a conspiracy to scuttle their agitation.But the unexpected bit was the reaction from an unlikely source  international pop icon Rihanna.The singer tweeted a CNN report about the internet shutdown at Delhi borders with the caption ""Why aren't we talking about this?"".Her tweet triggered a chain reaction on social media.Shortly thereafter, US vice-president Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris, who's a lawyer, climate activist Greta Thunberg, US House foreign affairs committee member Jim Costa, YouTuber Lilly Singh, poet Rupi Kaur, rapper Russ, former adult film star Mia Khalifa, UK MP Claudia Webbe and a host of others came out in support of the agitation.This prompted the ministry of external affairs to take the unusual step of reacting to tweets by private foreign individuals with a detailed official statement.Not much later, senior government ministers and Indian celebrities too joined in on the chorus.Actors Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn, producer-directors Karan Johar and Ekta Kapoor, singer Lata Mangeshkar and cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli supported the MEA's stand on Twitter with government-approved hashtags IndiaTogether and IndiaAgainstPropaganda.Several ministers of the Modi government, including home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, also joined the counter-attack.The sudden internationalisation and counter-attack added another layer of controversy to the movement. The Maharashtra government has now decided to probe allegations that celebrities were ""pressurised"" by the government to tweet in their support.The farmers and the government have both expressed willingness to initiate dialogue.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent appeal in Parliament, some farmer leaders said they are ready for further talks and even asked the government to fix a date.Separately, the farmers have announced a nationwide rail roko protest on February 18 to step up pressure on the government.More such protests are likely to follow if the deadlock continues.Tikait had earlier said the farmers have given the government time till October 2 to repeal the laws and will decide the next course of action after that. Meanwhile, the government continues to support the laws in ongoing Parliament session with PM Modi himself leading the defence.And the saga continues ..."

The police and paramilitary forces have deployed up to 50,000 personnel, as well as barricades, barbed wire and riot-control vehicles. The United Nations is urging restraint. And each day, more farmers and tractors arrive to join the disgruntled ranks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no stranger to sparking public anger with his determination to push through reforms, but this may be his most vital stand-off yet. The farmers are demanding he repeal laws passed in September that they say will ruin their livelihoods. The government insists the new policy will benefit the growers and refuses to withdraw the legislation. After months of protests, more than 10 rounds of talks and a Supreme Court order to temporarily suspend the laws, the government says it would consider some amendments and could delay implementation by as much as 18 months. But the agitators are in no mood for compromise.Were not going anywhere. We are ready to sit here for years if needed. The government has to listen, said Balwinder Singh, 50, who normally grows rice and wheat on 3 acres of land in Punjab. He has been protesting since Nov. 26 on the Singhu border, the epicentre of the demonstrations outside Delhi. We can survive the coronavirus but not these laws.Behind the protesters fears and the government rhetoric is a reality that the country somehow needs to reshape its agricultural system or face the environmental consequences of overproduction and a fiscal calamity from ballooning farm subsidies. Get the reform right and it could raise millions of agriculture-dependent families out of poverty and propel India to the forefront of global food exports. Get it wrong and it could force tens of millions of people off their land and degrade up to 90% of the nations water supply.Its a problem so titanic that consecutive governments have shied away from making meaningful changes. Not Modi. Emboldened by seemingly unsinkable popular support, even during a devastating pandemic, his administration has weighed in. Its a classic playbook for the prime minister, whose six years in power have been marked by policy reforms that often set off national protests and occasionally thrown the country into turmoil, such as canceling 86% of circulating currency and introducing a religion-based citizenship law. But the governments willingness to compromise on the farm issue shows that this is potentially an even more delicate path one that risks alienating more than half of the nations 1.3 billion people, who rely on agriculture for a living.The two sides are poles apart. The government says the laws will overhaul the way farm goods are produced and sold in the country, opening up a decades-old system of state-run wholesale markets to more private purchases and helping producers earn more. The farmers fear the laws would give companies and large wholesalers the power to dictate prices to small land-holders, who make up the majority of producers.Its about unlocking productivity in areas like farming of cereals by applying high-quality farm inputs such as seeds, and using less water to grow the same amount of grain, said Rahul Bajoria, Mumbai-based chief India economist at Barclays Plc. The best way for the farm sector to grow is to focus more on exports, for which the country needs to improve productivity and quality control.But the nations millions of small farmers live a precarious existence and have come to trust a government support system that allows them to survive year to year with enough to get to the next harvest.Private companies won't pay us on time, said Singh, the protester. If we don't get paid on time, how will we prepare for our next crop? We will die of hunger.""The root of the conflict lies in a system that evolved over more than half a century after the Green Revolution of the 1960s slowly transformed the nation from a land of frequent famines to an agricultural powerhouse. India is now the worlds biggest exporter of rice and the second-largest producer of wheat and sugar. At the same time, a complex and inefficient system of state support, controlled markets and government welfare grew up that Modi is trying to unpick.Under the present system, the government sets minimum prices for about two dozen crops and buys large volumes of rice and wheat for its welfare programs. While traders arent legally obliged to pay the government-set rates, the sheer volume of state purchases creates de facto price support for key grains from small farmers, who sell their produce through licensed traders in designated markets. These markets were set up to open up the industry and prevent exploitation of smallholders, but over time many became effective monopolies, with traders pulling together to stifle competition. As a result, prices of rice and wheat have remained stable over years, while other crops such as soybeans, corn and rapeseed have seen sharp price swings.Farmers like the arrangement because the government provides them with a guaranteed buyer, allowing them to easily secure informal short-term loans to buy farm inputs like seeds in a country where rural banking services are often inadequate.The new rules intend to liberalize trading by allowing farmers to sell crops outside the designated markets. Modis administration has promised that the welfare support mechanism will remain, but protesters arent convinced.Many believe the reforms are designed ultimately to cut the governments food subsidy bill expected to be $33.4 billion in 2021-22 by allowing market forces to drive down prices. The current support rates reflect the cost of production plus a 50% profit, which, along with assured purchases, has encouraged farmers to overproduce some crops. With India growing more wheat, rice, sugar cane and cotton than it needs, a free-for-all could cause prices to slump.Worse still, 86% of Indias farmers cultivate plots of about 2 hectares (5 acres) or less, while the other 14% own more than half the cultivated land. In an unfettered market, large landowners with lower costs per acre and better access to funds could end up dominating markets, forcing smallholders to sell their land. Thats a shift that took decades in many developed nations as rural residents migrated to cities to work in factories. But an accelerated transition on the scale of Indias population risks a major humanitarian crisis.Jokhu Ray, who grew corn and rice in the eastern state of Bihar, has had a taste of what a free market could mean. Bihar abolished its government-managed market in 2006 and Ray says the result was disastrous for him. In the 2019-20 crop year, he could only get 10 rupees (14 cents) a kilogram for his corn, less than the support price of 17.6 rupees or the 15 rupees he got the year before. Like many others, Ray left his village to seek work elsewhere and now works on a construction site in Rajasthan.Stories like Rays have fueled farmers fears. Protesters around the country held 3-hour chakka jams at the weekend, holding up traffic. The government blocked the internet at major protest sites and deployed some 50,000 police and paramilitary, along with riot control vehicles in and around Delhi, according to local media. After violence broke out at a Republic Day rally in the capital in January, the United Nations urged farmers to keep protests peaceful.The government has shut down the Internet here out of fear, said Singh, by phone. We are not scared. We are informing people through phone calls.We are urging those involved in agitation to end protests, Modi told lawmakers in parliament on Feb. 8. We should give these agriculture reforms a chance.Farmers instead are demanding new legislation that makes it illegal to pay less than the minimum support rate, a policy analysts say would distort the market even more. Private buyers could be scared off, forcing the government to have to step in and buy even more. That would worsen a fiscal deficit that is already expected to widen to 9.5% of GDP due to the coronavirus.State-run Food Corp. of India, the nations biggest food-grain buyer, is already stretched after buying 39 million tons of wheat and 52 million tons of rice from last years crop of about 108 million tons and 118 million tons respectively. Recent bumper harvests have filled many state granaries to bursting.Raising minimum prices each year could also hit exports, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the nations Rice Exporters Association. The moment we make minimum prices a legal obligation, we are bound to lose our share in the global market. He suggested that support prices should be set close to global levels and farmers compensated if needed for any losses.And there are other, even more serious long-term consequences if India doesnt find an equitable way to reform its agriculture, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, where the protests began.Indias Green Revolution in the 1960s brought a surge in grain output in Punjab thanks to high-yielding seeds, mechanization and increased application of pesticides and fertilizers. Known as Indias bread-basket, the state supplied about one third of the 62 million tons of water-intensive paddy that the government purchased from monsoon-sown crops so far this year, according to the food ministry.States like Punjab grow more rice than they consume despite unfavorable terrain, which has resulted in a drastic depletion of their water tables, Rini Sen, an economist with ANZ Banking Group, said in a report.India has only about 4% of the worlds fresh water and farmers tap almost 90% of the groundwater available. Growers say they cant afford to switch from water-intensive crops such as rice and sugar cane unless the government ensures the same kind of price support for more sustainable crops like soybeans, mustard or pigeon peas (used to make dal).Finding a compromise that would reassure farmers they can still make a decent living while dismantling an archaic and inefficient agriculture market may be Modis hardest task to date. But as the two sides dig in for what could be a long and bitter stand-off, its one that India must solve."
2021-02-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/challenge-for-food-corporation-of-india-rising-stocks-cost-push-to-procure-7188811/,"Challenge for Food Corporation of India: Rising stocks, cost, & push to procure","The economic cost is what the FCI incurs in procuring, transporting, storing and distributing every kg of wheat or rice. (Express File)The Food Corporation of Indias (FCI) economic cost of wheat sold through the public distribution system (PDS) is budgeted to go up to Rs 29.94 per kg and that of rice to Rs 42.94 per kg in 2021-22, from their corresponding current levels of Rs 27.40 and Rs 39.99 per kg.These numbers are significant, given that under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013, 81.35 crore persons, accounting for over 67% of the countrys population, are entitled to receive 5 kg of PDS wheat or rice per month at Rs 2 and Rs 3 per kg, respectively.Also, the political pressure from the farmer protests may force stepped-up procurement by the government.At the projected economic cost of Rs 29.94/kg for wheat and Rs 42.94/kg for rice, the corresponding per-kg PDS consumer subsidy in the coming fiscal would work out to Rs 27.94 and Rs 39.94, respectively.The economic cost is what the FCI incurs in procuring, transporting, storing and distributing every kg of wheat or rice.The estimated Rs 29.94/kg economic cost for wheat in 2021-22 includes a pooled cost of Rs 19.21 (roughly what the farmer gets); procurement incidentals of Rs 3.20 (gunny bags, market fee, arhtiya commission, labour and other mandi-level expenses); and distribution cost of Rs 7.53 (freight, handling, storage, interest and other administrative charges).In the case of the Rs 42.94/kg for rice, the pooled cost is Rs 27.90, with procurement incidentals at Rs 4.85 and distribution cost at Rs 10.19.Under NFSA, enacted during the previous United Progressive Alliance regime, the Rs 2-3/kg PDS issue prices for wheat and rice were valid for up to three years from the date of commencement of the law on July 5, 2013.The Narendra Modi government has not raised these rates even as the Finance Ministrys latest Economic Survey has pointed to the need to consider a revision in the Central issue prices of PDS grain to reduce the bulging food subsidy bill.Meanwhile, rice and wheat stocks in the Central pool remain at way above necessary levels, despite the Modi government implementing special schemes for alleviating the widespread economic distress resulting from the Covid-19-induced lockdown.As against 65.91 million tonnes (mt) of grain offtake from public godowns in 2018-19 and 62.19 mt in 2019-20, the Modi government has allocated a total quantity of 94.37 mt in the current fiscal.That includes 57.15 mt under NFSA (at Rs 2-3/kg), 4.31 mt under other welfare schemes (at higher rates of Rs 4.15/kg for wheat and Rs 5.65/kg for rice) and 32.91 mt under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.The latter scheme involved providing an extra 5 kg grain per month, free of cost, to NFSA beneficiaries (for eight months from April-November 2020) and 8 crore returning migrant labourers (for two months from May-June).But notwithstanding these extraordinary liquidation measures, total grain stock in the Central pool stood at 82.18 mt as on February 1, compared to 75.17 mt a year ago (see table).The 82.18 mt included 31.83 mt of wheat, 24.36 mt of rice and 38.79 mt of un-milled paddy (whose milled rice equivalent, at 67 per cent, was 25.99 mt)."
2021-02-19,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-exports-pick-up-as-additional-port-opened/article33877668.ece,Indian exports pick up as additional port opened,"India's 5% broken par boiled variety of rice eased to $395-$401 a tonne from last week's multi-year high of $402-$408.Indian rice exports gained momentum this week after an additional port was opened in the country's biggest rice-handling facility, potentially easing congestion.Waiting periods at the Kakinada Anchorage Port had reached up to four weeks, compared with about a week normally, because of congestion at the port.From Saturday we have started using Kakinada deep water port, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association of India, adding that this will reduce waiting times and accelerate overall exports.Mr. Rao said that exporters' resulting savings in demurrage fees could be passed on to farmers and overseas buyers.India's 5% broken par boiled variety of rice eased to $395-$401 a tonne from last week's multi-year high of $402-$408.Thailand's 5% broken rice narrowed to $540-$560 a tonne on Thursday, still near 10-month highs.There's muted demand and less supply in the country. There's not much demand from overseas either because our prices are higher than competitors', one Bangkok-based trader said.Vietnam's 5% broken rice fell to $505-$510 a tonne on Thursday as harvests in the Mekong Delta gathered pace, down from $510-$515 before the Lunar New Year holiday.Traders said they are buying more rice from farmers in expectation of rising demand from importers, pushing domestic prices of un-husked paddy to a 10-year high of between 6,200 and 7,000 dong per kg.Productivity of the winter-spring crop in the Mekong is relatively high, they added.Domestic prices in Bangladesh rose by 35% in 2020 amid low supply and increased demand during the pandemic, according tothe United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.The government has initiated imports of 2 million tonnes of rice and also lowered import duty on rice from 65.5% to 25%."

It was pure desperation that pushed Sebastian into a self-immolation bid in front of the Kallara Krishi Bhavan in Kottayam on February 25. Fortunately, the timely intervention of a few locals saved the farmers life. Over the past 10 days, two farmers of Upper Kuttanad have attempted suicide citing the allegedly deliberate delay by mill owners in procuring their paddy and the apathy of the Civil Supplies Corporation towards their plight.The government, however, is yet to intervene. According to the farmers, about two lakh tonnes of paddy has been lying in the open fields of Upper Kuttanad, Vechoor, Makopara, Kallara and Neendoor areas for more than one month. The Civil Supplies Corporation has tasked the rice millers to procure the rice on the condition that they will provide 68 per cent rice to the corporation. But the farmers allege the mill owners are deliberately delaying the procurement to bargain and lower the prices.Thomas, a farmer from Neendoor Makkethara, said the mill owners are demanding a huge wastage discount to the tune of 10 to 20 per cent. As the acidity of the soil in the Upper Kuttanad region is high, the yield is poor. So, they are trying to exploit us. Around 13,500 quintals of paddy have been lying in the Makkethara Kunnathukandam fields for more than 15 days.What are we supposed to do, said an aggrieved Thomas, who was the second farmer to attempt suicide in the Upper Kuttanad region over the past 10 days. He had tried to set himself ablaze on March 1, but was saved by other farmers. Sebastian, who is also the convener of Mundar Paddy Growers Forum, said he took the extreme step because his family was struggling due to mounting debts. I have availed a bank loan of Rs 3 lakh to meet agriculture expenses.Though it is a six-month interest free loan, the bank will charge 15 per cent interest if we dont close it within the stipulated period. The paddy was harvested on January 31 and a spell of summer rain could have destroyed the yield, he said, adding the mill owners and agents were deliberately delaying the procurement to frustrate the farmers.They know we will be desperate to sell yieldThey know we will be desperate to sell the yield as it may rain any time. They are demanding 16 per cent wastage discount, which is unbearable. In July last year, I had suffered a huge loss because the rains destroyed the first crop, he said.The government gives Rs 2,140 per quintal as procurement charge to the mills, but they are still demanding huge discounts in the name of wastage, said Sajeev Rajappan of Chengalam.As we use machines for harvest, the wastage is low. We gave them a discount of 2.5 per cent last year. We also had to bear other expenses like labour cost and harvester charges, Sajeev said. The paddy was harvested on February 6 and the agents arrived for procurement on March 4.Babu Simon, of Neendoor Kaipuzhakara paddy fields, said he suffered a huge loss last year because the mill owners refused to procure his yield for questioning the high wastage charge. We have been pleading with the paddy procurement and agriculture officers to take steps for early procurement. But nobody has responded positively, he said.Meanwhile, the Civil Supplies Ministers Office said the mill owners were not keen on procuring paddy from Upper Kuttanad because the yield is low and wastage is high. They have been demanding government compensation. After we held talks with them, they have assured to start the procurement process immediately, said an officer."

In the kharif marketing season (KMS) last year, the total paddy procurement was 53.31 lakh tonne.Expecting a bumper harvest of paddy, the government had set an ambitious target to procure 71 lakh tonne of paddy during 2020-21 KMS. It had fixed a target to procure 48 lakh tonne of rice (equivalent to 71 lakh tonne of paddy) for 2020-21.The State Cabinet had approved a target of 37 lakh tonne rice (equivalent to 54 lakh tonne paddy) for kharif season and 11 lakh tonne of rice (equivalent to 17 lakh tonne paddy) for rabi season. However, the government has exceeded its kharif target by nine lakh tonne. The rabi paddy procurement will start from May 1 and continue till June 30.Though 14.97 lakh farmers have registered online for sale of their surplus paddy under minimum support price (MSP), a report of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department said 11.92 lakh farmers sold their paddy till the deadline.The government failed to explain why 2.05 lakh registered farmers couldnt sell their produces. This points at the alleged irregularities in procurement process. The Food and Procurement Policy approved by the government said there was no bar on procurement of any higher quantum if more paddy comes to mandis from registered farmers.The fact remains that more mandis (3,840) were opened during this kharif season than last year (3,543) and 2,881 primary agriculture cooperative societies were engaged for procurement against 2,853 last year. Despite cash crunch, the Odisha Civil Supplies Corporation borrowed money from open market to buy paddy which costs around Rs 11,756 crore."
2021-04-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/niti-aayog-member-sparks-farm-income-debate-7262160/,Niti Aayog member sparks farm income debate,"Farmer Jaspreet Singh with a worker checks the wheat crop that is ready for harvesting at village Noorpur in Ludhiana on Tuesday. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Amid ongoing standoff over the agri laws, a Niti Aayog members remarks that the target of doubling farmers income by 2022 will not be fulfilled if the three new legislations are not implemented immediately, has sparked a fresh debate.Farmers and farm experts termed the statement as an excuse to protect the central government  which had announced in 2017-18 its target to double farmers income by 2022  and asked how these laws can double their income when there is no provision of even assured Minimum Support Price (MSP) in these laws.The debate began when Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand, said, I will say that if these three farm laws are not adopted immediately, then I dont see that goal (of doubling farmers income by 2022) getting fulfilled.He was replying to a question on whether the government is still confident of doubling farm income by 2022.Expert on farm issues and retired economics professor from Punjabi University Patiala Professor Gian Singh said that even if these laws are implemented today, they can never double farmers income by 2022. These laws lay more stress on privatisation and private mandis. Can the private player pay farmers so much that their income would be doubled? he asked.He further said that per capita income of a farmers family was Rs 54 per day in 2015-16 and even if it is increased to double, that is Rs 108 per capita, it cannot meet their basic needs including food, shelter, education, health etc.The pandemic has also proved that a human being can survive without cars, airplanes, big houses but cannot survive without food. Government must realise the contribution of farmers and should seriously do something to increase their income rather implementing these laws which have no guarantee of even getting a price equal to the current MSP, said Prof Gian Singh, adding that during the pandemic, India and particularly Punjab farmers have procured record paddy and even India has exported more rice this year to other countries.But our government, instead of rewarding them, is punishing them by running from government purchase.To double their income we need a farmer-friendly model not the corporate-friendly model, he added.In Punjab, wheat and paddy are the two main crops which are procured at MSP by the government and now the government is running from it giving several excuses in the name of direct payment, providing land record of the farmers etc. When around 68 per cent farmers have less than five acres and government is running from MSP purchase, how these laws can double the income of farmers? asked Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda).We had length and breadth discussions on every clause of these laws with the government but government could not explain how the income of farmers can be enhanced by adopting these laws when government has no control on private players, he said, adding that farmers income can be increased only if the MSP of every crop is given as per recommendations of the Swaminathan report.Our demand for legal status of MSP for every crop is only because this is the only way to double farmers income, he said.Another expert from Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, said that the Ramesh Chand committee 2014-15 had several good recommendations according to which he had recommended MSP of the crops, but as per these three laws the government is not talking about MSP, but about private mandis and players, which mean minimising the government purchase which would result in no purchase at MSP.The Niti Aayog member is thinking from the point of view of the private players, not from the farmers point of view and assuming that private players are paying much more to the farmers than the governments price. How can things be assumed when everyone is aware that a businessman (private players) is much more worried about his own profit not about the welfare of the farmers?Only the state can think about the welfare of farmers but the state is running from its responsibility, said BKU (Ugrahan) General Secretary, Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan.If the government is saying it wants to double the income of farmers, it should take such steps, not the steps it has taken in the form of these three laws which are more suitable to private players, he added.The lives of small and marginal farmers are already in a miserable state and now these laws will push them further into more poverty as they are not in a position to bargain with private players and sell their crop going one place to another, said Kokrikalan, and asked whether the Niti Aayog member convince farmers in layman language how these laws would double their income.Can he quote even a single such model where small and marginal farmers are earning a respectable income without the support of the government, he asked."

(TOI FILE)HYDERABAD: The Telangana government will set up 6,575 procurement centres in the state during Yasangi to procure 90 lakh metric tonnes of paddy.More centres would be opened if needed.Despite difficulties, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao sanctioned Rs 20,000 crore for procurement of paddy for the welfare of farmers, said civil supplies corporation chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy.The procurement would be carried out adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols.In all, the civil supplies corporation procured 3.93 crore metric tonnes of paddy worth Rs 68,000 crore at minimum support price between 2014-15 and 2020-21 Vaanakalam, said Mareddy on Thursday.The corporation chairman sought to advise farmers to cultivate crops that had demand in the market.The Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) may not purchase boiled rice in future and in Yasangi too, as it is not evincing interest to purchase boiled rice.From Telangana, boiled rice used to be transported to West Bengal , Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha.However, these states are now getting their required crop as a result of which the FCI is insisting on raw rice only and has said it wont be able to accept boiled rice."

Chandrasekhar Raos request with it, Chairman of Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation M. Srinivas Reddy has stated here on Thursday.He, however, suggested the farming community not to grow common grade (doddu rakam) paddy from which boiled rice is processed, from the next season as the FCI was not willing to procure it.It was unwilling to accept boiled rice from Telangana this season but had agreed after much persuasion.Explaining the FCIs reluctance to take boiled rice from Telangana, Mr. Srinivas Reddy said the agency used to procure boiled rice from the State for supply in Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala and West Bengal. However, those States were producing required quantities of common grade paddy and as a result the FCI was seeking only raw rice, processed from fine varieties of paddy, from Telangana.Keeping in mind such changing scenario, the farmers were required to grow only those crops which have demand in the market, the TSCSC Chairman said.He further stated that in spite of the financial constraints of the State government, the Chief Minister had agreed to take up paddy procurement this season and the government had given guarantee for borrowing 20,000 crore by the corporation for the purpose.Mr. Srinivas Reddy stated that the TSCSC would open 6,575 procurement centres to purchase paddy from farmers this season at support price, provided they bring the produce with fair average quality specifications such as maximum moisture content of 17% and chaff up to 3% among others. As on Thursday, a total of 179 purchase centres were opened in Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Khammam and Suryapet districts.Stating that it was only Telangana that was procuring entire paddy produced (brought to market) since 2014-15, the TSCSC Chairman said the government (corporation) had procured 3.93 crore tonnes of paddy till 2020-21 kharif season with a cost of 68,000 crore. The paddy production this year was estimated to be 2.37 crore tonnes including 1.05 crore tonnes in kharif and 1.32 crore tonnes in rabi."

The paddy production this season was 61,89,000 tonnes compared to 57,11,000 tonnes in the 2019-2020 Rabi season.These figures were part of the third advance estimates released by the department of economics and statistics and might vary in the final estimates to be presented later. As per the statistics, the increase in production has been attributed to three factors: more area brought under cultivation of paddy, better water availability and no heavy rains during the Rabi season.The area of paddy cultivation was increased to 8,81,000 hectares in the 2020-21 Rabi season from 8,05,000 hectares in the 2019-20 Rabi season. However, yield per hectare has decreased this Rabi compared to the previous one. As per the estimates, the yield per hectare this year was 7,025 kgs while it was 7,095 kgs per hectare in the last Rabi.It is true that the area of cultivation has increased and there was good ground water and sufficient water in reservoirs, but a couple of moderate rains in between and delay in transplantation of paddy from nurseries might have resulted in the low yield per hectare. With low moisture content, the percentage of broken rice is increasing. Millers are suggesting us to harvest the crop even if there is one or two per cent more moisture, Koti Reddy, a farmer in Dagadarthi mandal of Nellore district said.His family has cultivated paddy in 30 acres of land and hoped to get a good harvest to overcome the nightmare called Nivar cyclone. However, fall in quality is a worrying factor for Reddys family. We have only harvested a part of it and hope the quality of the rest is better, he said.Sriramulu, another farmer in Nellore, said that the government has to ensure that millers do not exploit the farmers in the name of quality and see that they get a fair price. He said it should negotiate with the Food Corporation of India for taking more boiled rice variety.In East Godavari district, harvesting of paddy commenced a week ago and is expected to continue for the next one month. Compared to previous Rabi and Kharif, the production is better. Hopefully, we will recover the losses suffered during Kharif, said Subba Reddy, a farmer in Kakinada rural. As per the advance estimates, the total food grains production this Rabi is estimated to be 90,10,000 tonnes compared to the previous Rabi production of 82,95,000 tonnes.Rabi yield61,89,000 tonnes paddy production in Rabi 2020-2157,11,000 tonnes paddy production in Rabi 2019-20"
