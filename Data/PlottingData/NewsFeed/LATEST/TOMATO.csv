2021-01-02,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/taking-note-of-farmer-welfare-the-kerala-way/article33475184.ece,"Taking note of farmer welfare, the Kerala way","The political allegations levelled against the State in the context of the farmers protest are far removed from the factsFor more than a month now, farmers are writing a new history, camping at the borders of Delhi. The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.Binoy Viswam is Secretary, CPI National Council, and leader of the party in Parliament.

I reckon that 2021 will be the year when the upmarket gourmet supermarket-food hall will flounder before it dies. The neighbourhood grocer, who has built up a relationship with his local community of shoppers, will survive  flourish, even  because of convenience, reliability and familiarity.But fewer and fewer people are going to be willing to get into their cars, drive to an upmarket supermarket, find parking, locate a trolley, negotiate a narrow aisle and line up to pay. And the so-called gourmet places will find it harder and harder to maintain margins that will allow them to pay rents, salaries etc., and still turn a profit.I guess this may have happened anyway but the pandemic has accelerated the death of the gourmet food hall. In the months when we were locked down and, in the period after that, when we were too scared to go to shops, we discovered that we could get everything we needed delivered to our doorsteps.Anata.in have created a 24X7 delivery service that drops artisanal products to your doorMost gratifying, to me, at least, is that we no longer need to hanker after foreign foods. These days we make nearly everything in India. And unlike the West, where the big shops are full of industrial, packaged products, the food scene in India is bursting with artisanal operations. Their products are made in small batches by people who care about quality.This was driven home to me when I went on the website of Anata.in. Over the last several months, I have written regularly about artisanal food operations because I have been excited about the quality of the prepared foods and raw vegetables that are now available for delivery. But a little voice inside me has always said: I wish there was an easier way. I wish people didnt have to directly contact every single artisanal producer.It seems like the people at Anata.in heard me. Because they have created a 24X7 delivery service that drops artisanal products to your door. Not only is their range vast but I felt pangs of familiarity because many of the producers on their roster are people I have written about (Shroomery, Artisan Meats, etc.).The hot dog buns from Artisanal Bread are soft and deliciousWhile I tend to focus mainly on quality, Anata focuses on sustainability as well. The card that came with my order said, Anata was started to solve our own needs. Each of us wanted to reduce our carbon footprint but did not know where to start.When they did start, it was simple enough: We reached out to people who were already doing the work: an environmental designer passionate about experimenting with coffee roasts, a mom creating artisanal ale concentrates from her living room, a zero-waste chocolate entrepreneur who invented his own plastic-free packaging from cacao husk.The systems are more complex. As soon as you place your order, they collect the products you want from a variety of entrepreneurs, bring them to their central facility, put your order together and dispatch a rider with the boxes to your home. Because it is an idea whose time has come, the producers are willing to give up part of their margins to be on the platform. So, a consumer pays exactly as much as he or she would have paid had they gone to several different websites and ordered the products.The vegetables from Krishi Cress can be fresh and distinctiveIt is, I guess, an online artisanal gourmet store that takes the place of the dying brick-and-mortar food halls of old. If you are new to this online/delivery world and want to know what to look for online, here are some tips.Cakes and bread: Most commercial Indian bread is depressingly poor and is made by a nasty industrial process that shortens baking time but also leeches out all flavour. Till recently, the only retail alternative was at five-star hotels. But even hotel bread can be nasty and the cakes are often made with synthetic cream and chocolate.So, its wise to always go niche. There are good bakers in every city. In Mumbai, Pooja Dhingra is the queen of the oven. In Delhi, Sahil Mehta is respected for the quality of his baking.Unlike the West, where the big shops are full of industrial, packaged products, the food scene in India is bursting with artisanal operationsBut even if you dont go to those superstars, look for small operations on the net. I tried the crostini from Farming V2 through Anata and it was of a far superior quality than any five-star hotel. The hot dog buns from Artisanal Bread were soft and delicious.Ordering cakes can be difficult because there are now too many small operations, some run by people who have just picked recipes off the Internet. But look around: the real talent is in the artisanal bakeries.Eggs: The only thing worse than bland broiler chicken is a pale, watery, industrial egg. Over 15 years ago, I recommended the then obscure Keggs for the quality of its free-range eggs. But there are now many others in the fray. Anata has some of the newer producers but Im sure there are others.Vegetables: The vegetables from such delivery options as Krishi Cress, which deal directly with farmers, can be fresh and distinctive. They are not particularly expensive and you can find otherwise hard-to-get veggies. But a note of caution: I still havent found a good source for tasty tomatoes!Meat and charcuterie like spicy Italian pork sausages from Artisan Meats are better than those from large companiesMeat: There are many large meat companies with large advertising budgets like Licious in the market now, but I stick to smaller producers. Most of the meat and charcuterie in my house still is from Artisan Meats. The only other suppliers I would trust for charcuterie are Meisterwurst and the Oberoi deli. All the famous Indian branded pork products that I have seen in the shops are uniformly disappointing.Pickles: Who knew? I first asked for recommendation for meat pickles two months ago and got so deluged by the responses that I have come to the conclusion that pickle makers are Indias secret food stars. Never buy retail. Always buy your pickles on the net. They can be fabulous.Coffee: Always go on the net: especially if you are looking for capsules for coffee-machines. I have relied on Fresh Brew for years now and am constantly astonished by how high their quality is.My product of the week: Chorizo Hummus by Artisan Collective.I dont even particularly like hummus, so I would never have ordered this ! I ordered a box of assorted products from Anata (they choose so its always full of surprises) and a jar of chorizo hummus came with a handwritten label, which gave the date of preparation. (It was delivered the same day.)So check the web. Explore. There has never been a better time to eat well at home.The views expressed by the columnist are personalFrom HT Brunch, January 3, 2021Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch"

Taking care of our skin, hair, working out and trying everything that made us happy and a better version of ourselves, we did it. Shahid Kapoors wife Mira Rajput has also been sharing a lot of content on her social media that talks about holistic living and ways of improving our lifestyle .From Yoga to clean eating, nutrition and sustainability, there are a lot of things that Mira talked about with her followers during the lockdown and she is still doing it. Her latest post is all about skincare. It is not just your regular skincare video with market bought products, but it is a Do It Yourself (DIY) clip that consists of all the products already available in your kitchen.The clip that is captioned, DIY Skincare. Here are my favourite packs and potions that you can prepare yourself #GetTheGlow (sic), shows the mother-of-two dressed in a stunning rose-pink full-sleeved top. She teamed the turtle neck top with a pair of black lowers. For the video, Mira accessorised her outfit with a pair of drop earrings and left her side-parted hair down.In the Instagram post, Mira also told her followers that she started making face packs with kitchen ingredients and taking care of her skin when she was 14. At the beginning of the video, she also gave a disclaimer that these face packs may not be as effective for the rest of the people but they work wonders for her. She also asked her followers to do a patch test on their skin before applying the masks as there might be a possibility of skin reactions.Lets check out the DIY recipes she spoke about:1. Honey And Haldi PackHoney is natural humectant aka it preserves the moisture of the skin and haldi is anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial. According to Mira, this pack is great for zits and can be applied when your skin is not looking fresh. Mix a pinch of haldi with some honey and let it remain on your skin for 20 minutes.2. Raw MilkRaw milk is Mira and her mothers go-to remedy for anything skin related. Be it a sunburn, uneven tan or dry skin, they use raw milk for it. In the morning take three tablespoons of raw milk and with the help of cotton, dab it on your face. Once it dries, repeat the process till you apply all the milk on your face. Mira also adds a little bit of rosewater to avoid the smell of the milk.3. DIY FacialMira cuts a lemon and applies it on her face. Once she is done with it, she shifts to a homemade face mask which includes besan and dahi as the basic components. You can add whatever other ingredients you have in your home including orange peel, sandalwood, etc. Mix the ingredients and apply it on your skin, once it is semi-dried, she removes the mask. After that, Mira applies tomato juice on her face. After 10 minutes, she removes the juice and finally applies aloe vera which tones and tightens the skin.4. DIY Oil For HairMira adds 7-8 hibiscus leaves, curry leaves and methi seeds to coconut oil and boils it. Once it is cooled, she bottles it and applies whenever needed.5. Hair MaskFor this, she boils half a cup of flax seeds in a pan of water and heats it till the water reduces and comes to a gel-like consistency. She passes it through a strainer and voila, your hair mask is ready. You can also use it as hair gel.6. Mask For ZitsTo get rid of zits, Mira steeps basil in water, once it is cooled, she dabs cotton in it and applies it on her zit. The zit temporarily settles and the redness also goes down for some time.Which one of these have you tried before?Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter"

Cabbage, chow-chow and beetroot were availabe for 10/kg. Beans was available for 25/kg, after price fell by 10-15. This was the lowest price in the past five months. Rates were fluctuating so much in the recent past that carrot and onion prices exceeded 100/kg due to shortage in arrivals.S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations said that arrivals to the market is expected to drop this week. ""We had huge arrivals in December that lowered the cost of all vegetables,"" he said. But, this week may see partial revision in prices since arrivals for Chennai is expected to drop as markets offering better prices in other states for the same commodity could attract additional vegetables, he added."

He noted that the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) officially announced 2021 as the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables with the idea to improve healthy and sustainable food production through innovative technology, and reduce food loss.Despite obstacles like Covid-19 and heavy rains, horticulture production was better last year. This only indicates that more farmers, mostly in Rayalaseema and upland areas of Krishna and Guntur districts, are shifting to horticulture, he observed.APSAM vice-chairman said more markets need to be explored when there is an increase in production so as to ensure that the farmers do not suffer losses.As domestic consumption cant continue to be a target, focus is on supply to other States. Apart from exploiting those markets, the horticulture department has been asked to ensure smoother and faster transportation and minimal paperwork, given the goods are perishable. To promote the horticulture produce from the State, representatives will be deployed in different markets, he added.At the same time, efforts to promote better quality produce with good demand through extension activities from horticulture and research institutions are underway.Fruits produced in 2019-20 (in lakh MT)Banana 62.97, mango 50.76, orange 22.41, papaya 18.08, lemon 6.57, muskmelon 4.05 , watermelon 3.74, guava 3.3Vegetables produced (in lakh MT)Tomato 26.67, onion 9.8, green chilli, cucumber 8.69, brinjal 4.32, bhendi 3.32"

Mira said she uses the pack as a remedy for zits or muddy skin. I like to mix a pinch of haldi and little bit of honey  please ensure that the honey is pure.DIY facialI have never actually gotten a facial, Mira revealed. In fact, instead of going for bridal facial for her wedding, she applied a chironji (cuddapah almond) scrub, mixed with masoor dal and milk, on her body, every single day. The scrub is good for removing dead skin.Mira also shared her go-to DIY facial routine  first, she applies lemon juice on her face. After removing it, she applies a mask made with besan (gram flour) and curd. To this mixture, you can also add other ingredients; Mira, for instance, adds orange peel powder, moringa powder, neem powder, and so on. Once the mask is semi-dry, rub your skin gradually to remove it.Following the mask, she puts tomato juice on her face. Cut a tomato and apply it straight on your face. Leave it for another 10-12 minutes and then remove.The facial routine is completed with aloe vera, which has many benefits for the skin. I like to do this once in two weeks because it does take quite a bit of time.Raw milk face packI have seen my mom putting raw milk on her face ever since I can remember. It is her go-to remedyfor sunburn, uneven tan, your skin is feeling dry. Mira explained how her mother takes raw milk in a bowl and dabs it on her face with cotton, a method she follows as well.

Wondering how it works? Read on.How does GM diet promise?GM diet is known to have been formulated in General Motors Corp in 1987, to tackle weight and health issues faced by its employees. It was field-tested at John Hopkins Research Centre and then approved for distribution by the board of directors of GM Corp.According to gmdiet.in, the diet plan works on providing simple nutrients to burn calories than adding further to your body, on a seven-day schedule which would enable weight loss, body detox and giving body cleansing benefits too. The diet claims to focus on eating wisely rather than starving.GM diet menuGM diet can be both vegetarian and non-vegetarian  while the diet remains the same for both groups on the first four days, it changes as per ones food preferences on day 5,6 and 7. Heres a brief look at the diet plan:On day 1, you can eat sweets and tangy fruits like melons, to keep you full for a long time. Other fruits include strawberries, apples, watemelon, and cantaloupe.Also Read | Have you heard of cookie diet?

A clinical dietitian answersIs GM diet sustainable?This diet plan involves the consumption of low-calorie or negative-calorie foods which provide fewer calories than they take to digest, thereby promoting weight loss. Besides, it emphasises drinking water which helps detoxify the body. But like most other fad diets, experts are divided in their opinion about whether this diet plan is sustainable.According to medicalnewstoday.com, the diet lacks essential vitamins and minerals that come with eating a variety of healthy foods daily. Besides, most days of the entire diet plan provide low amounts of protein, which, researchers argue, can decrease appetite and promote weight loss.Moreover, the diet can only lead to temporary weight loss. Once the GM diet plan is over, it is likely that you would regain weight once you resume your normal diet, according to Healthline.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"

While most farmers then decided to remain put at the borders  saying authorities wanted to push them into a corner  about 400 eventually moved to the Burari ground.Pointing to a volleyball net tied between a branch and a tent, Jagdeep Singh (24) from Punjabs Faridkot said on Tuesday, A sewadar from Delhi donated this net to us 10 days ago. Since then, some of us gather to play in the evenings. Farmers cannot sit idle, it is in our blood to do something productive. For the same reason, a number of older farmers decided to make use of the land and grow a few vegetables.Rows of 12-day-old onion plants are being cultivated not far from the 40 tractors at the site. Said Gurudev Singh Manga (42): They will take around 60 days to start yielding onions. It is symbolic of the fact that we will not move from here anytime soon.Gurudev and others from Ropar district in Punjab reached the site in the last week of November: We keep visiting Singhu and Tikri, but we will not go anywhere as it is easier to march to Delhi from here.At another corner of the site, Jaskaran Singh Kahan (58) and his family from Firozpur tend to the rows of corn, spinach, tomato and onion: There are 15 corn trees and two rows each of other vegetables. Once it becomes a bit warmer, we will grow rice and a few more vegetables. That way, we do not have to depend on resources from outside.He added that some were grown from leftover vegetables, while some seeds and plants were purchased from a nursery nearby. He said that they will be grown organically as the quality of the mud is good.While sporadic rains have been a boon for these crops, they have posed a new set of challenges. Many farmers dug trenches around their tents and tractors when they were expecting rain so water wouldnt accumulate where they sleep.For others, who have set up bigger tents with cloth on the ground, this was not an option. Pinderjeet Kaur (32), who joined her father-in-law at the protest, came to Delhi in a private vehicle along with her husband and two children. She said, Ten of us, including the children, sleep on three mattresses, which are now wet because of the rain the roof of the tents keep flying at night as well. She said nobody has given them a fresh set of mattresses and that they would have to wait for them to dry.Meanwhile, groups of farmers worked through the day to set up sheds for the two langars at the site. Jaspaal Singh (58) from Faridkot said a number of items come in from Singhu and Tikri borders. When we need something, we tap our networks there. Apart from that, people from Delhi come to our aid. The day it rained, a few sewadaars came and gave us material to set up tents, including asbestos, logs of wood, nails and hammers.As the evening set in, both langars had been sheltered from the drizzle, and farmers said they no longer had to worry about cooking in the rain."

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry. Simmer till it thickens and the oil separates. Serve with hot rice.(With inputs from Meghna Majumdar)"

But going just by the looks of it may prove fatal considering the extent of spurious food that have made their way into the open markets, particularly from Cuttack. The recent raids by the Commissionerate Police are a pointer to the volume of fake and sub-standard food items laced with chemicals flooding the markets.What are you consuming?From ghee, honey, turmeric and chilli powders to tomato sauce and soya chunks, the food adulteration network runs deep. The products are prepared using harmful chemicals, colours and sold to unsuspecting consumers at cheaper rates. A report suggests that spurious ghee is a heady mix of palm oil, vanaspati and yellow chemical colour; honey is prepared using water, sugar and chemical colour. For turmeric powder, the adulterators use waste rice powder and non-edible synthetic yellow colour.The list does not end here. Soya chunks are prepared using flour and ammonium bicarbonate (a levelling agent) that makes the dough light and airy besides, chilli powder is laced with non-edible aniline dyes. The innocuous ketchups that go into your noodles, rolls and fast food are prepared using cheap red, orange and green colours along with a mixture of pumpkin, potato and tomato paste. These sauces are easily available in the market and commonly used by street food vendors.Capital Hospitals Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (FMT) consultant Dr LK Behera says adulterated food can cause serious health hazards and lead to diseases like cancer. Turmeric is often adulterated by mixing wood powder and can cause obstruction in the intestine while chemicals in food products can cause cancer, gastroenteritis, liver and skin diseases, and others, he says.Profits First, Health SecondThe trade of spurious food is booming and food adulterators make a profit of 200 per cent (pc) through the illegal trade as cost of production is cheap.For example, production cost of a kg of refined honey is Rs 200 but that of adulterated honey is only Rs 40 which though sells for Rs 140 per kg in the market, says a report by Commissionerate Police. Whereas pure honey costs Rs 300 a kg and has a profit margin of 15 pc, sale of spurious honey brings 100 pc profit.Similarly, production of branded and popular tomato or chilli sauce would cost Rs 120 per kg but the spurious and low-quality costs only Rs 30. The genuine sauce costs Rs 160 per kg having a profit margin of 20 pc but the fake one is sold at Rs 70 per kg with an 80 pc profit margin.The production cost of pure turmeric and chilli powders is Rs 150 per kg and adulterated is Rs 70 per kg. Unadulterated turmeric and chilli powders are available for Rs 260 per kg with a profit margin of 20 pc and the spurious powders are sold for Rs 120 per kg having a profit margin of about 60 pc.Similarly, adulteration of clarified butter or ghee is equally profitable with the unscrupulous elements earning 40 pc profit from the business. Production of ghee costs Rs 300 per kg and a kg of the spurious stock can be prepared with just Rs 80. Pure ghee is available in the market between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the spurious counterpart is available at Rs 150 a kg.When it comes to soybeans, production cost is Rs 60 per kg as compared to Rs 30 per kg for the unadulterated item. Soybeans are sold for Rs 80 per kg in the market with 15 pc profit margin as compared to Rs 50 for the adulterated product having 40 pc profit margin. Its the high profit margin which drives these spurious food manufactures to sustain, says Cuttack DCP Prateek Singh who has gone after the adulterators in his area of operation.The Market & ConsumersThe recent raids show food adulteration mafia operates mostly out of Cuttack city and Jagatpur which are hubs of manufacturing consumer goods besides outskirts of the Millennium City where they can remain low-profile. The businesses have been flourishing as surveillance by Cuttack district administration as well as the municipal corporation is next to nothing.The consumer base, though, is spread across the region and food class. Much of the low-standard food is consumed by caterers which use the cost advantage to save on spending. Fast food makers are a big consumer base too as they pay little attention to health and hygiene; nor do their buyers.These manufacturers also focus on suburban and rural landscape of neighbouring districts where quality of packaged food is never under scrutiny due to poor surveillance of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, says an officer.Last year, Commissionerate Police alone registered 21 cases against production of adulterated food items and arrested 25 persons arrested while seizing goods worth over Rs 7.36 crore. This means the overall business of such spurious food manufacturers run into tens of crores rupees across the State, just going by the volume exposed by Twin City Police.Intensifying SurveillanceThe raids have led to alarm but also brought relief from people in general that adulterated food is being obliterated from the markets. Locals have urged police to continue raids at food manufacturing units to arrest the menace. Surveillance is the need of the hour, they said. Apparently, such illegal units continue to thrive due to complacence of the municipal corporations and district administrations. Consider this: Odisha scored only 53.15 pc in Food Safety and Standards Authority of Indias second State Food Safety Index in 2019-20.This index is based on performance of the State on five significant parameters - human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing (infrastructure and surveillance), training and capacity building, and consumer empowerment. The Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model that provides an objective framework for evaluating food safety across all States/UTs. FSSAI states that states scoring below 60 pc score need a push.Keep an Eye on PricesCuttack-Bhubaneswar Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi has urged citizens to not compromise with price while buying food items as adulterated products cost less in open markets. People must inform police if they find the price of a food product to be surprisingly low.Our raids will continue so that health is not a casualty. We have also requested Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the land allotment of the units found to be involved in manufacturing adulterated food items and take necessary action against them, said Sarangi.Food adulteration is conducted to alter the taste and quantity and can have serious impacts on an individuals health. People must be alert, Dr Behera cautions."

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack.

(Representational)The Trump administration announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from western Chinas Xinjiang region on Wednesday over allegations that they are made with forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims.U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the order applies to raw fibers, apparel and textiles made from Xinjiang-grown cotton, as well as canned tomatoes, sauces, seeds and other tomato products from the region, even if processed or manufactured in third countries.Read | How China won Trumps trade war and got americans to foot the billThe agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), estimates that about $9 billion of cotton products and $10 million worth of tomato products were imported from China into the United States in the past year.DHS acting deputy secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli told a news briefing the order sends a message to importers that DHS will not tolerate forced labor of any kind and companies should eradicate Xinjiang products from their supply chains.The move is the latest by the Trump administration in its final days to harden the U.S. position against Beijing, erecting economic penalties that would make it more difficult for President-elect Joe Biden to ease U.S.-China tensions after he takes office on Jan. 20.In December, Congress passed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which assumes that all goods manufactured in Xinjiang are made with forced labor and therefore banned, unless CBP certifies otherwise.Read | Uighur exploitation in China slammed as modern day slaverySecretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his final days in office, has been weighing a determination as to whether forced labor in Xinjiang constitutes an atrocity or labeling it genocide, which analysts say would have significant implications for relations with China.The region wide import ban follows a move to block cotton imports from Chinas largest producer, the military-linked Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).Both will have a big impact on cotton production in Xinjiang, which produces as much as 20% of the worlds supply of the commodity.Cotton futures prices fell slightly on Wednesday, but traders attributed the drop to profit-taking after prices hit a two year high on a U.S. production outlook cut.CBP officials said some 43 shipments of cotton-based products have been detained at U.S. entry ports since the XPCC ban was announced.The U.S. apparel industry had previously criticized a broad ban as impossible to enforce. On Tuesday, a coalition of apparel and retail groups said in a joint statement that members were working to push forced labor from their supply chains but hoped to work with CBP to make sure that enforcement is smart, transparent, targeted and effective.The United Nations cites what it says are credible reports that 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work in Xinjiang and faith leaders, activist groups and others have said crimes against humanity, including genocide, are taking place.China denies mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.The Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement the forced labor issue was a political lie and vowed to take actions to safeguard the rights of its companies.The U.S. side resorts to pressure, sanctions and other means to suppress Xinjiang enterprises and undercut Xinjiangs stability, development and prosperity, the statement said."

Cauliflower, for instance, is selling at Rs 3.50 per kg at the weekly markets and mandis and tomato for as low as Rs 10 per kg.This is because many Haryana farmers are selling their produce directly in the Gurgaon mandis instead of the main market at Delhis Ghazipur. Since several roads are blocked in the national capital, it has been difficult for them to reach Ghazipur, from where their produce is routed to states like UP, Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan. But with truck movement severely disrupted because of the blockades  the UP Gate protest site is, in fact, right next to the Ghazipur mandi  farmers are opting to sell their produce in Gurgaon and cut their losses.In fact, prices of almost all vegetables have come down by 50 to 75% in the past 20 days. Apart from the local vegetable markets, veggies on aggregator apps and in stores inside condominiums have also been selling at a low price.According to farmers, apart from the blocked roads, the absence of a cold storage facility in Gurgaon is forcing them to sell their produce at a lower rate as they are unable to preserve the veggies. Usually farmers from Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Nuh, Jhajjar and other nearby districts of Haryana sell their produce at the Ghazipur mandi. However the blockade of arterial roads has meant that sales of fruits and vegetables have shrunk close to 50% at the capitals wholesale market for over a month now.Sellers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are unable to visit the Ghazipur mandi, which has started to hurt their business. Vegetable sales are 50% less than a month ago, said Anil Yadav, a member of the Azadpur mandi, and wholesaler at the Khandsa mandi in Gurgaon. The detour has increased the transport freight and shortage of trucks has also affected our business. Transportation of onions, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic to north Indian states has come down substantially due to the unavailability of trucks.Rajinder Kumar, a wholesaler, said vegetables are being literally dumped at the Gurgaon mandi. Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring districts were transported to Delhi. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in the mandis there, farmers are dumping the same in the wholesale market in Gurgaon. The current climatic conditions are favourable for vegetables and thus a large number of farmers in the adjoining district have been bringing huge quantities of vegetables to the local markets.The rates of onions and potatoes have also seen a dip, being sold at Rs 25 per kg and Rs 15 per kg, respectively, on Wednesday. The price of radish and carrot is Rs 10 per kg, while peas and pumpkin are being sold for Rs 25.Hemant Kumar, another wholesaler, said he has witnessed this sharp slump in vegetable prices for the first time. Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed. The oversupply in the market is only leading to drop in prices as buyers are less, he said.At present, only 6,000 trucks are moving in and out of Delhi. Earlier this number used to be around a lakh. Not only vegetables, but prices of all essential goods have been impacted, said Rajinder Kapoor, president of Delhi Goods Transport Association.Meanwhile, consumers are a delighted lot. This is the first time that I got five different veggies for less than Rs 40 a kg. I am surprised that I am able to purchase vegetables for such a low price in an expensive city like Gurgaon, said Megha Chawla, a Sector 56 resident."

When the agriculture assistant reported a fall in tomato prices, the marketing department intervened and purchased about 24 tonnes of tomatoes by participating in bidding/auction from December 21 to 28 and when the prices stabilised, the intervention was stopped. Again, a few villages have reported very low tomato prices. Now the marketing department will aggressively participate in the bidding and purchase tomatoes from January 15 onwards, he said."

We can only meet our rent, groceries and loan payments.In a world of near zero inflation and economic fallout from the coronavirus, Turkey stands out with annual consumer prices climbing to 15%, second only to Argentina among emerging markets and by far the highest in the OECD.Rising oil and fertilizer prices and dry weather are part of the reason food inflation jumped more than 20% in a year. But economists also point to government policy decisions which saw the lira dive to record lows last year, hiking import costs on some $9 billion in food.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has reluctantly accepted sharp interest rate hikes that will slow an economic rebound just as COVID-19 vaccines are rolling out.A card showing the price of tomatoes is seen at a local market in Fatih district in Istanbul, Turkey January 13, 2021.

Ive had many sleepless nights (and) in the end I think Ill be unemployed.Hyperinflation dogged Turkey in the 1990s and only ended with an International Monetary Fund programme that tamed prices just as Erdogan came to power in 2003.Inflation, led by food, jumped again in a 2018 currency crisis and has since remained mostly in double-digits. Economists blame a chronic trade imbalance and costly state FX interventions that depleted reserves.Political testA Metropoll survey last month showed 80% believe inflation is higher than the official tally. A separate survey by the Deep Poverty Network showed more than half of respondents in Istanbul relied on food handouts from the municipality.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican Peoples Party, said the situation was getting worse. There had not been hunger in Turkey before. But hunger is the reality now.In a turnaround, Erdogan in November said even bitter pills like high rates were needed to cool prices. Lutfi Elvan, his new finance minister, said he would take structural steps to fight inflation, which is expected to edge higher until April.The government has several levers it can pull to ease pressure on the public. Ankara has already cut taxes on tobacco, which weighs heavily in the consumer price index (CPI), even while it raised duties on alcohol and road tolls which have less impact on the headline number.State agencies also set the price of utilities such as natural gas and electricity. Last month the government raised the minimum wage by a net 16% for 2021, to 2,825 lira ($377) a month, in a boost to workers but also to overall CPI.You cannot solve the food problem with interest rates, Gizem Oztok Altinsac, chief economist at Turkeys top business organisation TUSIAD, told a conference last week.Our problem with inflation is too big so we have to take more targeted steps to solve it."

While many farmers had to restart cultivation as their crops were inundated, shortage of labour has left the farmers in the lurch. There are around six lakh small to medium scale farmers in Prakasam who do not have the capacity to afford mechanisation, thereby forcing them to completely depend on labour for their cultivation. With paddy ready for harvest and crops like chilli, bengal gram, cotton and tobacco needing a lot of work to be done like clearing the weed, spraying fertilisers and watering, the farmers remained a worried lot.Most farm labourers have become construction workers and auto drivers. As workers are demanding high wages and work timings on par with the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), the farmers are not able to hire them Tata Krishna Rao, a farmer having around 3.5 acres of wetland in Gadiparthi Vari Palem in Cheemakurthy mandal, has cultivated paddy and green gram. I have spent around `1.2 lakh on my paddy crop. Though, I am ready to provide breakfast, tea and snacks along with a daily wage of `200, farmhands refused to come for work. I had to employ six women from neighbouring villages, as local labourers are not available and have been demanding high wages, Krishna Rao lamented.While the farmers are worried over giving high wages to workers, labourers said they have benefitted a lot from the NREGA. Chillaka Suseelamma, a farmhand leader from Darsi constituency, said NREGA has enabled them to earn good wages. We must thank the government for bringing the NREGA. Now, we get paid a minimum of `250 to `300 per day. We start work by around 9 am and finish by around 5 pm. This is in stark contrast to what we were earning and working earlier. There is a huge demand for us now as agriculture works are in full swing, she explained.M Narayana, a farmer from Inkollu mandal, had to employ labourers from nearby villages as workers in his village expressed their unavailability on the same dates. We lost chilli crop in around 1.5 acres due to Cyclone Nivar and later we sowed vegetables like tomatoes, ladys finger, brinjal, bottle guard and snake guard. For this, we had to depend on people outside our village. This puts an additional financial burden on us as we have to pay `100 extra to them towards travelling charges. Now, we requested our neighbouring farmers to extend a helping hand in our farm and we will reciprocate the same whenever they need. Luckily, they obliged, Narayana told TNIE.P Venkata Rao, District Rythu Sangham leader said that labour shortage is increasing gradually as a number of people are moving to nearby towns or cities in search of better livelihood. However, at present, farmhands are also getting a good remuneration when compared to olden days. Paddy harvest works, tobacco leaf grading work, cutting of chilli, cotton collection, weighing and packing works have become expensive for small-scale farmers as they cant afford to go for complete mechanisation and they are hit hard as they depend on manual labour, he reasoned."

The first farm by Simply Fresh was at Shameerpet. This rainwater harvesting pit and the water processing plant meets the farms irrigation needs up to nine months.While passing through the sleepy village with colourful wooden-framed mud houses and an enormous swamp, one would not expect to encounter a hydroponic farm at the end. The staff at Simply Fresh however takes pride in calling the farm a sustainable food factory. Sachin Darbarwar, the CEO and founder, asserts that Simply Fresh is Indias largest plant factory. Since its inception in 2013, the company that gave Hyderabad and the F&B industry fresh salad leaves  right from red romaine to rocket leaves  cherry tomatoes, jalapenos and crunchy fruity peppers, has now forayed into raw material (medicinal plants) for nutraceuticals (medicinal food products).Sachin says, In a country like ours, where we have scarcity of water especially for agricultural use, we can reduce our water consumption drastically by up to 1/10th of the traditional farming water consumption by using hydroponic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. While we sold our fresh produce like a range of lettuces, vine crops, leafy greens and fresh herbs, we dedicated a section of our farm for research and development of medicinal plants. We were not ready to approach any pharmaceutical company till we were satisfied with the products and the nutrient contents in them. After our medicinal plants were lab tested, we found the medicinal produce grown hydroponically have three times more alkaloid content than field-grown plants. And, we started marketing it.The list of medicinal plants grown by Simply Fresh for nutraceutical extracts includes high curcumin content turmeric, ashwagandha, ginger, safed, musli, shatavari, bacopa, Centella asiatica, holy basil, Gymnema sylvestre and Phyllanthus amarus. These serve as raw material for nutraceutical companies. We did R&D for rare and different species with the motive of conservation through cultivation. Having met the standards of the nutraceutical companies, and complied with the rules, we have started contract farming for a few, informs Sachin.The agricultural scientists at the farm inform they have combined hydroponic soil-less farming with AI technology, making it more effective. Chief scientific officer Satya Prasad explains, Factors like crop profiling  analysing seeds for better germination, measuring nutrient requirement of plants along with automated AI-controlled greenhouses for maintaining an ideal environment for plants are all done using AI technology. Our greenhouses are digitally controlled by an AI platform called Farm in A Box (FiAB), which determines and detects climate conditions and requirements for the plants and alters the environment to suit their needs."

A Bhuj-based farmer has successfully grown the crunchy, non-spicy bell peppers or capsicum adopting Israels poly-greenhouse method.Haresh Thacker is also expecting a bumper crop of the easy-to-cook hollow chilli   shimla mirch   otherwise a cold season crop.In major parts of the country, capsicum is grown as a winter crop as it requires low temperature while in hilly terrains it is grown during summers. But Thacker chooses a period between winter and summer so that the crop can be harvested from mid-February to summer-end.Thacker has grown the red and yellow varieties of capsicum in one acre land in Bhujs Reldi village where the crop is grown in a controlled environment using a fan and pad to get the desired temperature.I covered the entire field with seven layers of plastic and put China-imported pads inside them. Like in air coolers, these pads work as heat absorbers. I have also installed fans to provide cooling to the 4,000 m area, explained Thacker.As the exhaust fans throw heat outside the poly-greenhouse, it chills in just ten minutes.This crop requires a natural temperature of 25 degree Celsius during day and below 20 degree Celsius during night time. Fortunately, the entire machinery works automatically. When room temperature goes beyond 30 degrees, the machinery starts cooling by its own. I manage temperature during winter as required, he said.The farmer is expecting cash-rich bumper crop. Although a winter crop, it remains in demand throughout the year in hotels and restaurants that serve pizzas, Punjabi recipes, Mexican dish varieties. In fact, to get a good price, I have decided to harvest this crop from March to June which is the peak marriage season and produce from other states gets scarce and costly, he said.Thacker is expecting anywhere between Rs 150 to Rs 200 per kg for his 40 tonne-estimated yield by June-end. The one-time cost for adopting this technology and seedlings comes to nearly Rs 55 lakh per acre.Farmers income will only increase when they will grow new crop varieties. If all farmers grow tomatoes or dates, it will result in bumper crop. When they dont get good price, it results in wastage, he said.Capsicum requires huge investment. Growing colourful varieties of bell peppers is very difficult in Kutchs environment. So, not many farmers prefer this crop, said K P Sojitra, deputy director of horticulture Kutch."

The venue and dates of the fest will be declared soon. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has held meetings for assigning roles of agriculture, horticulture, culture, tourism departments, Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi Municipal Corporation and Varanasi Development Authority. We will rope in hotels, restaurants, chefs and housewives.District horticulture officer Sandeep Kumar Gupta said, Tomato and onion are two vegetable that witness massive price fluctuation. When the prices start rising, there is massive hue and cry. But, mostly the price of tomato doesnt rise and farmers are compelled to sell it for Rs 3-Rs 10 per kg. Risk for tomato growers is also high as it is perishable and cant be stored for long.As per rough estimates, tomato is cultivated in over 5,000 hectare in Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Naugarh belt of Chandauli, Ghazipur and Varanasi, and on an average 350 quintal of hybrid tomato is produced per hectare, said Gupta.It is a good move of the government and will help increase local and industrial consumption of tomato which will ensure good price round the year, he added.The fest will help farmers understand the requirements of hospitality and industrial sectors and the varieties of tomatoes best suited for them.Gaurav Garg, the chief executive officer of the event management company assigned this fest, said, It will be a good event. Housewives and master chefs will be participating and cooking their own dishes, while hotels, restaurants and vendors will also showcase their tomato-based food, drink and dessert items. The event will focus on attracting agro industries. There will also be fun and entertainment as renowned musical bands will perform at the fest."

Agriculture officer makes it possible,"Anilkumar T ByExpress News ServiceKOCHI: Now, those engaging in growbag farming neednt any longer bother about the poor yield mainly attributed to the poor quality of red topsoil used for the purpose. John Sherry, assistant director, Farm Information Bureau, Ernakulam, came up with a novel idea of soilless farming. He said rice husk and rice husk ash can be used as substitute for red soil. Sherry, who took up soilless farming during the initial days of the lockdown on an experimental basis, has cultivated several vegetables  snake guard, tomatoes, chilly, capsicum and ridge gourd  in 27 growbags on his rooftop near Thoppumpady.Growbags potting mixture is prepared and filled with red topsoil, sand and organic fertilisers. But often crops fail to give enough yield because of poor soil. As a remedy, I tried rice husk as an alternative. Compared to the traditional method of farming, the potting mixture prepared with husk and organic manure provides good yield in growbags, said Sherry. According to the agriculture officer, complaints from rooftop farmers forced him to find a solution.The quality of seed and the soil medium is the determining factor of yield. If the farmer uses low-quality soil, the yield will be poor and chances of crop damage are high. But rice husks chemical composition consists mainly of silica, ash, carbon calcium and magnesium.It gives good strength to the plant. Growbag gets better root growth and better yield as it gets more ventilation. Pest infestation can be reduced to a great extent. Moreover, vegetables have longer shelf life, said Sherry, who has over eight years experience in growbag farming. He has already started educating growbag farmers on the new farming method."
2021-02-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/kerala-food-in-delhi/article33827475.ece,"In Delhi, Kannur’s on my mind","Malayali food is now available across the city, and here are the basic foods to start off withIve been dreaming of a good Kerala meal for a while now. If all goes well, I hope to have a satiating Vishu feast in a couple of months at my Malayali friends place. Since sadhya is usually vegetarian, I thought I should, meanwhile, make the most of some fluffy appam and chicken stew. I went to the net and found that there were two new Kerala restaurants in my neighbourhood. I decided that Id try both out.The first was Kannur (Ph: 8750483283), and the second Mariyan (Ph: 8447127533), both in Mayur Vihar Phase III. From Kannur, I ordered some parottas (10 each), chicken curry (120), buffalo meat fry (120), tomato fry (50) and (by mistake) kadhai paneer (140). With taxes and delivery charges, the bill came to about 660.From Mariyan, a few days later, we asked for the Mariyan Special Chettinad chicken curry (180)  though this is not from Kerala  buff meat dry fry (160) and appam (12 each).On the two menus are also dishes such as vegetable korma, kadala curry, egg roast, biryani and various kinds of fish preparations.I love both parottas and appams. Kannurs parottas were flaky and crisp. I had one with the chicken curry gravy, which was nicely spicy, and the tomato fry, which was rather interesting  tart, but not overly so. Even though the paneer was not on my list, it turned out to be pretty good: the pieces were soft, and the gravy was thick and creamy.I was looking forward to the buffalo meat fry, but that sorely disappointed me. I tried out a piece when it arrived, and found it much too hard. So I pressure cooked it a bit, but even then it was too chewy. I had thought Id have one parotta with the meat fry, but after bravely struggling with the meat, I gave up.Appam | Photo Credit: iStockphotoMariyans buffalo meat fry, however, was delicious. It was a bit different from the ones that Ive had over the years. For one, it didnt have the little coconut bits that the Kannur buff had (I really enjoy the fried coconut in this dish). Second, the meat had been cut into strips, like small fish fingers. And the pieces had been dredged with corn flour and masalas, and then fried. It had a heady flavour of garlic, and the cornflour gave it an enjoyable crunch.The Chettinad chicken curry was delicious, too. The gravy was thick and had a coconutty taste, while the meat was so tender that it fell off the bone. I had the curry with two appams (which, despite the 6-odd-kilometre journey, were fluffy and soft when I had them for dinner). I missed not having parottas with the buffalo meat.Well, that can soon be remedied; all that I need to do is make a call. I am glad I have these small Kerala eateries in my neighbourhood. There was a time, not so long ago, when I used to comb the areas around hospitals in search of good Kerala food. Hospitals meant staffers from Kerala, which, in turn, translated into good regional food. Now, these eateries can be found in all parts of Delhi. Namaskaram, I say to them.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

The young chef, despite being at the venue, probably missed the highlight of the day... but he isnt complaining. For, he successfully managed to feed nearly 25,000 people over two weeks at his popup restaurant at Melbourne Park.Interestingly, this tennis extravaganza is also a haven for connoisseurs of good food. Grand Slam Oval features a variety of cuisine that traverses between fine dining and street food. After making his dbut at the event last year, Carrington is back again. In 2020, his menu comprised Mediterranean favourites from his venture LOMAH. This year, his restaurant Atlas Dining will cater at the venue and the focus is on Australian cuisine. Its a lot of fresh produce. The food has got a lot of influence from different countries: Lebanese, Chinese, Indian, Greek..., says Carrington, over a Zoom call from Melbourne.He is bringing in local flavours that translate to a refreshing menu starring Murray cod, Paroo kangaroo, Red Hill apples, pickled beetroot, smoked Holy Goat cheese served with heirloom tomato, and mango sorbet with saffron crumble. This time, given the pandemic, the number of people will be lesser. Carrington will start service on Thursday and is looking at serving 60 guests per day.And do the tennis players also get to grab a bite at his popup? No, its just the spectators. The players are too busy eating fish and salad, he laughs. In addition, Carrington is also doing an Atlas Master Class. We are sending out ingredient boxes and uploading videos on our YouTube channel. We have uploaded three videos with tennis player Sam Groth. I was in the kitchen with him and we made three Australian dishes. I will be very honoured if some people in India, watching this, would want to make one of our Australian dishes, he says.Carringtons cooking style is influenced by his incredible travel experiences. So far, he has travelled to 13 countries to learn more about its food, recipes, cooking styles. I spend two weeks in a country, go to markets, talk to people. He was in India last March, scouring the city of Mumbai that inspired him with its street food and ingredients. Once the pandemic situation sorts out worldwide, he plans to pick up from where he left off: India; he wants to head back and go to Goa and Kerala.Watch Australian Open 2021 live on Sony Pictures Sports Networks"

While a kilogram of drumstick at Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC) costs Rs 120, curry leaves was sold at Rs 60 a kg. Traders attributed the unprecedented increase to a drop in arrivals to the market.V R Soundararajan, a former member of the market management committee of KWMC and a wholesale trader, said unseasonal rain damaged crops, resulting in short supply and price rise. Harvest and ,in turn, arrivals to Chennai, have reduced. I havent seen such high prices sustain in the wholesale market in the past. Wholesale cost of curry leaves has never exceeded Rs 30 per kilogram, he said.Curry leaves, which cost Rs 80/kg last week, will be sold for Rs 60 this week. The Rs 20 drop was due to a dip in sales, Soundararajan said. Koyambedu market sources curry leaves from Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district and parts of Andhra Pradesh.Cost of drumstick too has reduced by Rs 20 and will cost Rs 120 a kg this week. The market currently gets only 100 tonnes of drumstick a day, 50% of the daily average of 200 tonnes of drumstick supplied usually. The highest the vegetable cost all of last year was Rs 60/kg and at times, dropped to Rs 15/kg. Its cost is likely to stabilise in April, when fresh yield is expected to hit the market, he added.On the other hand, costs of other vegetables barring shallots continue to remain stable. Shallots cost Rs 80/kg this week, Rs 20 more than last week. While staples potato and tomato are expected to cost Rs 20-Rs 25, grade I onions will cost Rs 40/kg."

Chandrasekhar Rao announced that the government would not buy the crop from the next season. Is it due to the new farm laws, he asked the CM to clarify. He said his meeting with farmers throughout the State was to understand their fears and raise it in the Assembly seeking answers from the government.Mr. Vikramarka alleged that both the Central and State governments were terrorising the farmers foisting false cases but the Congress party would support the farmers when they need political support the most.Explaining how lack of government support will hurt the farmers, he said tomato farmers in Narayankhed recently had to throw away their produce due to lack of support price. Neither the traders were willing to buy nor the government was helping and they just threw away the produce on the roads.He said both Narendra Modi and KCR were together in cheating the farmers to ensure their crony capitalists benefited. He said BJP was a party of businessmen and Prime Minister Modi was working for Ambani and Adani and such groups at the cost of common man. He said the farm laws will not only harm the farmers but also the consumers at the end of the chain.MLA D.

2021-02-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sukhpal-singh-interview-contract-farming-7191898/,Dr Sukhpal Singh: ‘Land leasing provisions under present laws worry farmers the most’,"Despite having three sets of contract farming laws being enacted in the past less than two decades, including the 2020 Act, the basic fear among the farmers is that their land will be snatched by companies with whom they enter into contract. Government, however, claims that farmers land is protected under provisions of the new Act.An expert on contract farming, Dr Sukhpal Singh, Professor, Centre for Management in Agriculture (CMA), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, having an experience around 3-decade on CF, shares his views on the farmers fear, why contract farming is needed but not a successful operation and how a small farmer can use it to enhance his income. Excerpts from his interview with The Indian Express.Why is contract farming needed?For contracting agencies, contract farming (CF) is the only alternative to buying from APMC mandi or private wholesale market, or buying directly from farmers without contract, as corporate farming (wherein corporate agencies undertake farming operations on owned or leased land for their consumptive use or for commercial purpose) option is not available in India. This is so because under the Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, non-agriculturists cant own agricultural land, and under the Land Leasing Act, cant even lease in agricultural land, both Acts being at the state level.So, if a company wants to procure desired quality raw material or farm produce in adequate quantity at reasonable cost which may not be available in the open market or sometimes not even grown by farmers e.g. processing variety (chips grade) potatoes in India before the Pepsi came in, then CF was the only option in India which Pepsi used.But, many times, corporate farming even if allowed, is not a viable option given that we are in the age of vertical coordination (buying from others) rather than vertical integration (making in-house). For farmers, CF can bring benefits of not only assured market and price but also new technology, seeds, extension, diversification and such other non-price benefits.Dr Sukhpal Singh, contract farming expert Dr Sukhpal Singh, contract farming expertWhen was contract farming started in India, Punjab?Contract Farming has been in practice in India since the 1960s in the seed sector wherein both public and private entities have been using this mechanism to get certified seed produced, and in other farm produce in many states like Punjab and Haryana since the 1990s with the PepsiCo undertaking tomato, chilly and potato contract farming. Pepsi was brought in for attempting crop diversification when contract farming was not even legal in India.When were the first rules governing CF framed?CF has been permitted in most states as per the model APMC Act 2003 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare (MoAFW) wherein three new channels of farm produce buying and selling i.e. direct purchase, contract farming and private wholesale market were made legal, which most states adopted in a few years, with the exception of one or two states, and later, under the separate model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation, APLCF&S (P&F)) Act, 2018. Punjab was the only state which, in 2013, framed a separate Act on contract farming instead of providing for it under the APMC Act which it had not amended adequately until 2017. However, a separate Contract Farming Act was never operationalised, and it was also not needed as all other states had provided for CF under the APMC Act itself.How has been the experience of CF so far?There is a widespread practice of contract farming across crops, states and agencies (public, private and multinational) in India covering dozens of crops and livestock products with hundreds of contract farming projects or schemes, for domestic processing or for export, and there have been dozens of studies over the last 20 years on its performance and experience.Default by both sides (companies and farmers) has been an issue and contract farmers in various parts of India have faced many problems like undue quality cut on produce or no procurement of produce, delayed deliveries at the factory, delayed payments, low price, poor quality inputs, no compensation for crop failure and even stagnation of contract prices over time, besides contract agreements being in favour of the contracting agencies. Also, the exclusion of small holders remains a key challenge as contracting agencies prefer larger farmers to reduce their transaction costs. Further, contract production of the same crop is generally higher cost than open market production as certain recommended practices have to be followed as far as input use and crop management is concerned which also leads to resource constrained small producers being excluded. The companies also put minimum land and other resources as the criteria for farmers being eligible to produce under contract.If contract farming has not been successful in areas, what have been the reasons?Poor regulation and lack of an enabling policy are the major reasons. There is no policy to support smallholder inclusion e.g. lower cost credit or encouragement to group contracts. Thailand had used CF as a mechanism to achieve agricultural development by including it in their 5-year plans and then bringing state support like extension and credit for making it spread across crops and farmers besides promoting group, not individual, contracts.Now that there have been three sets of Acts including two independent Acts on it (the central Act 2020, Model CF Act 2018 and APMC Act 2003), why are farmers still worried about their land being snatched by the sponsors. Is their fear genuine?It is land leasing under CF laws which worries farmers the most. The model APMC Act 2003 had protected farmer land clearly. Even if famer committed default, the contracting agency could not lay claims to farmer land or other assets. But, since the model ALPCF&S (P&F) Act, 2018, the land leasing has been made part of the contract farming definition which is not correct as contract farming can never include land leasing. This is one of the reasons for fear among farmers.The 2020 Act protects farmers land when it states in Section 14: No farming agreement shall be entered into for the purpose of (a) any transfer, including sale, lease or mortgage of the land or premises of the farmer. But, some other provisions are at a departure from this provision. For example, the dispute resolution section clause 14(7) states: The amount payable under any order passed by the Sub-Divisional Authority or the Appellant Authority, as the case may be, may be recovered as arrears of land revenue. However, then again, it states in the next clause (15), Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14, no action for recovery of any amount in pursuance of an order passed under this section, shall be initiated against the agricultural land of the farmer.But, still it means it can be recovered from other assets and properties of the farmer.The biggest problem is that in the 2020 CF Act, contract farming has been mixed up with corporate farming. Land Leasing Acts at the state level are still intact though may not remain for long going by what Karnataka, Rajasthan and Punjab are planning in terms of opening up land lease markets. The way production agreement is defined also raises doubts whether land leasing is also a part of contract farming. The mix up between contract and corporate farming in the Act is so significant that the Rajasthan Amendment Bill, 2020 assumes that leasing is a part of contract farming.How can farmers land remain safe under CF?For safety of farmer land ownership under CF, it is important to exclude land leasing from the definition of contract and it should be written clearly in the Act that no recoveries other than from farm produce can be made from famers even if they default.How can a farm friendly CF model be achieved which can help small farmers in an effective manner to enhance their income?Better and more effective regulation is the first step to protect famer interest and to ensure that they benefit from contract farming engagement. Further, since Indian farmers are mostly marginal or small, they cant deal with large buyers on their own even if they are brought under contract farming by some companies. Therefore, group contracts should be encouraged by policy incentives to make the mechanism inclusive and effective for farmers. The government can facilitate such contracts through credit and extension support to such small farmer groups like in Thailand. Also, we have thousands of Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) now which are very business-like entities of farmers and they can play a role in making contract farming deliver the objectives of farmer income enhancement by facilitating contract farming with smallholders, and also undertaking contract farming on their own. But, these entities have been treated as farmers in the Act despite the fact that no FPC undertakes production. They should have been defined as sponsors in the agreement as they do buy from their members and non-members and also undertake or facilitate contract farming. They should have been given better treatment in the new Acts.Finally, the 2020 CF Act has left the very basic aspects of CF like acreage, quantity and quality, timing and place of delivery besides price for the contracting parties to decide for inclusion into the CF agreement. But, these should have been mandatory aspects of the contract agreement like in the model CF under the model APMC Act of 2003."

Cooked in a robust 22-ingredient masala with bell pepper and tomato-based gravy, the gobhi was spicy and will be specially relished by the Punjabis. The dal was creamy with the required amount of spices. The Mutton Biryani tasted fine but was a dampener for having smaller-thanusual chunks of meat-andbones.However, the unconventional Jalapeno and Cheese Paratha and the Hari Mirch Paratha, complemented the dal and sabzi quite well.

In the past one month, the cost of perishable items has increased. According to traders, the hike in prices cannot be solely attributed to the fluctuating fuel prices. A gap in demand and supply of many items has also added to it.The price of shallots varies based on its quality. The cost of tomatoes has doubled. Earlier, it was around C22 per kg and now the price has crossed C40, said Biju Kumar., who runs a vegetable stall at Palayam market.Mukundesh, another trader at a vegetable shop near Sasthamangalam, said that the supply of many items has come down. The impact of the fuel price hike on essential commodities can be measured only based on the availability of vegetables. Currently, crops are scarce. However, there will be a slight rise in the base value of the commodities, said Mukundesh.Sajila J, a resident, said, The pandemic has wrecked lives and the soaring prices have added to it. Normally, I buy vegetable kits worth Rs 100 which would be sufficient for four days but now the quantity is less.Confra Consumer Forum general secretary M Sashidharan Nair said that lack of market interventions by government agencies is one of the reasons for the uncontrolled price rise. When onion prices were hiked, the government made them available at a subsidised rate. Similar efforts should be taken now, he said.What officials sayHorticorp deputy director(Marketing) Rejatha V said that the department will intervene if onion prices go up. There is a hike in the price of shallots but in Kerala, the consumption of shallots is very less. If onion prices rise, we will intervene.

Foodwrap is a pure vegetarian home catering enterprise that the mother-daughter runs from their home in Jubilee Hills since 2014. This is not just a business, but its our passion project, asserts Abhipsa who quit her job at a call centre to start this kitchen with her mother. And the passion surely transcends into the delicious food that they make. Specialising in Marwari cuisine, giving healthy twists to regular food is what sets them apart.For instance, the Rajkachori that I had was made in fresh, crisp poori stuffed with dhokla made with spinach and topped with sev, coriander and tamarind chutney and curd. The green dhokla gave the chaat a splash of colour and a unique twist to this street-food. Abhipsa says, Some people do not prefer aloo, so we add dhokla.Abhipsa ans Nirmala TulshanThe Marwari lunch that followed was a simple meal that had the quintessential tastes of ghar ka khana, without any added colours, preservatives or extra oil. The paneer badami was not spicy, was a little sweet in light tomato gravy topped with slivers of almonds. It paired well with hara bhara parathas made of wheat. The nutritious rotis were soft and thankfully, not oily. The meal also had a mix of dal chawal  typical tuvar daal in a flavourful tadka mixed with white rice.Two types of home-made pickles  one with red chillies and the other made with potatoes and green peas! Yes, you read right, and it was lip-smacking. Fluffy and tangy dahi vada and gaund laddoo ended the meal. The healthy laddoo made of jaggery had a nice crunch, and we couldnt stop at just one. The USP of our food is that each and every component is made at home and we dont compromise on the quality of the ingredients, shares the duo that runs this with five other staff.Not just sticking to traditional Mawari food, they also make international dishes such as spinach rice with veg augratin, pastas, burgers, etc. On the range of food, she says, We started with daily meals and chaats to fill the gap for good ghar ka khana, which became an instant hit. We moved on to making homemade dry snacks like bhel, jhaal muri, mathris, and flavoured bhujiyas. Abhipsa credits her mother Nirmala for these recipes.Always open to adaptation, she adds, We customise our starters; whip up new dishes and tweak the old ones of my mothers recipes. As they do not have a fixed menu and also do on-site catering, orders have to be placed two days in advance. Food is delivered in leak-proof packaging using local courier services. Going forward, she says, We want to make the best vegetarian dry snacks and home-cooked food, and adds, Happiness is homemade.She can be reached at: abtulshan@gmail.com Tamanna S Mehdi tamanna@newindianexpress.com @tamannamehdi"

Indians rediscover desi fruits,"Chef Dhruv Oberoi has come up with recipes like an amla and strawberry salad and Nilgiri passionfruit cocktail. Photo credit: Dhruv OberoiAmla and strawberry salad , shankalu chaat , guava baked into immunity-boosting pizza bases, tadgola ceviche... Indians are rediscovering local, seasonal fruit like never before, with everyone from top chefs to home chefs and caterers using it in inventive ways.For years, fruit lovers had decried the loss in local varieties as restaurants and homes embraced imported apples, oranges, kiwi et al that were available round the year. Seasonality and local diversity, two cornerstones of Indian farm produce seemed to be getting lost in the process. But post-pandemic, foreign fruit does not command as much a snob value as local desi varieties.At Delhi restaurant Indian Accent, for instance, the flavour of the season seems to be red ber or jujube along with shankalu, a tuber long popular in Bihar and Bengal as the poor mans fruit (since its taste may remind one of a pear), where it is also called mishri kand. Both these ingredients are now going into a new inventive chaat menu by Chef Manish Mehrotra, who recalls eating the tuber and berries bought from the roadside in Patna, where he grew up.In Mumbai, chef Prateek Sadhu of Masque restaurant is experimenting with apricots in his lab, after a visit to Ladakh familiarised him with chulli (the local name for the fruit) which is sundried to preserve it in winter, and reconstituted by boiling in water to create a naturally sweet dessert eaten with ice-cream!Chef Dhruv Oberoi of Olive Bar and Kitchen Delhi says theyve been getting great supplies of seasonal fruit from a number of farms directly which prompted him to come up with some unusual recipes. I have been testing a lot of fruit diversity. Some of the dishes that we have come up with include a shehtoot (mulberry) sauce to go with pork roast and amla (gooseberry) and strawberry salad that is doing really well with guests, says Oberoi, who ferments the amla to enhance its taste.Some of this gravitating towards more local fruit may be a result of greater health consciousness among diners in the wake of the pandemic. Last year, when the pandemic started, people were really seeking things like amla as immunity boosters. Though that phase is over now, perhaps people have learnt to include better quality fresh fruit in their diets in general, says Sneh Yadav of Tijara Farms, whose recent produce of small desi guava and figs sold out in record time. Since we are no longer operating our organic farmers market, we have been supplying these to customers directly, as also products that we make in the farm kitchen like grape panna, Yadav adds.What the pandemic did was also give time to people working from home to go back to the tastes of their childhood. Ankita Chavan, a young chef with The Bombay Canteen , who went back home to Vadodara has been experimenting with dishes such as tadgola (woodapple) ceviche. Now, Chavan and a colleague have teamed up to start their own catering venture where they will travel to different cities for small events.Home cooks, meanwhile, have been unearthing traditional recipes with fruit and posting these on social media, contributing to even more awareness and interest. You may find Bengali classics like Kheer Komola with oranges, an Assamese home-style dish with star fruit and prawns, Aamer luchis (maida puris with mango) and even hyper-local pop dishes such as fruit juice ki subzi, popular apparently in Bhiwani, Haryana. Abhilasha Jain, a Marwari home cook who runs a catering outfit from Gurgaon, has been cooking the latter and describes it as a mix of orange and pomegranate juice with tomatoes, onions and paneer! Whatever your preference, classic or inventive, it is definitely a fruitful time."

Read MoreBEIJING: China, under growing global pressure over its treatment of a Muslim minority in its far west, is mounting an unprecedented and aggressive campaign to push back, including explicit attacks on women who have made claims of abuse.As allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang mount, with a growing number of Western lawmakers accusing China of genocide, Beijing is focussing on discrediting the female Uighur witnesses behind recent reports of abuse.Chinese officials have named women, disclosed what they say is private medical data and information on the women's fertility, and accused some of having affairs and one of having a sexually transmitted disease. The officials said the information was evidence of bad character, invalidating the women's accounts of abuse in Xinjiang.""To rebuke some media's disgusting acts, we have taken a series of measures,"" Xu Guixiang, the deputy head of Xinjiang's publicity department, told a December news conference that was part of China's pushback campaign. It includes hours-long briefings, with footage of Xinjiang residents and family members reading monologues.A Reuters review of dozens of hours of presentations from recent months and hundreds of pages of literature, as well as interviews with experts, shows a meticulous and wide-reaching campaign that hints at China's fears that it is losing control of the Xinjiang narrative.""One reason that the Communist Party is so concerned about these testimonies from women is because it undermines their initial premise for what they're doing there, which is anti-terrorism"", said James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University and expert in Xinjiang policy.""The fact that there are so many women in the camps ... who don't have the faintest appearance of being violent people, this just shows how this has nothing to do with terrorism.""Uighurs make up most of the 1 million people that a United Nations estimate says have been detained in Xinjiang camps under what the central government calls a campaign against terrorism. Accusations by activists and some Western politicians include torture, forced labour and sterilisations.In rare US bipartisan agreement, the top diplomats of the former administration of Donald Trump and the new one of Joe Biden have called China's treatment of the Uighurs genocide, a stance adopted last week by the Canadian and Dutch parliaments.China faces sanctions such as a ban on U.S purchases of Xinjiang cotton and tomatoes, and calls by some Western lawmakers to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. The government denies accusations of abuse at the ""vocational training centres"" in the remote western region, and says claims of systematic sexual abuse are unfounded.Beijing has rejected calls for an independent U.N. investigation into Xinjiang's internment program. Journalists and diplomats have not been permitted access to the camps outside of tightly controlled government tours. Uighurs in Xinjiang have told Reuters they fear reprisals for speaking to press while in China'LIES AND SLANDER'China's tightly controlled, invitation-only media events on Xinjiang require journalists to submit questions days or weeks in advance. They include pre-recorded videos and prepared testimony by former camp inmates and religious figures.Beijing has packaged content from the events in two volumes titled, ""The Truth About Xinjiang: Exposing the US-Led Lies and Slanders About Xinjiang.""In January, the Twitter account of China's US embassy was suspended for a tweet that said Uighur women had been ""baby-making machines"" before Beijing instituted its system of camps.""The biological, the reproductive, the gendered aspect of this is particularly horrifying to the world,"" said Georgetown's Millward. China ""seems to have recognised that... You now see them trying in this clumsy way to respond.""During a regular daily press briefing last week, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin held up images of witnesses who had described sexual abuse in Xinjiang. The account of one of them, he said, was ""lies and rumours"" because she had not recounted the experience in previous interviews. He gave medical details about the woman's fertility.Xinjiang officials in January said a woman who had spoken to foreign media had syphilis, and they showed images of medical records - unsolicited information that was not directly related to her account.A Xinjiang government official said of another witness last month: ""Everyone knows about her inferior character. She's lazy and likes comfort, her private life is chaotic, her neighbours say that she committed adultery while in China.""Last week, the top spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, tweeted images of four named witnesses, saying they had ""raked their brains for lies"", adding ""they will never succeed.""China has declined to provide data on the number of people in the camps. Beijing initially denied the camps existed but now says they are vocational and education centres and that all the people have ""graduated""."

He has previous experience of handling drip system at his field located at another place from the village, in about two-and-half acres.Mallesh is among the 1,200 farmers from Erravalli and Narsannapet villages in Markook mandal benefiting from the drip system being provided by the authorities free of cost. These two villages adopted by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao are located in Gajwel constituency represented by him. The government has sanctioned about  48 crore as grant to implement the project on a pilot basis and it is aimed at inculcating the habit of adopting drip irrigation and reaping the benefits.The entire 2,733 acres in these two villages were divided into 14 zones, each zone comprising about 200 acres. The zones were again divided into four sub-zones. Each sub-zone has a chairman to monitor the drip water system. They have established a structure in each zone, from where the supply of water for each farm is automated and can be operated through computer system.This is Israeli technology, the most advanced one, and for the first time is being used by the government. The valves of the drip irrigation in each field are connected to the system at the zone office. Water can be released to a particular filed after request by a farmer, from the control room. We can also supply fertigation water soluble to the fields, J Nagender Reddy, Agriculture Officer, Markook, told The Hindu.A team of agriculture and horticulture officers have been campaigning in these two villages for the past few weeks and trying to convince farmers to go for drip system, stating that they can cultivate fields with less water. They are also being encouraged to go for vegetables and crops like keera and tomato. There will be lot of advantage due to the drip system. We can provide irrigation and fertilizer at the root of the plant. My experience is good, said Mr Mallesh."

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal."
2021-03-03,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/mar/03/turning-to-turnip-for-therapeutic-treats-2271252.html,Turning to turnip for therapeutic treats,"Roshne Balasubramanian ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: A few weeks back, Canadian cabinetmaker Damien Allard became the proud owner of three massive, recordbreaking creamy white and purple topped turnips all of which broke the Guinness record for the worlds heaviest turnip (weighing 22.9 kg, 24.4 kg and 29 kg).While we are sure that the Quebec resident has quite a lot of cooking to do with the colossal root vegetables, lets trace how the lesser-known (now record-worthy) cousin of potato, broccoli and Brussel sprouts provides plenty of nutrients while being low in calories.The turnip and its leafy greens are not only tasty but also nutritious. However, we seldom find people here adding it as a staple in their meals, notes Dhanalakshmi R, dietician, Rainbow Childrens Hospital, talking about the underground veggie variant.Gut healthAvailable at stores in the local markets and priced anything between Rs 25-Rs 30 (per 500 g), turnips are packed with fibrous goodness and can help in aiding weight loss and relieving intestinal problems. A cup of raw turnip has about 2.75 g of dietary fibre in it.This helps reduce pressure and inflammation in the colon, explains the medical practitioner, adding that the presence of high dietary fibres can also enable making bowel movements easier. The gut function is important in getting rid of toxins through bile and stool and the properties in turnips aids in maintaining a healthy digestive tract, she says.Aids in weight lossWith a high water content and low-calorie count, the consumption of the non-starchy vegetable makes people fuller for a longer period, aiding in weight loss. A 100 g of turnip has only 1.39 g of carbohydrates. So, it can be consumed by all and especially those who are on a journey to manage their weight, she says.Reduces blood pressureAccording to a study in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, foods containing (read turnips) high dietary nitrates were projected to benefit the health of the blood vessels. Rich in potassium (about 300 mg), it helps in lowering the bodys blood pressure by releasing sodium from the body. This helps the arteries dilate, she shares.For a long time, a healthy intake of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage and our star of the day, turnip, have been associated with a lower risk of cancer. Dhanalakshmi supports this link. The presence of a sulphur-rich compound called sulforaphane, a phytochemical can neutralise toxins. This plays an integral part in promoting anti-cancer activities in the body, she explains.Studies of a kind of indole in turnips, arvelxin, also suggest that it blocks pro-inflammatory compounds such as nitric oxide, aiding in reducing inflammation caused by diseases including arthritis, cancer, and high blood pressure.Immunity boosterBesides its wide profile of benefits, the vegetable is also rich in vitamin C, which is important for building and maintaining collagen, the component which provides structure to the skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of turnips can benefit the immune system and reduce hair loss prompted by iron deficiency.It can be added twice or thrice in a week in a meal, she shares. With a crispy, white inner flesh and a fresh, zesty flavour, turnips can be boiled or mashed, shredded or chopped, used as a salad garnish or added to stews and soups.NUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP GREENS (PER 100 G)Calories: 40 KcalsProtein: 3.12 gCarbohydrates: 6.16 g Fat: 0.35 g, Fibre: 2.76 gPotassium: 300 mgNUTRITION FACTS OF TURNIP ROOT (PER 100 G)Calories: 21 KcalsProtein: 1.58 gFat: 0.35 gFibre: 2.75 gCarbohydrates: 1.39 gWater content: 93.1 %Vitamin C: 64.7 mgRECIPETURNIP GREEN CURRYINGREDIENTSAny dal: 2 tbspGreen chilli: 3-4Onion: 1 (chopped)Tomato: 1 (chopped)Garlic cloves: 6-7 piecesTamarind pieceTurnips (root and greens):As required (chopped)Salt: To tasteTurmeric: 1 tspOil: 1 tbspMustard, cumin, Asafoetida: As requiredMETHODPick a dal of your choice, and add two tablespoons of it into a pressure cooker and soak it in water.Add green chillies, chopped onions, tomato, garlic cloves, tamarind piece and the chopped turnip rootand greens.Add turmeric and salt to taste.

The music starts getting louder with the space getting busier by 9:00pm.Owner Zorawar Kalra says, We built Swan to cater to the sensibility of the modern day ladies and gents, with a focus on clean aesthetics and a romantic vibe. And just to be clear, a swan on the menu is totally ruled out. The fine dine restaurant serves a mix of Japanese and Italian cuisines. We started with the Mushroom Cappuccino Soup, a creamy soup topped with truffle oil and served with ladyfinger cookie topped with chives and cream. The combo: deadly.The crispy Avocado Toast came laden with tangy and creamy avocado paste and was well-made. The asparagus fritters in the Asparagus Tempura Maki Roll, were covered in rice and fried to crisp, and paired well with a strongly-flavoured sauce. The baby wild mushrooms complemented the cream and parmesan cheese in the Porcini Mushroom Risotto.In the non-vegetarian, Herbs Marinated Chargrilled Prawns were a sheer delight. Grilled prawns drizzled with tomato pickle mayo were tender and delicious, so were the Lamb Chops. But if you want to keep your dining experience light, skip the latter as its quite oily.Swan also offers a variety of pastas, pizzas and Robata dishes, apart from Nigiri and Sashimi. Edamame and Asparagus Gyozas were not over boiled like the Indian version of dumplings and one could feel the crunchiness of the veggies, and spicy jalapeno sauce made for the best accompaniment.Swan makes for good brunch and dinner.

In the coming days, the farmers are anticipating that the price may go down further spelling further misery, said secretary of district unit of All India Krusaka Sabha, Padmalav Das.The dip in price has affected farmers of Derabisi, Mahakalapada, Garadapur, Pattamundai, Aul, Rajkanika and Rajnagar blocks. Absence of cold storage adds to the problem of farmers. This apart, absence of market linkage and availability of better quality tomatoes sources from Andhra Pradesh have only added to the farmers problems.Secretary of district unit of Krusaka Sabha, Umesh Chandra Singh said officials of Agriculture and Horticulture departments along with elected representatives must visit the villages to witness the predicament of farmers.

2021-03-08,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/importance-of-vitamin-c-for-women/articleshow/81375341.cms,Importance of Vitamin C for women,"Women across the world play multiple roles to adapt to the modern way of living in the society today. While they continue to juggle to do their best in the personal and professional front, one thing that often gets ignored is their health. Women tend to miss out on some of the most beneficial supplements in the daily grind, also, due to lack of awareness about their benefits. Take, Vitamin C, for instance, the immunity boosting, and often misunderstood vitamin. It is water soluble, hence, your body cannot store it. This is precisely why you need to consume it every day through food and other supplements, for it to have the required effect in the body. Dietary recommendations for Vitamin C are often not met because of poor lifestyle, various diseases, smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.Now, while most properties of Vitamin C help both genders the same, especially in boosting immunity, there are some that work particularly well for women. As women multi-task around the clock, lead hectic lifestyles and often fall prey to many lifestyle diseases, supplements like Vitamin C balance what their diets could be missing, lets take a closer look at the advantages of Vitamin C for women.This water-soluble nutrient acts a powerful antioxidant is needed for the development and maintenance of arterioles, scar tissues and cartilage. Collagen is a substance that is naturally produced by the body. However, the production of this substance diminishes as people grow older. Vitamin C plays an integral part in the production of collagen which therefore decreases wrinkles and the symptoms and signs of aging.Due to the needs of the developing foetus and the growing infant, vitamin C requirements are enhanced for pregnant and lactating women. The Vitamin C status of pregnant women is often lower than non-pregnant women, presumably due to active transfer of Vitamin C to the foetus. Women with complications of pregnancy can have much lower vitamin C status l. Supplementation of pregnant women with Vitamin C can potentially decrease the risk of pregnancy-related complications.Stress can affect various processes in the body like hormone production, the menstrual cycle, and fertility in women and men as well as digestion and immune function. When your body is exposed to stressful stimuli, the body makes the body makes it the priority over many other important processes. Vitamin C helps in dealing with typical indicators of physical and emotional stress. It also decreases the level of stress hormones. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women but is often underestimated and undiagnosed. Incidences of abnormally high blood pressure can be lowered by the regular intake of Vitamin C.Vitamin C supplements can help improve the absorption of iron from the diet. Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as plant-based sources of iron, into a form that is easier to absorb. As a result, it may help reduce the risk of anaemia among people prone to iron deficiency.Vitamin C supplements have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. These supplements may reduce the impact of known risk factors for heart disease such as high blood levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.Vitamin C can elevate your estrogen levels and lower progesterone levels. This causes the uterus to contract and the lining of the uterus to break down, leading to the onset of menstruation.The daily intake of Vitamin C depends on the country you are residing in. In India, you need 65-115 mg of Vitamin C depending on your age.66 mg/day68 mg/day65 mg/day80 mg/day115 mg/dayCitrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of Vitamin C. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe. Not all fruits and vegetables have equal levels of Vitamin C. For instance, bananas and apples are quite low in Vitamin C whereas oranges, strawberries, tomato, kiwi have a higher content. Vitamin C supplements are available as tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, and effervescent tablets. Not all Vitamin C supplements are created equal. To better ensure quality and safety, choose supplements that have been tested and certified by an authorised certifying body, such as the FSSAI (The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India).Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that must be obtained from the diet or supplements. Vitamin C plays an important role in strengthening your immune system thus enabling you to lead a healthy life."

The retail cost of veggies in the city is usually 20%-25% more than what they fetch in the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC).The cost of few vegetables such as carrots and shallots, being sold for twice as much as their wholesale cost, are currently burning a hole in consumers pockets.According to market sources, the cost of tomatoes , potatoes and shallots are expected to drop by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilogram, while drumstick rates could plunge by Rs 50/kg as arrivals to the city is increasing.The cost of curry leaves has been in the Rs 50 to Rs 70 price range for a while and a bunch of coriander is available for Rs 1 to Rs 3.S S Muthukumar, president of Koyambedu Semi-Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association, said carrot and drumstick prices have plunged as it is the harvest season of the vegetables. ""Carrot is largely procured from The Nilgiris district and the city receives drumstick from Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Villupuram districts,"" he said. The prices of potato and tomato are expected to fall further, he added. The KWMC has been receiving around 500 trucks of vegetables, a 100 more than November-December last year.On Sunday, 1kg of carrot was sold at Rs 46 in retail shops in Adyar and Rs 64 in Royapettah.

With tanks dry and the groundwater available only at below 300 feet over a year ago, the district is now in much better shape on the water front.With secondary treated water being supplied from the KC Valley Project for the last 18 months, 81 out of 126 tanks in Kolar are brimming with water, explains T Rajendiran, Accredited Consultant, Central Ground Water Authority. Rajendiran, who visited Narasapura recently to witness the state of the tanks, added that the availability of water was making a big difference to the lives of farmers.A farmer used to spend up to Rs 5 lakh to sink a borewell with the hope of finding water. Often, the water used to dry up very soon and he would be left with a huge debt to repay. This situation has now passed. This move needs to be emulated across the country to solve the problem of dry borewells and poor groundwater levels, he added. Concurring with Rajendiran, a Minor Irrigation department official said the rise in water table has opened up better agriculture options.Farmers used to raise eucalyptus trees as they dont require water regularly. Of late, the farmes have switched to cultivating tomato, beans and radish among other vegetables as they are sure the daily water needs can b e m e t ,  he said. B C Gangadhar, BWSSB Chief Engineer for waste water management, said, This was possible due to four STPs operating to treat water at KC Valley. One STP treats 218 MLD of water while the others treat 90 MLD, 60 MLD and 30 MLD each.We planned to supply up to 398 MLD, but due to sludge and the biggest STP being an old one, we are managing slightly lesser quantity. Another 90 MLD of treated water was being supplied to Chikkaballapur through a different project, he added. Rajendiran said a move to go in for tertiary treatment and supplying water to Naraspura Industrial Area is in the offing."

The duo was brought to Thiruvananthapuram zoo from Nagaland in 2017.Kohima, the Himalayan bear, at Thiruvananthapuram zoo having frozen watermelon pieces | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARWith the mercury levels rising, specific care is given to the residents on the 36-acre Thiruvananthapuram zoo. The daily menu has been tweaked for most of the animals. We include fruits and vegetables that are juicy and fleshy, especially watermelons and salad cucumbers, so that residents are not dehydrated. Both animals and birds relish those, says TV Anilkumar, Superintendent of the zoo.In the 155-plus kilograms of fruits and vegetables purchased daily, there are 25 kilograms of watermelon, nine kilograms of salad cucumber, 20 kilograms of cucumber (vellari) and 25 kilograms of different banana varieties. Salad cucumber is an addition this year because the animals like it more than vellari. We have even cut down the quantity of vellari by five kilograms, adds Sangeetha Mohan, Curator at the zoo.Carnivores reduce their meat intake during the summer months. For instance, tigers normally consume seven kilograms of meat daily. It comes down to five kilograms or so, says Dr Jacob Alexander, Zoo Veterinarian. Over 86 kilograms of meat (beef and chicken) is needed on a day for the carnivorous animals including seven tigers, two lions, six leopards, 10 hyenas, two foxes and four jungle cats.Short takes The diet chart is prescribed by the Central Zoo Authority.There are over 1,200 animals belonging to 105 species at the zoo. While primates and carnivores are fed only in the morning, rest of the animals have a meal at 11.30 am and 4 pm. Carnivores fast on Mondays, a regular holiday for the zoo.Water birds, otters, gharials and turtles eat fish. Ducks and swans have rice, amaranthus, green gram and cucumber. Peacocks and pheasants eat green chillies, coriander leaves, green gram, cooked rice and big onions.Among the flightless birds, rheas prefer cabbage, carrot, poultry feed, amaranthus and rice. While ostriches have amaranthus mixed with dog food, bananas and vegetables, emus are given carrot and bananas.Rhinos have cattle feed, cucumber, carrot, long beans, onion, grass, fodder and mineral mix.Monkeys now get more fruits, especially oranges and grapes, besides their daily meal of boiled eggs (they love egg whites!), guava, apple, bananas, coconut, papayas, groundnut (husked and de-husked), tomatoes, pineapple and long beans.Bath timeElaborate arrangements are also in place to keep the animals hydrated throughout the day. Sprinklers and fans have been installed inside the enclosures of rheas and nilgais or blue bulls. We operate the sprinklers at noon and they happily soak in the water to cool off. Or they move towards the fans to get relief. Sprinklers also ensure that there is enough green vegetation in the enclosures, adds Anilkumar.Meanwhile tigers, leopards and lions have the luxury of showers and concrete water pools within their cages. They love to rest in the water. Water is let out to the enclosures of Barasingha (swamp deer) and sambar deer so that they can create their own swampy environment with puddles, adds Dr Jacob. The regular diet for deer and other herbivores is a concentrated ration with cattle feed, Bengal gram sprouts, cotton seed and green gram, salt and mineral mix, besides grass and fodder. Mineral block and salt licks are always kept in the enclosures.Parrots feeding on fruits and vegetables at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARBirds get to eat more leafy greens these days, especially green amaranthus, which they have with rice. Garlic used to be an ingredient in their diet. But we dropped it ever since they showed an aversion to its taste, Sangeetha says.Special care is being given to three ostriches, two males and female. A few years ago an ostrich had died of heat stroke. It is the courting season for the ostrich and already seven eggs have been been laid.Water kept in clay pot for green vine snake to cool off at the reptile house at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARIn the reptile house, water is kept in clay pots for snakes to coil up against when temperature goes up. The three King cobras and two anacondas have the luxury of air-conditioned enclosures. While the anacondas, Dhil and Ruth, are fed a chicken and a rabbit once a week, the cobras feast on rat snakes.While summer is a difficult time for all zoos in the country, the situation is better in Thiruvananthapuram. That is because Kerala doesnt have extreme weather conditions, be it summer or winter. So all we have to do is take measures to bring down the temperature during summer. There are enough ponds for some animals. The staff keeps a tab on the animals even at night and refill the water basins, Anilkumar says."

In these difficult days where the prospect of receiving a tangible Ragnarok update seems bleaker than getting one for Valimai, reliving classics in the franchise will make us feel good, if only temporarily. Ghost of Sparta is a game that is very sure of itself. It is almost as confident as its protagonist, the angry and unconscientious Kratos.However, its confidence might fool us into thinking it is also steadfast. Oh no. Let me explain. The PSP has a tiny screen, smaller than the average phone screen of 2021. The PSP also does not have a right joystick, forcing a stable camera angle. One would assume that these constraints would make the game linear, and therefore easy. GoW however, is sure of itself, sure to fool us into a sense of comfort in knowing what lies ahead.The story in this game involves the Ghost of Sparta seeking out his long-lost brother, Deimos. The storyline is punctuated by flashbacks of Kratos youth. The pathway to fixing his past is simple. Kratos must visit the Temple of Poseidon, defeat Scylla, slash Callisto to learn no new information, defeat Thanatos daughter, use the key of Crete, cross the Gates of Herakleon, travel to the Temple of Ares, then to the Jails of Sparta . *inhales deeply*. receive the Arms of Sparta, stumble into Midas, find the statue of Poseidon in the city of Atlantis, and then enter the Domain of Death to search his brother. See? Simple. Ghost of Sparta would really be a joyful story about a man going on a pilgrimage; that is, if we didnt see him ripping peoples heads off so often.The path that Kratos takes is filled with a lot of traffic. There are huge spiders spitting poison, cyclops, minotaurs, automatons that can only be destroyed by a special fire, hounds, and more! However, Kratos is armed with the powers to destroy them. But as they get stronger, we must ensure that he has enough orbs, horns, feathers, and eyes (so weird) to max out the upgrades. You might just overuse one power-up the spinning chains one, but you still need upgrades! Here, the illusion of the stable camera angles forces us to explore. An old-school puzzle. The game shows us a main path. But there may be a chest hidden, just out of sight.Except for the story, Ghost of Sparta feels like concept art for the recent God of War games. While some bits may not have aged well, the game is right in being confident, as it provides a healthy challenge for one that is 11 years old. 299/300 for the Spartan.Anusha Ganapathi@quaffle_waffle(This economics graduate spends her leisure time preparing for the zombie apocalypse)"

It is one of the three agriculture laws that is being opposed by farmers who are protesting at Delhi borders.Mann said that the proposal put forward by the government in these laws would give impetus to hoarding, adding that removing onions and tomatoes from essential commodities list will make life difficult for the poor. He added that with the implementation of this Act hoarders would stockpile goods and later sell them at exorbitant prices.Mann said that he raised the issue in the meeting of the standing committee that Punjab was producing a large quantity of potatoes and farmers could not afford to keep potatoes in cold stores. He said that after this, the hoarders sell the potatoes at higher prices when there is a shortage of potatoes.Read | Kejriwal, Mann hand in glove with BJP govt at Centre: SADChallenging Harsimrat Kaur, Mann said , Now she should also make public proceedings of the meeting of June 5, 2020.Mann said that Congress and Akali Dal were in turmoil and to discredit the Aam Aadmi Party, the opposition parties are therefore engaged in spreading false propaganda."

He also accused the minister of not fulfilling any of the promises made in their manifesto during last Assembly polls.Minister Anbalagan had failed to bring Aliyalam-Thoolchetti project, Ennaikolpudur-Thumbalahalli project, Jarthalav- Pulikarai in Dharmapuri for revival of cultivation lands. The AIADMK government had also promised to implement a SIPCOT estate here, but no work has begun so far in that direction, Stalin said.The Opposition leader also charged that Anbalagan failed to oppose NEET which resulted in over 14 students losing their lives.NEET will be abolished when the DMK comes to power, he assured. He also criticised the AIADMK government for copying the DMKs manifesto. Right before Pongal, we made a promise to waive farmers loans. Immediately, they announced a waiver. Many similar promises have been copied from the DMKs manifesto, Stalin said.Referring to Pollachi sexual harassment, Sathankulam custodial deaths and firing at anti-Sterilite protesters in Thoothukudi, the DMK president said that these were all failures of the AIADMK government. If DMK comes to power...Stalin promised to set up a Womens Arts and Science College in Palacode, hasten the works for Ennaikolpudur-Thumbalahalli project, and lay underground drainage in Palacode.He also promised to upgrade the Hogenakkal Integrated Drinking Water project. His other promises included a coconut research foundation in Marandahalli, a tapioca research centre in Morappur. For tomato cultivators tomato dehydration units will be set up along with refrigeration units in three places -- Palacode, Karimangalam, and Pennagaram, he said. Stalin also promised to set up Hogenakkal hydro-electricity project to supply uninterrupted power to the district and implement Cauvery surplus water scheme here, he said.Addressing a campaign meeting in Krishnagiri, Stalin trained his guns at Rajya Sabha MP and AIADMK deputy coordinator K P Munusamy, who is contesting from Veppanahalli. He charged Munusamy with failing to seek justice for the death of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. Munusamy got his current positions after Jayalalithaas death by threatening Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam, Stalin said, adding that the election was for restoring self-respect of people and retrieving the rights of Tamil Nadu.Madurai Muslim Jamats extend support to DMKMadurai: The Muslim Jamats here unanimously decided to vote for DMK and its allies in the upcoming Assembly elections. Madurai Muslim Ikkiya Jamat secretary, Kaja Mohideen said there are 163 Jamats in Madurai and they have resolved to unanimously vote for the DMK led Secular Progressive Alliance."
2021-03-25,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/covid-pandemic-a-chef-who-lost-her-sense-of-smell-30-years-ago/article34152228.ece,The chef who lost her sense of smell 30 years before the COVID-19 pandemic,"As this writer recovers from COVID-19, she speaks to a chef who lost her sense of smell 30 years agoFor 10 days, all I could taste were oranges. Those citrusy bites were my only gustatory awakenings in the sleepy blandness that COVID-19 brought into my life. But, I could not smell them.Close your eyes and picture your favourite food. It is likely that the first thing you thought of was how it smells. The parts of your brain that process your emotions and memories use olfactory data, linking them closely. Our sense of smell richens our sense of taste.So when you wake up one morning and lose both, the world around you shifts slightly. You dont realise it but you miss the stimuli that were anchoring you: the smell of your skin, your bedsheets, wet soil in the garden, the shampoo in your hair, breakfast cooking in the kitchen.It happened to me in February, after I caught COVID-19. But to Chindi Varadarajulu, it happened 30 years ago  a severe flu during her second winter in Vancouver, Canada, left the would-be chefs nose incapable of sniffing out flavours.I am still upset that I have never smelt real lilacs, says Chindi. After appointments with specialists in Singapore and Canada, she had a name for the condition: anosmia.Chef Chindi Varadarajulu, founder of Pumpkin TalesIn the past year, anosmia has become a significant marker of Covid. Or in my case  parosmia, where instead of an olfactory vacuum, familiar smells seem distorted. For a few days, I wondered if anyone had spilled anything rancid in the vicinity. Did our dog kill a rat we did not know about? Because it seemed as though a stench would follow me around, stuck inside my nose.Around the world, as there is greater research on long covid, there may be relief for people whose symptoms have still not abated, even after testing negative.Thirty years on, Chindis sense of smell still has not returned. Still, it did not pull her back from a career in the culinary arts. Could her journey provide some answers for those who still show symptoms of anosmia?For a year after I stopped being able to smell, I tried nasal sprays of all sorts. Sometimes I would convince myself that I smelled something familiar  but it was just like a phantom itch, says Chindi.At her first restaurant in Vancouver, set up in 2003, she remembers accidentally burning a batch of dal, failing to notice and put it out until someone drew her attention to it. Today, she creates new recipes out of memories of old flavours, and has her team at Pumpkin Tales in Chennai test it out.She can do this because all these years, she has been making up for her lack of smell through an accentuated sense of taste.I may not be able to identify flavour profiles [a combination of taste and smell] but my taste is enhanced in many ways. For instance, tamarind, tomato, lemon  these are all sour tastes, but to different degrees: some sharp, some more rounded, some leave a bitter aftertaste, some sweet. I can appreciate all of that because of my years of training in it, says Chindi.I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomato dal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingnessThe passion with which she speaks of taste reminds me of the two weeks I spent bereft of it. At lunchtime, I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomato dal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingness. Fluffy rotis were like wet paper; evening snacks nothing better than an exercise in chewing.So of course, after getting my taste back, the first swirl of peanut butter chocolate ice cream made me feel complete in a way nothing else has.Chindi encourages me to pay more attention to the food I eat, and I readily agree. Take in the texture. Look at what you are eating and associate it with what youre feeling in your mouth, focus on the balance of tastes, she recommends.Train yourselfPay attention because if it slips away, you might not notice all at once. For, while there are eye charts and hearing tests, there are not many quantitative ways we can measure our power of smell and taste. Which is why, many people who have been infected with Covid once find it difficult to say for sure whether their senses have returned completely.Smell kits help. Comprising essential flavour profiles, they help associate odours with the correct source, almost willing your brain into recognising and remembering them.Back in February, I would do an informal training every day, as I picked up an apple or my favourite bar of soap, sniffing it, trying to remember what it smelt like.After I was reacquainted with a familiar smell  a cloud of freshly sprayed disinfectant, I rushed to the kitchen, sniffing spice after spice like some strange dog-woman. Most I could recognise again, but some are muffled till date.You should come over to the restaurant once, offers Chindi, We can do a smell-test and see how many you get right. I look forward to it."

This is the second such announcement he has made after he promised to create another district with Arani (Tiruvannamalai) as its headquarters, last Sunday.Giving a fillip to micro-level administration, and to ensure that the people have easy access to government schemes, Palaniswami in the past four years carved out six new districts Kallakurichi, Tenkasi, Chengalpattu, Tirupattur, Ranipet and Mayiladuthurai. As of now, Tamil Nadu has 38 districts.Earlier in the day, while campaigning in Karur, Palaniswami recalled his connection with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was Modi who guided me when I took over as the CM. He shared his experiences as the CM of Gujarat, and it was he who gave the good advice that has helped in the development of our State. He further stated, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has helped us whenever we asked for it.The Centre has provided `1 lakh crore to Tamil Nadu for the construction of National Highways only because we have a very close alliance with them. In another development, veteran leader and DMKs agriculture wing State secretary, M Chinnasamy, joined the AIADMK in the presence of Palaniswami. Rajini Makkal Mandarams district chief Bagavan Paramasivam also joined the party.Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami greets supporters during an electioncampaign in Dindigul district on WednesdayPlans on to build dam across Amaravati, says EPSSpeaking about other developmental works in the region, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said, Water will be available in abundance after the Cauvery Godavari Linking Project. We are building a barrage at Nanjai Pugazhur at Rs 406 crore. Three-quarters of 1 TMC water will be stored so that farmers can get water for both, irrigation and drinking purposes. The AIADMK government has also carried out Cauvery drinking water project in 50 panchayats in Aravakurichi and Paramathi at Rs 462 crore. He added, Through the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, as many as 32 flats worth Rs 3 crore are being built in Karur. A betel leaf processing centre worth Rs 2.50 crore is also to be set up at Velayuthampalayam.Steps have been taken to bring surplus water from the LPP canal to cultivate reed grass. Through this, about 10,000 acres of farmlands will be irrigated. There are also plans to build a dam across the Amaravati River in Chinnadharapuram. Necessary steps will be taken to clean and desilt Thathampalayam lake too. Lands in Aravakurichi will be irrigated through a pumping station, and once this project is completed, the arid region will become a prosperous area. Palaniswami also lashed out at DMK chief MK Stalin for fielding Senthil Balaji to fight the elections.Stalin, who calls the AIADMK corrupted, has Senthil Balaji with him, who was fired by former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, for corruption in Karur. Stalin calls him the best candidate. Senthil Balaji is someone who gives fake assurances. He had said in the last election that they would give 3 cents of land to everyone in Aravakurichi. But did that happen? We worked hard for him when he was in the AIADMK. But today, he wants to overthrow us. While canvassing votes at Vedasandur later in the day, Palaniswami accused Stalin of insulting farmers.He referred to Stalins fake farmer and rowdy jibes against him and said, Stalin is insulting farmers in his attempt to insult me. Elaborating on various welfare schemes implemented by the AIADMK government in Vedasandur, the Chief Minister said that steps have been taken to carry out projects like establishing a Taluk office in Guziliyamparai and a food park and processing units for tomato and drumstick farmers. Madurai Kamaraj Universitys constituent college in Vedasandur would be converted into a Government Arts and Science College, he promised.Later, in Palani, Palaniswami also made a slew of other promises including the implementation of road and underground drainage projects, establishing cold storage facility for guava farmers, direct procurement centres for coconut and Kodaikanal hill garlic, among others. He also assured that a tourist bus stand would be built in Palani for devotees. Vaiyapuri lake would also be cleaned and a park would be constructed, Palaniswami said. The CM also addressed rallies in Dindigul and Oddanchatram constituencies, and promised to provide 1,000 units of free power supply to power loom weavers. If given a chance, the AIADMK would make Oddanchatram as a model constituency, he said."

She forced open the main door and found the couple hanging from the ceiling rods. Soumya and Akshays lifeless bodies were lying dead in the bed.Akshay and Ramesh ended their lives in one room, while Padma and Soumya hanged themselves in the adjacent room. After the children committed suicide, the couple pulled their bodies down and then ended their lives, Devapur sub-inspector Vijayender said.Preliminary investigations by Kasipet police revealed that as a tenant farmer Ramesh cultivated cotton and tomatoes in 30 acres in Malkapalli village.In the suicide note, he said he had borrowed money for farming expenses and also for his daughters marriage performed last year. But he incurred losses in cotton farming and was unable to clear the debt of Rs 16 lakh, Vijayender said.A suicide note purportedly written by Ramesh and signed by all four members was found in the house. The note was written in Telugu and in it Ramesh asked his brothers to forgive him and his wife, the SI said.Even if I had Rs 10 lakh or even Rs 7-8 lakh, four lives would have been saved. I do not have a single acre. I made Rs 3 lakh by selling cotton and had to use it for clearing debts. I told everyone that money will be repaid by March 25, but I am unable to do it, the note said, adding, If I alone end my life, those who gave money will ask my family members to return it. They said they can't live without me and we decided to end our lives.Their bodies were shifted to Mancherial government hospital for post-mortem examination and a case was registered under section 174 of CrPC."

The 68-year-old veteran faced multiple defeats in the Krishnagiri region over that period, and is set to contest from Veppanahalli in the same area, yet again this time. In 2016 Assembly elections, he came a distant third in Pennagaram. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he lost to the Congress candidate A Chellakumar in Krishnagiri. Now, he is locking horns with sitting DMK MLA P Murugan.The last two Assembly elections witnessed a bitter fight for Veppanahalli. On both occasions, DMK emerged victorious. Munusamy, a three-time MLA, is now a Rajya Sabha MP. Murugan, on the other hand, is contesting for the same seat for a second time. Last elections, Murugan won the seat by a margin of over 5,000 votes. Veppanahalli shares borders with both Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Interestingly, its the only constituency with 100 per cent rural demography.Largely an agrarian society, tomato, mint, coriander, cabbage, and beans are widely cultivated here. People here are also dependant on the daily wages brought back by labourers working in Hosur, Bengaluru, Mallur, KGF, and other nearby industrial areas. Veppanahalli is rich in minerals and has over 150 granite polishing units.But, labourers here are mostly migrant workers. The segment, being a border area, has considerable number of linguistic minorities, who speak Telugu, Urdu, and Kannada. The constituency is dominated by Vanniyars, followed by Naidu, Adi Dravidar, and Gowdas communities.Whats the issue here?For tomato cultivators M Velayutham and L Vijay, their main demand is a cold storage unit. The State government should ensure that the tomatoes can be turned into a value-added product, by giving us equipment to make a sauce, juices, pickles, or other by-products. Government should set up a method where farmers could sell their produce directly to the government agency, they urged.The man-animal conflict was also a major concern for the people in this constituency. A forest official suggested, Because of the National Highway connecting Chennai - Bengaluru passing through the forest area, a few elephants inadvertently wander into the highway where they meet with accidents.To solve this fences must be built for a stretch of one km near Sanamavu. An Eco-Bridge can be constructed to allow the elephants to cross the road. The residents also demand to upgrade the PHCs.Poll promisesAIADMK candidate KP Munusamy assured to carry out all government schemes and ensure implementation of all AIADMK promises in the manifesto such as six gas cylinders per household, three-phase current system for farmers, and loan waiver for Self Help Group.DMK candidate P Murugan promised to set up a Government Polytechnic college in Veppanahalli. He also promised to reroute the Aliyalam- Thoolchetti channel via Nagamangalam and Rayakottai, which will revive over 5,000 acres of cultivation land and replenish over 20 lakes and groundwater table in Veppanahalli constituency."

A Sindhi's quintessential identity is indeed synonymous with this yellow-coloured curry.Bhavnani's aunt Kamla Thakur explains the tedious kadhi-making process in the film from start to finish, with the camera following the rigours. ""Food is something big for us, and so it made sense to weave the story around it. Kadhi is my favourite, and it was my only choice because that is a Sindhis identity,"" says Bhavnani.Sindhi Kadhi is distinctly different from other kadhis. ""It is made from tur daal. We boil it with tomatoes in a cooker, then seave and use the soup, cooking it on slow fire much like a mithai. It is nutritious as we put lots of vegetables in it,"" she says.Chef Sanjeev Kapoor couldn't agree more. ""Sindhi Kadhi is full of flavour. I like the veggies that go into it. Kadhi elsewhere uses curd, but the Sindhi one doesn't,"" he says.Same-same differentWhat sets Sindhi cuisine apart from others is its use of vegetables, spices, and cooking method. ""They use both leafy greens such as spinach, fenugreek, etc, and also other vegetables such as okra, potatoes and drumsticks,"" says Kapoor.Mumbai-based home chef Poonam Shahani, who runs Mamma's Cucina, agrees. ""We use many vegetables that arent common in other cuisines. We also use a technique to allow the food to cook in its juices called teewan, a gravy made of tomatoes, onions and spices."" When made with rice, it is Seyal Teewan; with bread, it is Seyal Dabroti; with roti, it becomes Seyal Mani.Kapoor thinks that Sindhi cooking is an amalgamation. He says, ""They have a unique cooking style and have their favourites when it comes to spices. They like to play with the base of their dishes."" But God is in the details. Chef Satyajit Kotwal of Satyajit's Kitchen elucidates that the most common type of Sindhi cooking is Daag Mein (onion-tomato-based-curry).""It brings out the sweetness of caramelised onions to provide a balanced flavour to the curries. In Seyal, the quantity of onions exceeds that of vegetables that are cooked till translucent. Saye Masale Mein uses coriander leaves, garlic, ginger and green chillies cooked with grated tomatoes and spices; the mix serves as a base in many Sindhi preparations,"" he explains.Another popular Sindhi cooking method is Daas, where whole vegetables are stuffed with a mix of grated onion and Sindhi pesto, and cooked till tender, says Kotwal.Sindhi cuisine has a lot of exciting items too. ""The accompaniments are also imperative. Dishes such as fried potatoes or fried okra, papads, dahi, sweet boondi, etc, are the common ones. Theres an array of sweets, snacks, and bread to choose from,"" says Kapoor.Cooking delightIt was a rather sweet initiation into the home-grown food business for Mumbai-based Uttamchandani siblings - Ritesh, Shirley and Sonia - who made their debut with Sev Mithai or Singharji Mithai and Mohanthaal during the lockdown. ""It was around Riteshs birthday in July last that this idea first cropped up. We were thrilled to bits, so we started it,"" says Shirley.The trio was wary of people's reaction, especially from the traditional Sindhis, but the sweets tickled their taste buds too, besides finding favour among the non-Sindhis. Ritesh attributes it to the ""curiosity factor"".Delhi's Archana Manwani loved to host non-Sindhi friends. ""It was their encouragement that led to this food business. I take orders 24 hours before the delivery. I prepare food with specially sourced ingredients, be it vegetables or spices,"" she says. Giving a rundown of her story, Shahani says, ""Not many people are aware of the range that Sindhi food offers. Also, theres a dearth of places that serve authentic range in Mumbai.""Chipping in, Sonia highlights how most upmarket eating places dont even have Sindhi foods on their menu. ""There's a mention of all but not Sindhi, and that's sad,"" says Sonia, who with Shirley and Ritesh has added many traditional Sindhi foods, and Riteshs special - jaggery Sev Mithai - to the menu.Shahani also got into the business to ""preserve her cultures flavour for those youngsters who are losing touch with their roots"".Manwani is quite keen to promote Sindhi cuisine among Delhiites. ""I approached the Director of Tourism in Delhi for a stall in Dilli Haat. But I havent got any response,"" she rues. Thakur is the go-to person for Bhavnani, be it ""Teevan, Sai Bhaji, Seyal Beeh Patata, and, of course, Kadhi"". Yes, Kadhi, because it is unlike others of its ilk."

In these difficult days where the prospect of receiving a tangible Ragnarok update seems bleaker than getting one for Valimai, reliving classics in the franchise will make us feel good, if only temporarily.Ghost of Sparta is a game that is very sure of itself. It is almost as confident as its protagonist, the angry and unconscientious Kratos. However, its confidence might fool us into thinking it is also steadfast. Oh no. Let me explain.

GoW however, is sure of itself, sure to fool us into a sense of comfort in knowing what lies ahead.The story in this game involves the Ghost of Sparta seeking out his long-lost brother, Deimos. The storyline is punctuated by flashbacks of Kratos youth. The pathway to fixing his past is simple. Kratos must visit the Temple of Poseidon, defeat Scylla, slash Callisto to learn no new information, defeat Thanatos daughter, use the key of Crete, cross the Gates of Herakleon, travel to the Temple of Ares, then to the Jails of Sparta . *inhales deeply*. receive the Arms of Sparta, stumble into Midas, find the statue of Poseidon in the city of Atlantis, and then enter the Domain of Death to search his brother. See? Simple.

There are huge spiders spitting poison, cyclops, minotaurs, automatons that can only be destroyed by a special fire, hounds, and more! However, Kratos is armed with the powers to destroy them. But as they get stronger, we must ensure that he has enough orbs, horns, feathers, and eyes (so weird) to max out the upgrades.You might just overuse one power-up the spinning chains one, but you still need upgrades! Here, the illusion of the stable camera angles forces us to explore. An old-school puzzle. The game shows us a main path. But there may be a chest hidden, just out of sight.

2021-03-29,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/segregating-patients-key-to-corona-control/articleshow/81740631.cms,Ahd: ‘Segregating patients key to corona control’,"AHMEDABAD: Scientists at a leading institute for occupational health in the city have once again put their weight behind the strategy of segregating patients with high Covid-19 viral load to slow the drastic spread of Covid infection and save lives.In a new study, scientists from National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOH) Ahmedabad have claimed that the cycle threshold value of RT-PCR tests, which indicates the viral load of a patient should be an integral part of the Covid management strategy. The research paper has been authored by NIOH scientists Bidisa Sarkar and Paramita Sengupta. People with low Ct value have high viral load and vice versa. Hence, Ct value of initial viral load of already diagnosed cases mandatorily be mentioned in each individual report for further management.Individuals with high viral load are super-spreaders - they take the centre stage in person to person transmissions of coronavirus. This appears to be true as similar observations (few people spread most and most people spread few) were also made during severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) epidemics, claims the paper.The paper states that in case of Covid-19 a 10% of all those infected with Covid-19 are responsible for spreading 80% of all local transmissions.The paper points to drop in cases achieved after Ct-based strategy was followed by Ahmedabad district administration since third week of June where cycle threshold-based segregation of laboratory-confirmed positive cases was adopted for home quarantine, institutional quarantine and hospitalization based on symptomatology. Apart from Ct-based segregation the scientists also pointed out that Contact tracing of the previous five days of the cases with higher viral load is to be done rigidly considering as transmission starts on an average four to five days prior to first appearance of symptoms."

The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human rights abuses in the western region.Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang - a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied.Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the regional government of Xinjiang, told reporters that a company should not politicise its economic behaviour and said H&M won't be able to make money anymore in the Chinese market because of its statement.Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He invited companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening.WESTERN SANCTIONSWashington on Friday condemned what it called a ""state-led"" social media campaign in China against US and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang.The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The US government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region.Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions.The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims .Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism."

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic"

2021-04-04,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/no-cakewalk-for-aiadmk-in-palacodde-this-time/article34234547.ece,No cakewalk for AIADMK in Palacodde this time,"Palacodde is predominantly into farming, with sugarcane and tomato being the primary crops alongside paddy, coconuts, and flowers. With a farm-based economy, the process-side lags and the lack of affiliated agro-based industries are the main concerns for the cultivators here. A cold storage facility for tomatoes remains to see fruition here.The constituency is also drought prone. Poor rainfall and the resultant drought axed cane production that Palacodde Sugar Cooperative Mill did not take up crushing this year for want of cane.Palacodde has long demanded irrigation schemes linking from Ennekolputhur (Krishnagiri) to Thumballahalli dam; Aliyaalam dam to Tulchetti lake; and Jathalavau channel extension to Pullikarai  to tackle the drought. Ennekolputur project was hastily hatched up in an election year and notification was issued only recently.Minister for Higher Education K.P. Anbalagan has had winning streak, holding the constituency for four straight terms since 2001. If anti-incumbency is a challenge, his run is equally dogged by the drought of Palacodde and the inability to deliver the promised irrigation schemes.The drought is seen as a result of the AIADMK governments failure to implement the irrigation schemes and the Minister is seen as the face of that failure, since the irrigation schemes were part of his poll promise in 2016. Kongu Vellalar community that is second only to the Vanniyars in population in the constituency has been hit hard by the drought as land holders.In addition, there is resentment of under-representation amid Kongu Vellalars for not receiving candidature even in the neighbouring constituency of Paapireddypatti, where they are a sizeable population. The blame for it has been laid on Mr. Anbalagan, who is said to have pushed for Vanniyar candidate in all, but one reserved constituency.The vote bank is led by Vanniyars by over a lakh population (48.30%), followed by Kongu Vellalars (15.50%), Adidravidars (13.80%), Muslims (4.80%), Chettiars (5.20%) and others.The AIADMK has relied on the Vanniyar votes of the AIADMK and the PMK. But, the communitys votes are split with the DMK too. In addition, there is also degree of distrust amid the PMK supporters over the defeat of their leader Anbumani Ramadoss in the Lok Sabha elections, allegedly caused by the lackadaisical participation of the AIADMK.The DMK has fielded P.K. Murugan, an office-bearer in its lawyers wing for the second time after his loss in 2016. A Vellalar Gownder, Mr. Murugan is riding high on sympathy wave that he is well expected to garner the community votes in full. He is also expecting to garner the votes of the Muslims and the Adi Dravidars, with neither community expected to go with the AIADMK. An essentially two-cornered contest, Palacodde is no cakewalk for the high-profile incumbent."
2021-04-04,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/breakfast-most-fowl-an-easter-treat/article34222519.ece,Breakfast most fowl: An Easter treat,"After a 40-day dalliance with vegetarianism, Easter was always a time to indulgeTheres more to the Easter feast than chocolate bunnies and painted eggs. In fact, the real hero of Easter  apart from the Risen Christ himself  is the meat!As Easter is the culmination of 40 days of fasting and penitence, its only fair that the feast is one of grand indulgence. I remember how, growing up in the 70s and 80s in Madras (now Chennai), the season of Lent was a time of complete abstinence at home, when even eggs were off the menu. Stretching into 46 days (to include Holy Week), it was a time to embrace a variety of vegetarian dishes, pachchadis, pickles and vadams, which blended quite well with the onset of spring and summer. Surprisingly, this brief dalliance with vegetarianism would be quite spiritually uplifting, and I wouldnt really miss the meat  until Easter.But the dawn of Easter awakened the senses in more ways than one, and the first dish for breakfast on Easter morning was our cook Shankars green chicken kurma with soft, melt-in-the-mouth idlis. Lunch was a different story. But that kurma, with its profusion of fresh greens and succulent chicken pieces, brings back many fond memories of festivals and the coming together of family and friends. Now, with both my parents gone and community gatherings becoming increasingly rare, it is memories such as these that I find myself reliving often.Feast for the soulBack in the 80s, my family used to man one of the breakfast stalls at the CSI St. Thomas English Churchs annual thanksgiving festival, for the sole reason that our cook used to make the best chicken kurma. I still remember how, on the carnival day, Shankar would arrive at four in the morning to start his preparation, and soon the house would be filled with the aroma of fresh mint and coriander, till the chicken joined in and took it to a different level.My father was a stickler for punctuality and we would arrive at the church well ahead of time, chicken kurma, gas stove, cylinder and Shankar in tow. The freshly-made idlis, dosas and kurma would fly off the plates in a jiffy. By popular demand, we would repeat the idli-kurma treat for carol rounds and choir Sunday breakfasts. Every annual mission fundraiser sale would also feature this star dish.Fresh as a memoryRecently, I happened to delve deeper into the origin of the kurma (or korma, as it is called in the north), which has its roots in Mughlai cuisine. I was surprised to find that this particular green variant is quite popular in the Nilgiris and the surrounding hilly regions of Kongu Nadu. A staple of the tribal Badaga kitchen, the recipe is unique as no powdered masalas are used  its only whole spices and fresh herbs. And the fresher the coriander and mint, the greener the kurma. These little bits of information fit in so neatly, like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle, as our cook too was from Coimbatore.I still have Shankars recipe. I remember writing it down as he narrated it the very year I was married. Now my daughter thinks its the only worthwhile dish in my rather limited repertoire of culinary exploits. I make it only for Christmas and Easter.Sunday recipeGreen chicken kurmaIngredients1/2 coconut, grated or cut into small pieces5 sliced onions7 green chillies2 tbsp ginger & garlic paste (freshly ground)1/2 a bunch fresh mint leaves (pudhina)1/2 a bunch fresh coriander leaves2 tomatoes3 bay leaves2 inches cinnamon sticks1 tbsp fennel seeds4 cloves3 cardamoms3 star aniseCurry leaves1 kg chickenSalt to tasteMethod1.

The kurma is done when the oil separates and it still looks green. Bon apptit! Happy Easter!The writer is a freelancer based in Chennai, who loves telling stories from the past."

To recuperate from childbirth, physically and mentally, takes time. So, it is important to replenish the nutritional levels to quicken the process of recovery. And for this precise reason, our ancestors resorted to the traditional pathiya samayal post-delivery.The diet eliminates consumption of spicy, acidic and fried foods by turning the spotlight on homegrown vegetables, fruits, spices and herbs that aid in secretion of breast milk and improve gut health. If you have never heard of pathiya samayal or do not live with elders who can help you with traditional delicacies, fret not.City-based homechef Yogambal Sundar, who specialises in south Indian cuisine, guides us through food items that should and should not be included in a postpartum diet. While a carefully curated prenatal diet is mandatory, a postnatal diet is equally important. A lot has changed from our times to yours.

2021-04-07,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/apr/07/swayed-by-sweet-potato-2286703.html,Swayed by sweet potato,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The humble sweet potato, in all its weird and wobbly innocuousness, often gets a poor rep. Especially when pitted against, rather unfairly, the universally loved potato. While madhura kizhangu puzhukku and sweet potato fries have persuaded many to switch camps, it doesnt exactly top the list of favourite vegetables for too many.But, maybe it should, given that theres plenty more to this unassuming tuberous root, says Yamini, clinical dietician, Kauvery Hospital. Theres a misconception that roots and tubers are not to be consumed in large quantities because of their starch content. But, when it comes to the nutritional value, the other components like micro-nutrients also have to be kept in mind.For this, sweet potato can be consumed, explains Yamini. There are two types of the sweet potato. The one which is available in India is the orange-pinkish one; the other one is purple and not commonly available here. But, both of them have the same properties and are very good for your health. It is antiinflammatory, reduces free radicals and boosts your immune, she details.Addresses anaemiaIt is very rich in ascorbic acid, fulfilling the vitamin C part. Its also a good source of iron. If cooked with jaggery, the nutritional anaemia can be treated.Potassium powerSweet potato is a rich source of potassium. This can help manage high blood pressure, its water retention properties can regulate muscle contractions and prevent kidney stones too.Starchy but goodEven though it is a starchy vegetable with a minimal amount of carbohydrates, it minimises the absorption of sugar in the body; thanks to its good fibre content both soluble and insoluble. So, even diabeticpatients can consume it once or twice a week if their sugar level is under control.Metabolism mattersThe high fibre content also helps in maintaining gut health. It enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria in your stomach; this way, it can help treat infective diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders. It helps in weight gain but portion size is the key and it has to be taken appropriately.Brain foodIt is a very good source of choline an essential nutrient that enhances the brain function.Vitamin storehouseSweet potato is also very rich in beta carotene, which is the precursor for vitamin A. This vitaminis very essential in all stages of life, playing a vital role in eye health.Rich in antioxidantsIt is filled with anthocyanins with antioxidant properties. Hence, it has to be included in everyday diet.ConsumptionA 100 grams of baked sweet potato offers 51 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of protein, 6 to 7 grams of fibre and very minimal fat. Otherwise, it is also rich in vitamin C and B6, magnesium, etc. The best way to consume sweet potato is to steam/bake it and have it with jaggery or slight seasoning. It can also be made as a regular south Indian curry or poriyal, with tomato and onions and spices.Sweet potato is not given much importance on the plate. But, you should try to include it regularly in your diet. In layman terms, it just looks like the pancreas the shape of the tuber. And Mother Nature has given it all these properties too. That depicts that it is very good for your vital organ, pancreas, she concludes."
2021-04-08,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/mocktail-india-trends-2021-premiumisation-innovation-better-ingredients/article34271677.ece,Hold the alcohol! 2021 will be the year of mocktails,"Bartenders across India chat about how the re-emerging bar culture sees bigger demand for more innovative, premium mocktailsEager to just step out, people find that the significance of a bar has evolved for them over the past year. For a growing number of Indians; it is not so much about swigging a few beers or throwing back a few shots, but more about enjoying the change of scenery and revelling in a non-alcoholic drink.Unfortunately, the virgin tag in the drinks space has so far come with a green light for compromise. Most virgin mojitos just have dollops of sugar syrup, while some virgin cucumber gimlets comprise lime juice with chunks of cucumber at best.Thankfully, consumers are now empowered more than ever to ask for a premiumisation of mocktails: that is to say, ones without sugar rush-inducing ingredients and stacks of ice. In response, bartenders rise to this challenge and admit that non-alcoholic beverages have shot into prominence.Sidecar founder and mixologist Yangdup Lama | Photo Credit: special arrangementThough Yangdup Lama first opened his famous Delhi bar Sidecar in August 2018, they did not have a liquor license until December of that year. So the place kicked off with a mocktail menu, which seemed risky. However, looking back at those first few months, he says innovating on mocktails was liberating rather than restricting, and he and his team of trusted bartenders loved the process so much that they retained that mocktails menu to this day.Read More | All about Sidecar, the only Indian bar in 2020 Asias Best 50 list, and its creatorWe get people coming in during the day for those mocktails, he explains. One of our popular ones is made of bel or wood apple  such a fantastic fruit in so much abundance  and we opened up that conversation around the bels versatility. This is mind, the demand for mocktails is also based on the typical growth mindset in that people always want something more. Other much-loved mocktails at Sidecar include a velvet spice (a concoction of black grapes, redberry puree and lime, with a dash of chilli) and walk on the street (grapefruit, turmeric shrub with orange and mint soda).A long-time inequality, resolvedFlair bartender Ami Shroff crafting a drink using chillies | Photo Credit: Ami Shroff / InstagramMumbai-based flair bartender and TEDx speaker Ami Shroff points out that for people who drink alcohol, there are many choices in terms of the base, a whiskey, a cognac or even a beer  and then for each base, there are countless possibilities. However, in the mocktail space, options are limited to mainly juices and aerated waters. This inequality has been long predominant at bars and restaurants across the country, and she is glad it is changing. Cocktails obviously have a bigger price bracket and get more attention, so that explains the heavier focus on them at some places, she states.Interestingly, Ami points out that many of Indias bartenders receive training from liquor brand ambassadors, so their repertoire primarily comes with boozy elements. There is not much focus on how flavours would work without alcohol. The same goes for a lot of bartending schools. Automatically, the bartenders are just attuned to fixing cocktails, she reflects. The good thing is, as the experience across customers is evolving, so will that of the bartenders.Ami predicts that bars will have more training sessions, specifically around flavour combinations in the non-alcoholic space. When a drink does not have such a component, the profile changes significantly. So bartenders will have to look into the good and bad of flavour compensation a lot more. As an example, she says Bloody Mary can easily be made non-alcoholic by enhancing the tomato flavours without offering the customer too much acidity.The growing mocktail mania has seen Yangdup working with different companies such as Jimmys Cocktails, making ready-to-make mixes in a mocktail format. In the next few months, people can look forward to more such companies releasing these non-alcoholic packages, he puts forth. These companies would also be making sure that one can add alcohol if they like to the same mix, to help people be more experimental at home which has been much of the new normal, post-pandemic.Going mainstream Big conglomerates have launched mocktail lines too. In 2019, Coca Cola foresaw the trend and launched their Bar None range, featuring sangria, bellini spritz, dry aged cider and ginger mule flavoured mocktails.More recently, in February, Pepsi launched Neon Zebra canned mocktails in margarita, strawberry daiquiri, mojito and whiskey sour variants.These companies, including &Stirred, Tea Trunk and Mixtale, appeal not just to big metro cities, but also to smaller towns where there are few opportunities to try a good mocktail or a cocktail.Of flavour and soulA juggler and flair bartender, Ami is no stranger to the theatre of the bar, but insists that the success of a drink comes down to its flavour and soul.Will this shift in consciousness affect how a restaurant or bars supply chain operates? Ideally, it should not. There is a misconception that making a mocktail is a no-brainer. But clearly, that is not the case, considering how so many mocktails have been a let-down for such a long time. Both Ami and Yangdup say the same knowledge of techniques, flavour combinations and presentation to make a cocktail should be used to craft a mocktail.Owing to premiumisation, Indias drinking crowd is more ingredient-conscious now; going far beyond ordering a drink just by the name but understanding and often predicting how a combination of elements would taste together in a single sip. People are asking bartenders when a juice within a drink was made, if it is freshly-squeezed or packaged. The communication between the customer and bartender has changed, specifies Yangdup.It is one thing to hear how mocktails are successful for bartenders reaching a new demographic, but we want to know what mocktails they actually drink. Yangdup favours any drink combination of kaffir limes, and mangoes makes him happy. Meanwhile, Ami chuckles and says she loves a good virgin Bloody Mary."

Consequently, the retail prices have also fallen to Rs 9-10 per kg.ON Shibudeen, a vegetable agent in Thennampalayam market in Tiruppur, attributed the price drop to a bountiful harvest. However, this has hurt farmers and traders as the excess supply of native variety has led to a slump in prices. ""We now get around 7 tonnes of tomatoes daily, compared to 4-5 tonnes earlier. As a result, the wholesale rates have dropped to `5-6, leading to losses,"" he said.Tomatoes are sourced from Pongalur, Udumalaipet, Polikalipalayam, Avinashipalayam in Tiruppur. But, over the past few days, the surplus supply from the other districts such as Dindigul and Krishnagiri have been flowing into the district, said Tamil Nadu Farmers Association (Udumalaipet) vice-president SR Madhusoodan.In Erode, tomatoes from Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, and Andhra Pradesh have been hitting the markets, in addition to local supply from Thalavadi, Sathyamangalam and other areas in the district, says Ibrahim Badusha, a vegetable agent from Netaji temporary market.

2021-04-12,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/boss-burger-in-delhi-home-delivers/article34301990.ece,Who’s the boss (burger)?,"Boss Burger in Delhi delivers veg and non-veg bun delightsSome friends had been drooling over the burgers they had been preparing at home. They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger.Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu.All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties. Nothing like a DIY burger.The writer is a seasoned food critic"
2021-04-12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hike-in-fertilizer-prices-will-neutralise-cushion-of-msps/article34305638.ece,‘Hike in fertilizer prices will neutralise cushion of MSPs’,"It will increase financial burden, says former KAPC chairmanThe sharp increase in prices of fertilizers is expected to add to the agrarian crisis in the State where farmers are already reeling under distress due to lack of scientific pricing mechanism for their crops, said agriculture economist and former chairman of Karnataka Agriculture Prices Commission (KAPC) T.N. Prakash Kammaradi.It is the first time in the history of the country that fertilizer prices have seen a hike of nearly 58%, accounting for an increase of 1,400 a quintal.Dr. Kammaradi, who had commissioned studies related to cost of production for various crops in Karnataka in his capacity as KAPC chairman, said increase in fertilizers cost would almost neutralise the cushion being provided by minimum support prices with respect to a few crops, including paddy.Citing an example, he said the paid out costs, which include not just cost of production but also rental value of land and family labour, is already much higher than the revenues earned by farmers with respect to several crops, including paddy.According to him, the cost of production of paddy on one acre is 37,578 of which the fertilizers alone cost 7,314 as there is a requirement of about 400 kg. Of this, the DAP and NPK, which have seen hike in prices, account for 50% of quantity. This would mean there would be a jump of about 2,800 to 3,000 per acre of paddy. Pointing out that farmers get 27 to 28 quintals of paddy per acre on an average, he says, production cost would go up by a minimum of 100 per quintal of paddy.With actual paid out cost of paddy already high at 52,453 per acre, the present fertilizer price hike would only increase the financial burden and make cultivation of various crops almost financially unviable despite MSPs, he argued.Similarly, the growers of elakki variety of banana spend about 16,429 per acre of plantation on fertilizers alone. Now, these expenses would increase, he pointed out. Same was the case of cotton where 333 kg of fertilisers is used per one acre. Even vegetable and fruits growers have been hit hard. According to an estimate, 290 kg of fertilizers is required for growing tomato on one acre of land while 505 kg of fertilizers is needed for growing dry chillies on one acre.Even dairy farmers, who are struggling since milk procurement prices were reduced on account of COVID-19, are expected to be hit hard as a majority are dependent on fertilizers for cultivation of fodder. Dr. Kammaradi argued for restoring full quantum of subsidy that was being given for fertilisers to bail them out."

Ali sells omelettes and bhurji pao outside Churchgate station. His last regular work day was on March 18, 2020, six days before the national lockdown was announced.Ali went back to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh in May 2020, returned to the city in August and reopened the food stall in December. With a complete lockdown looming again and restrictions already in place, Ali fears a repeat of 2020. Last week, three men working with him left for their home states of UP and Bihar, uncertain of the future after the experience of the sudden lockdown last year.Before the lockdown, Alis daily routine was to travel to Churchgate after 5 pm from his home in Navi Mumbai. He coordinated supplies of eggs, bread, onion, tomatoes, spices and set up his stall by 8 pm, just after the evening peak hour subsided and commuters stopped for a quick bite before taking trains to far-flung northern suburbs. His stall was open till the last local left the station around 12.50 am.When he shut down the stall during the national lockdown, he thought it would be a matter of days before he got back to his routine. I did not think it would be so many months, he says.After his return last August, Ali rushed to the space near the station where he had stashed his utensils, stove and a foldable table. It had all been stolen. I had to spend Rs 20,000 to buy everything again, he says.Those like Ali who earned over Rs 20,000 per month and had some savings managed to survive the lockdown, but the economic shock of the past year has set them back financially by many years.Unlike thousands of others, Ali and his wife Ishrat decided to stay put in their one-room home in Koparkhairane rather than risk travelling on foot or trucks. But they left in May when they could not afford to stay in the city. We left when they started the trains to take migrant workers back to their hometowns. We stayed at Ishrats mothers village, where there is some income due to farming, he says.In August, Ali had an accident and was told that surgery would cost over Rs 1 lakh. He returned to the city and got operated at a public hospital, taking a loan by mortgaging jewellery.After recuperating, Ali returned to Churchgate in the last week of August, but with train services operating only for essential workers and restrictions still in place, restarting the stall was unviable. I had no option but to sell small items I bought in Crawford Market. I sold earphones, mobile stands, even sanitiser bottles outside the station, he says.For Ali, the biggest concern is his sons studies. Moin, a Class V student in a private English medium school, has not attended online classes for a year as the family was unable to pay the fees, amounting to nearly Rs 1 lakh.With restrictions eased for the general public to travel on local trains in February, Ali had begun hoping for earnings to pick from March. But that hope crashed with the second wave of Covid infections and new restrictions.Ali has not decided if he should leave immediately, hoping that the spike is temporary. I cannot imagine restarting all over again for the second time, he says."
2021-04-13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramzan-breeds-dread-in-crisis-hit-iraq/articleshow/82042464.cms,Ramzan breeds dread in crisis-hit Iraq,"BAGHDAD: Faced with sharp price rises, a decline in the buying power of the dinar and rising unemployment, Iraqis enter the Muslim fasting month of Ramzan with a feeling of dread.""After a whole day of fasting, we have to eat something,"" even if the price of a kilo of tomatoes has more than doubled, said Umm Hussein, a single mother of five who has no salary.She struggles each month to raise the $45 rent for their modest home.Like 16 million of Iraq 's 40-million population living under the poverty line, Umm Hussein relies on her ration card for food.Under the legacy from the 1990s when Iraq's Saddam Hussein was under a stringent international embargo, every Iraqi whose household heads earns less than $1,000 a month is entitled to certain basic provisions at subsidised prices.But this year, ""we've only received the rations for February"", said Abu Seif, 36, who like his father before him has the job of distributing bags of subsidised goods.""We still haven't got the rations for Ramzan,"" during which Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, a period that starts this week.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi had promised extra rations for the holy month. But ""people are coming in or calling every day to ask when they're arriving"", said Abu Seif.In Abu Ammar's grocery store, the credit line has been stretched so far that he fears not being able to pay his suppliers any more.With prices rising sharply, ""some families owe more than 200,000 dinars"" ($130), the grocer told AFP.The authorities in energy-rich Iraq, with revenues slashed by the decline in world oil prices, last year devalued the dinar, which has lost 25 percent of its value against the dollar.As a result, for example, the price for a bottle of cooking oil has gone up to 2,500 dinars, from 1,500 dinars.On top of price hikes, Covid-19 restrictions such as lockdowns and curfews have killed jobs, especially the day jobs on which many Iraqis rely following decades of conflict.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says Iraqis are trapped in a vicious circle.""Over 90 percent of small and medium enterprises in the food and agriculture sector reported being severely to moderately affected by the pandemic. To cope with decreased revenue, more than 50 percent either let staff go or reduced salaries,"" it says.A joke doing the rounds on Iraqi social media goes something like: ""This year, salaries are in the group of death with Covid-19 and Eid al-Fitr (the feast marking the end of Ramadan). Not sure they will make it though to the next round.""Haider, a 32-year-old civil servant, says it's no laughing matter.""Ramzan fills me with dread. We need a lot of things for the house and new clothes for the children,"" he said.Even in normal times, he struggles to pay the rent, for daily expenses and electricity charges with his monthly salary of $600.Electricity is one of the heaviest financial burdens, in a country with at times 20-hours-a-day power cuts that force Iraqis to turn to private generators that run on pricey fuel.Abu Ahmad, a 32-year-old colleague, says he will skip the traditions this Ramzan.""I'm not going to be giving big dinners at my place, so as not to spread Covid ,"" he said. ""But also, because I can't afford it."""

Market and a few other markets in the city.Sources in the civic body said the Corporation was mulling allowing only 50% traders to function on a day and the rest the next day as it done last year during the lockdown. The Corporation could arrive at a decision in the next couple of days.Before taking a decision, the Corporation would engage with the traders to take their opinion and seek their cooperation and also consult with the district administration, the sources said.The Corporation, on Tuesday, also held talks with representatives of traders from the M.G.R. Wholesale Vegetable Market and Anna Retail Vegetable Market to explore the possibility of shifting them to a school or college ground or another place where maintenance of physical distance would not be a problem.After the discussion, the Corporation had decided to shift the onion trade to the Mettupalayam Road bus stand.Sources in the market said the shift of onion business would ease congestion in the wholesale market as it was onion at around 700 tonnes a day that occupied more space than other vegetables.At present, tomato business functioned out of the bus stand.The sources said the Corporation was looking at the old dump yard in Eru Company, at the junction of Sanganoor Road-Mettupalayam Road, as a possible alternative location for either the wholesale or retail market.Likewise at those markets and the one on Ramar Kovil Street in Ukkadam, the Corporation had also planned to ask the traders to regulate the entry and exit of customers so that at the entry point, they could be screened for temperature, given sanitisers and checked for mask, the sources added.In a related development, the Corporation slapped  10,000 fine on traders and customers at T.K. Market and Ramar Kovil Street market."

The restaurant, which boasts a food menu conceived by Michelin-starred Chef Atul Kochhar of Benares, London fame, and executed by Chef Tanvi Goswami, has just introduced an Experience Menu, curated by Kochhar, Available only on Sundays, it is a reflection of SAGAs food philosophy, weaving together the myriad flavours of the country into a nine-course meal that celebrates Indias rich culinary legacies in clean contemporary settings. Speaking of settings, the restaurant itself is stunning, sprawling over three floors and an al fresco area, with the focal point being a bar that towers up through the entire restaurant, requiring mixologists to travel up and down using lifts and pulleys.All of that spectacle is reinforced by some truly stellar cocktails, but more on those later. Going back to the food, Kochhar says, Through this menu we would like to give an experience, which is culturally rich and speaks volume of our heritage and love for food. The menu is brought to life keeping in mind different palates, touching key dishes from our a la carte offerings and also giving unparalleled dining experience. The Chefs Experience menu includes some of the best-selling dishes from the a la carte menu such as Crispy Crab, Ghee Roast Prawn, Sali Murg, Bhuna Mangsho, Edamame and Quinoa, Khari Paneer Tikka along with special dishes created for it, all washed down by a chilled glass of crisp Prosecco and live music by a violinist who traipses through the various floors and mezzanines of the space.Going with the non-vegetarian menu, we are pleased to make the acquaintance of dishes like the aforementioned crab and prawn. The fo rme r comprises a crackling soft shell crab (we recommend downing it in one bite if you have a large enough mouth and or a disdain for decorum), with dollops of saffron-spiked cream and a mustardy catsup, while the latter comes taco style, the Mangalorean prawn dish, scented with fennel and curry leaves, resting on a tortilla shell as delicate as a ballerinas ankles and just as tenacious, gamely managing to contain the shellfish as one wolfs it down.Helping us wash down this surfeit of seafood is the delicious Indo-Negroni, which gives a distinctly desi twist to the classic cocktail with cumin and citrus flavours. Next, we dally with the Himalayan Flavours (a Nepalese-inspi red Roas t Chicken Salad fired up with timur pepper and tart tomatoes) and Lentil Love (comprising slow-cooked lentils fortified with onion and garlic and served in a tart shell which gives the otherwise simple legumes a more complex texture and crumble, making it all the more welcome). We also take a dip in the Lonar Lake, a signature cocktail of SAGA that is a medley of gin, Aperol (an Italian bitter), Orgeat syrup and sparkling wine, perfumed with kaffir lime leaves.Swimming may be out this year but this is definitely something we could dive into again and again. In the interest of brevity, we shall refrain from further details, but suffice it to say that the main courses, which included Sali Murg (Parsi Chicken), Bhuna Mangsho (Bengali style goat mutton) and the Family Affair (a multi-grain khichdi for the whole family to pass around), were each delicious and individual in their own way. For desserts, there is the Petha (an ambrosial cloud of rabadi festooned with orange jelly, winter melon candy and rose) and the Pilgrims Sweet (a platter packed with plum cake, Panchamarat ice-cream, date treacle and wheat halwa). With the menu expected to change seasonally, given Kochhars emphasis of taking cues from nature, diners can keep enjoying new tastes from the country we call home.DETAILSAT: Vatika Atrium, Golf Course Road, Sector 53, GurugramTIMING: Every Sunday, 12:00pm-4:00pm, 7:00pm-11:00pmCOST PER HEAD: Rs 2,995 ++"

The latest to do so is actor Kajal Aggarwal, who has been on a plant-based for many years. Taking to Twitter, she shared why one needs to strive towards environmental sustainability by making the switch from animal and marine foods to plant-based.The 35-year-old shared how the Netflix documentary film, Seaspiracy, has put the spotlight back on the fisheries industry and the cruelty that exists within it.SAVE OUR OCEANS.

From plastic to slavery, bycatch of dolphins for the sake of pest-control to the slaughter of whales and bluefin tuna.

Terribly sad but true. And the only way to conserve our oceans is to stop eating marine animals. Why would we want to consume lead, mercury, and microplastic in any case?

(Source; Getty Images/Thinkstock)A plant-based diet is known to include fruits such as berries, bananas, apples, grapes, melons, citrus fruits, among others; vegetables like broccoli, beetroot, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, etc.; legumes like kidney beans, black beans, peas and chickpeas; seeds, nuts, whole grains, and plant-based milk like coconut, almond, soy, to name a few.Addressing concerns that making a complete switch to a plant-based diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies, the actor remarked, I have been on plant-based for many years now and I have absolutely no nutritional concerns/deficiencies.Advocating for active measures towards the environment, she added, We have to take a stand and do something about our environment now.

Park premises receives tomatoes from Talavadi in boxes and sells it to retailers across the district. About 3,800 boxes, each weighing 15 kg, arrives in the market and is sold for  280 to  350 a box. Since tomatoes are cultivated widely in Talavadi Hills, the arrival had increased in the past 10 to 15 days bringing down the price of the vegetable sharply, said Mani Anand, a wholesaler. He said the arrival of tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh had further pushed the price down as a box is sold anywhere between  50 and  80 on Wednesday. It cannot be stored for more than three days and hence is sold at  5 a kg here, he said.The 90-day crop is cultivated in November and December every year and harvesting is done from March to April during which the wholesale price at times falls to  2 a kg. Only if it rains heavily, the tomatoes rot in the plant pushing the price up, said another trader.Traders fear that with increase in arrival of tomatoes to the market, the price may go down further. Arrival usually drops in May after which prices would go up, they added. The retail price of tomato varies from  10 to  15 a kg across the district."
2021-04-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/taste-ukhrul-showcases-the-natural-produce-of-manipur-online/article34329349.ece,Taste Ukhrul brings the best Manipur’s natural bounty,"Leiyolan Vashum and Zeinorin Angkang are bringing the rich natural produce of Manipurs Ukhrul province to food lovers in various Indian cities, through e-commerceUkhrul, in Manipur, populated by the indigenous Tangkhul tribe, is a land is nestled in natures bounty, steeped in ancient tradition and buoyed by a modern outlook.Leiyolan Vashum and Zeinorin Angkang of Ukhrul tell the story of their people, through their rich produce. The couple, with a background in Management and Communication Studies, started Hill Wild in the winter of 2017. The business became popular for its confections infused with local produce, but took a detour in 2020. With the arrival of the pandemic, everything came to a grinding halt, explains Zeinorin, as she juggles online orders and social media updates.What the company stumbled upon as a predicament last year, soon transformed into an opportunity. On one hand, access to produce was limited, while on the other, plentiful harvest could not make it to consumers on time. So we launched Taste Ukhrul, a brand that would bring artisanal produce from the region to the rest of the country, and create a network for farmers to sell their harvest, Zeinorin says.Zeinorin Angkang and Leiyolan Vashum. Photo: Special Arrangement/THE HINDUThey had clearly hit the spot: in the midst of lockdown, the small business was inundated with online orders. I remember our small team packing till 11pm once, so we could meet our dispatch deadline the next day, Zeinorin recounts.Under the umbrella of Taste Ukhrul, a bouquet of unique produce is harvested, minimally processed and packed for shipment. Ukhrul plums, Sirarakhong chilli , Sivathei/king chilli (hitting a whopping million units on the Scoville Heat Scale), Kachai lemon, Ningthee sumac berry, Raphei perilla seeds (used in salads and with meats), wild figs, dried wild apples, kiwi candy and ginger powder have made their way to kitchens across India.We want to showcase Ukhruls tasty natural produce. With its amazing terrain, rainfall and proximity to the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot, Ukhrul has a cornucopia of delicious spices, vegetables and fruit. This venture motivates our small land-holder farmers and even our youth, to take up agriculture not just to sustain ourselves, but to ensure food security, Zeinorin explains.Sirarakhong chilli. Photo: Jim Kason, Special Arrangement/THE HINDUTaste Ukhrul is now working with over 200 farmers, with more additions every season. Our recent work on International Womens Day with Talui garlic farmers makes us particularly joyous. Two hundred women planted the same garlic on small patches of land, grown without pesticides. They gathered manure from the forest, mulched it regularly, adding organic compost as fertilizer. The same heirloom garlic, now yields collective sales with equitable wealth distribution across the community, states Zeinorin.The little victories are truly sweet, reminisces the couple, Just before Diwali, Ukhrul had at least 10 tonnes of harvested kiwi fruit and some farmers approached us to speed up sales when the stock was fresh. We sold three tonnes of fresh kiwi locally, but we had to think on our feet to preserve the rest of it.She says they finally made it into sweet-sour kiwi candy, by slicing the fruit thin, soaking it in sugar and then dehydrating it under the sun. This was just one of the many instances for us where we felt a sense of responsibility to our farming community, Zeinorin says.Grassroots firstErnest Luikham, a local farmer with disability, grows tree tomatoes. His rich harvest from a 1,500-tree farm has inspired local women to source produce from him for their pickle business.Food is enjoyed the best, when you know where its grown and who lovingly tended to it. Shangshangwung Huileng, who returned to Ukhrul from Chennai, started a cabbage farm. Initially we got our cabbage from other states, but now Huileng has risen to the challenge and is trying to meet local needs with his amazing, organic cabbage. We see such a spark with our youth, to be self-sufficient and support the local economy, Zeinorin says.The collective has had some artistic collaborations too.Dimapur-based jewellery and home-decor business Runway Nagaland, for instance, has created hand-embroidered pouches for Taste Ukhrul.The journey has not been easy, despite the success. We took a big leap of faith during the lockdown and sunk our own resources at considerable risk. But I think it is paying off now. We have brands based in Switzerland and across the USA who are buying from us, Zeinorin says. She adds, This augurs well for our farmers, who reap rich dividends, and these small partnerships form the base for future collaborations."
