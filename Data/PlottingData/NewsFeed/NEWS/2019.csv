to rs 30 lakh. after the farmers filed a police complaint, the cops found nobody at the address provided by the farmers.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------mumbais conmen have found a new target: gullible farmers of nashik.over the past one year, eight cases have been registered with the police at pimpalgaon, a town an hours drive from nashik known for. all eight cases involve farmers growing either onions or grapes and who were cheated by exporters based out of mumbai and thane.in all eight cases the exporters offered to buy the farmers produce for rates much higher than what they would get locally. while initial payments were made, cheques began bouncing subsequently.after chasing them for payments for months  making multiple visits to their offices and residences in mumbai  when the cheated farmers filed police complaints, the businessmen filed counter-complaints of kidnapping, assault and even molestation against them in mumbai and nashik.now the farmers are caught between making round of police stations and courts to recover the lost money on the one hand, and on the other defending themselves against trumped up charges.some of these farmers dreamt of bettering their lot and floated their own companies. they acquired trading licences and started out on their own, but because they lacked both business expertise and experience, they were sitting ducks for the rogue traders.ajit patil, a 46-year-old onion farmer from deopur village in nashiks niphad tehsil, along with his six brothers launched a company named vrindavan export around seven years ago. patil and his brothers initially conducted business without any outside help and did well for themselves. in 2014, four people from sion koliwada approached patil with a deal to sell his produce at good prices abroad. they introduced themselves as executives of a company named sreenathji food agro pvt ltd.over the next four years, patil not only sent his produce over to sreenathji food, he also collected grapes and onions from farmers around pimpalgaon and handed these over to the company. it was all smooth for a few months, after which the payments stopped. last year, patil filed a police complaint against sreenathji food saying he hasnt been paid rs 4.61 crore. patils company has been shut, hes fallen into debt trap, and worse, the wife of sreenathji foods owner has filed a police complaint against him alleging molestation.im ruined, says patil, rajan munni, who owns sreenathji food, is nowhere to be found. my complaint is pending since august last year and i am battling charges of molesting munnis wife. and i have to answer the creditors.interestingly, munni was recently booked by the bhoiwada police for allegedly cheating a 75-year-old customs official of rs 8.17 crore through a ponzi scheme.another farmer doing the rounds of a mumbai police station is 48-yearold gopi shaikh from pimpalgaon, who says a mumbai exporter owes him rs 18 lakh. soon after the cheques issued by the exporter bounced, shaikh filed a police complaint on august 17. he was in for a shock when he received a call a few days later from the azad maidan police station, where the exporter filed a cross-complaint saying shaikh had kidnapped him and forced him to sign on the cheques.shaikh travels to mumbai all the way from pimpalgaon every time the police summons him.shaikh, an onion farmer, says he rues the day he met the exporter, maqbool noor, who runs a firm called noor imports and exports, and who sold him the idea to export his produce to dubai. shaikh had secured his trading licence in 2016 in the name of his firm al-umar fruit and vegetable suppliers and was keen to expand his business.noor said that he had contacts in the middle east and he could help me export my produce there. between january 2018 and may this year, i supplied 29,000-kg onions, worth rs 30 lakh, and got paid only rs 12 lakh, shaikh says.he says that his is a fledgling company, launched with the help of a partner, and a loss of rs 18 lakh is a death knell to his business. because a majority of our business is conducted on trust, i did not insist on documentation. once the payments stopped coming, i made several trips to his office at fort but couldnt get a penny out of him because there was nothing on paper, he says.on june 16 at the, the two men had an altercation in full public view which landed at the police station. noor issued post-dated cheques of rs 18 lakh in front of the cops at pimpalgaon. all the cheques bounced and now there is a case against me saying i had kidnapped him and obtained the cheques forcefully, shaikh says.noors son ahmad claims that it was shaikhs intention to extort from his father. not only did he threaten my father, he went on to kidnap him during his visit to pimpalgaon. hes now playing the victim, but we have filed a case against him at azad maidan police station, ahmad says.officers at both azad maidan and pimpalgaon police stations would only say that all documents have been submitted before the court.even as the law says that the accused in the cheque-bouncing cases will have to be immediately arrested and produced in court under the negotiable instruments act, the complainant doesnt get the money back immediately. in the cases where the farmers have filed a police complaint, the accused have managed to get bail.the farmers cases are also weakened by the fact that the business of agriculture in maharashtra is run on trust, and theres rarely anything on paper. senior inspector sanjay mahajan from pimpalgaon police station stresses on this problem and says the farmers are vulnerable to frauds largely because trust has always been the backbone of the business of agriculture.no agreements exist. the farmers dont even know the names of the companies they are dealing with, leave alone their addresses, he says.mahajan says the police have launched a drive at all 18 villages near the pimpalgaon market to make the farmers aware of such frauds. we are stressing on the need to possess legal documents before entering into any deal.even then, the numbers of those cheated could be much larger than what the police complaints reflect. for instance, several farmers in pimpalgaon and the nearby villages who have been similarly cheated havent approached the police fearing countercomplaints. they call it a double whammy: pay the lawyers to fight the case filed by them and pay another set of lawyers in mumbai to defend them in cases filed by the exporters or their kin. two such examples are onion cultivators asif shaikh and shivaji deore.shaikh says hes yet to receive rs 19 lakh from a mumbai-based trading company while deore is waiting for an exporter to clear his dues amounting to rs 24 lakh. both havent approached the police; instead they are hoping for some sort of divine intervention or a miracle. in deores case, he hasnt received money for exports to pakistan in the wake of the troubles between the two countries.deore says the rogue exporters know how to bully the farmers. the exporter in mumbai who has to pay me issued the cheques, but brazenly told me that theyll bounce. he said that i had a choice to wait or battle it out in the court. he says hell pay me once he receives the payments from other parties and im hoping he sticks to his word, deore told this newspaper.another stumbling block for the farmers  and this goes back to the lack of documentation while doing the deal  is they are rarely able to provide the police with the defaulters addresses. in the case of ajit patil, all he knew was that sreenathji food agro pvt ltd was operating out of a few buildings in sion koliwada. when the police reached the address, they found nobody.similarly, grape cultivator vaibhav patil, who along with 20 other farmers was allegedly duped by a thane-based exporter named ravi sharma of rs 30 lakh, realised the addresses and contact details of sharma could be fake when he found nobody at the address provided. the police have informed us that the address we provided doesnt exist. there is no sign of the exporter who owes us money, patil says.

grapes and who were cheated by exporters based out of mumbai and thane.in all eight cases the exporters offered to buy the farmers produce for rates much higher than what they would get locally. while initial payments were made, cheques began bouncing subsequently.after chasing them for payments for months  making multiple visits to their offices and residences in mumbai  when the cheated farmers filed police complaints, the businessmen filed counter-complaints of kidnapping, assault and even molestation against them in mumbai and nashik.now the farmers are caught between making round of police stations and courts to recover the lost money on the one hand, and on the other defending themselves against trumped up charges.some of these farmers dreamt of bettering their lot and floated their own companies. they acquired trading licences and started out on their own, but because they lacked both business expertise and experience, they were sitting ducks for the rogue traders.ajit patil, a 46-year-old onion farmer from deopur village in nashiks niphad tehsil, along with his six brothers launched a company named vrindavan export around seven years ago. patil and his brothers initially conducted business without any outside help and did well for themselves. in 2014, four people from sion koliwada approached patil with a deal to sell his produce at good prices abroad. they introduced themselves as executives of a company named sreenathji food agro pvt ltd.over the next four years, patil not only sent his produce over to sreenathji food, he also collected grapes and onions from farmers around pimpalgaon and handed these over to the company. it was all smooth for a few months, after which the payments stopped. last year, patil filed a police complaint against sreenathji food saying he hasnt been paid rs 4.61 crore. patils company has been shut, hes fallen into debt trap, and worse, the wife of sreenathji foods owner has filed a police complaint against him alleging molestation.im ruined, says patil, rajan munni, who owns sreenathji food, is nowhere to be found. my complaint is pending since august last year and i am battling charges of molesting munnis wife. and i have to answer the creditors.interestingly, munni was recently booked by the bhoiwada police for allegedly cheating a 75-year-old customs official of rs 8.17 crore through a ponzi scheme.another farmer doing the rounds of a mumbai police station is 48-yearold gopi shaikh from pimpalgaon, who says a mumbai exporter owes him rs 18 lakh. soon after the cheques issued by the exporter bounced, shaikh filed a police complaint on august 17. he was in for a shock when he received a call a few days later from the azad maidan police station, where the exporter filed a cross-complaint saying shaikh had kidnapped him and forced him to sign on the cheques.shaikh travels to mumbai all the way from pimpalgaon every time the police summons him.shaikh, an onion farmer, says he rues the day he met the exporter, maqbool noor, who runs a firm called noor imports and exports, and who sold him the idea to export his produce to dubai. shaikh had secured his trading licence in 2016 in the name of his firm al-umar fruit and vegetable suppliers and was keen to expand his business.noor said that he had contacts in the middle east and he could help me export my produce there. between january 2018 and may this year, i supplied 29,000-kg onions, worth rs 30 lakh, and got paid only rs 12 lakh, shaikh says.he says that his is a fledgling company, launched with the help of a partner, and a loss of rs 18 lakh is a death knell to his business. because a majority of our business is conducted on trust, i did not insist on documentation. once the payments stopped coming, i made several trips to his office at fort but couldnt get a penny out of him because there was nothing on paper, he says.on june 16 at the, the two men had an altercation in full public view which landed at the police station. noor issued post-dated cheques of rs 18 lakh in front of the cops at pimpalgaon. all the cheques bounced and now there is a case against me saying i had kidnapped him and obtained the cheques forcefully, shaikh says.noors son ahmad claims that it was shaikhs intention to extort from his father. not only did he threaten my father, he went on to kidnap him during his visit to pimpalgaon. hes now playing the victim, but we have filed a case against him at azad maidan police station, ahmad says.officers at both azad maidan and pimpalgaon police stations would only say that all documents have been submitted before the court.even as the law says that the accused in the cheque-bouncing cases will have to be immediately arrested and produced in court under the negotiable instruments act, the complainant doesnt get the money back immediately. in the cases where the farmers have filed a police complaint, the accused have managed to get bail.the farmers cases are also weakened by the fact that the business of agriculture in maharashtra is run on trust, and theres rarely anything on paper. senior inspector sanjay mahajan from pimpalgaon police station stresses on this problem and says the farmers are vulnerable to frauds largely because trust has always been the backbone of the business of agriculture.no agreements exist. the farmers dont even know the names of the companies they are dealing with, leave alone their addresses, he says.mahajan says the police have launched a drive at all 18 villages near the pimpalgaon market to make the farmers aware of such frauds. we are stressing on the need to possess legal documents before entering into any deal.even then, the numbers of those cheated could be much larger than what the police complaints reflect. for instance, several farmers in pimpalgaon and the nearby villages who have been similarly cheated havent approached the police fearing countercomplaints. they call it a double whammy: pay the lawyers to fight the case filed by them and pay another set of lawyers in mumbai to defend them in cases filed by the exporters or their kin. two such examples are onion cultivators asif shaikh and shivaji deore.shaikh says hes yet to receive rs 19 lakh from a mumbai-based trading company while deore is waiting for an exporter to clear his dues amounting to rs 24 lakh. both havent approached the police; instead they are hoping for some sort of divine intervention or a miracle. in deores case, he hasnt received money for exports to pakistan in the wake of the troubles between the two countries.deore says the rogue exporters know how to bully the farmers. the exporter in mumbai who has to pay me issued the cheques, but brazenly told me that theyll bounce. he said that i had a choice to wait or battle it out in the court. he says hell pay me once he receives the payments from other parties and im hoping he sticks to his word, deore told this newspaper.another stumbling block for the farmers  and this goes back to the lack of documentation while doing the deal  is they are rarely able to provide the police with the defaulters addresses. in the case of ajit patil, all he knew was that sreenathji food agro pvt ltd was operating out of a few buildings in sion koliwada. when the police reached the address, they found nobody.similarly, grape cultivator vaibhav patil, who along with 20 other farmers was allegedly duped by a thane-based exporter named ravi sharma of rs 30 lakh, realised the addresses and contact details of sharma could be fake when he found nobody at the address provided. the police have informed us that the address we provided doesnt exist. there is no sign of the exporter who owes us money, patil says.

797, AN unusual move with less than a month to go for state elections in Maharashtra and Haryana- the central government Sunday decided to ban the export of onions in a bid to control the retail price hike across the country.AdvertisingThis is the fourth decision taken by the central government this year to control the price hike in onions. Assembly elections in the BJP-ruled states of Maharashtra and Haryana are scheduled to be held on October 21.An order issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) under the Commerce Ministry said that the export policy of onion is amended from free to prohibited till further orders. It said that export of all varieties of onions is prohibited with immediate effect.Union Minister for Food and Civil Supplies Ram Vilas Paswan also announced a stock limit for onions.

quarter.advertisingbut amidst this overall dismal picture, some early signs of green shoots are visible.to start with, we have inflation numbers based on the consumer price index (cpi). for 36 months running, from september 2016 to august 2019, consumer food inflation trailed general cpi inflation. this extended period of low food price increases  an average of 1.38% year-on-year, unprecedented in india  has seemingly ended. for september 2019, cpi food inflation stood at 5.11%, as against 3.99% for overall consumer inflation.the improved price sentiment for farm produce is also borne out by the rates for kharif crops that are arriving in wholesale mandis of the country. in most cases, these, even while ruling below the minimum support prices declared by the narendra modi government for the 2019-20 season, are more than what they were at this time last year. the turnaround, as the accompanying table reveals, is most significant in pulses and soyabean. only for cotton are prices lower relative to last year.advertisinghowever, it is not only the msp crops. onion in maharashtras lasalgaon market is trading at an average of rs 3,500 per quintal, compared to rs 1,550 a year ago. farmers in the state are also receiving rs 28-29 for a litre of cow milk containing 3.5% fat and 8.5% solids-not-fat, which is better than the corresponding last years levels of rs 23-24. prices of red chilli (the high-pungency teja variety) in gunturs mirchi yard are today around rs 16,000 per quintal, up from rs 9,000-10,000 one year back.one reason for prices looking up is heavy rains across central, western and southern india through september and the current month. the monsoons late withdrawal has caused damage to the kharif crop that was at maturity stage (especially soyabean in madhya pradesh) and also led to delayed harvesting of urad (black gram), moong (green gram), onion and assorted vegetables. in maize, yields have been impacted by infestation of the fall armyworm insect pest, apart from drought conditions in maharashtra and karnataka till late-july. many farmers in maharashtra are reported to have diverted their maize crop for fodder well before it had reached grain formation stage.another reason for price recovery is supply pressures. these, in turn, are a result of sustained low prices in the recent past. in milk, for instance, not getting good prices over the last four years or more has led to farmers gradually reducing herd sizes or underfeeding their animals. the effects of that are being felt now, with dairies having to pay higher procurement prices. they are being forced to do so also because of the drought-induced fodder and feed shortages, which should ease in the coming months with the monsoons spectacular recovery after july.the above firming up of prices is, perhaps, the only heartening piece of news for the indian economy buffeted by a consumption slowdown on top of a prolonged investment slump. moreover, the country has recorded its best southwest monsoon since 1994. the excess rains have not only helped substantially recharge the groundwater table and aquifers, but also resulted in water levels in 120 major reservoirs being filled to 89.1% of their full capacities, as against the last 10-years average storage of 71.6% at this time. the positive effect of this will be seen in the upcoming rabi season.the best case scenario will be if the present price uptrend  actually, a recovery from lows  holds and, together with a bumper rabi crop, would deliver the much-needed boost to farm incomes after april. that will, to a great deal, depend on policymakers tolerance to price increases, even of an episodic nature.the modi governments first term was marked by general hawkishness, reflected in the frequent resort to export restrictions, duty-free imports and imposition of stocking restrictions on farm produce at the slightest hint of inflationary pressures. in its present term, this approach has been witnessed so far only vis--vis onions, where both export ban and stock limits on the trade are in place.it remains to be seen whether the modi government will be emboldened to look beyond temporary supply disruptions to take the next big reform step  of dismantling all controls on marketing, movement, stocking and export of agricultural produce. the timing cannot be better than now, when farm prices have bottomed out and production prospects for the rabi season seem particularly bright on the back of probably the best monsoon in quarter of a century. this is something that fmcg companies and

more return than from non-basmati varieties even at a guaranteed msp of rs 1,835/quintal on 34-35 quintals/acre. progressive farmers like him are able to harvest high yields through practices such as incorporating crop stubble into the soil (rather than burning) and applying farm yard manure, in addition to granular sulphur and other secondary nutrients.talwinder singh of nauli village in

cotton acreage from 2.67 lh to 3.91 lh. the reduced non-basmati area would mean less pressure on government procurement agencies. within basmati, a significant switch from pusa-1121 to pusa-1718 has taken place. g.s. bal, chief agricultural officer of amritsar, estimates the new variety to cover 30-35% of the districts basmati area of 1.39 lh this time.increased planting, of course, comes with price risk. farmer realisations have been good in the last couple of years due to a rebound in basmati exports (see table). the value of shipments have marginally slipped during april-june ($ 1,255 million versus $ 1,285 million in the same quarter of 2018-19), with the payment problems in iran adding to the uncertainty.one way to protect the countrys export interests is by preserving basmatis premium quality attributes  aroma, long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking and fluffiness  and minimising use of chemical pesticides. the punjab government, last month, issued an advisory to farmers not to spray formulations of five insecticides (acephate, thiamethoxam, triazophos, buprofezin and carbofuran) and four fungicides (tricyclazole, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim and propiconazole).an alternative approach to pesticide application is to breed for disease resistance. this is what iari scientists have sought to do through transfer of specific disease-resistance genes, from landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy, into existing high-yielding basmati varieties. pusa-1718 is a result of such marker-assisted backcross breeding, which helps avoid use of streptomycin or tetracycline combinations to control bacterial blight.a similar variety pusa-1637 has been bred by incorporating a pi9 gene, sourced from oryza minuta (a wild relative of the normal cultivated oryza sativa paddy), into the popular pusa basmati-1. this gene provides high-to-moderate resistance against leaf and neck blast, obviating the need to spray fungicides such as tricyclazole, azoxystrobin and picoxystrobin.advertisingvijay setia, president of the all india rice exporters association, feels pusa-1718 is a good variety. but he emphasises that farmers should not put all their eggs in a single variety, while advocating tough action against companies aggressively marketing pesticides. so long as an insects population is below the economic threshold level  at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest  there is no need to spray at all, he points out.

farmers not to spray formulations of five insecticides (acephate, thiamethoxam, triazophos, buprofezin and carbofuran) and four fungicides (tricyclazole, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim and propiconazole).an alternative approach to pesticide application is to breed for disease resistance. this is what iari scientists have sought to do through transfer of specific disease-resistance genes, from landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy, into existing high-yielding basmati varieties. pusa-1718 is a result of such marker-assisted backcross breeding, which helps avoid use of streptomycin or tetracycline combinations to control bacterial blight.a similar variety pusa-1637 has been bred by incorporating a pi9 gene, sourced from oryza minuta (a wild relative of the normal cultivated oryza sativa paddy), into the popular pusa basmati-1. this gene provides high-to-moderate resistance against leaf and neck blast, obviating the need to spray fungicides such as tricyclazole, azoxystrobin and picoxystrobin.advertisingvijay setia, president of the all india rice exporters association, feels pusa-1718 is a good variety. but he emphasises that farmers should not put all their eggs in a single variety, while advocating tough action against companies aggressively marketing pesticides. so long as an insects population is below the economic threshold level  at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest  there is no need to spray at all, he points out.

1359,rmeet Singh- 60,,0.729295595409776,POTATO,2019-09-16,Anomaly,Anomaly,AJNALA,1.996007984031936,7.0,2019-08-17,Anomaly,2019-08-04,PUNJAB," a tall land-owning farmer in bhattiwal khurd village, which is located in punjabs sangrur district, has yet again planted the water-guzzling paddy crop this summer (kharif) as he is sceptical of any other crop fetching him a remunerative price.standing on the edge of the ghaggar branch canal, which flows barely a few metres away from his field, gurmeet reveals that hardly anyone in the village irrigates his/her field with canal water. that is because motor-operated tube wells, with their powerful submersible pumps, have become an easy and preferred choice for most of the households to extract groundwater, he says.punjabs policy of providing free electricity to farmers, in place since 1997, along with the central governments favourable attitude towards paddy cultivation, are the key factors that have motivated farmers like gurmeet to persist with paddy, despite the grave groundwater crisis faced by the state.most of us here in the village have tube wells installed, be it on our farm or inside our houses. we use groundwater for irrigation, drinking and other domestic purposes. in 1977, we got our first tube well drilled at a depth of 35 ft-40 ft. water at that time was easily available at 15 ft-20 ft. since then, we have drilled as many as four tube wells as the water levels have been consistently falling. i got the latest one installed two years ago at around 300 ft. it cost me around 1,00,000, he says, his head dropping in despair as he mentions the high cost of his latest tube well.the green revolution impactgurmeets father magar singh, 90, intervenes to point out that farmers like him shifted to cultivation of rice and wheat during the hara inquilab (green revolution); till then, he says, crops like pulses, maize, vegetables and cotton were mainly grown in the village.paddy (rice) requires far more water than other crops and as farmers started cultivating paddy, the need for tube wells arose. the extraction of groundwater only increased as farmers shifted from the use of monoblock pumps in the 1980s to other types like submersible pumps, he says.ideally, groundwater should be available at a depth of 50 ft to 60 ft, but in punjab, its level has significantly dropped to 150ft to 200 ft in most places. many attribute this drastic fall to an indiscriminate extraction of groundwater in the last two decades.further, deepening of tube wells, and purchase of the powerful motors to carry out the deepening, is costing farmers 1,100 crore per year, according to government data. the state, which gives free power to farmers, is also facing an increased financial burden due to the rising use of electricity. this year, the total power subsidy to the farm sector is estimated at 9,674 crore.to counter this, the punjab state farmers policy, drafted by the states farmers and farm workers commission in june last year, suggested rationalising of power subsidy and asked the government to restrict the subsidy to the non-income tax payee farmers. it also recommended that cultivation of paddy on common lands be disallowed. common (shamlat) village lands, whose utilisation is regulated under punjab village common lands (regulation) act 1961, have been increasingly used for paddy cultivation over the years. experts feel that a restriction on such usage can help arrest groundwater depletion. the government, however, is yet to take a final call on these policy proposals.the punjab government is well aware of the fast depleting groundwater reserves. last month, chief minister captain amarinder singh directed the state planning board to chalk out a comprehensive crop diversification model. the board was also directed to undertake a detailed review of the various schemes of the agriculture department to bring in much-needed reforms in the sector.the chief minister, who has been stressing the need to prioritise the cultivation of crops that consume less water like maize, cotton and sugar cane, asked the board to come up with a strategy to persuade the farmers to shift to these crops.however, while the state government has been advocating crop diversification to save groundwater, farmers dont seem to be keen on shifting to other crops unless they are given an assured market and a guaranteed price for their produce. i am aware that paddy consumes more water than other crops but what is the alternative? government agencies purchase rice and wheat (during rabi season) at the minimum support price (msp), which assures me of a remunerative return. but in the case of other crops, theres hardly any such assurance. the government should purchase all major crops at msp as is done in case of rice and wheat; until then, it's difficult to shift, says randhir singh, 51, who grows paddy at his three-acre farm in bhattiwal khurd village.this sentiment is echoed in other parts of the state as well. in fatehpur village, located in the chief ministers pocket borough of patiala, karamjeet singh says that after suffering financial loss owing to a price crash in the market, he stopped the cultivation of potato a few years ago. three years ago, i planted a potato crop in my field but prices in the market crashed badly. the potato was fetching as low as 2 per kilo in the market. i couldnt even recover the cost of my crop and suffered a loss of around 3,00,000. since then, i have stopped its cultivation and have been sowing rice and wheat, for which i am assured of getting a remunerative price as government agencies will purchase my produce at the msp, he says, as he takes a seat along with his fellow farmers at the public shed in the village.wrong to blame farmersas the farmers beat the heat and humidity of an august afternoon under a fan mounted on the sheds ceiling, ajaib singh, 62, points out that it is wrong to blame farmers for groundwater depletion. there are industries and factories that are extracting a huge amount of groundwater  legally and illegally. not only this, the unsystematic disposal of waste from these industries is contaminating the water, making it increasingly alkaline, he says.for dilbag singh, 43, usage of water from the kherimala branch (canal), which flows barely three km from the village, is an affordable and doable way to reduce dependence on groundwater. the government needs to upgrade and work on maintenance of canal irrigation system. it needs to ensure the supply of water at tail-ends [the last part of the water outlet]. if an underground pipeline system can be laid, it will help us optimise water use. also, it will check the theft of canal water, he says.farmers like me are using tube wells because its an easy way of extracting water with powerful submersible pumps these days, but if the government develops a mechanism and lays a pipeline till my farm, why would i need to invest in a tube well? i remember we used to get water in canal outlets and also from wells for irrigation during the 1980s, but now almost every house in the village has a tube well, says kesar singh, 52, who has sown rice in his five-acre farm.another rice-growing farmer, nirmal singh, who is a farmer leader as well, points out that the government needs to focus on establishing an assured market mechanism. what farmers want is a market  where the purchase of their products is guaranteed and they get an assured remunerative price, he says.punjabs economy is highly dependent on agriculture. the sector. however, is experiencing slower growth as the states cropping intensity and irrigation potential have been fully exploited and the growth in productivity has also reached a saturation point.the intensive groundwater extraction in the last five decades through installation of shallow tube wells is reflected in tube well numbers  which have increased by almost 200% in 35 years, from six lakh in the 1980s to 14.76 lakh in 2017-18. also, the area under rice cultivation has increased from 11.83 lakh hectares in 1980 to 28.86 lakh hectares in 2017-18. on an average, there are 34 tube wells per sq. km of net sown area in punjab (2015-16).according to the draft dynamic ground water estimation report-2017, 109 blocks out of the 138 blocks taken for its study were over-exploited, two blocks were critical and five blocks were semi-critical while 20 blocks are in safe category. the water table was declining in nearly 80% of the area of the state.the report also said that while the annual replenishable groundwater resource in punjab was about 17.5 million acre-ft (maf), the annual draft (extraction) was 29 maf, implying that the extraction rate outstripped availability by quite a few notches.if this trend continues, it will adversely affect the agricultural economy of the state and it is apprehended that irrigated area may decrease by up to 15% in the year 2025. further, in the coming 20 years, supply from about 60% of top aquifers may be jeopardised. there will be an increase in the cost of raising crops, placing an increased financial burden on farmers and the government. a shortage in water supply could also act as a deterrent when it comes to investment in industries requiring water. around 30 million residents of the punjab region may face a collapse in agricultural output, says s.k. saluja, superintending engineer, directorate of ground water management.salinity in waterthe report also raised concerns about the deteriorating quality of groundwater due to pollution caused by urbanisation, industrialisation and an increased use of fertilisers and pesticides. it said that while nearly 50%-60% of groundwater was fresh and fit, 20%-30% was moderately saline and of marginal quality. further, about 15%-25% of the groundwater was saline, alkaline and not fit for irrigation.water in south and southwestern districts  like sangrur, muktsar, bathinda and mansa  came under the last category, containing varying concentration of soluble salts and its use for irrigation will adversely affect agricultural production, said the report.farmers in fatehpur, patiala, looking at an abandoned well, which once used to be a major water source for irrigation but has now run dry due to over-extraction of groundwater.an increased awareness about the need for safe drinking water has caused many households in bhattiwal khurd village to install ro (reverse osmosis) water purification systems. i felt the need for ro system at my home after my family members started falling ill due to water-borne diseases at regular intervals. we have been consuming groundwater directly from tube wells for a long time, says randhir singh.untreated industrial effluentsp.s. rangi, a noted agriculture economist and a former adviser to punjab state farmers commission, says that water quality is being impacted by untreated or inadequately treated industrial effluents and sewage that flows into rivulets and rivers in punjab.also, traditional water bodies such as ponds and wells in the villages are under threat. in most of the places, ponds have been filled and encroached upon while in other places, they have become a dumping ground for sewage. the problem is further compounded by the mixing of storm water and sewage in various municipal towns. the pollution and contamination of water resources due to industrial waste, sewage and excessive use of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a major cause of concern that needs immediate attention, says rangi.given the grim situation, punjabs department of water supply and sanitation is planning to implement 10 surface water projects at a cost of 1,021 crore. these projects intend to provide potable piped water supply to 1,021 quality-affected villages, making them less reliant on groundwater and more on canal water.a total of 130 such villages  including 85 uranium-affected villages in moga and 45 iron-affected ones in roopnagar  have so far been shifted from groundwater to canal water.lakhwinder singh, professor of economics at punjabi university, patiala, who has been mapping rural punjab for decades, asserts that agriculture in the state thrived in the past due to easy availability of both groundwater and surface water but, over the past few years, the availability has reached a saturation point.increase in indebtednesssuccessive state governments invested on drainage systems that saved crops from damage in the case of heavy and untimely rains. over the years, due to an incentivising of groundwater irrigation by the government and an irrational increase in the number of electric tube wells, water tables have receded. experts have been time and again cautioning the state on the long-term consequences of excessive exploitation of groundwater. now, farmers are forced to borrow from informal and formal sources to install tube wells, causing indebtedness and farmer suicides, says lakhwinder, adding that that faulty public policy and irrational cropping system should be blamed for the scenario.governments never visualised a scenario where agriculture would block the natural groundwater recharging process and create conditions for falling water tables, he says.he proposes that the drainage system be used for artificial recharge of groundwater. there is also a dire need to change the cropping pattern, especially in major parts of malwa, which need to take up cotton cultivation again, he says, adding that water recharging system, if put in place, can solve weather-related problems and economic incentives can be used to change farmers mindsets, making them shift to multi-cropping system.he feels that a major policy shift with long term vision can solve both the agrarian crisis and the problem of water depletion.realising the magnitude of agrarian crises, the draft policy framed by punjabs farmers and farm workers commission points out that a decade of business as usual has left farmers in an unenviable position.the policy strikes a cautious note in telling that the state is struggling to meet the aspirations of its farmers and the time has come to take a critical look at the deteriorating resources, the changing economic environment and the emerging market scenarios.

incidents of paddy straw burning in punjab and haryana have reduced in the last three years, experts feel that a lot more needs to be done. a committee constituted by the union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare to look into the issue of crop residue burning has flagged off serious concern regarding initiatives being taken by the state governments. the committee has called for an urgent need to look into after-sales service for the crop residue management (crm) machinery, especially happy seeders, in punjab and haryana. the committee has also recommended modification of agronomic practices according to local and farm-level conditions.the committee headed by nagesh singh, head and consultant in the centre for poverty studies and social registry of national institute of rural development (nird), has found that despite various efforts punjab has recorded the higher number of paddy farm fires in 2018 when compared with haryana. a total of 28.10 million tonnes of paddy straw was produced in punjab and haryana in 2018 out of which 11.3 million tonnes was burnt in fields. punjab accounted for 88.15% of the paddy straw burnt in these two states.this year, despite all measures, punjab saw 4,373 incidents of paddy straw burning till october 23. haryana has registered 2,714 farm fire incidents.around 23 million tonne of green house gases (ghgs) and particulate matter (pm) was estimated to be emitted from paddy residue burning in punjab, haryana and uttar pradesh in 2018. out of the 23 million tonnes of ghg and pm emission, punjab contributed 82%, haryana contributed 11% and up 7%. of the total emissions, carbon dioxide contributed 93.7% of the pollutants.in punjab, sangrur, bathinda, ferozepur, muktsar, mansa and patiala districts witnessed high incidence of paddy straw burning. whereas in haryana, highest number of farm fires were witnessed in fatehabad, sirsa, kaithal, karnal and kurukshetra. the committee has also recommended, some form of coercive action, such as imposition of fines on farmers still indulging in burning of paddy straw would also be helpful in combating straw burning.the committee, after interaction with various farmer bodies in a number of districts in punjab and haryana, has recommended, both the state governments would need to frame rules on after-sales service and work out an incentive/disincentive mechanism for machinery suppliers so that they invest in after-sales service.citing an example, the committee, during one of its visits to the sirsa district in haryana, found that after an initial one or two days, happy seeders developed snags and lack of after-sales support from the vendor left farmers with no other option but to resort to crop burning . another significant observation by the committee is that untrained or poorly trained happy seeder operators have resulted in unnecessary snags. this was pointed out by a farmer producer organisation, being assisted by a team of confederation of indian industry (cii) that is supporting crop residue management initiatives in 19 villages in ludhiana and patiala districts.the interaction with farmers also led the committee members come to a conclusion that delayed delivery of happy seeders is one of the main reasons for burning paddy residue. the committee, therefore, has strongly recommended that crm machinery needs to be provided to farmers latest by september 30. procurement of paddy in punjab grain markets starts from october 1.the committee has pointed out that many farmers took to crm machinery for sowing wheat for the first time in 2018. naturally, they were apprehensive. the committee, in its interaction with farmers has found out that those who used happy seeder for sowing wheat are satisfied with the growth of the wheat crop. the committee recommended that this should also be publicised among farmers.both punjab and haryana governments as well as the central government have been trying to convince farmers for a long time now to move from paddy-wheat cropping cycle and try something else. but these efforts have not been very successful, noted the committee.the other measure that the governments have been pushing quite aggressively through incentives is the utilisation of paddy straw in industrial applications, especially power generation.but the committee, after studying the ground scenario, feels that the most sustainable solution for paddy straw is its incorporation in the soil. this can be easily achieved by supporting farmers in buying crm machinery and running a sustained information, education and communication campaign for proper utilisation of the machinery, reads the report.many farmers have also told the committee that their choice of paddy varieties is influenced by the preference of the rice millers and the price that millers are willing to pay, outside the scope of the minimum support price. this is an issue that needs further examination and a solution that is acceptable to the farmers should be worked out, the committee has recommended.according to the farmers feedback, the earliest maturing variety of paddy, pr 126, had a higher brokerage percentage during milling. the committee pointed out there were reports that many millers had advertised in newspapers in may to discourage farmers from planting pr 126. punjab has a strong network of more than 3,600 rice mills and they play a major role in the varieties that the farmers grow, reads the report.in the study conducted by the committee, basmati paddy variety has come across as a crop that leaves behind very little residue, as it is harvested mostly manually. but this is a choice the governments have to consider carefully weighing in the other factor, basmati guzzles a lot of water than non-basmati varieties.

they play a major role in the varieties that the farmers grow, reads the report.in the study conducted by the committee, basmati paddy variety has come across as a crop that leaves behind very little residue, as it is harvested mostly manually. but this is a choice the governments have to consider carefully weighing in the other factor, basmati guzzles a lot of water than non-basmati varieties.

2567,o of the most iconic agrarian movements against the Fadnavis-led ruling government in the last four years- marked by striking images of farmers upturning milk cans on the roads and of callused,,0.7142014693754039,TOMATO,2019-05-13,Normal,Normal,PUNE,2.4958402662229617,7.0,2019-04-05,Anomaly,2019-03-31,MAHARASHTRA," bleeding feet of the tribal cultivators, marching into mumbai, were from the states north maharashtra region.as the region spread across six parliamentary constituencies goes to polls in less than a month, much water has flown under the godavari river, after the strike in 2017 and the long march in 2018. but the agrarian discontent and the dissatisfaction among tribals is still simmering. these are among the two central poll issues for the region that voted completely saffron in 2014 polls.the bjp has five sitting mps here, while one constituency, nashik, is with the shiv sena. beyond agrarian distress and drought that has affected all five districts here, caste calculations in individual seats, maratha vs obc vs scheduled tribes polarisation will also have an impact on the results. aware of the potential losses from the region, the bjp has turned down candidature for two of its sitting mps from the region, three-term mp from dindori harishchandra chavan and two-term mp from jalgaon at patil. but this has, in turn, led to internal factionalism in the bjp. the congress-ncp has an opportunity to improve their tally here, but it remains to be seen whether these parties can actually make use of an opportunity. while the congress could win back the tribal nandurbar belt, party bastion where it had lost no election until 2014; the ncp could potentially win dindori or even nashik due to local demographics and internal rivalries.agrarian distress and droughtdespite the loan waiver announced by the fadnavis government after the farmers strike in 2017, a majority of farmers are dissatisfied with the ruling government. the goodwill of the loan waiver granted to as many as 30lakh-plus farmers is not seen on ground zero.and even those who got the benefit now stand at the threshold of debt, thanks to drought. the drought this year has aggravated the disquiet, with farmers failing to recover, in many cases, even the production cost of crops. this year, i couldnt even recover the production cost of planting tomatoes over my two acres. i dont have the money to sow in june, said kailash kandbahale, a farmer from nashik district.despite this, kandbahale may vote for the shiv senas nashik candidate hemant godse and prime minister narendra modi. no government is good for farmers. the previous government was full of thieves and this one is made up of bandits. but modi is good for the countrys security. this is a urban constituency, which will anyway vote for the sena, then why should i waste my vote, kandbahale asked.he said that there was no modi wave like in 2014, but the pm continued to have a favourable image and was a deciding factor in urban areas. his extended family in dinodri, a largely rural constituency, however, will be backing nationalist congress party (ncp) candidate dhanraj mahale.political observers said that agrarian crisis continues to be one of the strongest poll issues that will go against the ruling government in rural areas. from jalgaons cotton and banana cultivators to nashiks onion, grape and vegetable farmers, there is no cultivator who is unaffected by the volatile market conditions and current drought. there is a clear urban-rural divide vis-a-vis class as well as caste, when it comes to bjp support and opposition. the middle class, also from upper castes based in cities, prefer modi and the bjp. in rural areas, there is anger against the modi government and this is most apparent among lower castes and farmers, said a senior editor with a local, vernacular newspaper.in nashik, for instance, there are nearly 8 lakh urban voters, of which a majority may be tilted in favour of the sena-bjp, while around 6 lakh voters are from the rural areas of the constituency. in dindori, a largely rural constituency, the agrarian distress, would have a greater impact.the tribal beltthe north maharashtras tribal belt, across the reserved constituencies of dindori, nandurbar and parts of nashik, is unhappy with the government over the processing of their forest rights act claims. last year, 30,000 tribal cultivators had marched from mumbai to nashik seeking justice and speedier disbursal of claims that will give them ownership rights over their land.barring surgana, where cpi (m) mla jp gavit followed up on the 12,000 claims, the government has totally failed to meet the promises made to the tribals. this is a serious issue, as is the ongoing agrarian unrest, said ashok dhawale, cpi (m) leader and head of the all india kisan sabha that played a central role in both the protests.gavit, the mla from akkalkuwa is also the cpi (m) candidate in the dindori seat, turning the poll table into a three-cornered fight. gavit, the man who led the marching 30,000 farmers, is a popular tribal leader. but this advantage to the opposition may be lost with gavit contesting the dindori seat. we had sought this seat from the ncp and they should have given it to us. they are after all the bigger party. we are contesting this seat to win, but there is a chance of the opposition votes being split between the ncp and us, said dhawale.the other subtle narrative in the tribal areas against the ruling government is the latters extension of economic and social benefits of tribal development department to the dhangar community (shepherd). the dhangars have been agitating for reservation in the scheduled tribe category for long. as the government could not deliver on this, fearing a backlash from the community, a cabinet decision was taken just ahead of the code of conduct to make all tribal linked schemes available to the dhangars.congress mla and candidate for nandurbar, kc padvis campaign takes up this issue and this could go against bjp candidate heena gavit. while gavit is not very popular, bjp leaders say in nandurbar city, support for modi will lift her chances of winning the seat.caste polarisationcaste calculations in each constituency will have an impact on the results as will the overall polarization between the marathas versus the other backward castes (obc).the states 16% reservation to the maratha community has not gone down well with the obcs, who form a significant chunk of voters in north maharashtra. in nashik a direct caste-based poll battle is likely with ncps sameer bhujbal, a mali (obc) being pitted against senas hemant godse (maratha). in dhule, bjp union minister subhash bhamre, an obc, will be pitted against congress candidate and mla kunal patil (maratha).in the case of dhule, minority votes will also make an impact as malegaon that has significant muslim votes, falls in this constituency. these votes will go to the congress, but may even lead to counter polarization, as it has for so many years in favour of the bjp.even in a reserved seat like nandurbar, for instance, the maratha vs obc factor will get played out with marathas in this case voting against gavit and in favour of the congress, while obcs may vote in favour of the bjp.the advantage in the polls will go to the party where the alliances are working together and the party organisation is activated. the bjp seems to score better than the remaining three parties when it comes to keeping its election machinery well oiled. the decision over jalgaon candidate, who was changed at the last minute is an indication that the bjp is not leaving much to chance. after minister girish mahajans close aide district jalgaon chief uday waghs wife and mlc smita wagh was given a ticket, the party witnessed opposition from ground level cadre. a survey showed that wagh was not popular and may not succeed against deokar, which led to the change in the candidate.the bjp is responsive and this may save us from the loss of one seat. the change was also done to dilute the rebellion by the sitting mp at patil, said a senior bjp leader.the congress, for a change, taking a leaf from the opponent also succeeded in stemming a rebellion from its nine-term mp manikrao gavit in nandurbar. gavit was upset as his son bharat was not given the ticket and bharat gavit had threatened to contest polls as an independent. central congress leaders met gavit and placated him after a half an hour meeting.first

2576,E BJP-LED NDA governments tenure has been marked by benign food prices. Consumer food inflation has ruled below general retail inflation for 31 months running- from September 2016 to March 2019,,0.7783980885595452,TOMATO,2019-06-10,Normal,Anomaly,SRINIVASAPUR,1.8930041152263373,8.0,2019-05-12,Normal,2019-04-28,KARNATAKA," while averaging a mere 1.3 per cent year-on-year during this period, as against 3.6 per cent for the latter.advertisingbut food inflation could well be the next governments first challenge, regardless of who heads it. the past couple of months have seen prices of a host of farm commodities surge, mainly on the back of drought in large parts of western and southern india, coupled with an early and harsher-than-usual summer.on friday, the average traded price of maize at davangere (karnataka) was rs 2,010 per quintal, compared to rs 1,120 a year ago. jowar and bajra were, likewise, selling for rs 2,750 per quintal (rs 1,600) at jalgaon (maharashtra) and rs 1,900 per quintal (rs 1,100) at chomu (rajasthan), respectively.a lower crop  31.5 million bales in 2018-19, down from 36.5 million bales last year  has led to kapas (raw un-ginned cotton), too, quoting at rs 5,800 per quintal in rajkot (gujarat), from rs 5,250 at this time last year.advertisingexplained good for farmers, not consumers this election, unlike previous ones, has not been fought on inflation. the central government, if at all, has faced flak not for high, but low prices of farm produce during its term. it makes the return of food inflation  bad for consumers, but good for farmers  that much trickier for the next government to handle.however, it isnt only coarse cereals and fibres.according to vipul mittal, head (fruits & vegetables) at the online grocery bigbasket.com, the average cost price of horticultural produce has gone up 13-15 per cent year-on-year since march. thus, tomato prices at karnatakas kolar market are currently averaging rs 2,000 per quintal, from rs 580 a year ago, while increasing from rs 655 to rs 850 for onion at lasalgaon (maharashtra). even summer season vegetables such as okra, bottle gourd and bitter gourd are wholesaling 36-39 per cent higher than last year; so is radish.the real problems, though, are in milk. most cattlefeed ingredients are costing much more now relative to last year. that includes not just maize, but also de-oiled rice bran (up from about rs 8,950 to rs 14,350 a tonne), fine rice polish (rs 16,750 to rs 20,350), molasses (rs 3,950 to rs 7,200) and guar churi/meal (rs 20,200 to rs 23,650).cottonseed oilcake prices have also risen from rs 19,000-22,000 to rs 27,500 per tonne since november-january.its only a matter of time before all this cost push translates into higher milk prices for consumers, says r s sodhi, managing director, gujarat co-operative milk marketing federation. the cooperative, better known by its amul brand, had registered a jump in average milk procurement from 176.5 lakh litres per day (llpd) in 2016-17 to 204.3 llpd in 2017-18 and 223 llpd in 2018-19.in this financial year, procurement has so far been 3 per cent lower year-on-year, despite our members union hiking prices from rs 570-580 per kg of fat in december-january to rs 630-650 now. even in north india, procurement prices of buffalo milk with 6.5 per cent fat has soared from rs 32-33 to rs 40 per litre in this period, says sodhi.while drought-induced fodder and feed shortages are a major cause of cost push and drop in milk procurement, r g chandramogan, managing director, hatsun agro product ltd, indias largest private sector dairy, also attributes it to sustained low prices over the last four years or more. not getting good prices for milk has shaken the confidence of farmers. they have been underfeeding their animals or reducing herd sizes, which is bound to affect supply at some point, he says.dairies were forced to slash procurement prices, especially after exports of skimmed milk powder (smp) from the country collapsed from 129,868 tonnes in 2013-14 to 34,490 tonnes in 2014-15 and 11,476 tonnes in 2017-18. in 2018-19, they recovered slightly to around 45,000 tonnes. the resultant depletion of stocks has, in turn, helped prop up domestic smp rates from rs 135-140 per kg to rs 210 levels in the last six months.another commodity that has witnessed improved price sentiment, of late, is sugar. the key driver has been drought in maharashtra. the state is expected to record 40 per cent lower cane area for the 2019-20 crushing season from october, with farmers  particularly in the marathwada region and surrounding areas of solapur, ahmednagar and nashik  reducing or not taking up plantings of the pre-seasonal (september-october) and suru (december-january) crops.my mill in osmanabad had roughly 15,000 hectares of cane area last season. for the next season, this may not touch 1,000 hectares. even the standing crop is being diverted by farmers for fodder, claims b b thombre, chairman, latur-based natural sugar and allied industries. he predicts that only 6-7 out of marathwadas 47 sugar mills will have enough cane to operate in the coming season.for now, the main ray of hope is the southwest monsoon. the met department has forecast aggregate rainfall during june-september to be 96 per cent of its long period average, making it a near normal season. but chandramogan feels that even if the monsoon turns out good and prices are finally looking up, farmers will not be able to step up production overnight, as agriculture isnt like switching on or turning off lights.mittal sees the current uptick in food prices as a healthy and necessary correction. it may look inflationary, but the fact is that before march-april, the year-on-year cost increases in fruits and vegetables was in the low single digits or even negative. farmers, then, couldnt recover their cultivation costs, which is not sustainable, he says.advertisingwhen the nda government took over in may 2014, annual consumer food inflation was in near double-digits. by end-2016, that was brought down to low single digits by end-2016. given the associated farm stress caused, it is unlikely that if food inflation returns, the next government  even if headed by prime minister narendra modi  would be inclined to adopt an overly hawkish approach.

so is radish.the real problems, though, are in milk. most cattlefeed ingredients are costing much more now relative to last year. that includes not just maize, but also de-oiled rice bran (up from about rs 8,950 to rs 14,350 a tonne), fine rice polish (rs 16,750 to rs 20,350), molasses (rs 3,950 to rs 7,200) and guar churi/meal (rs 20,200 to rs 23,650).cottonseed oilcake prices have also risen from rs 19,000-22,000 to rs 27,500 per tonne since november-january.its only a matter of time before all this cost push translates into higher milk prices for consumers, says r s sodhi, managing director, gujarat co-operative milk marketing federation. the cooperative, better known by its amul brand, had registered a jump in average milk procurement from 176.5 lakh litres per day (llpd) in 2016-17 to 204.3 llpd in 2017-18 and 223 llpd in 2018-19.in this financial year, procurement has so far been 3 per cent lower year-on-year, despite our members union hiking prices from rs 570-580 per kg of fat in december-january to rs 630-650 now. even in north india, procurement prices of buffalo milk with 6.5 per cent fat has soared from rs 32-33 to rs 40 per litre in this period, says sodhi.while drought-induced fodder and feed shortages are a major cause of cost push and drop in milk procurement, r g chandramogan, managing director, hatsun agro product ltd, indias largest private sector dairy, also attributes it to sustained low prices over the last four years or more. not getting good prices for milk has shaken the confidence of farmers. they have been underfeeding their animals or reducing herd sizes, which is bound to affect supply at some point, he says.dairies were forced to slash procurement prices, especially after exports of skimmed milk powder (smp) from the country collapsed from 129,868 tonnes in 2013-14 to 34,490 tonnes in 2014-15 and 11,476 tonnes in 2017-18. in 2018-19, they recovered slightly to around 45,000 tonnes. the resultant depletion of stocks has, in turn, helped prop up domestic smp rates from rs 135-140 per kg to rs 210 levels in the last six months.another commodity that has witnessed improved price sentiment, of late, is sugar. the key driver has been drought in maharashtra. the state is expected to record 40 per cent lower cane area for the 2019-20 crushing season from october, with farmers  particularly in the marathwada region and surrounding areas of solapur, ahmednagar and nashik  reducing or not taking up plantings of the pre-seasonal (september-october) and suru (december-january) crops.my mill in osmanabad had roughly 15,000 hectares of cane area last season. for the next season, this may not touch 1,000 hectares. even the standing crop is being diverted by farmers for fodder, claims b b thombre, chairman, latur-based natural sugar and allied industries. he predicts that only 6-7 out of marathwadas 47 sugar mills will have enough cane to operate in the coming season.for now, the main ray of hope is the southwest monsoon. the met department has forecast aggregate rainfall during june-september to be 96 per cent of its long period average, making it a near normal season. but chandramogan feels that even if the monsoon turns out good and prices are finally looking up, farmers will not be able to step up production overnight, as agriculture isnt like switching on or turning off lights.mittal sees the current uptick in food prices as a healthy and necessary correction. it may look inflationary, but the fact is that before march-april, the year-on-year cost increases in fruits and vegetables was in the low single digits or even negative. farmers, then, couldnt recover their cultivation costs, which is not sustainable, he says.advertisingwhen the nda government took over in may 2014, annual consumer food inflation was in near double-digits. by end-2016, that was brought down to low single digits by end-2016. given the associated farm stress caused, it is unlikely that if food inflation returns, the next government  even if headed by prime minister narendra modi  would be inclined to adopt an overly hawkish approach.

2621,"indiaUpdated: Oct 31- 2019 05:51 ISTThe government is weighing policy options to increase the area and production of onions and tomatoes in northern states to tide over supply disruptions from southern and central states""-"" especially during the monsoon months- that cause prices of the vegetables to spike.The consumer affairs ministry has proposed to the horticulture commissioner under the agriculture ministry that increasing production of onions and tomatoes in states such as Haryana",,0.8075893127342892,TOMATO,2019-12-09,Normal,Normal,SRINIVASAPUR,2.9940119760479043,9.0,2019-10-31,Anomaly,2019-10-27,KARNATAKA," uttarakhand, rajasthan, punjab and uttar pradesh be included in the mission for integrated development of horticulture, according toan official with knowledge of the matter.this is a centrally sponsored scheme in which the union government funds up to 60% of total costs, with state governments contributing the rest. in the case of hill states, such as himachal pradesh and uttarakhand, the centres share of funding is higher at 90%.onion prices more than doubled in many cities since august. they have since settled at around rs 50-55 a kg in retail markets. during times of normal supply, retail prices usually range between rs 20 and rs 30 a kg.heavy rains during august-september in maharashtra, the biggest onion producing state, as well in madhya pradesh and karnataka, disrupted onion shipments to northern india as well as other parts of country. unseasonal rains could have damaged nearly 30% of the onion crop in maharashtra, said shirish jamdade, an official in the states horticulture department.the main summer onion crop  sown during may-june and harvested in october-november  accounts for just 15% of the countrys annual output. yet, this crop is critical because it replenishes markets at a time when they generally run out stocks from previous harvests.traders who rely on stocked onions they set aside for such seasonal shortages then up prices, leading to inflationary spells.according to data from the national horticultural research and development foundation, rain-led disruptions caused onion arrivals at wholesale markets in september to slump to 3.5 million quintals until september 25, from about 6 million quintals in the previous year.higher production in northern states can ease supply shocks in eastern states such as bihar, west bengal and the north-east, an official with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.during the price spiral last month, metros such as mumbai and delhi were the worst hit, and retail onion and tomato prices soared to rs 75-80/kg.sowing of the countrys main summer onion crop was delayed by over a month in maharashtra due to a sluggish start to this years monsoon in june, which pushed back harvests in what is a lean season, another reason for the price spike.on september 13, the union government curbed exports by raising the minimum export price (mep) of onion to $850 a tonne (about rs 62,000). imposition of mep makes an indian-origin commodity expensive for foreign buyers, thereby discouraging shipments abroad.as prices failed to cool, the government then imposed a ban on export of onions on september 29 to augment domestic supply and cool prices.the horticulture mission, under which onion output is sought to be raised in northern states, will aim at productivity increases through improved varieties, quality seeds and planting materials, the official cited above said. the mission also aims to promote subsidised greenhouse cultivation and horticulture mechanisation.if implemented properly, the proposal for higher production within northern states can fulfil demand during the lean phase. but the scheme may need to offer some form of subsidy and be also backed by higher procurement of onions, said alok kumar, a former horticulture scientist at the indian council of agriculture research. the government usually buys onions from farmers to build a buffer stock;

agriculture, the idea was to acknowledge their contributions and empower them through opportunities to help them become better farmers, thereby improving their lives, said a company note.the initiative consists of direct access to knowledge of improved agricultural practices, introduction of farm tools and technology for reducing farm drudgery and increasing productivity, with the ultimate objective to improve income.in the first phase, prerna reached out to 40 villages in odisha over the past 18 months, covering 2,000 women farmers. in its second phase, it covered 60 villages in madhya pradesh, maharashtra and karnataka.prerna has been working in six clusters across these states for the past six months. the company aims to reach 6,000 women farmers.in manegaon, organisers chose 100 women as champion farmers from among those who have at least one acre land, have access to water and were interested in the initiative. the idea was that these 100 would reach out to 1,000 others.sinnar has been drought-prone for years and farmers have traditionally been growing onions and other vegetables. but prerna introduced green peas in the region as it requires less water.the innovation did not meet with immediate acceptance. farmers were apprehensive about growing new crops since water in the region is limited. most families have continued with their traditional crops and techniques and set aside land for crops like green peas and soyabean.farmers are being given constant guidance through whatsapp. they share pictures of their farm processes and receive tips.acheiving a balancewomen were taught how to process seeds using a seed treatment drum that involves putting a medicine in with the seeds for a few hours to improve yield. if seeds are sowed directly, their germination speed is slow but using this process, it becomes faster, said prashant dudhade of baif development research organisation, prernas partner non-governmental organisation.the farmers would add fertiliser later in the process, but were taught to do so after sowing. since we knew they would not agree to organic fertilizers or pesticides immediately, we taught them to balance both, said mr. dudhade.women have been also maintaining a record of their farms, from the time they do the sowing to how many times they use fertilisers and pesticides, the date of the first germination, and so on.the farm equipment and tractors have been of help, although few in the taluka have actually begun to use them. some cannot afford to lease or buy the equipment, and since it is peak season, most of it is already rented.of the 100 women we trained in using farm equipment, about half decided to take further training and four of them successfully ploughed their farms using a tractor this season. we are hoping the numbers will increase with time, said mr. dudhade.prerna has planned a customer hiring centre in the taluka with women as stakeholders. about 10 women will run it, while the rest will be allowed to rent farm equipment. preference, though, will be given to prerna women.the ones who are using the equipment are relieved. ploughing using bullocks costs 800 per 0.5 acres while through tractors, it only costs 600, said farmer mathura sonawane.for sangita sonawane, it was about reducing stress. since we women did most of the farm labour, our back, legs and hands would hurt. there is also no escaping the household chores. we were relieved when the equipment was introduced to us, she said.combating stereotypesthe going hasnt always been easy, though. there are stereotypes to combat, and dismantling power structures will take a while.my neighbour laughed at me when he saw me sowing groundnut using the token method (also called the dribbling method, where seeds are sown deep in the ground manually and the flow of water is designed to give optimum yield), said poonam sonawane, another champion farmer. he said, is this what champions do? i was embarrassed. i hope i prove him wrong.whether at home or outside, the women still do not call the shots. they have spent nearly 15,000 on their farms, loaned to them by their husbands  and that, in a sense, makes them beholden. asked how they would spend the income from their farms, many said it would be a decision they would take along with their husbands.still, theres one thing they know for sure: they are on the

Cross the Lakhan gate into town and the invigorating smell of rose petals wafts into the nostrils.The imperial glory of Kannauj under emperor Harsha Vardhan is long gone; today the all intrusive city life hits one on the face,,0.7229487135745644,POTATO,2019-05-27,Anomaly,Normal,FAIZABAD,1.2489592006661117,7.0,2019-04-27,Normal,2019-04-14,UTTAR PRADESH," almost immediately. however, the usual hustle and bustle of a poll season is nowhere to be seen even in the bylanes, which hoard attar bottles.yet, that kannauj is at the epicentre of up politics is clear from the fact that mulayam singh yadavs daughter in law dimple is in the fray in the socialist bastion, where party ideologue ram manohar lohia won an election in 1967.like in 2014, its a straight fight between sps dimple yadav and bjps subrat pathak who lost last time narrowly by 19,000 votes.follow our full election coverage hereby logic, with support from the bahujan samaj party (bsp) and the rashtriya lok dal (rld) and the congress deciding not to field a candidate, dimple should have an easy run. but the ground realities are different.caste dynamics are a major factor in the constituency, which has elected both sp patriarch mulayam and his son akhilesh yadav to parliament earlier. additionally, kannauj has been an sp bastion since 1999, with the yadav, muslim and dalit support base further bolstering the party cushion this time.dimples rival pathak rides on his personal popularity, besides the modi factor  which is evident in both the rural and urban segments.farmers of tirwa  anuj, 35 and bansi, 39  feel that though stray animals are giving them sleepless nights, its an issue for chief minister yogi adityanath to handle, not the pm.we want to give modi a second chance, they say in unison. yet, there are issues which come to the fore during discussions. the recession-hit perfume industry, a potato glut and unemployment, being the major ones.kannauj has over 200 small, medium and large manufacturing units of perfume. traders, who export attar worth rs 100 crore annually, claim that the trade could not soar owing to government apathy.we dont want loans, but facilities, says pawan trivedi, secretary of the attar and perfumers association.non-availability of raw materials and a lack of support from an administration led the likes of ram sanehi to close down units in 2015.but despite all hardships, nishish tiwari, a perfume trader in the city, finds the ensuing battle in the constituency tightly poised between the bjp and the mahagthbandhan.on one hand, modiji is popular, on the other, the sp has to save its bastion, he says.what do voters want? the question is mostly met with a cautious silence. no one speaks of support to one or the other party but deshdeepak, 27, of makrand nagar, a suburb of kannauj, feels cheated.everyone promises jobs but no one delivers.joining the conversation, trader rajnarain gupta says: the election is for the country and not forkannauj. only this government has the courage to hit at terrorism.however, pitching for the mahagathbandhan, ratan lal a contract farmer says: the mahagathbandhan is putting up a good fight. akhilesh has done a lot. he has ensured that this region gets uninterrupted power supply. for us that is a big relief.jalalabad, some 20 km away from kannauj city, has a population of around 1200, most of whom are potato growers. kush har, who owns six bighas of land, has his own woes to relate.the government has announced that it will purchase our potato stocks. but they grade it before we can sell it, which hardly helps retrieve the input cost. we dont want to sell to the government.the issue of paucity of cold storage units to store the produce also comes up. in case of a glut, farmers are forced to leave the produce in the open.however, non-availability of the sitting mp is a common refrain, which goes against dimple.the bjp has done good work and will reap benefits. they have fielded a local candidate who is available. he may have lost the previous election but is putting up a good fight this time, says mukesh tiwari, 38, a dhaba owner.anurag arora, vice president, up cold storage association, aptly summarised the dilemma of the kannauj voter.nearly 80% people of kannauj are either dependent on the attar business or are farmers. the electoral battle here is evenly poised because on one side, the sp has done good work here, on the other bjps subrat pathak is popular.while caste arithmetic favours dimple, young voters and the chemistry seem to favour the bjp candidate.

growth,,0.7558458670900551,POTATO,2019-07-29,Anomaly,Normal,BISHNUPUR(BANKURA),0.9992862241256244,7.0,2019-06-29,Normal,2019-06-16,WEST BENGAL," which also matters for this governments agenda of sabka saath, sabka vikas. sometime back, i did a study on how much decline in poverty was witnessed when there was 1% growth in agriculture and 1% growth in non-agriculture. i found that agriculture growth had much more significant impact than non-agriculture growth. we should recognise some of the positive changes that have taken place in the agricultural sector. in the 1970s, we were producing 1 kg of food per person per day  and food here includes not just foodgrains, but also fruits, vegetables, milk etc. at that time, our population was about 56 crore. now, that has gone up to more than 130 crore, but our per capita food production today is roughly 1.74 kg food per day. this has its own implications, as we are no longer living in scarcity.why ramesh chand?advertisinga member of the niti aayog, ramesh chand is seen as key to the narendra modi government driving agriculture sector reforms, especially in its second innings. a farm economist of repute, he has been an advocate of dismantling provisions under the essential commodities act and apmc laws that enable restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports, besides preventing large retailers from buying directly from farmers. these views may find resonance in a context where food inflation and shortages have ceased to be a major worry, with the focus now shifting to addressing agrarian distress and doubling farmers incomesharish damodaran: do you think the narendra modi government in its first innings was excessively pro-consumer and not pro-producer?i doubt the government was pro-consumer at the cost of producers. we draw this conclusion only because producer prices have risen at a very low rate after 2014-15, when this government came to power. but agricultural prices historically move in cycles. during 2006 to 2012, there was a sharp increase in global agricultural prices, which fell just around when this government came. in 2012, they were at their peak. but still if one looks at the terms of trade for agriculture  the prices that farmers pay and what prices they receive  these had been improving up to 2015-16. only in the last two years, the prices paid by farmers have increased at a slightly higher rate compared to the prices received. but overall, the terms of trade figure for 2018-19 is higher than 2011-12 this government has tried hard to keep these prices high with a new formula for fixing msp (minimum support price) and also through procurement. so it is a combination of factors  international prices, demand and supply cycle  that is responsible for the current agrarian distress. it is very difficult for the government to influence prices beyond a point.advertisingharish damodaran: as you say, the scarcity of the past is over. is it time now to scrap the essential commodities act (eca), export controls and other restrictions that are clearly anti-farmer?the farmer is a consumer too. but i agree, the sectors interest today lies in scrapping these restrictions. in the last (june 15) meeting of the niti aayogs governing council, we proposed some reforms, including on the eca, apmc (agricultural produce market committee) reforms and enabling contract farming. the prime minister announced that a high-power committee of chief ministers would be constituted to examine these reforms. in 2016, the union government passed an order, after which there are no real restrictions on food commodities with regards to stocking, movement or exports. but people say that a similar order was issued in 2002, but when prices increased in 2006, the controls were brought back. so they believe that unless the act changes, the government will always find ways to bring back control if things are seen as going against the consumer. the niti aayog has suggested a way out  classifying commodities into two categories: foodstuffs and others. there are some commodities such as drugs where the eca is needed, but not in case of agri produce. if the eca has to be used, let us clearly define the conditions. if, say, there is a 20% decline in production because of natural calamity of an extraordinary order, or a war, only then can the provisions be brought back.ravish tiwari: how do you deal with political opposition to these reforms being suggested?the supply situation is much better than in the past. the need for eca to stop hoarding or black marketing does not arise in the case of most commodities, where even exports are happening. when we meet politicians, we give them examples by asking them if they ever felt the need to have eca on eggs or milk (which are non-perishable and cannot be hoarded). price volatility may be extreme in onions, but not in most other commodities. the best way to address volatility is through buffer stocks, not by eca. recently, west bengal, for example, imposed movement controls in potatoes under eca, but that only did a lot of harm to its farmers. todays india and its agriculture situation are very different.prabhudatta mishra: how does the niti aayog plan to make msp more effective on the ground?everybody wants only the centre to act. but agriculture is a state subject. it can only be the joint responsibility of the centre and the states. the total production of all commodities where msps exist will be about 300 million tonnes. if the centre is taking care of rice and wheat, whose production is about 200 million tonnes, cant all the states combined take care of the remaining one-third production? under pm-aasha (pradhan mantri annadata aay sanrakshan abhiyan), states were given the option to implement msp by procuring up to 30 per cent of the produce (similar to what the centre is doing for rice and wheat). if in the process of procurement and disposal, the states incurred a loss, the centre would bear it up to 30-35%. but the states did this only at a very small level. when the financial cost is being borne by the central government, the states should come forward and take advantage of pm-aasha by putting in place a procurement mechanism.harish damodaran: but instead of physical procurement, why cant we have direct benefit transfer and simply pay the difference between msp and market prices into farmers accounts?the niti aayog has suggested this as well. if you take the msp of wheat today, it is actually 30% higher than the international price. so if you procure wheat at msp, you will only distort the market and exports will be hit, as domestic price is very high. stocks, too, will pile. direct benefit transfer is a very good idea and under pm-aasha, we have the option of physical procurement as well as provision of deficiency price payments. in this case, we dont have to look at the price received by each and every farmer. farmers just have to register the area they are sowing under different crops before the seasons start on a portal. for every state, the harvest season is defined. so, at the end of the season, we monitor the actual price received by farmers in every district. every district has 3-4 mandis. we take the average price at these mandis for the produce of fair average quality. if that price is lower than the msp, the difference can be paid for the area that has been reported by the farmer on the portal and taking the average yield for the crop in the district. i think the madhya pradesh governments bhavantar programme, despite the criticism it faced from some economists, was a good initiative. today, the food corporation of india incurs a cost of rs 700-800 per quintal in the process of paying rs 1,600 as msp to farmers. that can be avoided through direct payment of the price difference.prasanta sahu: following the implementation of pm-kisan, should the government now use this scheme to replace fertiliser and other input subsidies to farmers?income support and subsidies are two different things. pm-kisan is the former. subsidy was originally meant to promote the use of a particular input to ensure increase in productivity. when dr c rangarajan was the chairman of the prime ministers economic advisory council (2009-2014), he asked me to find out the impact on the countrys food security and agriculture production if fertiliser subsidy was completely withdrawn and it was sold at market price. at that time, i calculated that if we do it suddenly in a knee-jerk manner, there will be 10% decline in foodgrain production. i look at pm-kisan in a different way. it was brought in as some sort of income support, as crop prices remained low, and farmers in many places could not get the msp. subsidies are a different issue and they exist in many countries. we must try to make subsidies more efficient than they currently are. subsidies in water and power are serious issues and must be addressed. agricultural power subsidy for the country as a whole is about rs 1 lakh crore. we did calculations to find how many irrigations a farmer would apply in case he is charged for power or if he is not charged anything. they will use 40% less irrigation on paddy alone if power is fully priced. also in most cases, the yield will not fall.sandeep singh: rural consumption is slowing down. the government had talked of doubling farmers income. where are we on that?it is not proper to use agriculture and rural synonymously today. in rural india, only one-third of the income now comes from agriculture and two-third from non-agricultural activities. the last five years have been unique. for the first time in 65 to 70 years, we have had five consecutive years of less than average rainfall and the current one could even be the sixth. but despite that, the annual growth rate of the value added in agriculture has been 2.9%, which is not bad. if growth rate becomes 5%, prices will crash and farmer incomes may decline by 30-40%. the slowdown in rural demand may be due to many reasons. one of it could be that loan waivers have reduced the flow of bank credit to rural areas. industry people were happy when rural demand was good. but much of this demand was debt-based, with people taking loans to buy commodities. but families dont have internal income to buy resources. as far as agriculture is concerned, for doubling farmers income, you need it to rise by over 10% every year. in the last three years, the growth rate, according to my calculation, has been 6%. we can still achieve the target if we are able to do something to prices. if farmers get 10% more than what they are getting, the income elasticity with respect to price would be 1.6. then, farmers incomes will increase by 16%.ravish tiwari: how can we improve the current level of private and public investment in the agriculture sector?if you look at public investment in agriculture as percentage of the gdp, the latest available data for 2016-17 shows it at 2.35%. for most of the recent period, it was 3%. almost 85% of public investment in agriculture comes from the states. the centre invests about 15% and that includes investment on irrigation and agriculture technology. within private investment, the bulk of it comes from farmers themselves. if investment has to go up, that should now come from the corporate sector, which is currently very low. that is why the prime minister said last week in parliament that corporates should not only see investments in agriculture in terms of making and selling tractors. they should make investments in agriculture, including in backend extension and working directly with farmers. this government wants to create an enabling environment for corporates to invest in agriculture. that will also require making changes in the regulatory environment, particularly facilitating contract farming.ravish tiwari: the private sector can invest in technology. but given the kind of protests against gm technology, how can the private sector be confident about investing?gm technology is not the only technology through which countries have made progress in agriculture. there is public sensitivity about gm technology. but the biggest damage was done when jairam ramesh (former environment minister) took the issue of whether gm technology should be adopted to the streets and not leaving it to be decided by an expert body. on gm crops, the niti aayogs stance has been  there should not be a blanket ban on the technology. it should not be encouraged in areas where we are able to get success through conventional means. the other thing that we emphasised was to finance public sector research in gm technology in a big way. this was mainly to allay the fears of people that private sector developers were charging hefty royalty. some of our public sector research institutions were very close to developing a gm chickpea. moreover, there are many more opportunities for the private sector other than gm. that includes ge or gene editing, which is different from modification (through introduction of alien genes).ravish tiwari: cattle trade rules enforced two years back disrupted the market. do such rules help farmers or create trouble for them?advertisingthe livestock sector grew by more than 6% in the last five years. if there were so many problems, it would not have been growing so fast. on the other hand, the crop sector, particularly cereal, oilseeds and pulses, is growing at just around 1.15%. this is why the overall agricultural growth rate comes down to 2.9%. but on the whole, i would say that indian agriculture has now reached a stage where more the intervention by government, the lower will be the growth. the more the sector is liberalised, the higher will be the growth rate.

production of oilseeds.on the first achievement, there are few doubts.advertisingduring 2016-17 to 2018-19, indias pulses output has averaged 23.92 million tonnes (mt), as against 17.58 mt for the preceding three-year period. as a result, imports, after more than doubling from 3.18 mt to 6.61 mt between 2013-14 and 2016-17, fell to 2.53 mt in the last fiscal. in value terms, pulses imports were only $ 1.14 billion (rs 8,035.30 crore) in 2018-19, having peaked at $ 4.24 billion (rs 28,523.18 crore) two years before.the washington-headquartered international food policy research institute has projected the countrys pulses demand under different gdp growth scenarios at 21.40-22.36 mt in 2020 and 25.22-28.07 mt by 2030. given that current production is already at 23-25 mt, the self-sufficiency claims arent entirely without basis. and the narendra modi government can probably take some credit for it.but can the pulses (vegetable protein) success be replicated in oilseeds (vegetable fat)? the simple answer: it is a tall order.advertisingtable 1 shows the quantum and value of indias vegetable oil imports  how these are much bigger relative to pulses. between 2009-10 and 2017-18, imports surged from 6.73 mt to 15.36 mt, with the corresponding foreign exchange outgo, too, rising from $ 4.72 billion (rs 22,316.68 crore) to $ 11.64 billion (rs 74,995.91 crore). they dipped somewhat to 15.03 mt ($ 9.89 billion or rs 69,023.80 crore) in 2018-19, but nowhere near the scale seen in pulses.the accompanying chart gives a better idea of the extent of import dependence. in 2001-02, the countrys vegetable oil production, at 6.72 mt, exceeded imports of 4.76 mt. in 2011-12, imports crossed 10 mt for the first time, while also surpassing the domestic output of 8.15 mt. in the last oil year, imports, at 15.12 mt, were almost twice the production of 7.92 mt, translating into a self-sufficiency ratio of just over 34%.the wholesale shift to imports has completely transformed the profile of edible oil consumption.according to ggn research, an indore-based agri-commodity analytics firm, 58% of indias estimated edible oil consumption of 2.29 mt in 1973-74 was accounted for by groundnut. this was followed by mustard (28%), cottonseed (10%) and other indigenous oils such as coconut and sesame. but in 2001-02, 29.1% of the total consumption of 10.13 mt was constituted by palm oil, which, along with soyabean (22.3%), had relegated mustard and groundnut to third and fourth places. by 2017-18, the combined share of palm and soyabean oil had increased to more than 60%. adding sunflower oil took it further up to nearly 72%.about 96-98% of palm and sunflower oil consumed by india is imported  the former from indonesia and malaysia, the latter mostly from ukraine. the ratio would be lower, at 70-72%, for soyabean that is imported primarily from argentina and brazil. it is these three, predominantly imported, oils that are being largely used today for deep-frying pooris and pakodas, making the tadka/chounk tempering to add flavour and aroma to dals, and imparting necessary texture, mouth-feel and bite to biscuits and cookies. while soyabean and sunflower are consumer-facing oils, not even a third of palm oil gets directly used in home kitchens. the bulk of it is consumed by the food industry  for everything from mithais, namkeens, bread and biscuits to noodles  and quick-service restaurants. it is the cheapest oil and amenable to deep as well as multiple frying. hydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati), too, is entirely based on palm oil.against this background, how feasible is the goal of self-sufficiency?b.v. mehta, executive director, solvent extractors association of india, believes it is possible to push up production, particularly of mustard oil, which is currently around 2.2 mt. mustard-seed has roughly 40% oil content. our average seed yield is hardly 1.2 tonnes per hectare. punjab and haryana together have six million hectares under wheat that the government is struggling to procure, amid overflowing godowns. if half that area is diverted to irrigated mustard with 2 tonnes/hectare yields, we can get an additional crop of 6 mt or 2.3-2.4 mt of oil, he notes.the second biggest contributor to indias annual vegetable oil production of 8-8.1 mt is soyabean, at 1.3-1.4 mt. but since its oil content is only 17-18%, increasing production beyond even 2 mt is difficult. at no. 3 and no. 4 spots are cottonseed (1.2-1.3 mt) and rice bran oil (1 mt). cottonseed has, in fact, now become gujarats dominant indigenous oil, ahead of groundnut. the boost here has come essentially from the bt (genetically-modified cotton) revolution, just as increased paddy production has led to higher rice bran availability. a targeted approach can raise the output of these two oils by another 1.5-1.6 mt.the real impetus to self-sufficiency, however, can come from oil palm  the only crop capable of yielding 4 tonnes of oil per hectare. at present, local palm oil production is just 0.25 mt. india can potentially cultivate oil palm in 1.9-2 million hectares, giving 7.5-8 mt oil. but since the trees take four years to grow and yield fresh fruit bunches, you need to plan now. oil palm should be declared as a plantation crop and exempted from land ceiling laws to attract investments from corporates. simultaneously, we must restrict imports, especially of refined palm oil, adds mehta.on the other hand, industry expert and former cargill india chairman, siraj a. chaudhry, is skeptical about aiming for self-sufficiency.advertisingedible oil cannot be equated with pulses, where theres very little global trade and the consumption requirement of our significantly vegetarian population has to be met through domestic production. in edible oils, wheat or corn, there is no dearth of global suppliers producing at much lower costs. if china can import 100 mt of oilseeds annually (compared to its production of 58-59 mt), why should we worry about importing 15-16 mt of oil? also, assuming our oilseed production rises substantially, where will you sell the resultant de-oiled cake or meal? unlike china, our meat consumption isnt going to grow enough to absorb all this byproduct, he points out.

only 17-18%, increasing production beyond even 2 mt is difficult. at no. 3 and no. 4 spots are cottonseed (1.2-1.3 mt) and rice bran oil (1 mt). cottonseed has, in fact, now become gujarats dominant indigenous oil, ahead of groundnut. the boost here has come essentially from the bt (genetically-modified cotton) revolution, just as increased paddy production has led to higher rice bran availability. a targeted approach can raise the output of these two oils by another 1.5-1.6 mt.the real impetus to self-sufficiency, however, can come from oil palm  the only crop capable of yielding 4 tonnes of oil per hectare. at present, local palm oil production is just 0.25 mt. india can potentially cultivate oil palm in 1.9-2 million hectares, giving 7.5-8 mt oil. but since the trees take four years to grow and yield fresh fruit bunches, you need to plan now. oil palm should be declared as a plantation crop and exempted from land ceiling laws to attract investments from corporates. simultaneously, we must restrict imports, especially of refined palm oil, adds mehta.on the other hand, industry expert and former cargill india chairman, siraj a. chaudhry, is skeptical about aiming for self-sufficiency.advertisingedible oil cannot be equated with pulses, where theres very little global trade and the consumption requirement of our significantly vegetarian population has to be met through domestic production. in edible oils, wheat or corn, there is no dearth of global suppliers producing at much lower costs. if china can import 100 mt of oilseeds annually (compared to its production of 58-59 mt), why should we worry about importing 15-16 mt of oil? also, assuming our oilseed production rises substantially, where will you sell the resultant de-oiled cake or meal? unlike china, our meat consumption isnt going to grow enough to absorb all this byproduct, he points out.

rice ($ 4.71 billion in 2018-19)  since 2008.advertisingthis year, the 53-year-old from majitha village in the same tehsil of amritsar district, has slashed his pusa-1121 acreage to two acres, from 10 acres in 2018. simultaneously, his area under pusa-1718, a new improved basmati bred by the indian agricultural research institute (iari) in new delhi, has expanded five-fold to 10 acres.pusa-1718 is essentially pusa-1121, which they (scientists) have made more disease-resistant. you dont need to spray any pesticides now. i tried it out first last year and got an average paddy yield of 23 quintals per acre, against 18-20 quintals from pusa-1121. also, the crop tillered better (more side stems produced from the initial parent shoot), says onkar, who grows the short-duration pusa-1509 basmati variety on the remaining 33 acres of his total 45-acre holding.onkar singh farms only basmati paddy, which has no assured government procurement at minimum support prices (msp). pusa-1509 matures in just 115-120 days, from the date of nursery sowing to harvesting. i can transplant it from june 10 to june 25 and harvest between mid-september and early-october. it gives the flexibility, then, to plant matar (pea) in september and potato in october for harvesting by late-november/early-december. there is time to sow wheat, winter maize or ajwain (celery) even after that, he explains.advertisingpusa-1121 is a longer-duration basmati (140-145 days, seed to grain), mostly transplanted during june 10 to july-end for harvesting towards october-end and mid-november. it leaves scope only to sow wheat. yields, too, are lower than the 24-28 quintal/acre from pusa-1509. the only advantage is price. last year, i got rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal for pusa-1121, whereas pusa-1509 paddy fetched rs 2,600-3,000, he adds.this is where the new variety could make a difference.pusa-1121 was susceptible to bacterial blight. we have basically made it resistant to the pathogen by introducing two genes xa21 and xa13, derived from a wild rice species (oryza longistaminata) and a traditional land race (bj1), respectively. the resultant variety (pusa-1718) also possesses a non-lodging habit from a strong culm (stem). it is, hence, less prone to falling and can withstand heavy rain or water-logging better than pusa-1121, a.k. singh, head of iaris division of genetics, tells the indian express.davinder singh (30), of khabba rajputan village in tarn taran district and tehsil, agrees. this farmer has dedicated 20 acres to pusa-1718 in the current season, from last years two acres, while halving it from 40 acres to 20 acres for pusa-1121.i did it after seeing how the new variety stood tall, despite being submerged under water for a week after incessant rains in september 22-24. and my yield was 27 quintals/acre, compared to 18-19 quintals of pusa-1121, states davinder, whose total 150-acre holding also includes 50 acres each under pusa-1509 and non-basmati paddy varieties, and 10 acres of other crops (maize, vegetables and pulses).onkar and davinder singh are both bullish on pusa-1718, which also matures 10 days earlier than pusa-1121. the traders are paying rs 200-300/quintal lower for the new variety, just as they once tried to beat down the price of pusa-1509. but the grain quality of pusa-1121 and pusa-1718 is just the same, claims onkar.according to davinder, the economics of basmati cultivation today is superior to non-basmati. a yield of 25 quintals/acre from pusa-1509 and pusa-1718, at an average rs 3,000/quintal rate, gives more return than from non-basmati varieties even at a guaranteed msp of rs 1,835/quintal on 34-35 quintals/acre. progressive farmers like him are able to harvest high yields through practices such as incorporating crop stubble into the soil (rather than burning) and applying farm yard manure, in addition to granular sulphur and other secondary nutrients.talwinder singh of nauli village in jalandhar district/tehsil is growing pusa-1718 on three of his nine acres this time. amarjit singh from viram in amritsars majitha tehsil has, likewise, halved his pusa-1121 area to five acres, while planting pusa-1718 on five and pusa-1509 on his balance 18 acres. both have cited the same reasons  better disease resistance, less lodging-prone and more tillering ability.farmers in punjab have sown a total basmati area of 6.29 lakh hectares (lh) this kharif season, 1.92 lh more than last year, while bringing it down under non-basmati varieties from 26.66 lh to 22.91 lh. they have also stepped up cotton acreage from 2.67 lh to 3.91 lh. the reduced non-basmati area would mean less pressure on government procurement agencies. within basmati, a significant switch from pusa-1121 to pusa-1718 has taken place. g.s. bal, chief agricultural officer of amritsar, estimates the new variety to cover 30-35% of the districts basmati area of 1.39 lh this time.increased planting, of course, comes with price risk. farmer realisations have been good in the last couple of years due to a rebound in basmati exports (see table). the value of shipments have marginally slipped during april-june ($ 1,255 million versus $ 1,285 million in the same quarter of 2018-19), with the payment problems in iran adding to the uncertainty.one way to protect the countrys export interests is by preserving basmatis premium quality attributes  aroma, long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking and fluffiness  and minimising use of chemical pesticides. the punjab government, last month, issued an advisory to farmers not to spray formulations of five insecticides (acephate, thiamethoxam, triazophos, buprofezin and carbofuran) and four fungicides (tricyclazole, thiophanate-methyl, carbendazim and propiconazole).an alternative approach to pesticide application is to breed for disease resistance. this is what iari scientists have sought to do through transfer of specific disease-resistance genes, from landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy, into existing high-yielding basmati varieties. pusa-1718 is a result of such marker-assisted backcross breeding, which helps avoid use of streptomycin or tetracycline combinations to control bacterial blight.a similar variety pusa-1637 has been bred by incorporating a pi9 gene, sourced from oryza minuta (a wild relative of the normal cultivated oryza sativa paddy), into the popular pusa basmati-1. this gene provides high-to-moderate resistance against leaf and neck blast, obviating the need to spray fungicides such as tricyclazole, azoxystrobin and picoxystrobin.advertisingvijay setia, president of the all india rice exporters association, feels pusa-1718 is a good variety. but he emphasises that farmers should not put all their eggs in a single variety, while advocating tough action against companies aggressively marketing pesticides. so long as an insects population is below the economic threshold level  at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest  there is no need to spray at all, he points out.

which is located in punjabs sangrur district, has yet again planted the water-guzzling paddy crop this summer (kharif) as he is sceptical of any other crop fetching him a remunerative price.standing on the edge of the ghaggar branch canal, which flows barely a few metres away from his field, gurmeet reveals that hardly anyone in the village irrigates his/her field with canal water. that is because motor-operated tube wells, with their powerful submersible pumps, have become an easy and preferred choice for most of the households to extract groundwater, he says.punjabs policy of providing free electricity to farmers, in place since 1997, along with the central governments favourable attitude towards paddy cultivation, are the key factors that have motivated farmers like gurmeet to persist with paddy, despite the grave groundwater crisis faced by the state.most of us here in the village have tube wells installed, be it on our farm or inside our houses. we use groundwater for irrigation, drinking and other domestic purposes. in 1977, we got our first tube well drilled at a depth of 35 ft-40 ft. water at that time was easily available at 15 ft-20 ft. since then, we have drilled as many as four tube wells as the water levels have been consistently falling. i got the latest one installed two years ago at around 300 ft. it cost me around 1,00,000, he says, his head dropping in despair as he mentions the high cost of his latest tube well.the green revolution impactgurmeets father magar singh, 90, intervenes to point out that farmers like him shifted to cultivation of rice and wheat during the hara inquilab (green revolution); till then, he says, crops like pulses, maize, vegetables and cotton were mainly grown in the village.paddy (rice) requires far more water than other crops and as farmers started cultivating paddy, the need for tube wells arose. the extraction of groundwater only increased as farmers shifted from the use of monoblock pumps in the 1980s to other types like submersible pumps, he says.ideally, groundwater should be available at a depth of 50 ft to 60 ft, but in punjab, its level has significantly dropped to 150ft to 200 ft in most places. many attribute this drastic fall to an indiscriminate extraction of groundwater in the last two decades.further, deepening of tube wells, and purchase of the powerful motors to carry out the deepening, is costing farmers 1,100 crore per year, according to government data. the state, which gives free power to farmers, is also facing an increased financial burden due to the rising use of electricity. this year, the total power subsidy to the farm sector is estimated at 9,674 crore.to counter this, the punjab state farmers policy, drafted by the states farmers and farm workers commission in june last year, suggested rationalising of power subsidy and asked the government to restrict the subsidy to the non-income tax payee farmers. it also recommended that cultivation of paddy on common lands be disallowed. common (shamlat) village lands, whose utilisation is regulated under punjab village common lands (regulation) act 1961, have been increasingly used for paddy cultivation over the years. experts feel that a restriction on such usage can help arrest groundwater depletion. the government, however, is yet to take a final call on these policy proposals.the punjab government is well aware of the fast depleting groundwater reserves. last month, chief minister captain amarinder singh directed the state planning board to chalk out a comprehensive crop diversification model. the board was also directed to undertake a detailed review of the various schemes of the agriculture department to bring in much-needed reforms in the sector.the chief minister, who has been stressing the need to prioritise the cultivation of crops that consume less water like maize, cotton and sugar cane, asked the board to come up with a strategy to persuade the farmers to shift to these crops.however, while the state government has been advocating crop diversification to save groundwater, farmers dont seem to be keen on shifting to other crops unless they are given an assured market and a guaranteed price for their produce. i am aware that paddy consumes more water than other crops but what is the alternative? government agencies purchase rice and wheat (during rabi season) at the minimum support price (msp), which assures me of a remunerative return. but in the case of other crops, theres hardly any such assurance. the government should purchase all major crops at msp as is done in case of rice and wheat; until then, it's difficult to shift, says randhir singh, 51, who grows paddy at his three-acre farm in bhattiwal khurd village.this sentiment is echoed in other parts of the state as well. in fatehpur village, located in the chief ministers pocket borough of patiala, karamjeet singh says that after suffering financial loss owing to a price crash in the market, he stopped the cultivation of potato a few years ago. three years ago, i planted a potato crop in my field but prices in the market crashed badly. the potato was fetching as low as 2 per kilo in the market. i couldnt even recover the cost of my crop and suffered a loss of around 3,00,000. since then, i have stopped its cultivation and have been sowing rice and wheat, for which i am assured of getting a remunerative price as government agencies will purchase my produce at the msp, he says, as he takes a seat along with his fellow farmers at the public shed in the village.wrong to blame farmersas the farmers beat the heat and humidity of an august afternoon under a fan mounted on the sheds ceiling, ajaib singh, 62, points out that it is wrong to blame farmers for groundwater depletion. there are industries and factories that are extracting a huge amount of groundwater  legally and illegally. not only this, the unsystematic disposal of waste from these industries is contaminating the water, making it increasingly alkaline, he says.for dilbag singh, 43, usage of water from the kherimala branch (canal), which flows barely three km from the village, is an affordable and doable way to reduce dependence on groundwater. the government needs to upgrade and work on maintenance of canal irrigation system. it needs to ensure the supply of water at tail-ends [the last part of the water outlet]. if an underground pipeline system can be laid, it will help us optimise water use. also, it will check the theft of canal water, he says.farmers like me are using tube wells because its an easy way of extracting water with powerful submersible pumps these days, but if the government develops a mechanism and lays a pipeline till my farm, why would i need to invest in a tube well? i remember we used to get water in canal outlets and also from wells for irrigation during the 1980s, but now almost every house in the village has a tube well, says kesar singh, 52, who has sown rice in his five-acre farm.another rice-growing farmer, nirmal singh, who is a farmer leader as well, points out that the government needs to focus on establishing an assured market mechanism. what farmers want is a market  where the purchase of their products is guaranteed and they get an assured remunerative price, he says.punjabs economy is highly dependent on agriculture. the sector. however, is experiencing slower growth as the states cropping intensity and irrigation potential have been fully exploited and the growth in productivity has also reached a saturation point.the intensive groundwater extraction in the last five decades through installation of shallow tube wells is reflected in tube well numbers  which have increased by almost 200% in 35 years, from six lakh in the 1980s to 14.76 lakh in 2017-18. also, the area under rice cultivation has increased from 11.83 lakh hectares in 1980 to 28.86 lakh hectares in 2017-18. on an average, there are 34 tube wells per sq. km of net sown area in punjab (2015-16).according to the draft dynamic ground water estimation report-2017, 109 blocks out of the 138 blocks taken for its study were over-exploited, two blocks were critical and five blocks were semi-critical while 20 blocks are in safe category. the water table was declining in nearly 80% of the area of the state.the report also said that while the annual replenishable groundwater resource in punjab was about 17.5 million acre-ft (maf), the annual draft (extraction) was 29 maf, implying that the extraction rate outstripped availability by quite a few notches.if this trend continues, it will adversely affect the agricultural economy of the state and it is apprehended that irrigated area may decrease by up to 15% in the year 2025. further, in the coming 20 years, supply from about 60% of top aquifers may be jeopardised. there will be an increase in the cost of raising crops, placing an increased financial burden on farmers and the government. a shortage in water supply could also act as a deterrent when it comes to investment in industries requiring water. around 30 million residents of the punjab region may face a collapse in agricultural output, says s.k. saluja, superintending engineer, directorate of ground water management.salinity in waterthe report also raised concerns about the deteriorating quality of groundwater due to pollution caused by urbanisation, industrialisation and an increased use of fertilisers and pesticides. it said that while nearly 50%-60% of groundwater was fresh and fit, 20%-30% was moderately saline and of marginal quality. further, about 15%-25% of the groundwater was saline, alkaline and not fit for irrigation.water in south and southwestern districts  like sangrur, muktsar, bathinda and mansa  came under the last category, containing varying concentration of soluble salts and its use for irrigation will adversely affect agricultural production, said the report.farmers in fatehpur, patiala, looking at an abandoned well, which once used to be a major water source for irrigation but has now run dry due to over-extraction of groundwater.an increased awareness about the need for safe drinking water has caused many households in bhattiwal khurd village to install ro (reverse osmosis) water purification systems. i felt the need for ro system at my home after my family members started falling ill due to water-borne diseases at regular intervals. we have been consuming groundwater directly from tube wells for a long time, says randhir singh.untreated industrial effluentsp.s. rangi, a noted agriculture economist and a former adviser to punjab state farmers commission, says that water quality is being impacted by untreated or inadequately treated industrial effluents and sewage that flows into rivulets and rivers in punjab.also, traditional water bodies such as ponds and wells in the villages are under threat. in most of the places, ponds have been filled and encroached upon while in other places, they have become a dumping ground for sewage. the problem is further compounded by the mixing of storm water and sewage in various municipal towns. the pollution and contamination of water resources due to industrial waste, sewage and excessive use of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a major cause of concern that needs immediate attention, says rangi.given the grim situation, punjabs department of water supply and sanitation is planning to implement 10 surface water projects at a cost of 1,021 crore. these projects intend to provide potable piped water supply to 1,021 quality-affected villages, making them less reliant on groundwater and more on canal water.a total of 130 such villages  including 85 uranium-affected villages in moga and 45 iron-affected ones in roopnagar  have so far been shifted from groundwater to canal water.lakhwinder singh, professor of economics at punjabi university, patiala, who has been mapping rural punjab for decades, asserts that agriculture in the state thrived in the past due to easy availability of both groundwater and surface water but, over the past few years, the availability has reached a saturation point.increase in indebtednesssuccessive state governments invested on drainage systems that saved crops from damage in the case of heavy and untimely rains. over the years, due to an incentivising of groundwater irrigation by the government and an irrational increase in the number of electric tube wells, water tables have receded. experts have been time and again cautioning the state on the long-term consequences of excessive exploitation of groundwater. now, farmers are forced to borrow from informal and formal sources to install tube wells, causing indebtedness and farmer suicides, says lakhwinder, adding that that faulty public policy and irrational cropping system should be blamed for the scenario.governments never visualised a scenario where agriculture would block the natural groundwater recharging process and create conditions for falling water tables, he says.he proposes that the drainage system be used for artificial recharge of groundwater. there is also a dire need to change the cropping pattern, especially in major parts of malwa, which need to take up cotton cultivation again, he says, adding that water recharging system, if put in place, can solve weather-related problems and economic incentives can be used to change farmers mindsets, making them shift to multi-cropping system.he feels that a major policy shift with long term vision can solve both the agrarian crisis and the problem of water depletion.realising the magnitude of agrarian crises, the draft policy framed by punjabs farmers and farm workers commission points out that a decade of business as usual has left farmers in an unenviable position.the policy strikes a cautious note in telling that the state is struggling to meet the aspirations of its farmers and the time has come to take a critical look at the deteriorating resources, the changing economic environment and the emerging market scenarios.

But OSI will enable us to analyse better about areas actually put under fire- says Verma.According to the data on stubble burning cases compiled by district-level authorities till November 12",,0.7040129293993154,RICE,2019-12-23,Normal,Anomaly,AMRITSAR,0.999687597625742,7.0,2019-11-15,Anomaly,2019-11-10,PUNJAB," no fire in more than 17,000 sites across punjab was spotted.till tuesday, the punjab remote sensing centre (prsc) had issued 48,125 alerts of fires in the state. the official teams so far visited 40,557 sites in different districts and inputs of no fire were reported in 17,832 cases till tuesday.the state government has initiated legal action in 29,671 cases for burning crop residue.however, officials said, several farmers evaded action as district authorities failed to take action upon prsc data on farm fires.dr anil sood, a senior scientist analysing stubble burning data at prsc, said the institute has a comprehensive data of area under rice cultivation in the state.unlike thermal imagery system, osi is capable of detecting even minor traces of fires in the identified fields. osi data is generated after detailed analysis and it will be completed soon to point out the spots where fires took place, he said.deputy commissioners of various districts claim that their local teams worked efficiently for field inspections, but satellite data on fires was found erroneous in several cases.prsc had sent 4,326 cases of fire alerts in ferozepur district whereas the data says fire could not be verified in 2,483 cases.in bathinda, official teams failed to establish any fire at 1,491 sites out of total 3,690 spots visited.similarly, sangrur recorded 4,557 fire cases, but the district reported no fire in 1,563 sites.meanwhile, punjab pollution control board (ppcb) member secretary krunesh garg said the satellite imagery is an established system to detect fire through using sensors.there is no human intervention in data collection and the satellite-based system works efficiently. the districts may have lacked coordination in correlating fires with satellite inputs. it should have been streamlined to get more results, says garg.

4491,o of the most iconic agrarian movements against the Fadnavis-led ruling government in the last four years- marked by striking images of farmers upturning milk cans on the roads and of callused,,0.7142014693754039,TOMATO,2019-05-06,Anomaly,Anomaly,PUNE,1.7264879600181735,7.0,2019-04-05,Normal,2019-03-24,MAHARASHTRA," bleeding feet of the tribal cultivators, marching into mumbai, were from the states north maharashtra region.as the region spread across six parliamentary constituencies goes to polls in less than a month, much water has flown under the godavari river, after the strike in 2017 and the long march in 2018. but the agrarian discontent and the dissatisfaction among tribals is still simmering. these are among the two central poll issues for the region that voted completely saffron in 2014 polls.the bjp has five sitting mps here, while one constituency, nashik, is with the shiv sena. beyond agrarian distress and drought that has affected all five districts here, caste calculations in individual seats, maratha vs obc vs scheduled tribes polarisation will also have an impact on the results. aware of the potential losses from the region, the bjp has turned down candidature for two of its sitting mps from the region, three-term mp from dindori harishchandra chavan and two-term mp from jalgaon at patil. but this has, in turn, led to internal factionalism in the bjp. the congress-ncp has an opportunity to improve their tally here, but it remains to be seen whether these parties can actually make use of an opportunity. while the congress could win back the tribal nandurbar belt, party bastion where it had lost no election until 2014; the ncp could potentially win dindori or even nashik due to local demographics and internal rivalries.agrarian distress and droughtdespite the loan waiver announced by the fadnavis government after the farmers strike in 2017, a majority of farmers are dissatisfied with the ruling government. the goodwill of the loan waiver granted to as many as 30lakh-plus farmers is not seen on ground zero.and even those who got the benefit now stand at the threshold of debt, thanks to drought. the drought this year has aggravated the disquiet, with farmers failing to recover, in many cases, even the production cost of crops. this year, i couldnt even recover the production cost of planting tomatoes over my two acres. i dont have the money to sow in june, said kailash kandbahale, a farmer from nashik district.despite this, kandbahale may vote for the shiv senas nashik candidate hemant godse and prime minister narendra modi. no government is good for farmers. the previous government was full of thieves and this one is made up of bandits. but modi is good for the countrys security. this is a urban constituency, which will anyway vote for the sena, then why should i waste my vote, kandbahale asked.he said that there was no modi wave like in 2014, but the pm continued to have a favourable image and was a deciding factor in urban areas. his extended family in dinodri, a largely rural constituency, however, will be backing nationalist congress party (ncp) candidate dhanraj mahale.political observers said that agrarian crisis continues to be one of the strongest poll issues that will go against the ruling government in rural areas. from jalgaons cotton and banana cultivators to nashiks onion, grape and vegetable farmers, there is no cultivator who is unaffected by the volatile market conditions and current drought. there is a clear urban-rural divide vis-a-vis class as well as caste, when it comes to bjp support and opposition. the middle class, also from upper castes based in cities, prefer modi and the bjp. in rural areas, there is anger against the modi government and this is most apparent among lower castes and farmers, said a senior editor with a local, vernacular newspaper.in nashik, for instance, there are nearly 8 lakh urban voters, of which a majority may be tilted in favour of the sena-bjp, while around 6 lakh voters are from the rural areas of the constituency. in dindori, a largely rural constituency, the agrarian distress, would have a greater impact.the tribal beltthe north maharashtras tribal belt, across the reserved constituencies of dindori, nandurbar and parts of nashik, is unhappy with the government over the processing of their forest rights act claims. last year, 30,000 tribal cultivators had marched from mumbai to nashik seeking justice and speedier disbursal of claims that will give them ownership rights over their land.barring surgana, where cpi (m) mla jp gavit followed up on the 12,000 claims, the government has totally failed to meet the promises made to the tribals. this is a serious issue, as is the ongoing agrarian unrest, said ashok dhawale, cpi (m) leader and head of the all india kisan sabha that played a central role in both the protests.gavit, the mla from akkalkuwa is also the cpi (m) candidate in the dindori seat, turning the poll table into a three-cornered fight. gavit, the man who led the marching 30,000 farmers, is a popular tribal leader. but this advantage to the opposition may be lost with gavit contesting the dindori seat. we had sought this seat from the ncp and they should have given it to us. they are after all the bigger party. we are contesting this seat to win, but there is a chance of the opposition votes being split between the ncp and us, said dhawale.the other subtle narrative in the tribal areas against the ruling government is the latters extension of economic and social benefits of tribal development department to the dhangar community (shepherd). the dhangars have been agitating for reservation in the scheduled tribe category for long. as the government could not deliver on this, fearing a backlash from the community, a cabinet decision was taken just ahead of the code of conduct to make all tribal linked schemes available to the dhangars.congress mla and candidate for nandurbar, kc padvis campaign takes up this issue and this could go against bjp candidate heena gavit. while gavit is not very popular, bjp leaders say in nandurbar city, support for modi will lift her chances of winning the seat.caste polarisationcaste calculations in each constituency will have an impact on the results as will the overall polarization between the marathas versus the other backward castes (obc).the states 16% reservation to the maratha community has not gone down well with the obcs, who form a significant chunk of voters in north maharashtra. in nashik a direct caste-based poll battle is likely with ncps sameer bhujbal, a mali (obc) being pitted against senas hemant godse (maratha). in dhule, bjp union minister subhash bhamre, an obc, will be pitted against congress candidate and mla kunal patil (maratha).in the case of dhule, minority votes will also make an impact as malegaon that has significant muslim votes, falls in this constituency. these votes will go to the congress, but may even lead to counter polarization, as it has for so many years in favour of the bjp.even in a reserved seat like nandurbar, for instance, the maratha vs obc factor will get played out with marathas in this case voting against gavit and in favour of the congress, while obcs may vote in favour of the bjp.the advantage in the polls will go to the party where the alliances are working together and the party organisation is activated. the bjp seems to score better than the remaining three parties when it comes to keeping its election machinery well oiled. the decision over jalgaon candidate, who was changed at the last minute is an indication that the bjp is not leaving much to chance. after minister girish mahajans close aide district jalgaon chief uday waghs wife and mlc smita wagh was given a ticket, the party witnessed opposition from ground level cadre. a survey showed that wagh was not popular and may not succeed against deokar, which led to the change in the candidate.the bjp is responsive and this may save us from the loss of one seat. the change was also done to dilute the rebellion by the sitting mp at patil, said a senior bjp leader.the congress, for a change, taking a leaf from the opponent also succeeded in stemming a rebellion from its nine-term mp manikrao gavit in nandurbar. gavit was upset as his son bharat was not given the ticket and bharat gavit had threatened to contest polls as an independent. central congress leaders met gavit and placated him after a half an hour meeting.first
