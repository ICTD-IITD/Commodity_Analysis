While he was happy with the yield 4.5 tonnes per acre the farmer was disappointed by the market price. He decided to wait it out, only to see the prices tumbling down.He is staring at a loss of Rs 4.5lakh, Kadhiresan told TOI. With a total yield of 45 tonnes, I was expecting about Rs 40/kg. When traders initially offered Rs 20/kg, I was waiting for it to go up to at least Rs Rs 35. However, after more stocks began to arrive in the market, including a variety from Palladam and Mysore that can not be stored for long, the price first dropped to Rs 15 and went down to Rs 13/kg. I am ready to sell it for at least Rs 25/kg to break even.Like other small onion farmers in the district, Kadhiresan now plans to offload some of the stock if prices dont go up after Pongal.Small onions are cultivated on 4,500 acres in Coimbatore, said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association S Palanisamy.Many farmers are getting offers as low as Rs 7 to Rs 8/kg, which will not even cover the cost of seeds, said DK Ramaswamy, another shallot farmer from Thondamuthur. It is almost like throwing away the stock.The farmers say small onions are an expensive crop to cultivate. While the seeds cost about Rs 22,500/acre, fertilizers, biofertilizers and the labour push the expense to Rs 70,000/acre, onion farmer TN Karuppusamy, who cultivates on five acres, said. I finally ended up selling some stock for Rs 13/kg. The trader has promised to give me some more money once he sells the stock at a higher price.Many shallot farmers have taken loans for cultivation, said Palanisamy. They are facing debts, for which they can not even pay the interest. The government should fix a minimum support price, he said.",ONION

It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.",ONION

""The amount will come in two tranches during rabi and kharif farming. In Bengal, there are many small and marginal farmers who own less than an acre. The cash support will be calculated on their landholdings based on the Rs 5,000-per-acre formula,"" the CM said.Target beneficiaries will be able to apply for the cash support from February 1.Banerjee's New Year gift to farmers will be a political weapon for Trinamool MPs.

The produce reaching the market is not getting sold or getting low price from traders, who still have stock to clear.Nashik traders send onions to New Delhi, Bihar and other states in North India, West Bengal, and the North East states. They prefer to transport by rail rather than road as it is cost effective and quick. While it costs Rs 5 per kg to transport onions by road, it costs only Rs 2.5 per kg by the Railways.The traders claimed that at present, they are getting one rake (each with 40 wagons) once in two-three days, though they have sought three rakes a day, considering the huge supply of onions from farmers. A delegation of Nashik traders led by the chairman of the state agriculture commission, Pasha Patel, discussed the issue with Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari a couple of days back.Railway is an effective means of transportation. About 1,600 tonnes of onions may be transported at a time through one rake. While there is demand of three rakes a day, onion traders are getting only one rake after every two-three days, Patel said. He claimed that during their meeting, Gadkari spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal , who has assured them that more rakes would be sent. The railway minister has assured Gadkari that immediate steps would be taken to increase the rakes in Nashik, said Patel.According to him, traders do not buy fresh onions from farmers till their stock is cleared. Hence, there is need to increase the transport of onions by rail and adequate rakes must be made available for the purpose, Patel added.About 2 lakh quintals of onions are auctioned a day in district APMCs during peak period. Sohanlal Bhandari, president of Nashik district onion traders association, said that recently, there was huge arrivals of onions in Agriculture Produce Market Committees. Ideally, Nashik traders need 20 rakes a week, he said. Recently, we had urged the railway administration to provide us more rakes, but it did not. This affected our despatch of onions during the peak period. We want railway administration to provide rakes as per our demand, said Bhandari.A railway official, requesting anonymity, told TOI that they had provided rakes whenever they got a demand. He claimed that the railways had provided 700 wagons from Niphad and Kherwadi stations in the past one month. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest wholesale onion market in the country, said that wholesale onion prices may increase by Rs 200 per quintal if traders are able to despatch their consignments by rail on regular basis.Availability of rakes on regular basis will help traders to increase onion procurement and that may result into rise in wholesale onion prices by at least Rs 200 per quintal from the present level, said Holkar.",ONION
36219,Man with the moves,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/man-with-the-moves/cid/1685999,2019-01-03,"A man from the small African nation of Ivory Coast has made a big impact on his housing complex at Uniworld City in New Town. At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

36220,Hope with concerns in 2019,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/hope-with-concerns-in-2019/article25904743.ece,2019-01-04,"The New Year is always looked forward to with hope, whatever the conditions might have been the previous year; 2018 has been a mixed bag, both globally and domestically.Globally, the growth rate in 2018 was high, particularly in the United States. But strong signs of a trade war emerged, dimming hopes of faster international trade. Britain is passing through the pangs of separation from the European Union. Domestically, the first quarter growth rate was high. But signs are not good for the balance of the year. The rupee underwent a severe shock as crude oil prices rose, and abated after a fall in oil prices. While prices fell, agrarian distress accentuated.Indias growth rate in 2018-19 is forecast at 7.4% by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). But it looks to be a touch-and-go situation. More likely, it will be slightly lower. Looking ahead, 2019 may not show any substantial rise in the growth rate. Even though the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has stabilised, much will depend on the pickup in the investment rate.The international environment is not that conducive for growth in our foreign trade; this will have an impact on our exports and, therefore, growth. Perhaps the growth rate will be between 7.2% and 7.5%. Though this may be the highest growth rate of any country, it falls short of our requirements.Going ahead, what are our major concerns?Investment ratioIn the final analysis, the growth rate depends on the investment rate and the productivity of capital or its inverse incremental capital-output ratio.The incremental capital output ratio is a catch-all expression. It depends upon a multiple number of factors such as quality of labour, which again depends on education and skill development levels, and technology, which is constantly changing. For ensuring a sustained high growth, we need to raise the investment ratio and keep the incremental capital-output ratio at 4. The Gross Fixed Capital Formation ratio has fallen from 35.8% in 2007-08 to 28.5% in 2017-18. The journey to raise the investment ratio is not going to be easy. Animal spirits must be revived. A tranquil political and economic environment needs to be nurtured.Banking systemAn important factor affecting economic growth is the condition of our banking system. Non-performing assets (NPAs), including stressed assets, as a proportion of loans of public sector banks stood at 16.7% as of March 2018. As many as 11 public sector banks are under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). This restricts the lending abilities of these banks. Added to this, the non banking financial company (NBFC) system is also under stress. This is partly a reflection of the stress in the banking system since most NBFCs borrow from banks. Recapitalisation of public sector banks will partly solve the problem. It is not clear at this point how much it will help in adding to lending capacity.Some have advocated providing more capital to banks outside the PCA framework as that will increase their lending capacity immediately.Today, banks are responsible both for short-term and long-term lending. Their inability to lend affects the availability of working capital as well as capital expenditures.The decision to pump in more capital to public sector banks must be completed soon. The growth rate in the industrial sector will depend on how quickly the banking system comes back to normalcy.Employment growthThere is a great concern about the inadequate growth of employment. Honestly, we do not have satisfactory employment numbers. The employment data in the organised sector are reliable. But the employment in the informal sector is much larger. One question that is asked is that if growth is around 7%, why is there no corresponding growth in employment? We need to keep two factors in mind. Growth can occur either as a result of increase in investment or because of better utilisation of existing capacity. It is growth which is led by new investment that leads to a significant increase in employment. But growth caused by improved efficiency of utilisation of existing capital can lead only to a marginal increase in employment. Much of the growth seen in the last few years is of the latter variety.Second, the increase in employment seen in the period between 2004-05 and 2009-10 was because of the rapid growth of the information technology (IT) and financial sectors. The IT sector has slowed down. The financial sector is under stress. Employment in these sectors was visible and educated entrants into the labour market found ample opportunities. The IT sector growth rate is not likely to pick up significantly as this industry is undergoing many structural changes. The revival of the banking system depends on a number of factors. Thus, even from the point of view of employment, the key factor is the pickup in investment.Indias external sector has grown and is well integrated with the rest of the world. Indias trade in goods and services as a percentage of GDP has grown to 42% of GDP. Therefore, what happens in the rest of the world affects Indias growth very much. Indias balance of payment situation has been comfortable since liberalisation. However, there are vulnerabilities as seen in September-October 2018, when the value of the rupee suddenly plummeted when crude oil prices rose and there were simultaneously capital outflows. RBI intervention and the subsequent fall in crude prices have restored the value of the rupee. In April-November 2018, Indias exports of goods grew by 11.6%. However, we need to note that exports growth was 5.2% (2016-17) and 9.8% (2017-18). Strong growth in exports is a must if we have to keep the current account deficit (CAD) at a manageable level.The forecast for world trade and output is not encouraging. There are too many uncertainties which include an intensification in the trade war. Along with export promotion, we also need to contain some of our large imports. A watch on Indias CAD is critically important if we have to achieve growth with stability.Agrarian distressThe future growth also depends on the performance of agriculture. Agrarian distress is widespread. Strangely, the fall in prices of agricultural products is in one sense a reflection of our success in raising output. Some years ago, the concern was a rise in the price of pulses to abnormally high levels. But today the picture is reversed. Thanks to increase in production, prices have fallen. Similar is the case with respect to vegetables, particularly onion. The need of agriculturists is income in current prices. The solution to the fall in prices lies in government intervening in the market and buying off the surplus over normal levels. The market will then automatically take prices to the normal level. The important requirement in this context is not only the financial capacity of the government to procure but also adequate physical arrangements to procure and store. The procured agricultural products can be sold by the government in later years when output is low or utilised in any safety net programme.Loan waivers are at best short-term solutions. The fundamental problem is one of increasing productivity and enabling farmers to achieve increased output and better prices. There is also a basic weakness that we have to address. The average size of landholding is so small that any amount of increase in productivity will not give adequate income. Farmers have to think in terms of consolidation of landholdings so that they can get the benefits of larger size. Small farmers will also have to think in terms of higher value-added products like vegetables. A combined attack to increase productivity, consolidate landholdings and improve marketing is needed to assure farmers of better income.Thus there are five concerns as we stand at the beginning of 2019. These are: raising the investment ratio; putting the banking system back on the rails; employment generation through better growth; enhancing export growth to contain the CAD; and removing agrarian distress by increasing productivity and consolidation of small landholdings. These issues need to be addressed comprehensively, if we have to achieve sustained high growth.C.

36221,Chinese flavours from Ghaziabad,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/chinese-flavours-from-ghaziabad/article25916340.ece,2019-01-05,"Its that time of the year when the heart calls out for something hot and sour. Time was when I would make a detour to the Pandara Road Market on my way back home from somewhere or the other and pick up two or three bowls of hot and sour soup from one of my favourite restaurants, Ichiban. Winter evenings are just right for the soup, which is, yes, hot and sour, and full of the good stuff  little pieces of fatty pork, nice plump shrimps, tender chicken, and a host of veggies.Wide assortmentSo, when the temperature dipped some nights ago, my heart sang for something suitably hot to placate the spirit and the body. I have tried out most of the Chinese restaurants in and around East Delhi. This time I thought I would order some dishes from a place called Dragon Noodles  a seemingly popular Chinese restaurant with outlets in Indirapuram and Vaishali.I placed my order through Swiggy. I asked for a plate of stir-fried Chinese vegetables (Rs. 180), shredded chicken in black pepper gravy (Rs. 210), roasted lamb in spring onion sauce (Rs. 230), mixed Thai basil fried rice (Rs. 170) and chicken Chinese chop suey (Rs. 180). There was hot and sour soup on the menu, too, but I am a bit finicky when it comes to this hearty soup  and like the Ichiban version more than what the others offer. So I decided Id try out the other dishes instead.And I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I had my dinner, for the dishes were, indeed, rather nice. Chinese takeaway can be awful, and I live in fear of being presented with lamb in a thick red sauce, or chicken in a gelatinous white one. But I found the food had been cooked well, and each dish had a sauce that tasted different. The stir-fried veggies were deliciously crunchy, and the Thai basil fried rice was aromatically flavoured and topped with everything from shrimps to chicken.I enjoyed my chop suey, which had crunchy noodles with chicken in a light sauce. I had the pepper chicken but thought would eat the lamb with spring onions at lunch the following day.Piquant sauceThe chicken was in a pleasantly piquant sauce. The pieces were soft, and had infused in the flavours of the black pepper. I mixed it with my fried rice, and had a satisfying meal. The next day, though, my lunch was a bit of a surprise. I got some hot rice cooked at home, and mixed it with what I thought was the lamb. But every now and then, I got the feeling I was eating chicken, too. That was when I discovered that our (wo)manager of the hearth had thought the chicken and the lamb  with similar looking brown sauces  were two plates of the same dish, and heated them together. So I ended up eating shredded chicken and roasted lamb in black pepper gravy and spring onion sauce. And it wasnt half bad!Dragon Noodles gives me hope. One day I am going to try out its hot and sour soup, along with a dish called Dragon cottage cheese with spinach .But if anything has to be heated the next day, I am going to supervise the proceedings. Or maybe not.",ONION

Moreover, the average wholesale price of Kharif onions has also dropped by 23% to Rs710 per quintal in the last three days.The lack of demand for summer onions has led to drop in average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon. The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs160 per quintal on Thursday, against Rs150 per quintal on December 3, 2016.The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs100 and Rs235 per quintal, respectively on Thursday. In the retail markets of Nashik city, summer onions were sold at Rs10-12 per kg, while fresh kharif onions were sold at the price range from Rs 15-20 per kg.On December 28, 2018, the union ministry of commerce increased the incentives on onion export from 5% to 10% in order to boost onion export of the country to increase the demand for onions and thereby stop the crash in wholesale onion prices.Although the price of summer onions continued to crash, the average wholesale prices of fresh kharif onions had increased by Rs200 per quintal  from Rs700 on December 28 to Rs931 per quintal on Monday. But the average wholesale onion prices have again dropped by Rs220 per quintal in the past three days to Rs710 per quintal on Thursday.The minimum and maximum wholesale price of new kharif onions were recorded at Rs 300 and Rs898 per quintal respectively on Thursday.Last year, the average wholesale price of summer onions was recorded at Rs951 per quintal at Lasalgaon on the last working day before Diwali vacation on November 1. Thereafter, the Lasalgaon APMC remained closed for 10 days till November 11.The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 800 per quintal once the market reopened after Diwali vacation on November 11 and the wholesale prices of summer onions were in the price range up to Rs700 for next few days. The drop in wholesale price of summer onions began thereafter and the wholesale prices crashed to Rs300-400 per quintal by November-end, an APMC official said.The arrivals of fresh kharif onions began after the market reopened after Diwali.

He said a report had been sent to the government in this regard.The crop has been raised on 15,379 ha in eight taluks, including Pullampadi, Manachanallur, Thuraiyur, Uppilliyapuram and Vaiyampattai, and the pest has destroyed almost the entire cultivated area. Fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda) was first reported in the country a few months back in Karnataka and Telangana, following which the Indian Council for Agricultural Research sounded an alert. The pest spreads fast and attacks have been reported in Karur and Tiruchi districts. Farmers in Tiruchi district have been demanding compensation for the damage.Speaking at the monthly farmers grievance day meeting, Mr. Rajamani said based on demand from farmers, steps were being taken to get compensation from the government as a special case.A sum of Rs. 1 crore had been released as an initial allotment to the district for being disbursed as compensation to farmers whose coconut trees were damaged during Cyclone Gaja. The compensation had been disbursed to 1,121 farmers in Tiruverumbur, Srirangam, Manapparai and Marungapuri taluks. The government also made an initial allotment of Rs. 1.68 crore for being disbursed as compensation to farmers whose horticultural crops were damaged in the cyclone. The money would be deposited in the bank accounts of the affected farmers within the next few months.Agriculture crops on about 228 hectares and horticulture crops on 2,331 ha had been damaged in the cyclone and the district administration sought Rs. 2.21 crore to be disbursed as compensation for damaged agricultural crops and Rs. 3.41 crore for damaged horticultural crops.Steps would be taken to get the remaining sum and disburse the compensation to all affected farmers soon, he added.Speaking on the issue, R. Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, sought adequate compensation for maize farmers, whose crops have been damaged by the pest attack, and small onion (shallots) growers whose crops have been damaged due to frost. As per an earlier announcement by the Union government, compensation can be given to all crops if the loss was more than 33%, he said.P. Viswanathan, president, Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam, demanded sanction of Rs. 25,000 an acre for farmers whose maize and small onion crops have been damaged.Earlier, a cross-section of the farmers staged a demonstration in front of the Collectors Office condemning Karnatakas attempts to build a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu.Responding to a plea from Puliyur A.Nagarajan, president, Farmers Wing of Tamil Maanila Congress, Mr. Rajamani said that a causeway would be built soon across the Kollidam river at Mukkombu to enable villagers and farm workers on the North bank of the river to cross over.He also disclosed that Annawari certificates would be issued to farmers in cyclone affected areas by tahsildars to enable them get their bank loans rescheduled.",ONION

Beginning Sunday, the next three weekends will see three grand events on the sprawling grounds: Bhim Mahasangam, a meeting of the citys scheduled caste communities on January 6; a two-day convention of national leaders, elected representatives and state office bearers on January 11 and 12; and Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20, when party leaders will address the youth.Senior party leaders claimed Bhim Mahasangam will be a unique event in which chef Vishnu Manohar will break his own record by preparing 5,000 kg of khichdi in a single vessel. Manohar had entered the Guinness Book of Records with a 3,000-kg khichdi event in Nagpur in October 2018. The oversized vessel Manohar used at the Nagpur event has been retrofitted for a bigger quantity of food and transported to Delhi. Gas stoves will be installed on a 15ftx15ft platform constructed close to the dais.We have collected over 10,000 kg of rice and lentils from about three lakh SC families in the past few days for the dish, disclosed Ashok Goel, media convenor, Delhi BJP . The rest of the ingredients  tomatoes, garlic, onion, salt, etc  have been arranged by the party. We will set up distribution points on the ground and a team of 1,000 people will serve the dish to people attending the meet.The party is expecting over 25,000 people at the event. The idea is to bring all sub-castes of the SC community under one roof and deliver the message of unity in diversity. The party leaders will elaborate on the work the Modi government has done for the community, said the head of media and IT cell.The bigger challenge for the party workers, however, is the organisation of the national convention on January 11 and 12, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and top leaders from different states. More than 12,000 delegates are expected to attend.Apart from the main event area from where the top leaders will address the delegates, we are also setting up separate lounges for the Prime Minister, national president and the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states, said a party leader. There will be two separate halls where the members of the national executive and other delegates will be served food. Arrangements are also being made for the PM, Union ministers and CMs to discharge urgent administrative work from the ground itself.BJP has formed 24 teams to look after the travelling arrangements, local transport and accommodation for the delegates and manage the logistics, work stations and internet connectivity, sound and LED screens and well as the internal and external beautification of the venue. Over 80,000 city youths are expected to participate in the Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20.",ONION
36226,In Karnataka  row over midday meal,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-karnataka-row-over-midday-meal/article25923067.ece,2019-01-06,"The Karnataka governments midday meal programme in schools has run into controversy with one of its NGO partners in the mammoth welfare exercise, International Society for Krishna Consciousnesss subsidiary Akshaya Patra Foundation (APF), refusing to include onion and garlic in cooking.Following this, the State government has not yet signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to continue the programme with APF that supplies food to 4.49 lakh students in government and government-aided schools through its centralised kitchens in several cities.In Bengaluru alone, it provides meals to 1.83 lakh students across 1,212 schools.In November, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education directed the foundation to include onion and garlic in the noon meal and start supplying hot milk instead of cold milk to the students. While the foundation has started supplying hot milk to some schools on a pilot basis, it has categorically said it will not add onion and garlic.Why does it matter?An official of the State Food Commission said it had received complaints about students skipping the midday meals as they did not like the taste of the food without onion and garlic, which are an integral part of the food culture among most communities.Children skipping meals is worrying because malnutrition is a serious issue. According to the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS) data for Karnataka (2015-2016), 36.2% of the children below the age of five are stunted, while 26.1% are wasted. The survey also reveals that 10.5% of the children were severely wasted, while 35.2% are underweight.The Central Food Technological Research Institute has sent a report to the Department based on its earlier research findings that both onion and garlic were found to enhance the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from grain.But the institute has stated that during its survey across 270 schools in Mysuru district between January and May 2017, it found the average calorific value of the meals supplied by the APF was more than a school-cooked meal. The APF has said in a statement that its cooked meals are in compliance with the nutritional norms prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.What is the governments stand?Principal Secretary S.R. Umashankar said a final call would be taken after considering the feedback from students and teachers. The APF has had a series of meeting with several stakeholders, including officials of the State Food Commission and the Education Department. The government will have to either accept the dietary norms of APF or make alternative arrangements for supplying food.Are health activists worried?Around 145 health activists, experts and citizens, who are part of the Right to Food Campaign and the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, have written to the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Chief Minister, stating that children are eating less as they find the food bland.Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher who is one of the signatories, argued for cooking culturally appropriate food in de-centralised kitchens.Activists have also demanded that eggs be served as part of the midday meals as it is a good source of protein. They want the contract with the APF terminated, and meals prepared by self-help groups and other community-based organisations in accordance with nutritional norms and cultural practices, using fresh local produce.Veena Shatrugna, a clinical nutritionist and former Ddeputy Director of the National Institute of Nutrition, said, Normally, phytates and oxalates found in vegetarian diets precipitate iron and zinc and prevent their absorption from the gut. Onion and garlic appear to enhance absorption of these minerals. This is significant, she pointed out, because around 50% to 70% of children in India are anaemic.Tanu Kulkarni",ONION

One, a chef, cleaned fresh red snapper filets with a sharp knife. The other, a filmmaker, pointed her camera into a large pot of simmering vegetables.What would you say this is, low heat or medium? Tuleka Prah asked, setting the camera aside.Low heat, said 38-year-old Touty Sarr, who runs the kitchen of a popular cafe in Dakar. She turned to her daughter, who was watching her cook. This one, if you put it on high, it would all get dry. Thats one of the secrets.Senegal was Ms. Prahs fifth destination since her project began in 2012. She hopes to show the care and skill that goes into African dishes, such as South Africas fried dough amagwinya and Kenyas kachumbari, an onion and tomato salad.The idea, at its most basic, is to present the food how people who love it would love it, Ms. Prah said. Its like a database or a digital vault where people can open the drawer, see recipes, see some ingredients.Born in England to a Ghanaian father and a South African mother, she lived in six African countries during her childhood, including Namibia, Kenya and what is now South Sudan. After finding no reliable recipes online for Ghanaian dishes and no photos that made the beloved food look appetising she started My African Food Map.Cuisines of a continentShe celebrates the cuisines of a continent often marred by negative stereotypes.Africa is often associated with poverty, with hunger, with failures of food in a political and nutritional sense, said James C. McCann, chair of the history department at Boston University and a specialist in African environmental history and cuisine. Its an area of the world that has not been covered by the food craze.Other culinary historians, chefs, and foodies are fighting such stereotypes. Some, like author and professor Jessica Harris, have studied African and diaspora cuisine, exploring the roots of foods taken far from home by slavery. Others, like Fran Osseo-Asare and her Ghanaian-focused project Betumi, investigate the foods of a single country.The internet was the democratisation of African food writing, said Osseo-Asare, who said she has blogged about African food since the 1980s. When the internet came, you didnt have publishers as gatekeepers that could stop you from getting your work out.Unique among prominent bloggers, Ms. Prah takes an almost pan-African approach.I always feel like I am from the whole continent, she said. I can find myself in different aspects of different countries I visit.The best outcome is when people say, That is our food, that is our dish, she said, remembering her work in Kenya. I was extremely happy when the first comments I got on YouTube were, Oh, this reminds me of home.To find authentic recipes and skilled chefs, Ms. Ms. Prah asks everyone she meets in a country  hosts, cab drivers, shopkeepers and strangers  about their favourite foods. She met Ms. Sarr this way, through friends of friends.I learned from my grandma. I used to follow her everywhere, said Ms. Sarr, who wears her stiff white chefs uniform every time she cooks, even at home, because it makes her feel more professional. And our grandmas, they think that taking time with the food gives it more flavor. So I take time, too.She said she became a chef after money ran out to pursue her dream of being a doctor.By smell, sound and tasteShe dropped garlic into sizzling oil, then stepped back as Ms. Prah moved close to the pot to film. The two women orbited each other, artists collaborating over the pot burbling on the stove.Ms. Sarr said she cooks by smell, by sound and by taste, but Ms. Prah wrote her steps down in order, recording a recipe for others without the guidance of grandmothers and mothers at their side.After two hours, the platter was ready.Ms. Prah snapped a picture, and then another, before putting her camera aside to try the dish.Its really good, she said.",ONION

The first day of the 48-hour shutdown was mostly peaceful, except at Manjeri in Malappuram where traders fended off an attempt by trade unionists to close shops forcibly.Railway tracks blockedStrike supporters blocked railway tracks, upsetting rail schedules and causing trains to run late. Autorickshaws, buses and taxis remained off the road. However, private vehicles plied as usual.Retail business remained mostly unaffected, with a large number of shops and restaurants opening for business. However, wholesale markets came to a standstill, raising the spectre of a rise in commodity prices.

The produce is currently selling for Rs. 60 a kg in the retail market, up from Rs. 25 a kg barely two days ago. The sudden surge in price has been attributed to a severe shortage due to crop failure in both Karnataka and Maharashtra.The tomato growing areas  Kolar-Chikkaballapur  are reeling under drought and, hence, the yield has been severely hit.Crop failureUsually at this time of the year, tomatoes come to Bengaluru's market from Nasik in Maharashtra. But the crop has completely failed in Maharashtra due to drought and a rain deficit, said a senior HOPCOMS official.Most of the farmers have not even sown tomatoes this season, as there was a severe rain deficit and many borewells have dried up. Those who sowed tomatoes saw their crop drop to less than half, said G. Sanna Munigowda, a vegetable farmer from Chikkaballapur, who added that the situation with other veggies is no different.There is a severe water shortage, which when coupled with falling temperatures, have adversely affected short-term crops. The yield is so less that prices have shot up, he said.But farmers say their profit margins are not good.Most of us are not even able to recover the input costs due to the low yield, said Papareddy, a farmer from Kolar district.A silver liningThe price of other vegetables, too, have been rising steadily over the last two weeks. Beans, carrots, brinjal, ladies finger and most other vegetables have crossed the Rs. 45 mark. The silver lining is the price of onions and potatoes, which are still in the affordable range of of Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kilo.December  January is that time of the year when vegetable yield is comparatively low due to winter. But the prices do not rise as avarekai (field beans) dominates the platter during these months.

All this from an investment of just Rs 2lakh.At a time when sugar cane and onion cultivators are struggling to make adequate returns from their produce, some farmers in the Junnar tehsil are making a killing from coriander thanks to the demand-supply mismatch for the herb caused by extreme cold conditions and a paucity of water. Junnar is about 92km from here on the Nashik highway.Kute said this year has been exceptional. In the past decade, I have never got such good returns from coriander. For the past two years, I have been growing tomatoes, leafy vegetables and summer fruits like watermelon and muskmelon, but I never made so much money due to the low prices in the market. In fact, a few months ago, I had to throw away hundreds of crates of tomato due to market fluctuations and suffered heavy losses, he said.Like Kute, many coriander farmers have made good profits from the high prices their produce is fetching due to the demand-supply gap this year. Reports from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Narayangaon and Pune reveal that the kitchen staple, which usually sells for Rs 5-10 a bunch, is now commanding between Rs 30 and Rs 50.Kamlakar Wajge, a farmer from Narayangaon who is also a commission agent, earned Rs 2 lakh from the coriander harvest. Vegetable production shortage is unusual during the winter. But this year, the scenario is different. Many farmers could not grow several vegetables because of a water shortage. Now, there is a gap in demand and supply. This has resulted in an unprecedented price escalation for coriander in the market.Satish Dombale, from Otur, who made Rs1lakh in a week, added, I had cultivated coriander on 20 gunthas of land. I faced losses with all the other vegetables I had grown last year. But coriander has saved me. I can now use this capital to grow more vegetables in the coming months.According to the Narayangaon APMC data, in the past 10 days, it has received around 1.5 lakh coriander bunches every day from Junnar, Shirur, Ambegaon and Khed tehsils. Usually, in the winter months, we get around 2.5 lakh coriander bunches daily, said Sanjay Kale, the chairman of the Narayangaon market, putting a figure on the volume of shortage.At the Pune APMC market, the officials reported getting just 1 lakh coriander bunches every day against the usual supply of 2.5-3 lakh bunches. In January, a bunch of coriander usually sells for Rs 3-5. But over the past fortnight, a bunch is selling for Rs 25-30, said a senior APMC official.Talking of the possible cause for the low production, Rajaram Deshmukh, former vice-chancellor of the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, said, Growth of vegetables is affected when the temperature drops below 10C. In recent times, the night temperatures have been low. This must have adversely impacted the vegetable harvest.",ONION

If not, pay a visit to Arumugam evening mutton stall which specialises in mutton dishes - their bone roast is the most soughtafter. The eatery offers parotta along with a range of mutton dishes including liver fry, brain fry, boti (intestine) fry and curries.Established as a roadside stall about fifty years ago by P Arumugam, it is now run by his three sons. It is situated near the famous Tallakulam Perumal temple in Madurai where crowds swell in the morning and evening. A Saravanan, one of the sons, said their success lies in the quality of raw materials, including the meat which they have been sourcing from the same mutton stall which has been in business for three generations.While all the other dishes are eaten along with parotta or rice, bone roast can be enjoyed as a single dish. I wait for Wednesdays to just have two plates of bone roast for lunch and never miss this meal if I am in Madurai, said S Kumar, a software engineer. A plate of about 75g of the dish costs Rs70.Thigh bones of the goat are chopped into two-inch pieces, washed, marinated in salt and turmeric and boiled in a pressure cooker till it turns tender. Earlier it used to be boiled in an open fire for many hours. This is usually done at the home kitchen and brought to the shop.The speciality of this dish is its flavour, spiced with only pepper. No chilli is added, said Saravanan. The marrow within the bone and the meat on the bones imbibe the strong flavours, he added.Cook Rajaram, who specialises in the dish, said that the dish is prepared by frying a handful of finely chopped onions along with ginger, garlic, cumin, salt, curry leaves, mint leaves and coriander. It is spiced with cinnamon and fennel seeds. When the onion turns translucent, a handful of boiled bones are added to it, fried and served on a platter, garnished with onion and lemon rings.The shop opens at 11am and is open till 11.30pm, but the delicious bone roast is sold out by evening. The shop closes only on Diwali and Pongal every year.Gfx:Where  Near the Tallakulam Perumal TempleTime  11 AM to 11.30 PM on all daysWhat  Bone roast, brain roast and liver roastPrice  Rs 70 per plate of bone roast",ONION

The old kuchumber  chopped tomatoes, onions and cucumber  worked for me. I must also admit that I am a changed man. The difference that a freshly plucked sprig of basil  which grows in my back verandah  makes to a bowl of fresh veggies has turned me into a salad freak. Its not just the flavour of the basil that does the trick, I believe. Its also the fact that it is fresh, grows in my backyard, and is organic.Now I know what the old aunt  who disapproved of modern contraptions such as a fridge in the old days  meant when she talked about fresh food. For its not just freshness of cooked food that tickles your palate; what adds to the taste is the freshness of the ingredients. And if there are no chemicals, the flavours magnify.Going organicSo, that explains why my young friend Abhishek Basu has been focusing on fresh and organic ingredients at The Park in New Delhi. I had a delicious meal the other day at the restaurant called Fire, and realised how difficult it is to curate a full menu, day after day, that features local dishes, cooked with local and organic ingredients. Because organic farming is still to take off in a big way in our country, it is not easy to source your ingredients if you are cooking on a large scale.People would promise, but not be able to deliver the ingredients, Chef Basu says. I finally found my farmers, but for the food to be completely organic and to be able to use the local produce, I have to make sure that I change my menu three times a year.I am not doing all the hard work, but I must say that it is worth it. For the new winter menu that he has created is superb. One, the dishes are those that people have grown up eating  but in different parts of the country. So there is the Singju salad of Manipur, and fish in a coconut based gravy of Malabar. It includes the juicy nalli nihari gosht of Old Delhi, and the Lahori chicken that you will find in the north. I had my winter favourite  aloo methi  and the bhatt ki dal of Uttarakhand.There was too much food on my platter for one meal, so I could only taste some of the dishes. I loved the hot and spicy rasam and the salad  which consisted of shredded cabbage, lotus stem, coriander mixed with roasted gram flower and pigeon peas.The platter of snacks was delicious. It consisted of crispy Hyderabadi lukmi (keema puffs), barbequed Kashmiri tujji chicken, gulnar ki tikki (prepared with fig, walnut, paneer, puffed amaranth, kale powder and tomatoes) and papad-crusted beetroot patties stuffed with coconut.The thali came adorned with little bowls, all carrying regional favourites. I enjoyed the fresh aloo methi and the thick but light bhatt ki dal. The river sole was delectable, sweetly flavoured with coconut milk and raw mango. I have had way too much of chicken in the last few months, so I let the Lahori chicken be and concentrated instead on the dessert, which was stupendous. I enjoyed the chikoo cheese cake and the chocolate fondant immersed in a cup of south Indian filter coffee.The prices at The Fire are pretty reasonable, if you consider the fact that its a luxury hotel. The salad was for Rs. 295 (before taxes), the vegetarian dishes on the platter were for Rs. 395 and the meat or chicken ones for Rs. 645.The desserts are for Rs. 345, and the prices of the mains vary between Rs. 445 and Rs. 795 (the latter for the Pandhi pork curry).Chef Basu offers us a delectable meal to beat the cold: it is regional, healthy  and ever so tasty.",ONION

Experts say that due to low sowing, prices of these commodities are expected to shoot during the summer months by 30-40%.As per the sowing data released by state agriculture department, garlic sowing is 50% less in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18. Onion is 37% less as compared to previous year while coriander is a significant 58% less.Agriculture stakeholders said that the dip in sowing is mainly due to poor monsoon and scarce availability of irrigation waters. All the three crops are grown mainly in Saurashtra region which is reeling under severe water and agri-crisis.Farmers said that with scarcity looming large and no guarantee of a good crop, many have opted to sow fodder which guarantees to sell in times of scarcity.Pratap Sarodiya, an farmer in Bhavnagar said that onion crop he reaped last year had failed to fetch a good price. ""I had put my onions in cold storage hoping to get good price but am getting a paltry Rs 2 per kg which is the cost of cold storage. I chose to sow fodder which at least save cattle during this year of scarcity,"" said Sarodiya.Vashram Bhambhaniya, farmer in Gir-Somnath district, said he had sown coriander last but has taken no crop this winter due to scarcity of water.Ghanshyam Patel, chairman of agriculture produce market committee of Mahuva in Bhavnagar said farmers have stayed away from onion and garlic as these crops failed to fetch them good price last year. Less availability of water is another key reason.""During Diwali, onions fetched Rs 20 kg for farmers which is now getting only Rs 2 per kg. Similar situation prevails in garlic crop. Impact of this low sowing will be felt by people in summer when retail prices would rise due to low production,"" said Patel. Agriculture department officials said barring four crops of jowar, cumin, fennel and fodder, sowing of major 17 crops in the state has been less than 100%. Usually, till first week of January, sowing of almost all crop is around 100%. In January 2018, 13 crops out of 21 had recorded 100% or more sowing.",ONION

The government would grant subsidy for a maximum of 200 quintals of onions sold during this period.The initial deadline for applying for the subsidy was January 15. We have now extended it to January 25 as there was demand from the farmers. Moreover, the authorities of different Agriculture Produce Market Committees too had requested for the extension, department officials added.So far, about 70,000 onion farmers in Nashik have applied for the grant.The extension of the deadline will help those farmers who are yet to apply for the grant, said Gautam Bansane, deputy district registrar, Nashik.A section of the farmers have urged the state government to extend the period of sale of onions to avail ex-gratia grant from December 15 to January 30. Farmers have incurred heavy losses due to crash in wholesale onion prices and they could not even recover transport cost. The production cost for onions is around Rs 900 per quintal. Most of the farmers have sold their produce at Rs 100-200 per quintal, said Kuber Jadhav, onion farmer.We want the state government to increase the ex-gratia amount to Rs 500 per quintal and union government should also give funds to the state in the interest of farmers, he added.",ONION

Bandra resident Samir Firasta, who spotted Nath during his morning walk, saw that he had completely stopped breathing and was lying listless. He immediately started giving CPR to Nath and asked a bystander to fetch an automated external defibrillator (AED) machine that was installed at the nearby Otters Club .

He didnt respond to the first one but started breathing mildly after the second shock, he said, adding that he was transported to Holy Family Hospital in an ambulance.

Correspondingly, production doubled from 21.42 lakh tonnes to 46 lakh tonnes. Almost 80% of the rise in the onion area took place in the past two years.After that, farmers quickly expanded. In 2017, I produced over 450 quintals from four acres. I sold the produce for Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,200 per quintal. Considering the good rates, I doubled the area to eight acres, said Rajesh Pawar, a farmer from Deola.Many like Pawar switched to onion with the hope of getting robust returns. Their hopes were dashed with the sharp fall in prices last year. The high production resulted in a glut in the market and the average wholesale price of onions grown last summer crashed to Rs 200 per quintal. Now, farmers are left with huge stockpiles of onions.I produced around 1,000 quintals from eight acres but did not get good rates. I sold around 600 quintals at an average rate of Rs 300 per quintal. I had to dump around 200 quintals and the remaining 200 quintals in storage have begun sprouting. I had spent around Rs 4.5 lakh on cultivation but could not recover the cost, said Pawar.

I have come to the conclusion that some days are just meant to be. In our mad, rush-hour existence, we are often disappointed when a mission doesnt lead to the goal in mind. After a pleasant half hour loitering around in Prithviraj Market and meeting old friends, I say, So what? Whats a goal, after all?Searching for kababsLet me start at the beginning. I wanted to eat some kababs, and I wanted to try out a small kabab corner that I had noticed in Khan Market a few weeks ago. I went there and discovered that the barbecue was still to be lit. So I started walking towards Prithviraj Market, where my car was parked. I like this part of Khan Market because it is not glitzy like its mega-rich cousin on the other side of the road. This side is still middle class and has two of the best meat shops in New Delhi. I first went past my old favourite  The Meat Shop  run by a very enthusiastic and polite youngS man. I was happy to meet him after years, and happier still to find that my old butcher and fish slicer were still there. I doffed my cap to them, and then went in search of another old favourite, Mirajuddin.But before that, I stopped by at a new Gopala outlet. The Khan Market branch of the popular sweet shop, which now sells a whole lot of other products (such as namkeen and breads), had opened last month. I had heard from a friend that they were selling various kinds of cheese, but the only cheese they had was the pizza variety. I love their rasgullas, but bought some of the kalakand instead (Rs. 560 a kilo; nice, mildly sweet, but could have been just a bit more moist), some lavash (Rs. 50 a packet), crusty garlic butter slices (Rs. 40), jeera ajwain biscuits (Rs. 120), walnut bran biscuits (Rs. 210) and coconut biscuits (Rs. 108). The coconut biscuits were superb, the jeera ajwain biscuits werent bad either and I am told the walnut bran cookies were rather good, too. The bread is for friends who are coming over for dinner, so more about that later.Whats also interesting is that Gopala is selling kachoris these days. It had muttar kachori (Rs. 10 a piece) and pyaaz kachori (Rs. 20). They were not bad, I was told, and had a very hot filling of peas and onions. But, of course, they cannot be compared with the hot kachoris that come out of kadhais in many sweet shops in various parts of Delhi.Kings special dishFrom Gopala, I went to Mirajuddins meat shop, just to tease him a bit. Do you have labbe, I asked him. Now labbe is a small piece near the liver which you very rarely find in meat shops.Mirajuddin looked stunned. No, he didnt have labbe, but he did have a story to tell. A badshah once wanted to feed his guests labbe. So a hundred goats were slaughtered for just one dish of labbe, he said.Thats some story, I said. And that was some trip down memory lane. And so what if the journey didnt lead to the desired kababs? I met some old friends, ate some good biscuits, and heard a nice story.",ONION

Freshly dug out from many layers of soil, the mud-covered skeleton lay on its spine, awaiting a number.That would be 283, says W.R.A.S. Rajapaksa. He is standing on an elevation inside the site, located at a busy junction in Mannar, an island town in Sri Lankas Tamil-majority Northern Province. In his blue smock, the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer at Mannar District General Hospital looks like a surgeon, except that this operation is taking place under the sun, inside a messy soil pit. So he is also wearing a cap and rubber boots.On a Monday morning earlier this month, at least four skeletons were clearly visible at the site, while parts of another were protruding from the soil. Where they lay  some piled one on top of the other and a couple to the side  it was at least two metres below ground level, says Rajapaksa, the chief investigator of the latest mass grave to be found in Sri Lanka.As of Friday (January 18), 300 skeletons, including those of 23 children below the age of 12, have been identified. Members of his team that comprised fellow judicial medical officers, forensic archaeologists and analysts had resumed excavating the skeletons after a break for Christmas and the New Year. Wetting their brushes in a cup of water, they gently pried aside the soil deposits over the bones, making them visible, little by little, to the world they had left behind.Scene of crimeWe consider this a scene of crime until proven otherwise, says Rajapaksa on what happens to be the 125th day of the excavation, being undertaken following a directive from the Mannar magistrate court. The bodies had been found dumped, instead of being laid to rest beside each other, as would be the case in a cemetery.In March 2018, construction workers stumbled upon human remains while preparing to build a new outlet for the state-run cooperative Sathosa (in place of its old building that had been demolished). Little did they know that they would be uncovering one of Sri Lankas largest mass graves almost a decade after the civil war ended in 2009.Says Rajapaksa, Of the 283 skeletons identified here so far, we have excavated 277 and stored them at the court premises.Samples will be sent to a laboratory in the U.S., in Miami, Florida, possibly next week, for carbon dating analysis. The process, which is often used in archaeology and forensic study, would ascertain the amount of Carbon-14 in bone and teeth samples. This could help establish the approximate period in which the person lived, before it possibly leads investigators to the likely year of their death or to those behind it.At 9.45 in the morning, the shops in the area are open and teeming with customers. With the post office, market and the bus terminus all in the same vicinity, a number of vehicles criss-cross the grand bazaar area, or periyakadai sandi as the locals call it. Motorists on their way to work slow down and turn their heads 90 degrees to catch a glimpse of the grave site that has drawn media attention to their otherwise neglected town.Pedestrians stop and watch for a few seconds. Perhaps deterred by the uniformed policemen and Special Task Force personnel stationed under a neem tree adjoining the site, some move a safe distance away before pulling out their smart phones for a picture of the ongoing exhumation.Mannar district, along Sri Lankas north-western coast, is part mainland and part small island, connected by a causeway. The mass grave has surfaced at the districts main town on Mannar island, a thin patch of land jutting into the Palk Strait like a little fin. On the western tip of this little island is Talaimannar, the closest point to Dhanushkodi in India, in Tamil Nadus Rameswaram district. Some 30 km apart and with a narrow stretch of the Indian Ocean running between them, Talaimannar and Rameswaram were once connected by a popular ferry service that, since the 1980s, has been defunct. In the nearly three decades of Sri Lankas civil war, waged by the state armed forces against the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), both towns bore witness to mass displacement, rough boat rides, and prolonged separation but also a precious solidarity among the common people.Business as usualSays Meeramohideen Salman, a vegetable vendor who has a small shop right opposite the mass grave site, It has not been a great season. I have had to slash prices to make sure I sell enough. On a good day, I make about LKR 3,500 a day [about Rs. 1,360], and it is barely enough to feed my family.The lull in business had little to do with the excavation nearby. Months of erratic weather  a severe drought followed by flash floods  had affected both the harvest and prices, adds Salman. He has been running the stall here for 12 years, he says, from the time he returned from Kalpitiya in Puttalam, some 240 km south, where many Muslims like him had fled after the LTTE ordered their expulsion from the north in October 1990.He says, Had the cooperative store come up across the road as planned, they would have sold vegetables like onions for at least five rupees lesser. That would have hit me harder.Even at the other shops adjoining the site, managers spoke only of practical hindrances. The trucks bringing their supplies from Colombo now stop at the main road, since the excavation site is cordoned off, along with the lane to these shops. The load is physically carried to the stores by workers, unlike earlier, when the trucks could drive into the lane. For the row of shops here, the implications of having a mass grave unearthed in their midst seemed, at best, logistical.Cycle of distressHowever, for some residents a little further away from the site, the excavation and the sighting of skeletal remains has meant another cycle of distress. Especially if they happen to be like the thousands of mothers looking for a loved one who forcibly disappeared during those tumultuous war years.A war that spanned 30 years, a savage state unleashing mass violence, armed militant groups offering resistance  at times with their own brand of brutality  have meant a massive human cost. The casualties were more than a lakh, as in some estimates. With the unresolved mysteries of the deaths and disappearances of Tamil rebels, activists, journalists, and scores of civilians haunting them for years, the survivors in the north struggle to recover from the everyday imprint of trauma. Even if they choose to look ahead rather than behind, healing is not easy as they strive to make ends meet in a battered economy with no promising jobs and few sympathetic political leaders who chose action over rhetoric.Amarasingam Ranjinis son, who was in the LTTE, went missing in the summer of 1999. He was born when she was still in her teens following her early marriage. They [army] took him for questioning, and he has not come back in these 20 years, she says. While her other son and daughter now live in India, Ranjini, 60, stays in her hometown all alone.She still hopes to see her son one day. I do believe he is alive somewhere and I will continue looking for him. But when I saw this mass grave site and heard about the hundreds of bodies being unearthed, I wondered if one of them could be my son. The thought did cross my mind, she says, breaking down, torn between denial and resignation.It was this double-edged fear that the Sri Lankan-born writer Michael Ondaatje described in his novel Anils Ghost . There was always the fear, double-edged, that it was their son in the pit, or that it was not their son  which meant there would be further searching, he wrote, of a fictional grave site with submerged bones.Mothers of those who disappeared in the run-up to the final phase of the war in 2009  many after being reportedly taken by state agencies for questioning  are far from accepting that their child could be dead. Those looking for relatives who went missing in the 1990s allow for that option, but have no way to reconcile with it in the absence of evidence, says Jena Jayakanthi, a Mannar-based activist working with the families of the disappeared. If you havent seen your childs body, how do you begin to believe that he is dead? she asks.The Sri Lankan Army has repeatedly denied having played a role, but has done little else to explain what happened to those its personnel picked up for questioning, or the others who were seen surrendering to its officers.Manoharan Vetrimalar, who is looking for her disappeared son and son-in-law, raises her grandchildren in Mannar while her daughter works in Saudi Arabia as a house help to support the family. She says, The grama sevaka (village officer) told me to obtain a death certificate for my missing relatives, so that I can receive some financial assistance for their loss. My daughter said nothing doing, we have not seen the body and we cannot accept that. But the families, she adds, are fatigued after years of petitioning different state commissions and repeating their stories. And then when a mass grave like this is found, it is very disturbing.Getting to the bottom of itApart from the troubling reality of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances coexisting with unexpectedly found human remains in the heart of town, the mass grave has also set off considerable speculation within and outside Mannar. Stories travel, supplemented by recollections of senior citizens some of whom remember a bank building at the site before the now-demolished cooperative store was built  and acquiring new details and narratives.Home to nearly 1 lakh people, mostly Tamils (Catholics, Hindus) and Tamil-speaking Muslims, Mannar is the most religiously diverse district in the north. During the war, the LTTE was in control of mainland Mannar, part of the Vanni region sandwiched between the Sinhala-majority south of Sri Lanka and the northern Jaffna peninsula. On the other hand, Mannar island itself was, for the most part, under the jurisdiction of the Sri Lankan Army and Navy, recalls Ranjini, quickly pulling out her 1999 Army IC or the identity card distributed by the Army, that was used to keep track of those moving between Mannar island and the mainland.Says Vetrimalar, Our district has seen a lot. I have very vivid images of shells piercing through walls, people falling dead, and of the many who were badly injured. Now, 10 years after the war ended, we are desperately looking for our missing relatives but no answers have been forthcoming. Shouldnt we know what really happened to them?The Sri Lankan government set up the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) in 2016 to investigate the scores of cases of missing persons, reported from both the former war zones in the north-east, and during the states ferocious crackdown on radical Sinhala youth in the south in the late 1980s. Amnesty International estimates a total of at least 60,000 disappearances in the country.The exact number of missing persons from Mannar is not clear. The OMP has so far not put out lists or numbers, perhaps because its own task includes comparing and verifying figures mentioned in previous lists compiled by other commissions.Says OMP chairman Saliya Pieris, The OMP has been acting as an observer in this case since June 2, 2018 as it is a mass grave site that may relate to cases of disappearances and missing persons that fall under our mandate. The office stepped in last year to financially support the excavation efforts and will also help transport the samples to a testing laboratory in Florida.Some among the families of the disappeared are sceptical of the OMPs ability to provide them the answers they have been chasing for years. Most of them have already testified before multiple government-appointed panels earlier, to no avail.Says Jeyakanthi, This is a state institution. How can a party accused of committing a crime probe it fairly and deliver justice to the victims?It was in March 2018, just around the time of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session in Geneva, that Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the commissioners to the OMP. The OMP has held at least seven public sittings in different districts in the war-affected north, east and the south, where disappearances have been reported.Says parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan at his party office a few hundred metres from the site, So far the OMP has at least been transparent about what they can and cant do. We need a thorough and complete investigation into this mass grave. People want a resolution.Reacting to the discovery of mass graves in Mannar, the international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch says, Sri Lankan authorities should ensure that the Office of Missing Persons is able to operate properly, and should set up an impartial transitional justice process that was pledged at the Human Rights Council.The last time mass graves were alleged in Mannar was in late 2013, near the famed Thiruketheeswaram Shiva temple, and later in 2016, in a well not far from this temple. The investigation into the 2013 sighting by the residents of the area is yet to be completed, with some officials reportedly declaring the grave to be a part of a cemetery. For locals, though, questions linger. In the 2016 case, investigators told the magistrate court that there were no human remains.The inquiry into the Matale mass grave found in 2012 in the islands Central Province has also stalled, despite the left-wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramunas (JVP) demands for a full investigation of the site where, some believe, its activists and sympathisers could have been interred during the state repression of the JVP in 1971 and again in 1987-89. Yet another mass grave in Kaluwanchikudy was found in the eastern Batticaloa district in 2014, but the excavation did not see much progress.In the recently-discovered site in Mannar, the team is working largely on a voluntary basis. Says Rajapaksa, who has led teams at two other mass graves in the past, There are no standard operating procedures in place in Sri Lanka to deal with mass graves.He says, We havent finished excavating yet. We will continue until we get to what we call a bone-free margin, to rule out any more bones, suggesting that the number of skeletons could increase further. Giving no room for speculation on who the dead may be and when they were killed, he adds, We cannot resort to any pre-judgment without evidence. These are bodies that have been heaped up. And no one knows who did this. No one, except those who did it. We have to find out. His observation echoes those of many mothers who desire to unearth the truth buried with the bodies. Until then, they will remain bare bones, carefully wrapped and safely stored, bearing only a number.If you havent seen your childs body, how do you begin to believe that he is dead?Jena Jayakanthi,Activist, Mannar",ONION
36249,An itinerary for your trip to Bali,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/travel/bali-the-island-of-god/cid/1682194,2019-01-19,"Thats the thing about Bali. It has something for everyone. Its good for a bachelors group, a honeymoon, a solo trip, or a vacay with the family. (Shutterstock)If there is one place on earth that has taught me to love, find myself, grow stronger and, of course, have a ball, it is Bali. My first brush with this Indonesian island was in 2010, when in the movie Eat Pray Love I watched a certain Elizabeth Gilbert played by Julia Roberts rediscover herself and find love there. Watching that movie, I, in turn, fell in love with this corner of the world.My first visit to Bali was in September 2014 and it has been followed up by two subsequent trips  a solo vacation in February 2018 and a work trip in September the same year.Over my three visits, I have discovered different sides of the island. The first one was all about exploring the place with my partner. The second time I landed up in Bali alone to look for peace and happiness. On the third trip, which was organised by VITO India, I went back to Bali happy and confident on a travel assignment. And all the trips were equally satisfying.Thats the thing about Bali. It has something for everyone. Its good for a bachelors group, a honeymoon, a solo trip, or a vacay with the family. Whatever be your situation, the diversity and beauty of Bali is bound to mesmerise you.Having travelled to Bali on my birthday in February, it seemed like deja vu when I boarded Thai Airways again in end-September and landed at Ngurah Rai International Airport, the only one on the island.This time, my agenda was to explore a side of Bali that I hadnt seen before and to do as many things as possible in the two days that I had. Heres a list of things you can do to make the most of a short trip to the Island of the Gods.Bali's golden hour when the sky turned into a canvas of red, golden, orange and pink (Pramita Ghosh)SAVOUR THE SUNSETMy fave part of the day was the golden hour when the sky turned into a canvas of red, golden, orange and pink as the sun seemed to go down into the water. And Beraban village of Tanah Lot is one of the best places to do that. Theres a Hindu temple on a rock formation on the shore here that makes the view quite spectacular. Get there by 5pm and you can even walk to the base of the temple if you feel up to it.A white coral from the beaches in Kuta (Pramita Ghosh)BUM ON THE BEACHTake a stroll on some of the beaches in Kuta and go coral and shell hunting for your aquarium. The one in the picture here is a white coral. Being a water baby, I simply sat by the beach, meditated and listened to the waves breaking on the shore. The whole experience was so therapeutic and calming! It was one of the best parts of a much-needed getaway from a busy, loud and noisy city.The grilled corn cob (in picture) is a popular street snack (Pramita Ghosh)SNACK STREET-STYLEThe grilled corn cob is a popular street snack, especially around tourist spots. You get it in butter, sweet, spicy and salty flavours. We loved the buttery and spicy ones, which are refreshingly different from those we have in Calcutta. If you find the spicy one too hot, soothe your palate with the local coconut ice cream that is served with coconut pulp, or malai, inside a coconut shell. Topping options include jam, sprinkles and Oreo cookies.Bitang beer, which is one of the cheapest tipples you can find. Pick it up at supermarkets for about IDR 15,000 (about Rs 74) (Pramita Ghosh)CHUG ITYou cant visit Bali and not swig Bitang beer, which is one of the cheapest tipples you can find. Pick it up at supermarkets for about IDR 15,000 (about Rs 74) or in an upscale pub for double that. The taste is almost similar to American pale lager and makes for a lovely sip on a hot day! Bitang is also by far one of the most popular T-shirt prints and youll find lots of tourists wearing their love for it on their chest.The mind-blowing Ulundanu Temple on the edge of the Bratan Lake in Bedugul is temple that you must visit (Pramita Ghosh)SAY YOUR PRAYERSContrary to the popular idea of Bali being a sea-sun-sand destination, there are numerous temples that merit a visit. The mind-blowing Ulundanu Temple on the edge of the Bratan Lake in Bedugul is one of them. Its a long drive from Kuta and I had dozed off on the way. So, it took me a while to wake up to the fact that I was in Bali. Once out of the car, the nippy air and gusts of wind gave me goosebumps. All that my eyes could see was a beautiful temple enveloped in mist with mountains peeking from the background.The temple in Candi Kuning village almost around 80km north of Denpasar, Ulundanu, is believed to have been built in the 17th century and dedicated to the Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva triumvirate as well as Devi Danu. There are plenty of spots around where you can go into click mode. One can also take a boat out onto the waters, but sudden rain ruled that out for me. Carry a shawl and an umbrella.If beach clubs are what you are after, you will be spoilt for choice at Seminyak, which has famous Ku De Ta, Potato Head and the beautiful La Plancha that is a very popular with Instagrammers, thanks to its colourful tents on the beach. (Pramita Ghosh)GO PARTYIf you are a party animal, then Bali wont disappoint you. Kuta, Legian and Seminyak are the liveliest areas with the whole gamut of party places from easy-on-the-pocket watering holes to swank nightclubs like Sky Garden. If you want to enjoy all of it in one night, head for Legian which has everything from karaoke bars and beer clubs to night markets. And you cannot miss the girls on stilts (right) who welcome tourists to the bars and pubs there. If beach clubs are what you are after, you will be spoilt for choice at Seminyak, which has famous Ku De Ta, Potato Head and the beautiful La Plancha that is a very popular with Instagrammers, thanks to its colourful tents on the beach. Its a perfect sunset spot too. Want to be happening? Head straight to Rock Bar in Badung where even a certain Alia Bhatt was spotted chilling with her friends.The bustling tourist areas like Legian are dotted with affordable shopping options selling the de rigeur cane and straw handbags (Pramita Ghosh)SHOP TILL YOU DROPThe Indonesian rupiah is one of the currencies against which the Indian rupee has a favourable exchange rate (Re 1 is about 200 IDR). Its just the thing you need to go on a buying binge. And when youre on a travel assignment, you cannot but shop for your family and friends. The bustling tourist areas like Legian are dotted with affordable shopping options selling the de rigeur cane and straw handbags. For something more exclusive, stroll into boutiques in Seminyak which are loaded with very swish outfits that are more pricey, but well worth the money.Indulge in nasi ayam (chicken and rice) and, particularly, nasi campur (Pramita Ghosh)EAT LOCALIndulge in nasi ayam (chicken and rice) and, particularly, nasi campur. The second has rice, satay, betutu (chicken or duck stuffed with spices), prawn wafers, and mixed veggies served with spicy sambal matah. A salad of chopped raw onion and chillies and boiled eggs are often part of this dish. Its an entire meal in itself and considered Balis substitute for nasi goreng. A self-confessed bheto Bangali, I feasted on this rice delicacy almost every day!Take a leap of faith and go parasailing or opt for kayaking in the crystal clear sea for very reasonable rates (Pramita Ghosh)HIT THE WATERYou cannot be on a beach vacay and not indulge in watersport. Although Kuta offers a lot of options, you can drive down to the Pandawa beach, a new tourist spot located in the Kutuh district of south Kuta. Hidden between high cliffs and trees, this secret beach is named after the five Pandavas, so you will spot huge statues of Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadewa when you enter the beach area. Take a leap of faith and go parasailing or opt for kayaking in the crystal clear sea for very reasonable rates.Getting on a swing hanging from the tops of palm trees with lo-o-ong ropes (Pramita Ghosh)SUSPEND FEARIf youve been fascinated with Instagram videos of people swinging high up in the sky with a sea of greenery below them, then its time to strike the Bali Swing off your bucket list. Getting on a swing hanging from the tops of palm trees with lo-o-ong ropes is one of the most touristy things you can do. Or snap yourself and your bae in a nest swing for that perfect IG post! Prices for a go on the swing vary from place to place, but IDR 100,000 (about Rs 500) will get you almost unlimited number of swings.Where to stay?Bali Dynasty Resort (Pramita Ghosh)Bali Dynasty ResortWhere: On the beach in Jalan Kartika, South KutaHow to reach: Its a 10-minute drive from Ngurah Rai International AirportFacilities: It has six restaurants, five bars, three swimming pools, the Ashoka Spa, a gym, a beach club and Gracie Kellys Irish Pub.

Creation of an exclusive budget will lead to more allocation of funds for agriculture, make crop insurance payouts, fixing of minimum support prices and loan waivers easier. With agriculture just a part of the general budget, the allocation it receives is minimal compared to industries, defence, railways and other sectors, association president S Palanisamy said.Fixing a minimum support price for staple crops like tomato and small onion, spices like turmeric and pepper, and grains was critical for farmers survival, the petition said. Only if you have an exclusive budget will you calculate the cost of calculation of a specific crop. During crop damage, you have to take that cost, add a little more money and pay it out to the farmer. Or at least the cost of cultivation has to be given to the farmer, district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivaisaigal Sangam P Kandasamy said. Minimum support price is critical to support farmers when onion prices crash, like it did last year. Also, once fund is allocated for it, the government will find it easier to distribute it.Agriculture is also an industry, which also requires support, the petition said. The number of farmers in the country is steadily decreasing and more families are moving to urban areas. Unless you recognize agriculture as an industry, giving it the loans, loan waivers and support prices required, more and more farmers will keep quitting and one day, we will have a food shortage, Palanisamy added.",ONION

However, significant inter-state differences persist with the highest consumer inflation in Kerala at 6% and the lowest in Odisha at 2.2%, the CRISIL report said.Apart from Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the inflation was below 4.5% in all other states in the country.Commenting on the study, Krishnakumar K K, senior fellow, Centre for Socio-economic and Environmental Studies (CSES), said that it was the agrarian crisis that had brought down inflation and even caused deflation in the rest of the country. The deflation in the agriculture sector has pulled the inflation rate down right from north Indian states till up to Tamil Nadu. If you review the last five years, you could see that it was farmers who had suffered the most as prices of their products experienced severe fluctuations while heading to a crash, he said.At the height of the crisis, the farmers in Maharashtra were forced to sell onion for as cheap as 25 paisa per kg a couple of months ago. They were happy even when they had to sell the produce for Rs 2-3 per kg, Krishnakumar said.On the other hand, prices rarely experienced a significant decline in Kerala which is a consumer state. Onion prices rarely went below Rs 20 per kg in Kerala. In addition, the increase in transportation costs and the profit-making middlemen hindered the drop in inflation rates, he noted. Even though Kerala had recorded the highest rate, the 6% rate is quite normal, he added.",ONION

This is for the first time that such a shift has been witnessed, he added.Crop production is up 1.5% year on year and about 8% higher than the previous five years average. Singh said horticulture production contributes 29% of the countrys GDP. This despite horticulture occupying only 14% of the total area under agriculture at 140 million hectares. Potato, tomato, onion, brinjal, mango and banana are other major horticulture crops the country is producing, he added.A senior researcher from ICAR said with increasing production, India is set to expand its footprint in horticulture crop exports on the global trade map. Potato, onion, mango and banana are in high demand in other countries. For the first time, we recently exported bananas from Tamil Nadu, he added.Researchers attribute the rise in production to higher returns farmers are getting per unit area of cultivation. While paddy gives a maximum yield of only 30 quintals per hectare for a cultivator, the same for banana is 400q/ha and grape is 100q/ ha. Consumption of horticulture crops which are rich in vitamins and nutrients, has also gone up. Farmers are investing in flowers used for decorative purposes as well, he added.",ONION

High production depresses prices and farmers are left in the lurch.Production of high-focus TOP (tomato, onion and potato) is estimated to be higher than the output of these crops in 2017-18 with potato at 52.58 MT recording 6% growth, followed by tomato (2% higher) and onion (1.5% higher).Records show that horticulture production has been consistently rising since 2012-13. Production is up. Producer is down. Thats the story of Indian agriculture, tweeted Yogendra Yadav , national president of Swaraj India who has been raising farm related issues.The remarks summed up what other observers too feel about growing production of not only horticultural produce but also of foodgrains. Record production of horticulture crops is the result of favourable weather and expectations of higher income based on past experience. But record production is not translating into higher returns, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said.Panwar, a farm expert and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, cited two major reasons for it. First, the central governments policy of containing inflation in food items and second, over-dominance of middlemen in supply chain of fruits and vegetables, specifically corporates, in some segments, he told TOI.Initial efforts of government such as price stabilisation funds and boost of food processing industry could not be rolled out because of budgetary constraints and lack of focused approach, he added.Actual production figures of horticultural crops in 2017-18 show that fruits recorded slightly higher growth than vegetables. Production of fruits in 2017-18 was estimated at 97.35 MT which was 4.8% higher than the previous year. Vegetables output at 187.5 MT in 2017-18, on the other hand, was 3.5% higher than 2016-17.",ONION

But, with three years of research at a private college here, students of first and second year Hotel Management and Travel and Tourism departments have come up with more than 100 varieties of halwa pizza.Have you heard of halwas like paan, maize, butterscotch, crunchy caramel, rum ball, coffee? These were among the jaw-dropping ones for world-renowned food critics and chefs who were there to taste them at an event in the college on Wednesday. Then, there were halwas catering to exotic tastes and mouth-watering ones for kids, prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables. And what about non-vegetarian halwas? Gotta be kidding! Well, well, they are those made of egg, theres also Shahi Mutton Halwa, and Chicken Halwa, to name a few.It is very difficult to convert mutton into a sweet dish, and cook it without onion and garlic. It took me almost six hours to prepare it, as it is a slow cooking procedure, said Hritik Rawar, student of first year hotel management at the college. Dev Kartik, another first year student, said: Egg bhurji and egg toast are passe in breakfast. When it comes to sweets, one can have egg halwa with mix fruit. Consuming a lot of time, rajma halwa was prepared by Aditi, another first year student. She said: Instead of sugar, I have used stevia leaves and rajma. This halwa is rich in protein content, but it took me almost three hours to cook.Halwas of fruits like mango, pomegranate, dragon fruit, coconut, papaya, cheeku, guava, apple, caramel, banana, plum, raw mango, blueberry, strawberry, and water chest were made by students with the puree of fresh fruits. Same goes for vegetables like potatoes topped with sweet French fries, spinach, cauliflower, and raddish. Bitter gourd  a vegetable that has less demand in the market  was also used to make halwa.Halwas for kidsKeeping nutritional values alive and the varying mood of kids in mind, students have also made halwas for children from cherry, gems, toffee pudding, and custard vanilla halwa.Payal Bassi, a first year student, used multi-vitamin bread, jam, nuts, and desi ghee to make halwa. She said: I have used this because my nephew loves jam, but he gets bored of carrying bread and jam to school on a regular basis. Thus, I chose this ingredient so that they can remain healthy by eating this halwa.Anirban Gupta, dean, Hotel Management and Aviation & Tourism at the college, said: In todays generation, everyone is after fast food. It is especially difficult for parents to feed them nutritious food like spinach, gooseberry, broccoli, woodapple (bel), bitter gourd, and pumpkin. We have made them in the form of halwa with a pizza base.Exotic halwasOther exotic halwas include dry fruits like pista, almonds, rawa kesari, mix fruit, khuskhus, walnut, khajoor, sesame, kaju, and kiwi, which were inspired by the Mughal period, as these ingredients are known for valour and strength.For health-conscious people, there were halwas made of oats and cornflakes, and mix root halwa (made of red and black carrot, and beetroot). Sweets with high sugar like chamcham, mix barfi, gulab jamun, milk cake, rabri, panjiri, balushahi, white rasgulla, and cottage cheese were also used with a donut base, so that they can relish both the sweet and the halwa.To make it to the international market, students have come up with innovative ideas like use of orange brownie, cookies, red velvet, cheese cake, tiramisu, Kit Kat, Oreo, fudge cake, and chocolate. Simran, a second year student, said: I have a bakery, but I am unable to serve an Indian sweet dish like halwa to people. So, to make it to the international market, I have tried an orange brownie.Students have also attempted acid-based ingredients like pineapple for making halwa. As milk gets curdled due to high acid content, they found processing could be done by tossing it into a sugar cane syrup or stevia leaves. The same process goes for lemon and orange.With their hard work to push a typical Indian dish into the international market, students have planned to sell it in the open market. They said hotel chefs could also approach them for recipes. Interestingly, these halwas will be served in the campus at reasonable prices through canning.WAH! KYA HALWA!* Some of the varieties included Exotic Halwa, Rasgulla Halwaizza, Cornflax Halwaizza, Pan Gulkand Halwaizza, Tiramisu Halwaizza, Mughal Gosht Halwaizza, Orange Brownie Halwaizza, Sarso Ka Saag Halwaizza, Murg Halwaizza, and Karachi Halwaizza.* The guests at the event were Kavita Bahuguna, famous food and hotel reviewer-writer, chef Sudhanshu, general manager from Maharaja Grand, celebrity chef Neelu Kaura, chef Shibiraj Saha, executive chef from Park Plaza, and chef Paramjeet Singh, executive chef from Keys Hotel.* The students showcased a lot of creative and innovative ideas for the event, where Hritik Rawat from BHMCT first year bagged the First Prize for Gosht Halwaizza, followed by Aditi from BTTM first year who bagged the second prize for Rajma Halwaizza, and the third prize was bagged by Gurkaran from BHMCT second year for Pan Gulkand Halwaizza.",ONION

According to officials, large-scale paddy harvest will commence in the district from February 15.Senior paddy marketing officer A.V. Suresh Kumar told The Hindu that 20,140 farmers in the district have so far registered online with the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) for selling their produce. We have extended the deadline for online registration to January 10. The process of sowing is still going on in a few fields and we are expecting 18,000 more farmers to register with us in the coming days, he said.Mr. Kumar, however, warned that the shortage of harvesters would hamper the harvest in the district.Flood-hit fieldsThis year, the paddy farmers, especially in Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, have shown resilience in preparing the flood-hit fields for the puncha season.According to the Agriculture Department, the farmers have undertaken paddy farming in more than 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres approximate), up from 23,000 hectares last year, a major portion of which is in Kuttanad.1 lakh tonnesSupplyco had procured more than 1 lakh tonnes of paddy from the district in the previous puncha crop season. Officials said that after the entire second crop (additional crop) was destroyed in the June-July floods, they were expecting a bumper crop this season. However, pest attacks have been reported in a few places and farmers fear the production may take a hit.Procurement priceThe procurement price offered this season is Rs. 25.30 a kg. This includes the minimum support price of Rs. 17.50 and the State incentive bonus of Rs. 7.80.We have reached an agreement with nine banks for hassle-free distribution of price to farmers. The farmers will be provided the procurement price from different banks on production of the paddy receipt sheet (PRS) issued by the millers who procured the paddy. They will get the amount within 3-5 days of harvest, Mr. Kumar added.",RICE

The state government has decided to introduce subsidy on paddy transplanters to make farmers opt for machines over labour.Farmers face the problem of labour shortage every year during transplantation of paddy. Now, it has decided to provide 50% subsidy on transplanters to small, marginal, scheduled caste (SC) and woman farmers. Other farmers will be extended a 40% subsidy on these machines.There are two types of tranplanters: one is operated by two persons and covers 4-6 acres in a day and the second one is a self-propelled machine which covers 10-12 acres per day. These machines ensure uniform transplantation of paddy, as per recommendations of Punjab Agriculture University.The smaller machine, which covers 4-6 rows of the crop, is priced at Rs 3 lakh, while the self-propelled machine costs nearly Rs 10 lakh. The larger, self-propelled rice transplanter, which takes care of about eight rows of the crop in one go, costs nearly Rs 16 lakh. As the machines are costly, the state government will encourage primary cooperative societies of villages to purchase these.The state agriculture department has sought applications from farmers interested in getting subsidized paddy transplanters till January 20, and farmers will have send their applications to block agriculture development officer or district agriculture officer.Paddy is expected to be transplanted in 65 lakh acres in Punjab. Experts say if machines are used for transplantation, production would increase from 25 plants in a square metre to 32 plants in the same area.Punjab agriculture department secretary Kahan Singh Pannu told TOI that the state government has directed that transplantation of paddy should start on or after June 20. The subsidy scheme will be funded by the Centre and the state government, in the ratio of 60:40. We expect to sell nearly 1,000 machines in the first year on subsidy, he said.Punjab has been facing an acute shortage of farm labour for the past few years due to a constant decline in manpower from other parts of the country. Because of this, said Pannu, farmers farmers wanted to use machines for transplanting the paddy crop.Farmer organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri, however, said the machines were costly and the results of these machines were not of much benefit to farmers. Just look at what happened to wheat sown using Happy Seeder, he said.A farmer of Sangat village in Bathinda , Dalbir Singh, said cultivators were not familiar with transplantation machines. Few would go in for them, he said.",RICE

Praseed Kumar from Sulthan Bathery is scripting a different story  one of hard work, perseverance and fine imagination.The 45-year-old farmers journey to success began after he got a handful of paddy seeds from a friend in Gujarat.Krishna Kamod, the Basmati rice variety for which he got the seeds, is known for its taste, colour and aroma. Enticed by its violet chaff, he first cultivated it on just a cent of land.Gradually, in a period of seven years, he expanded the cultivation to one hectare and last year, Mr. Kumar harvested about 2,500 kg of the rice.And instead of selling the rice in the open market, he sold the seeds to farmers at Rs. 200 a kg.He had spent Rs. 85,000 for the cultivation last year and got returns to the tune of Rs. 5 lakh.Buoyed by the success, Mr. Kumar tried his luck this season with Black Jasmine rice, a medicinal rice variety from Assam that is violet in colour.100 kg of seedsHe spent Rs. 25,000 on cultivating it on 50 cents of land and harvested 400 kg of the rice. I have sold 100 kg of the rice seeds to farmers at Rs. 400 a kg and some traders, who have been selling premium varieties of rice online, have offered to procure the remaining quantity of rice at Rs. 500 a kg, Mr. Kumar added.Mr. Kumar acknowledged the timely assistance provided by T. Girija, project director, Agricultural Technology Management Agency, Wayanad, for the cultivation.He had also received an incentive of Rs. 20,000 from the Agriculture Department.As there is a huge demand for the seeds of rare rice varieties among the farming community in the country and pesticide-free rice from the elite class of society, I am trying to tap the huge potential, Mr. Kumar said. The Black Jasmine variety has huge demand from supermarkets in the country as well as abroad, he said.Mr. Kumar has also launched a website to market the seeds.This rice variety [Black Jasmine] seems quite suitable for the district, though its market is yet to be tapped properly in the State, Sebastian Joseph, Assistant Director, Agriculture Department, Wayanad, said.However, many farmers had come forward to cultivate the crop as it fetched a better price in the market, he added.Mr. Kumars farm had been selected as a demonstration plot last season to promote the rice variety.The farmer has also dabbled in the cultivation of a spectra of rice varieties.There is huge demand for seeds of such varieties, particularly for pesticide-free ricePraseed Kumar",RICE

As the grains will be stocked at rice mills, the mill owners should provide bank guarantee  by paying a certain amount to the bank depending upon their purchasing capacity  as the security. According to a mill owner at Srirangapatna, it will be a huge sum and thus mill owners are not ready to procure paddy. 9,000 farmers have already registered to sell about 3.5 lakh tonnes of paddy under the scheme, Kumuda Sharath, Deputy Director, Department of Food and Civil Supplies, told The Hindu here on Sunday.Even the rice mill owners should register to procure the grains. They will be paid hulling, handling and other charges. Nevertheless, of the registered 250 rice mill owners, so far only six have registered, she said.Meetings have been held with the mill owners. If the mill owners fail to provide the bank guarantee, they can hypothecate their property with the banks, officials at the Karnataka State Warehousing Corporation said.The last date to procure grains is be February 28, 2019.

At times, the bags delivered to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 2017-18 with printed Punjab lot number  were also found.Sources said the practice of recycling public distribution system (PDS) rice has been on for last few years in Punjab and Haryana. The illegal supply was detected last year between September and November. A probe showed that 1.90 lakh bags of paddy (37.5 kg per bag) and one lakh bags of rice (50 kg per bag) were seized by the Punjab food supplies department in 41 raids. The department got seven cases registered with the police.The modus operandi is simple. Under the National Food Security Act, 2013, the FCI procures paddy from Punjab and Haryana and in some cases after milling, distributes the rice to other states. This rice is meant for sale through the PDS system. Bags of rice or paddy come back in trucks (540 bags of rice and 400 bags of paddy per truck) and are bought by rice millers here at Rs 2,200 per quintal and sold back to the procurement agencies for Rs 2,900 per quintal, thus leading to a profit of Rs 700 per quintal. In UP and Bihar, the price is Rs 1,000 per quintal. Fake bills are produced as the MSP here is Rs 1,750 per quintal.Once this paddy or rice reaches rice millers they get fake bills and show it as purchased from the mandis. The paperwork is thus complete though no actual purchase is made. As rice does not attract any GST and no permission is needed for interstate transfer, traders make fake bills and the product is transferred. In most cases, when caught, traders presented these bills as they are difficult to verify, he said.Sources said the state government has instructed rice millers to show paddy and rice found in their mills as their own purchase and whenever they sell these commodities they need to record it with the district manager of the procurement agency concerned. It will ensure that they will not be able to pass off these stocks to FCI.Sources said that these bags of rice and paddy were coming from Muzaffarpur, Muradabad, Gaya, Sitapur and Gulabgarh in Bihar and Bulandshahr, Bareilly and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh.Director Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Punjab, Anindita Mitra, said, In the coming season, we will intensify efforts to detect and eliminate bogus purchases and billing through the use of technology and required amendments in the policy framework. We have already brought this matter to the notice of FCI.Sources said in last six years, the procurement of paddy was increasing every year despite the fact that the yield and area of production remained constant. In 2017, it was 179 lakh metric tonnes and in 2016, 165 lakh MT and in 2018 it was expected to cross 200 lakh metric tonnes in Punjab but it is now 169 lakh MT after the crackdown.",RICE

The retail prices of per kg tur have increased by Rs 10 in the last couple of days.Per kg prices of moong dal in the wholesale market have also increased by Rs 4 in the last 20 days. The impact on retail prices has been more, said sources. Wholesalers said tur was likely to get pricier in the coming days, with an increase of Rs 8-10 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 10-15 per kg in the retail market.Dhaval Shah, director of Jairaj Group in Market Yard, told TOI that prices of all pulses, except tur and moong, were stable in the wholesale market.Tur dal has recorded the highest spike in prices in the last 20 days, as arrival of the new crop has dipped by 30% in comparison to the same period last year. Moong dal prices have gone up by Rs 4 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 5 in the retail market during this period. The rise in the tur prices has been to the tune of Rs 6-7 per kg. It may rise by another Rs 8-10 per kg in the wholesale market during the next one month. The rise in retail price may be around Rs 10-15 per kg during the next one month, Shah said.Tur dal production in the state has been hit the most because of shortage at the farm level, as the state has the highest acreage under this lentil, he added.Khushal Unecha, owner of Ganpat super market in Gokahlenagar, said, The retail prices of tur dal went up by Rs 10 on Friday. The tur crop has dipped considerably this time, as not only sowing was delayed but rain was also deficient in 2018. With the sudden surge in price, customers may get panicky and cut down on buying tur.In the last 15 days, he said, tur prices in the wholesale market have gone up by 10% as the government had last year also hiked the minimum support price (MSP) of moong, tur, urad, masoor and chana or gram.The MSP of tur was hiked from Rs 5,450 per quintal to Rs 5,675 per quintal. The government has also stopped the import of pulses since a year, which is creating further shortage at a time when around 50% of the tur crop has failed, he said.An Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) official said tur prices in the Pune APMC market have gone up by Rs 6-7 in the last seven days, while that of moong by Rs 2-3 in the last four to five days.Vijay Rathod of Mulchand and Sons, a wholesale firm in Market Yard, said tur prices in the wholesale market have shot up by Rs 500 per quintal since Monday. The new tur crop arrivals are 40% less than what they were during the same period last year, he said.Nitin Nahar, a wholesaler and director of the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra , said pulse prices in the wholesale market were expected to rise further during the next one month.In 2017, over-production of tur in Maharashtra had led to a grave situation for farmers, compounded by what they considered a faulty government procurement system. Consequently, numerous farmers in the pulse growing belt of Marathwada and Vidarbha had planned to cut down on tur sowing.The production of tur during the few years preceding 2017 was quite low. This led to an increase in the prices of the commodity. But the good rainfall in 2016 and government initiatives to increase production of pulses led to a glut in tur production. Both the areas and productivity of tur increased significantly, causing a crash in its prices. In 2018, a drought-like condition caused an opposite situation with a shortage of the pulse.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

But, with three years of research at a private college here, students of first and second year Hotel Management and Travel and Tourism departments have come up with more than 100 varieties of halwa pizza.Have you heard of halwas like paan, maize, butterscotch, crunchy caramel, rum ball, coffee? These were among the jaw-dropping ones for world-renowned food critics and chefs who were there to taste them at an event in the college on Wednesday. Then, there were halwas catering to exotic tastes and mouth-watering ones for kids, prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables. And what about non-vegetarian halwas? Gotta be kidding! Well, well, they are those made of egg, theres also Shahi Mutton Halwa, and Chicken Halwa, to name a few.It is very difficult to convert mutton into a sweet dish, and cook it without onion and garlic. It took me almost six hours to prepare it, as it is a slow cooking procedure, said Hritik Rawar, student of first year hotel management at the college. Dev Kartik, another first year student, said: Egg bhurji and egg toast are passe in breakfast. When it comes to sweets, one can have egg halwa with mix fruit. Consuming a lot of time, rajma halwa was prepared by Aditi, another first year student. She said: Instead of sugar, I have used stevia leaves and rajma. This halwa is rich in protein content, but it took me almost three hours to cook.Halwas of fruits like mango, pomegranate, dragon fruit, coconut, papaya, cheeku, guava, apple, caramel, banana, plum, raw mango, blueberry, strawberry, and water chest were made by students with the puree of fresh fruits. Same goes for vegetables like potatoes topped with sweet French fries, spinach, cauliflower, and raddish. Bitter gourd  a vegetable that has less demand in the market  was also used to make halwa.Halwas for kidsKeeping nutritional values alive and the varying mood of kids in mind, students have also made halwas for children from cherry, gems, toffee pudding, and custard vanilla halwa.Payal Bassi, a first year student, used multi-vitamin bread, jam, nuts, and desi ghee to make halwa. She said: I have used this because my nephew loves jam, but he gets bored of carrying bread and jam to school on a regular basis. Thus, I chose this ingredient so that they can remain healthy by eating this halwa.Anirban Gupta, dean, Hotel Management and Aviation & Tourism at the college, said: In todays generation, everyone is after fast food. It is especially difficult for parents to feed them nutritious food like spinach, gooseberry, broccoli, woodapple (bel), bitter gourd, and pumpkin. We have made them in the form of halwa with a pizza base.Exotic halwasOther exotic halwas include dry fruits like pista, almonds, rawa kesari, mix fruit, khuskhus, walnut, khajoor, sesame, kaju, and kiwi, which were inspired by the Mughal period, as these ingredients are known for valour and strength.For health-conscious people, there were halwas made of oats and cornflakes, and mix root halwa (made of red and black carrot, and beetroot). Sweets with high sugar like chamcham, mix barfi, gulab jamun, milk cake, rabri, panjiri, balushahi, white rasgulla, and cottage cheese were also used with a donut base, so that they can relish both the sweet and the halwa.To make it to the international market, students have come up with innovative ideas like use of orange brownie, cookies, red velvet, cheese cake, tiramisu, Kit Kat, Oreo, fudge cake, and chocolate. Simran, a second year student, said: I have a bakery, but I am unable to serve an Indian sweet dish like halwa to people. So, to make it to the international market, I have tried an orange brownie.Students have also attempted acid-based ingredients like pineapple for making halwa. As milk gets curdled due to high acid content, they found processing could be done by tossing it into a sugar cane syrup or stevia leaves. The same process goes for lemon and orange.With their hard work to push a typical Indian dish into the international market, students have planned to sell it in the open market. They said hotel chefs could also approach them for recipes. Interestingly, these halwas will be served in the campus at reasonable prices through canning.WAH! KYA HALWA!* Some of the varieties included Exotic Halwa, Rasgulla Halwaizza, Cornflax Halwaizza, Pan Gulkand Halwaizza, Tiramisu Halwaizza, Mughal Gosht Halwaizza, Orange Brownie Halwaizza, Sarso Ka Saag Halwaizza, Murg Halwaizza, and Karachi Halwaizza.* The guests at the event were Kavita Bahuguna, famous food and hotel reviewer-writer, chef Sudhanshu, general manager from Maharaja Grand, celebrity chef Neelu Kaura, chef Shibiraj Saha, executive chef from Park Plaza, and chef Paramjeet Singh, executive chef from Keys Hotel.* The students showcased a lot of creative and innovative ideas for the event, where Hritik Rawat from BHMCT first year bagged the First Prize for Gosht Halwaizza, followed by Aditi from BTTM first year who bagged the second prize for Rajma Halwaizza, and the third prize was bagged by Gurkaran from BHMCT second year for Pan Gulkand Halwaizza.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.",TOMATO

Now that the standards (on food products) are more or less in place, our focus is going to be on compliance, monitoring, inspection and enforcement,"" Agarwal told .A Parliamentary Standing Committee on health and family welfare in a report submitted in 2018 had rapped FSSAI over weak enforcement of food safety laws and also recommended restructuring of the autonomous body that functions under the health ministry.Asserting that the big focus will be on enforcement, Agarwal said while some of the standards are made effective from January 1, the implementation time for other products has been extended by three or six months depending on the cases.The new standards effective from January 1 are for all varieties of pulses, whole and decorticated pearl millet grains, de-germed maize flour and maize grit, textured soy protein, sago flour, bee wax and royal jelly.Microbiological standards for fruits and vegetables and their products, all provisions of organic food regulations and standard for honey, except few parameters where test methods are being validated -- are made effective from Tuesday.According to FSSAI, three-month extension has been given to businesses to comply with the tolerance limit of antibiotics and pharmacology active substances.Similarly, standards for alcoholic beverages will come into force from April 1, 2019 to coincide with financial year requirements of excise laws.Food fortification norms will come into force from June 1, compliance of labelling requirement for frozen dessert would be applicable from July 1, FSSAI said.The regulations on advertising and claims, packaging and labelling requirements of blended edible vegetable oils will come into force from July 1, this year.In 2018, new standards for fruits and vegetables including canned tomato, jam, jelly and marmalade came into effect from July.

Many multi-cuisine restaurants are still working overtime to get that combination right.Ram Bhat, owner, Matsya Group, says that he is still not happy with the changes made in the packaging. For the solid stuff we have cardboard boxes but for sambar, rasa/sambar/curd vada and juices, the cup with lid I have opted for is not very apt. We are still working on a proper solution and are asking our customers to bear with us for sometime, said Mr. Bhat who has had to train his employees on plastics before they would convert to these new items.Rohit Zacharia of Mash Restore Cafe in Besant Nagar said he was trying to get alternatives that are affordable. We are using sugar cane bagasse containers. But we also need something stylish and elegant and leak proof. So far we have not passed on the packaging charges to customers, he said.For many restaurants like Hotel Kalpaka on TTK Road, its owner Diwakar believes that when parcels form around 30 percent of the orders, packing charges need not be passed on to customers.In the long run, we can adjust costs, he said. They have changed to aluminium foil containers, which are costlier than plastics.Aluminium foil that has been suggested by the State government as an alternative has caught the fancy of many restaurants. A section of outlets in Tiruch have begun using the material. According to a leading hotelier, nearly 40 % of restaurants and eateries have switched over to eco-friendly options and the rest continue using plastics. Though aluminium foil is a bit expensive, a manager of a restaurant at Central Bus Stand in Tiruchi said that they had no option but to bear the additional cost in order to comply with the ban on use-and-throw plastics.Like elsewhere, restaurants in Madurai too are finding it difficult to pack chutneys and sambar. M. Kumaresan, who runs a roadside eatery near Anna bus stand in Madurai, said that while he was using silver-coloured pouches, which are touted as alternatives, some officials warned him not to use them since they also contained plastic.Stating that he was finding his own ways to address the problem to an extent, he said, ""I used to offer both coconut and tomato chutneys in liquid form. Now, I have made them thicker so that they can be packed in banana leaves. It costs me more. But I cannot afford to lose customers,"" he added.Hotels in Coimbatore have increased charges 7 % to 10 % for take aways since the ban on throwaway plastics came into effect. The alternatives used by these outlets vary.They have gone in for banana leaves, aluminium foil pouches, biodegradable pouches, and reusable plastic containers. The packed food is delivered in brown paper bags instead of polythene carry bags and customers have to pay for it in most hotels. Savoury are packed in brown covers, butter paper covers, or plastic containers.We have consulted the Pollution Control Board officials on the alternatives that we can use. However, continuous availability of many of these products might be a problem. It will take 10 or 15 days for the hotels to finalise on the sustainable options, says Jegan S.

Beginning Sunday, the next three weekends will see three grand events on the sprawling grounds: Bhim Mahasangam, a meeting of the citys scheduled caste communities on January 6; a two-day convention of national leaders, elected representatives and state office bearers on January 11 and 12; and Yuva Vijay Sankalp rally on January 20, when party leaders will address the youth.Senior party leaders claimed Bhim Mahasangam will be a unique event in which chef Vishnu Manohar will break his own record by preparing 5,000 kg of khichdi in a single vessel. Manohar had entered the Guinness Book of Records with a 3,000-kg khichdi event in Nagpur in October 2018. The oversized vessel Manohar used at the Nagpur event has been retrofitted for a bigger quantity of food and transported to Delhi. Gas stoves will be installed on a 15ftx15ft platform constructed close to the dais.We have collected over 10,000 kg of rice and lentils from about three lakh SC families in the past few days for the dish, disclosed Ashok Goel, media convenor, Delhi BJP . The rest of the ingredients  tomatoes, garlic, onion, salt, etc  have been arranged by the party. We will set up distribution points on the ground and a team of 1,000 people will serve the dish to people attending the meet.The party is expecting over 25,000 people at the event. The idea is to bring all sub-castes of the SC community under one roof and deliver the message of unity in diversity. The party leaders will elaborate on the work the Modi government has done for the community, said the head of media and IT cell.The bigger challenge for the party workers, however, is the organisation of the national convention on January 11 and 12, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and top leaders from different states. More than 12,000 delegates are expected to attend.Apart from the main event area from where the top leaders will address the delegates, we are also setting up separate lounges for the Prime Minister, national president and the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states, said a party leader. There will be two separate halls where the members of the national executive and other delegates will be served food. Arrangements are also being made for the PM, Union ministers and CMs to discharge urgent administrative work from the ground itself.BJP has formed 24 teams to look after the travelling arrangements, local transport and accommodation for the delegates and manage the logistics, work stations and internet connectivity, sound and LED screens and well as the internal and external beautification of the venue.

The trio have come up with a solution today.The vegetables are rotting quickly because of the water content in them. Hence, we decided to remove the water content and powder them, so that they could be used for days together, Silambarasan said. He explained that instead of drying the vegetables in sunlight, they were dipped in liquid nitrogen the temperature of which is -321degree Fahrenheit to remove the water content. The process will take only a few seconds.Whenever farmers could not sell their produce, they could always powder and store them, so that they wont incur loss, he said. The innovation was on display at the two-day Science and Technology Festival that got under way at the Codissia Trade Fair Complex here on Sunday as part of the ongoing Coimbatore Vizha celebrations.Another innovation that was on display was an alternative to plastic cups. And there wouldnt have been a better time to showcase the alternative, with the plastic ban is on in the state. The specialty is that these cups are edible. A Abinaya, Class VIII student of panchayat union middle school at Bagya Nagar in Ooty, along with her teacher L Sundaram, has come up with the cups that are made of wheat and corn flour.Moulding the flour mixture in the form of cup, it is heated for about 10 minutes in a chamber with IR lamp and reflectors. The cup could be used to drink any liquid immediately. We could either eat the cup or throw it for stray animals to consume, Abinaya said.A total of 100 schools and 37 colleges in and around the district participated in the expo on Sunday. R Vishnu Prabhakar, chairperson of the Vizha, said they had scrutinized the projects for one month and selected only the ones that are functional. They had received more than 250 entries.The theme of the Vizha is impact and inspire and the science expo was organized for the first time in the city to inspire the citizens. With numerous projects such as drone race and virtual reality, a separate zone was created to offer the children the experience of basic science and inspire them, he said.The Vizha also featured a parade on Sunday, showcasing the citys unity in diversity. More than 16,000 participants from 16 community associations and six school bands took part in the event.We may have different cultures, but we want to show that we are yet united. It not only shows how secular the country is, but also sort out the communal differences among the people, said Preeti Shah, one of the participants.",TOMATO

NASA plans to fly directly to the planet with a target landing date of 2030.In the study, published in the journal Life , the researchers performed three experiments  the first two experiments determined the effect of restricted rooting and nutrient solution volumes, and based on this a third experiment was performed to assess plant responses to various nitrate nutrient solution concentrations.We found that plants can, in a way, smell the amount of nutrients available to them. When the nitrogen concentration is very low, the plant will absorb more water and thus more nitrogen until it reaches an optimal level, said Silje Wolff, a plant physiologist at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Space (CIRiS), which is part of NTNU Social Research.The plant has a mechanism that turns on when the nitrogen level is adequate. Then it adjusts both nitrogen and water absorption down, Ms. Wolff added.The researchers said that everything that can be tested on Earth has now been carried out.Effect of gravityThe next step is to grow beans in space to observe the effect of no gravity on plants ability to transport water and absorb nutrients. Simulating the absence of gravity cannot be done on Earth.The beans would be placed in a centrifuge to sprout and grow in the space station. The centrifuge would be rotated to create different amounts of gravity.The art of getting something to grow in space can be transferred to our planet, Ms. Wolff said.This is how we create a setup that produces both the microgravity conditions in the space station and the 1-g (gravity) force that exists on Earth.That will allow her to compare how the different gravitational levels affect the plants in space.The dream of every astronaut is to be able to eat fresh food  like strawberries, cherry tomatoes or anything thats really flavorful. Someday that will certainly be possible. We envision a greenhouse with several varieties of vegetables, Ms. Wolff said.",TOMATO

One, a chef, cleaned fresh red snapper filets with a sharp knife. The other, a filmmaker, pointed her camera into a large pot of simmering vegetables.What would you say this is, low heat or medium? Tuleka Prah asked, setting the camera aside.Low heat, said 38-year-old Touty Sarr, who runs the kitchen of a popular cafe in Dakar. She turned to her daughter, who was watching her cook. This one, if you put it on high, it would all get dry. Thats one of the secrets.Senegal was Ms. Prahs fifth destination since her project began in 2012. She hopes to show the care and skill that goes into African dishes, such as South Africas fried dough amagwinya and Kenyas kachumbari, an onion and tomato salad.The idea, at its most basic, is to present the food how people who love it would love it, Ms. Prah said. Its like a database or a digital vault where people can open the drawer, see recipes, see some ingredients.Born in England to a Ghanaian father and a South African mother, she lived in six African countries during her childhood, including Namibia, Kenya and what is now South Sudan. After finding no reliable recipes online for Ghanaian dishes and no photos that made the beloved food look appetising she started My African Food Map.Cuisines of a continentShe celebrates the cuisines of a continent often marred by negative stereotypes.Africa is often associated with poverty, with hunger, with failures of food in a political and nutritional sense, said James C. McCann, chair of the history department at Boston University and a specialist in African environmental history and cuisine. Its an area of the world that has not been covered by the food craze.Other culinary historians, chefs, and foodies are fighting such stereotypes. Some, like author and professor Jessica Harris, have studied African and diaspora cuisine, exploring the roots of foods taken far from home by slavery. Others, like Fran Osseo-Asare and her Ghanaian-focused project Betumi, investigate the foods of a single country.The internet was the democratisation of African food writing, said Osseo-Asare, who said she has blogged about African food since the 1980s. When the internet came, you didnt have publishers as gatekeepers that could stop you from getting your work out.Unique among prominent bloggers, Ms. Prah takes an almost pan-African approach.I always feel like I am from the whole continent, she said. I can find myself in different aspects of different countries I visit.The best outcome is when people say, That is our food, that is our dish, she said, remembering her work in Kenya. I was extremely happy when the first comments I got on YouTube were, Oh, this reminds me of home.To find authentic recipes and skilled chefs, Ms. Ms. Prah asks everyone she meets in a country  hosts, cab drivers, shopkeepers and strangers  about their favourite foods. She met Ms. Sarr this way, through friends of friends.I learned from my grandma. I used to follow her everywhere, said Ms. Sarr, who wears her stiff white chefs uniform every time she cooks, even at home, because it makes her feel more professional. And our grandmas, they think that taking time with the food gives it more flavor. So I take time, too.She said she became a chef after money ran out to pursue her dream of being a doctor.By smell, sound and tasteShe dropped garlic into sizzling oil, then stepped back as Ms. Prah moved close to the pot to film. The two women orbited each other, artists collaborating over the pot burbling on the stove.Ms. Sarr said she cooks by smell, by sound and by taste, but Ms. Prah wrote her steps down in order, recording a recipe for others without the guidance of grandmothers and mothers at their side.After two hours, the platter was ready.Ms. Prah snapped a picture, and then another, before putting her camera aside to try the dish.Its really good, she said.",TOMATO

Sources said the ground frost and the extreme cold weather were causing some crops to wilt and hampering the growth of others.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer in Nashik, said sensitive crops like tomatoes, gourd, chillies, leafy greens and eggplants have been affected. We have noticed an increased incidence of fruit dropping in tomatoes. The extreme cold conditions have affected almost 35% of the produce, Pawar said. The exposure to frost and then sunlight in the afternoon causes black blotches to appear on vegetables, he said.Mahesh Shelke, the director of a farmers producer organisation in Junnar , seconded Pawar. The frost has a direct impact on crops, causing considerable damage. Even grapes in many fields are cracking, he said.In Vyalla village of Akola, Gajanand Wahoka is struggling to shield his gram crop from the cold. The crops are stiffening. Close to 25% of my crop has been affected. Vegetables like spinach , eggplant and dill are facing problems, he said.Though cold conditions are required for rabi crops, the extreme cold  with temperatures several degrees below normal  is detrimental. The normal winter minimum is around 15C, but the temperatures in some places have dropped to below 8C, said Amit Naphde, the MAHA Farmers Producer Company Ltd director.",TOMATO

The produce is currently selling for Rs. 60 a kg in the retail market, up from Rs. 25 a kg barely two days ago. The sudden surge in price has been attributed to a severe shortage due to crop failure in both Karnataka and Maharashtra.The tomato growing areas  Kolar-Chikkaballapur  are reeling under drought and, hence, the yield has been severely hit.Crop failureUsually at this time of the year, tomatoes come to Bengaluru's market from Nasik in Maharashtra. But the crop has completely failed in Maharashtra due to drought and a rain deficit, said a senior HOPCOMS official.Most of the farmers have not even sown tomatoes this season, as there was a severe rain deficit and many borewells have dried up. Those who sowed tomatoes saw their crop drop to less than half, said G. Sanna Munigowda, a vegetable farmer from Chikkaballapur, who added that the situation with other veggies is no different.There is a severe water shortage, which when coupled with falling temperatures, have adversely affected short-term crops. The yield is so less that prices have shot up, he said.But farmers say their profit margins are not good.Most of us are not even able to recover the input costs due to the low yield, said Papareddy, a farmer from Kolar district.A silver liningThe price of other vegetables, too, have been rising steadily over the last two weeks. Beans, carrots, brinjal, ladies finger and most other vegetables have crossed the Rs. 45 mark. The silver lining is the price of onions and potatoes, which are still in the affordable range of of Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kilo.December  January is that time of the year when vegetable yield is comparatively low due to winter. But the prices do not rise as avarekai (field beans) dominates the platter during these months. However, a severe hit in the supply of avarekai as well this year, has made the situation bad, said a procurement official of a leading retail chain in the city. He added that the situation is expected to continue to be bad for consumers at least for the next one month.",TOMATO

Although most salmonella outbreaks are linked to contamination from post-harvest handling and transportation, this infectious bacterium can also enter the plant from contaminated soil, researchers said in a statement.But how exactly does it enter from the soil? In their study, the researchers said unlike other disease-causing bacteria that enter the root, fruit or leaf by producing enzymes to break down the plants cell wall, salmonella sneaks in through a tiny gap created when a lateral root branches out from the plants primary root.This is the first time we have shown how different salmonella are from other plant pathogens based on their ability to colonise roots, said Kapudeep Karmakar, a PhD student, department of microbiology and cell biology, IISc, and first author of the paper published in BMC Plant Biology.Karmakar and his colleagues studied how different types of bacteria, including salmonella, colonise the roots of tomato plants. While other bacteria were spread across the root, salmonella bacteria clustered almost exclusively around areas where lateral roots emerge.When a lateral root pierces open the wall of the primary root to spread across the soil, it leaves behind a tiny opening. Using fluorescent tagging and imaging, the researchers figured out that salmonella bacteria were using this gap to enter the plant.Researchers also noticed that under the same conditions, a plant with a more lateral roots harboured a greater concentration of salmonella than one with fewer lateral roots. Similarly, when plants were artificially induced to produce more lateral roots, the salmonella concentration increased.",TOMATO

Prices of many vegetables have escalated, thanks to cold weather and less yield this time. Market experts see tomato prices touching Rs 100 per kg in the retail market . Tomatoes are currently being sold at Rs 60 per kg while the price was around Rs 25-30 till a few days ago. Owing to drought in Karnataka and Maharashtra (from where Karnataka receives supplies during this season), there is shortage of tomatoes in local markets. This has led to an increase in prices. If the shortage continues, tomato rates may go up to Rs100, said an official from Hopcoms.Siraj Ahmed, a vegetable merchant at Russell Market, said tomato prices in Mumbai markets have also surged and the producers in Maharashtra are sending most of the produce there as they are getting good returns. To get tomatoes from Maharashtra, local traders have to struggle a lot. Even in local markets, owing to rain deficit and lack of good returns, farmers havent shown much interest in cultivating tomatoes and other vegetables. Acute cold conditions are posing a challenge to the storage of vegetables. All these factors are having an impact on vegetable prices, Ahmed added.Low temperature and water shortage have resulted in less production of other vegetables as well, which are basically short-term crops. Prices of brinjal, carrot, beans and ladys finger have also gone up, said a Hopcoms official.Pramod P, a farmer from Kolar, said the production has come down this season in Kolar, Chikkaballapura and other districts around Bengaluru, which supply vegetables to the city on a regular basis. Seeing the market demand, farmers have now started cultivating vegetables. However, it will take one to three months before the yield arrives in Bengaluru markets, he added.",TOMATO

Under such circumstances, it is hard not to overstate the consequences of extreme oscillations in its price, both on consumers and farmers. While Mysureans were purchasing tomato over the counter at Rs 20 per kilo only a week before, citizens had to shell out anywhere between Rs 48 and Rs 60. Traders and wholesalers attribute the spurt in the prices to the demand in Bengaluru, where one kilo of tomato cost Rs 90 last week owing to a spike in demand.While the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (Hopcoms) charged Rs 48 for one kilo of tomato, traders in markets and other hawkers were selling it at Rs 60. Besides the huge demand from Bengaluru, this is the Sankranthi season, which is another reason why the prices have soared. Till Tuesday, we were procuring 50kg of tomato at Rs 500, and selling it at Rs 14 to Rs 15. But, supply to the city has come down sharply since. Cultivators and wholesalers are sending the crop to Bengaluru, where they are getting a better price for their crop. Naturally, the price has increased in Mysuru, said Siddappa Appaji, a wholesale vegetable trader in Devaraja Market.Appaji added that the bandh also had an adverse impact on supply of tomatoes to the city.A Hopcoms employee said, The price was hovering around Rs 22 in the first week of January, but it has jumped to Rs 48 now at Hopcoms. This is still cheaper compared to the open market. But, yes, there are fluctuations in the supply of the crop.Abdul Sharif, a supplier in MG Road Market, said that the demand for tomato was markedly higher in Bengaluru compared to Mysuru. Every day, on average, around seven to eight trucks carrying tomatoes are supplied to Mysuru. Thanks to the cold weather, this number has come down. Moreover, tomato farmers and traders from HD Kote, Bannur and Hassan are taking their crop to Bengaluru, where they get three times as much as they would in Mysuru, said Sharif.Homemakers are understandably perturbed with the steep rise in the cost of tomatoes and other vegetables. As they prepare for the Sankranthi festivities, the rise in vegetable prices has left them a worried lot. We are extremely worried about how we will balance the budget, said Jayashri Bhat, a resident of Vivekananda Circle.",TOMATO

37470,When raw tomatoes can spoil your salad,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/when-raw-tomatoes-can-spoil-your-salad/article25964624.ece,2019-01-11,"Washing tomatoes thoroughly will not get rid of Salmonella typhimurium bacteria, which cause gastroenteritis. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru have found that infection with S. typhimurium is a pre-harvest phenomenon and not a post-harvest problem as commonly thought. The researchers found irrefutable evidence of the bacteria entering the plants through tiny openings that form on the main root for the lateral roots to emerge. Contaminated irrigation water and open defecation are the main sources of this bacterial strain in the soil.While the bacteria are killed on cooking, Salmonella infection is usually caused when raw vegetables used in salad contain the bacteria. While studies are now being done to see if the bacteria infect other vegetables used in salad in the same manner, the key is to avoid eating any raw vegetable in the current scenario, said Dipshikha Chakravortty, from the IIScs Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, who led the team.Salmonella bacteria do not have the necessary enzymes to degrade plant cellulose and pectin and so cannot degrade cell wall. So active invasion by degrading the cell wall is not possible. Hence, S. typhimurium have to rely on natural entry points. Lateral roots are formed by remodelling of the main root. During the formation of the lateral root, a small opening is formed for the lateral root to emerge, said Professor Chakravortty. The pathogen takes advantage of these openings in the primary root to enter the plant.High colonisationEarlier studies had indicated that the bacteria colonise and enter the root through lateral root emerging areas. But the precise mechanism of entry was not known.The researchers observed very high colonisation of Salmonella in the lateral root emerging regions compared with other regions of the primary root. Other pathogens that have the ability to degrade the cell wall were found to colonise all regions of the root equally. Using an Arabidopsis mutant that produces fewer lateral roots and a chemical that induces lateral root formation, the researchers were able to increase the number of lateral roots. Compared with wild Arabidopsis, colonisation by S. typhimurium was significantly enhanced when lateral roots were formed by the mutant.In soil pre-treated with the bacteria, colonisation was more in the case of wild Arabidopsis compared with mutants. Unlike the wild Arabidopsis, the mutant produces fewer lateral roots. Since the mutants were not induced to produce more lateral roots, bacteria colonisation was more in the case of wild Arabidopsis, said Kapudeep Karmakar, Ph.D student in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, IISc, and first author of a paper published in BMC Plant Biology .As the salinity increases, the number of lateral roots formed increases. By varying the salinity of the soil the researchers found significant increase in lateral root formation in both Arabidopsis and tomato plants. We found 50 millimolar was the best concentration to induce maximum lateral root formation in Arabidopsis, said Professor Chakravortty.As the number of lateral roots increased in number, the percentage of tomato fruits infected with S. typhimurium also increased. Also, the severity of infection was higher in tomato grown in saline soil compared with controls.So salinity is a stressor and makes the plant susceptible to severe Salmonella infection, said Mr. Karmakar. This is the first time the salinity-induced lateral root proliferation and transmission of S. typhimurium to edible parts of the plant has been studied.",TOMATO

All this from an investment of just Rs 2lakh.At a time when sugar cane and onion cultivators are struggling to make adequate returns from their produce, some farmers in the Junnar tehsil are making a killing from coriander thanks to the demand-supply mismatch for the herb caused by extreme cold conditions and a paucity of water. Junnar is about 92km from here on the Nashik highway.Kute said this year has been exceptional. In the past decade, I have never got such good returns from coriander. For the past two years, I have been growing tomatoes, leafy vegetables and summer fruits like watermelon and muskmelon, but I never made so much money due to the low prices in the market. In fact, a few months ago, I had to throw away hundreds of crates of tomato due to market fluctuations and suffered heavy losses, he said.Like Kute, many coriander farmers have made good profits from the high prices their produce is fetching due to the demand-supply gap this year. Reports from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Narayangaon and Pune reveal that the kitchen staple, which usually sells for Rs 5-10 a bunch, is now commanding between Rs 30 and Rs 50.Kamlakar Wajge, a farmer from Narayangaon who is also a commission agent, earned Rs 2 lakh from the coriander harvest. Vegetable production shortage is unusual during the winter. But this year, the scenario is different. Many farmers could not grow several vegetables because of a water shortage. Now, there is a gap in demand and supply. This has resulted in an unprecedented price escalation for coriander in the market.Satish Dombale, from Otur, who made Rs1lakh in a week, added, I had cultivated coriander on 20 gunthas of land. I faced losses with all the other vegetables I had grown last year. But coriander has saved me. I can now use this capital to grow more vegetables in the coming months.According to the Narayangaon APMC data, in the past 10 days, it has received around 1.5 lakh coriander bunches every day from Junnar, Shirur, Ambegaon and Khed tehsils. Usually, in the winter months, we get around 2.5 lakh coriander bunches daily, said Sanjay Kale, the chairman of the Narayangaon market, putting a figure on the volume of shortage.At the Pune APMC market, the officials reported getting just 1 lakh coriander bunches every day against the usual supply of 2.5-3 lakh bunches. In January, a bunch of coriander usually sells for Rs 3-5.

In fact, it was an opportunity to sell packed food to some local labourers for a few days that got him thinking about 10 years ago. Thanks to the overwhelming response he received  especially for the variety rice items  S Siva immediately quit his autorickshaw riding business and started a roadside food stall called Sri Chellayi Tiffin Centre on Thanjavur Road near Old Palpannai.Right from the word go, the locals started loving his food with sambar rice being in high demand. The food stall is open from 11.30am to 3.15pm every day and serves at least 150 customers. According to Siva, his mother used to sell idlis for close to two decades and that was how he got to know the basics of food sales. The local labourers knew about his interest when they gave him a chance to try out his culinary skills by packing lunch for them for a few days. They loved what I sold. I learnt cooking from a person named Krishnamoorthy. Hes my guru who taught me everything that I know now, he added.Siva said that adding chickpeas in sambar rice worked wonders as several people loved the idea. In sambar rice, he also adds multiple vegetables including carrot, beans, drumstick and potato. In the beginning, when I used to sell sambar rice, it used to get over within 2pm itself. It gave me confidence that my eatery would be a success in the longer run, he said. Along with sambar rice, he serves coriander-mint chutney and pickle. Apart from this, people also get medhu vadai and they say that the combo tastes really well, Siva said.Kuska, lemon rice, tomato rice and curd rice are the other variety rice items that are sold at his food stall. While kuska costs Rs 25 a plate, other items are available for Rs 20 each. Siva said that apart from him, his wife S Moogambigai and mother S Gnanavalli also help him with cooking. Its only because of them that Im able to manage the demand, he said. Siva said that about 100 of the roughly 150 customers he served every day got their food parcelled. Those who buy parcels say its for their families. It gives me happiness that Im able to reach all kinds of people, he said. Though he also serves breakfast from 8.30am to 10am, he said it receives lukewarm response. Siva is also opening a tea and coffee stall near his food stall after Pongal.What: Sambar riceWhere: Near Chellayi Amman Temple, Thanjavur Road, Old PalpannaiWhen: 11.30am to 2.30pm",TOMATO

In Chennai, the hybrid navin variety hit a high of 60 per kg in retail markets on Friday, while the local variety cost 50 per kg.Several hotels in Chennai have come up with solutions that includes cutting down on tomato use. We are restricting the use of tomatoes as much as possible and alternatively using tamarind... We are ensuring that customers are not affected in any way, said M Ravi, who runs the Vasantha Bhavan chain of vegetarian restaurants and is Chennai Hoteliers Association president.The situation is the same across the state, with Cyclone Gaja that ravaged Dindigul district, a major tomato hub, being cited as a reason for short supply. Around this time last year, wholesale tomato prices in places like Madurai hovered around 5 per kg.At the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai, there has been a 50% drop in number of trucks bringing in tomatoes, mainly from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. A 15 kg box of tomatoes sold for 250-260 four days ago and crossed 500; higher quality tomatoes even sold for 550- 600 per box on Friday, said Bhuvaneshwaran, a wholesale trader.A huge drop in tomato cultivation in TN has forced traders from Dindigul and nearby districts to look for supplies from AP and Karnataka, adding to the woes, says Ravi S, another wholesaler.For Madurai region, this is when local markets get large supplies, mostly from Dindigul. Horticultural crops on 5,600 hectares were damaged by Cyclone Gaja. Though tomato crops were not damaged, there was heavy flower drop, affecting supply, said Dindigul deputy director of Horticulture, K Srinivasan.In Coimbatore region, the unusually cold weather has taken a toll on cultivation, spiking prices from 30 per kg a fortnight ago to 60 now. While bad weather forced reduction in acreage of tomato cultivation, the yield from cultivated crops too dropped. I used to harvest 15 tonnes per acre. This season, I managed only seven tonnes, said S Ganesan of Thalavadi in Erode district. Farmers who used to raise tomato crop on more than 600 acres, this season cut it down to 250 acres.Its a seasonal phenomenon, when tomato suffers damage during extreme cold. But, we have not seen any alarming damage or fall in yield in Coimbatore, said M Chinnadurai, Centre for Agricultural and Rural Development Studies, TNAU.",TOMATO

The old kuchumber  chopped tomatoes, onions and cucumber  worked for me. I must also admit that I am a changed man. The difference that a freshly plucked sprig of basil  which grows in my back verandah  makes to a bowl of fresh veggies has turned me into a salad freak. Its not just the flavour of the basil that does the trick, I believe. Its also the fact that it is fresh, grows in my backyard, and is organic.Now I know what the old aunt  who disapproved of modern contraptions such as a fridge in the old days  meant when she talked about fresh food. For its not just freshness of cooked food that tickles your palate; what adds to the taste is the freshness of the ingredients. And if there are no chemicals, the flavours magnify.Going organicSo, that explains why my young friend Abhishek Basu has been focusing on fresh and organic ingredients at The Park in New Delhi. I had a delicious meal the other day at the restaurant called Fire, and realised how difficult it is to curate a full menu, day after day, that features local dishes, cooked with local and organic ingredients. Because organic farming is still to take off in a big way in our country, it is not easy to source your ingredients if you are cooking on a large scale.People would promise, but not be able to deliver the ingredients, Chef Basu says. I finally found my farmers, but for the food to be completely organic and to be able to use the local produce, I have to make sure that I change my menu three times a year.I am not doing all the hard work, but I must say that it is worth it. For the new winter menu that he has created is superb. One, the dishes are those that people have grown up eating  but in different parts of the country. So there is the Singju salad of Manipur, and fish in a coconut based gravy of Malabar. It includes the juicy nalli nihari gosht of Old Delhi, and the Lahori chicken that you will find in the north. I had my winter favourite  aloo methi  and the bhatt ki dal of Uttarakhand.There was too much food on my platter for one meal, so I could only taste some of the dishes. I loved the hot and spicy rasam and the salad  which consisted of shredded cabbage, lotus stem, coriander mixed with roasted gram flower and pigeon peas.The platter of snacks was delicious. It consisted of crispy Hyderabadi lukmi (keema puffs), barbequed Kashmiri tujji chicken, gulnar ki tikki (prepared with fig, walnut, paneer, puffed amaranth, kale powder and tomatoes) and papad-crusted beetroot patties stuffed with coconut.The thali came adorned with little bowls, all carrying regional favourites. I enjoyed the fresh aloo methi and the thick but light bhatt ki dal. The river sole was delectable, sweetly flavoured with coconut milk and raw mango. I have had way too much of chicken in the last few months, so I let the Lahori chicken be and concentrated instead on the dessert, which was stupendous. I enjoyed the chikoo cheese cake and the chocolate fondant immersed in a cup of south Indian filter coffee.The prices at The Fire are pretty reasonable, if you consider the fact that its a luxury hotel. The salad was for Rs. 295 (before taxes), the vegetarian dishes on the platter were for Rs. 395 and the meat or chicken ones for Rs. 645.The desserts are for Rs. 345, and the prices of the mains vary between Rs. 445 and Rs. 795 (the latter for the Pandhi pork curry).Chef Basu offers us a delectable meal to beat the cold: it is regional, healthy  and ever so tasty.",TOMATO

While farmers had reduced acreage of tomato cultivation owing to the weather, the yield from cultivated area has also come down.I used to harvest 15 tonnes of tomato from an acre. But this season I could manage to get only seven tonnes, said S Ganesan, a farmer from Thalavadi in Erode district, a tomato hub.Farmers in Thalavadi taluk who raise tomato in 600 to 700 acres every season have cut short the cultivation to just 250 acres. I have cultivated tomato in just one acre of my land. Usually I will cultivate in three acres, Ganesan said.In Coimbatore, the retail price of apple tomatoes which hovered around Rs 30 a fortnight back had shot up to Rs 60 while the country variety is sold at Rs 52. The wholesale price was Rs 20 a week back. But now it is Rs 37, said a hotelier.Though there was not much damage to the crops in Coimbatore, frost in Karnataka affecting yield there has spiked the demand resulting in a sharp rise in prices here.Its a seasonal phenomenon when tomato suffers damage during extreme cold. But we have not seen any alarming damage or fall in yield in Coimbatore, said M Chinnadurai, director, Centre for Agricultural and Rural Development Studies of Tamil Nadu Agriculture University.In Coimbatore, most farmers were saved from poor yield as they usually shift to other crops during Pongal season. Farmers in Hosur, where tomato is cultivated extensively, have also switched to other crops, leaving the households feeling the pinch.Since there was poor yield from tomato last year due to erratic rainfall many farmers had switched to other crops. Karumandhurai, Thekkalpattu, Vellimalai, Pagudupatu, Maniarkundam, Thavalaipatti, Pethanayakanpalayam and surrounding areas are tomato hubs.Thalaivasal market alone will receive about 60 truckloads of tomato from these areas while Vazhapadi market will receive 15 truckloads. But not even a single truckload came to these markets on Friday, M G R Palaniswamy, a wholesale tomato trader in Vazhapadi market.Since Hosur is also a hub of cut roses, many farmers have switched to rose cultivation, eying the Valentines Day market.Murugan, a farmer from Vazhapadi, said there was no adequate northeast monsoon rain in Salem region forcing them to drop tomato. I was all set to cultivate tomato. Since there was no water I switched to other crops, he said.There are several nurseries in and around Omalur, Rayakottai, Ayodhiyapattina, Hosur and Salem. Thousands of saplings were left unsold and the nursery owners have suffered a loss.The nursery owners have also moved to other crops like cabbage and chilli.Market experts from TNAU said the situation will improve by the end of this month as harvest of tomato would pick up.",TOMATO

Having said that, it is a fabulous museum, beautifully curated and even has a section devoted to Sachin Tendulkar!Bowral itself is a quaint town but the village that really stole my heart was Berrima, which is widely recognised as the best-preserved example of a Georgian village on the Australian mainland. From 1831 to the 1860s was a time of promise and growth for Berrima, which came to an abrupt end when the railway bypassed the village in 1867. For the next 100 years there was little or no development. Todays visitor to Berrima can experience the quiet charm and romance that comes from those features of the village which remained frozen in time. It is clearly an affluent area with delightful shops selling everything from basket ware to gourmet jams, desserts and designer ware and quaint cafes.

Chorui means open space and bhaati, feasting. In my mind, somehow, the term had come to be punched with a passage from Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyays Pather Panchali. A teenaged Durga whispering conspiratorially to her little brother: Choruibhaati korbi, Apu? Will you join me for a picnic, Apu? Brother and sister then collected some wild potatoes, stole a fistful of rice, a little bit of oil from their mothers kitchen, and then gleefully stirred it all in a pot on a wood-fire.Now I realise that it was less than a frugal meal even, much less a picnic  but all through my childhood the image held a different flavour for me.This winter, after ages, my husband and I went on a picnic with some friends from the neighbourhood. I had not been to attend the meetings in the run-up to the big day; all I knew was that I had to pay a certain amount and that we would be going to a resort in Baruipur in South 24-Parganas.On the appointed day, the car arrived at 7am. It was still misty and the sun was mellow. I slipped into a corner seat and nodded off. Time was when the very utterance of picnic worked like a magic spell, suggested a flurry of activity. A big bus would ferry a whole bunch of us to some nondescript spot. Anxious mothers would carry with them half their households  sheets to sit on, a medicine kit for emergencies, tiffin carriers heavy with snacks and flasks of tea. There would be skipping ropes, carrom boards, badminton racquets and half a dozen shuttle cocks for us.The fathers, smartly dressed in their pullovers, would holler at each other imperiously as they loaded (rented) utensils and cutlery, crates of soft drinks and bags full of grocery for the grand cookout.The car stopped and I woke up. We had reached the resort and someone was playing Bidi jalaile Bewildered, I checked my phone; it was 8am. I was told later that a picnic without a DJ is unimaginable now, as is a wedding, a thread ceremony, a birthday  so far funerals are out.The current day picnic is a completely outsourced affair Telegraph pictureWe had barely settled down, when uniformed catering staff started to serve breakfast  fish fingers, French fries, boiled eggs, sandwiches and tetrapacks of fruit juice. In the old days, it used to be singara with cauliflower stuffing or kochuri-alur dum or luchi-bonde and jilipi.Breakfast done, the DJ played Bryan Adams Summer of 69. The kids headed for the swing, the teenagers for the badminton court for some net flicks, some others just sat glued to their phones, earphones in place  their parents said they were overwhelmed they had deigned to come along. The adults sat around, drinking beer, chatting, stealing covetous glances at their phones, some got up to shake a leg.In the golden days, this was when the adults would get busy prepping for lunch. The women would chop and peel. The men would get the clay oven started, fetch more firewood; oftentimes, they would cook. But now there is no work to be done. Everything has been taken care of, paid for. The DJ started to play Pretty Woman and I got up to admire the flowers, but ended up tripping over a pair of canoodling teens, falling and flattening three dahlia plants.The picnic menu used to be really basic. Bhaat, beguni (fried brinjal slices in batter), labra  a vegetable mix. There would be some gooey chatni  tomato  and papod, finished off with mishti doi and rosogolla. But the pice de rsistance and possibly the only thing the men actually cooked, when they did, would be the fiery mutton curry. For days on end after the picnic, they would congratulate each other on the curry, its fine balance of spices, its chilli kick, the way the meat came off at the bone, till it moved their better halves from indulgent to sour to bitter.After lunch, the children would return to their play. The gaggle of mothers would bring out their knittings from their bottomless carrybags. The men would be busy with the cleaning up, the winding up. A quick round of tea and the picnic was over, everyone was bone tired but satiated.That day lunchtime came and went and people barely noticed. We sat at individual tables and ate off La Opala plates. The menu was elaborate  two kinds of fries, a dal, a sabzi, fish, mutton, chatni, papod, rabri. It was good cooking. But adults and children alike were busy, first clicking and then posting photographs of the food on social media. The eating was hurried, even incidental.

But this time, there is less crowd. Were selling to local vendors as usual, but there are not many individual buyers this time around. So, the overall sales are showing a dip for many of us.He adds, Gaja cyclone hasnt impacted the arrival of sugarcane . While 50 truckloads arrived on Saturday, by Sunday morning, 550 more loads have come. Each bundle is now being sold for anywhere between `250 and `450. We are expecting more supply by this morning, and the prices are expected to fall further, he says.Raghavan, a vendor from Porur, says that the supply of turmeric and ginger, considered to be indispensable for the festival, are less compared to last year. Needless to say, the prices of the same have shot up. While a bundle of manjal kizhangu kothu (comprising approximately 40 plants) is being sold for `50-`60 at Koyambedu, each plant is sold for `30 in other parts of the city, he says.However, the salubrious weather seems to have helped flower sellers. Kalai, a flower seller, says, Since we have enough supplies, we are able to sell flowers for a nominal rate. While Jasmine is being sold for `500-`600 a kilo, all other flowers are now being sold in the range of `100-`150 per kilo.Chandra, who had come to buy vegetables at the Koyambedu market, says, I think most people have gone to their native places.

The prices of sugarcane and most vegetables have shot up because of the vagaries of the weather Among the Pongal staples, sugarcane costs Rs 450 for a bundle of 18 to 20 stalks. Sellers blame the high prices on loss of crop caused by early onset of the monsoon, worsened by insufficient rain later in the season. Last year, the upper limit for sugarcane was Rs 350 a bundle.Around 600 truckloads have arrived so far and 500 more are expected in the next few days. The market is currently selling the produce at a fair price, which will come down further to Rs 150 for a bundle in the next few days said an official at the Koyambedu Market. He said the trucks were mostly coming from Melur, Erode, Villupuram, and Cuddalore and from a few places in Andhra Pradesh.On Sunday, loads of trucks arrived early in the morning at Koyambedu with sugarcane, turmeric, and bananas ahead of Pongal. Turmeric was sold at Rs 20 to Rs 50 with Rs 40 being the standard price for a bundle of 8-12 pieces. Ginger was sold at Rs 30 to Rs 40 for a bundle of 4-5 pieces. The price of turmeric and ginger has not increased unexpectedly, said Vinayagamoorthy, a retail trader from Ennore. Dry coconuts were sold at Rs 35 to Rs 40, well within expectations, but tender coconuts were dearer as supply has been affected this time.However, vegetable prices, especially that of tomato , beans, and broad beans have gone up considerably this Pongal season. A colder than expected winter has hit arrivals of these vegetables at Koyambedu.Cyclone Gaja is responsible for the short supply of coconuts as lakhs of trees were uprooted in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Pudukottai districts. Supply from these districts is zero, said Koyambedu fruits, vegetables and flowers merchants welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar.Explaining the reason for hike in prices of tomato, he said three months ago the tomato yield was very high but the farmers were unable to get a good price. It fetched only Rs 8 per kg. As a result, many farmers switched to growing other vegetables. Unusually cold weather in the southern states further reduced the tomato yields.",TOMATO

Desi ghee , pure milk, fresh produce from the riversides and age-old cooking mediums like angithi s with charcoal ensure that the food here is as authentic as it is flavourful.Food is everywhere in Allahabad  in the shacks that dot the tiny lanes, push carts that appear magically at dusk with lip-smacking chaat , at the hole-in-the-wall shops that have no name but hundreds of people queuing up for their jalebi s and samosa s.While these carts, shops, and stalls dot every part of the city, it is in Loknath Gali  a cramped, narrow lane  where you find the most authentic flavours. This street in Allahabad is famous everywhere for its food, says Saurabh Srivastava, a High Court advocate who visits the place often. Before Independence, it used to be the favourite haunt of the most brilliant minds in the country. Famous men would get together every evening to discuss matters of national importance over food.The evenings, he says, would begin with chaat at Nirala, and end at the Loknath Temple with kulfi - faluda . In between there was rabri , malai , lassi , khurchan , gulab jamun , imarti , and samosa s.Rows of tiny sweet shops manned by elderly men line Loknath Gali today. The shops, set in the verandas of crumbling old mansions and haveli s, are lit with bright lamps hanging from naked wires. The light illuminates their respective specialities, from khurchan and fruit cream to gajar ka halwa . Rabri , the thick, mildly-sweet preparation of milk, is one of the oldest products of this lane. The portly man at an unnamed shop tells us how it takes hours of patience and hard work to make just one tray. Thick and chunky, it is not too sweet, and that, we are told, is its speciality.The khurchan , another speciality, comes in large rectangles. Thick sheets of condensed milk set with layers of castor sugar and nuts are served in long rectangular pieces.What people like the most, however, is the fruit cream. Stored in large tin containers, it is sweet and chilled. The bite of seasonal fruits is balanced with the smoothness of rich cream. It is sweeter than the rabri and khurchan and also carries the beautiful earthy scent of the clay bowl it is served in.The flavours of Allahabad are as authentic as they get, says Sangeeta Khanna, a food writer and consultant who writes extensively about the food of Uttar Pradesh.My favourite is the gulab jamun that you find on the highway between Allahabad and Benaras. It is made with the purest khoya on coal, and has the same old taste, she adds.You have eaten nothing if you have not eaten Nirala ki chaat , the man at the counter of Nirala, one of Allahabads most famous chaat shops, tells us. Tamatar (tomato) ki chaat , aloo (potato) tikki , matar (peas) ki chaat , and pani ke batashey top the list. Everything is made in pure ghee.The tikki s, unlike those in Lucknow, Agra, or Mathura, are small and crunchy. Tamatar ki chaat is a mash of umpteen ingredients, while the matar is soaked ingheeand topped with rustic spices.A hint of saltNo conversation about Allahabads food can be complete without the namkeen s and samosa s of the city. Made fresh every day, the namkeen s are often sold-out by evening. The mind-boggling variety ( dalmoth , mathri , sem ke beej , sev , gur ke sev , aloo ke lacche , and the legendary dal ki samose ), flavours, textures, and aromas of these fresh snacks display the citys mastery over its food and the importance it holds in the daily lives of its people.Allahabadis are real connoisseurs of food, declares Naresh. They not only know their food  both at home and outside  but also discuss it with great passion. It is impossible for you to serve average food to an Allahabadi. After having a sample, we cannot help but agree.Whither fromPersian sweetbamiehand Turkishtulumba, both balls of fried dough soaked in sugar syrup, are believed to have been likely influences behind the Indiangulab jamun.",TOMATO

While this has been a constant over the past few years, colleges too have been doing their bit. With Grow your own Veggies movement taking city folk by storm, we find out how city colleges fare at thisMany colleges have been making conscious efforts to preserve the green cover on campus. With several sapling drives and initiatives, colleges have been doing their bit. Many colleges boast gardens that have medicinal plants and herbs on campus , which is often maintained by students and faculty members and are mainly used for educational purposes. We grow plenty of herbs and medicinal plants on campus, since a lot of it is used for practicals, where we show them how to make herbal medicines. It is difficult for us to go out and source these plants, which is why we grow them ourselves. The gardens maintained by our department are mostly for education purposes, says Lekha George, professor Department of Botany at Mount Carmel College.Similarly, Geeja S Kurian, HOD, Department of Botany and Biotechnology at Jyoti Nivas College, says that students and faculty members are involved in the maintenance of these gardens. We have a small medicinal garden called Sanjeevani, which is maintained by our department, where we grow a lot of medicinal plants. We also have a small orchard where we grow fruits. The students who live in the hostel make the most of it and get to take those fruits , says Geeja.While many campuses do boast ample greenery, not many are able to grow vegetables and fruits due to the lack of space. One of the biggest reasons we dont grow vegetables and fruits on campus is because of the space crunch we face. If there is a patch of land that is available, we would definitely grow fruits and vegetables and actively involve students in this activity. We have enough manpower, but no space, says Lekha. Similarly AK Bopaiah, professor at St. Josephs College, agrees and says, Though we have a big green house on campus, we mostly grow ornamental and medicinal plants there. Some students from the environment science department have planted some plants that bear fruits, but its not done on a large scale because of the construction work thats currently going on. Once thats over, we will take it up and plant more trees, especially those that bear fruits, says Bopaiah.But that doesnt mean that there is lack of enthusiasm among students, say teachers. Even if we dont have a full-fledged vegetable garden on campus, students do come up to us and ask for pointers on how to grow fruits and vegetables at home and we help them, says Geeja. Several workshops and seminars too are conducted to get more students actively involved. We get experts and conduct workshops on a regular basis for students, so that they understand the importance of growing fruits and vegetables at home. In Bengaluru, terrace gardening has picked up and we promote the same. Once they (students) graduate many take it up professionally, says Bopaiah. Colleges also offer several courses in horticulture, encouraging students to try their hand at growing vegetables. Since it is a part of our course, we grow ladies fingers and tomatoes. We have it in patches and its scattered across the campus, says Amal KV, final year BSc student, Christ (Deemed to be University).",TOMATO

MudurScientists have for the first time spotted the little Indian field mouse in farms and granaries in the cold, high-altitude region of Ladakh and called for surveillance and management of this crop pest there.A two-year study by scientists from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to explore the diversity of rodents in Ladakh has revealed the presence of the Mus booduga at altitudes up to 3,768 metres.The tiny mouse has long been recognised as a major crop pest elsewhere across the Indian subcontinent where it damages many field crops, vegetables and fruits. Scientists have recorded the mouse causing damage to groundnuts, maize, rice, raddish, wheat, apples, peaches, plums, cauliflower and tomatoes, among other crops.Earlier field surveys by the ICAR had documented the presence of the little Indian field mouse only up to 3,696 metres above sea level, its highest locations hitherto in Uttarakhand.Several larger rodents  other mice, rats and squirrels  cause more damage to various crops than the little Indian mouse in other parts of the subcontinent. But the little Indian field mouse appears to be the major pest in Ladakh.In Ladakh, weve found the mus booduga thriving in fields during summer and in granaries during winter, Vipin Chaudhary, an agricultural entomologist and principal scientist at the ICARs Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur, told The Telegraph.Chaudhary and senior CAZRI scientist Rakesh S. Tripathi, whos also coordinator of the All India Network Project on Vertebrate Pest Management, have published their findings in the research journal Mammalia.The scientists say the presence of the little Indian field mouse warrants greater surveillance to determine the extent of crop damage it might be causing and the adoption, if necessary, of appropriate pest management practices.Ladakh is widely viewed as a cold, dry desert, but agriculture is the backbone of 70 per cent of its population, Chaudhary said. Local communities grow wheat and barley during their seasons and vegetables throughout the year. Vegetables are grown in open fields in summer and inside special protective housing during winter.The scientists said their finding did not imply that the little Indian field mouse had expanded its range into Ladakh in recent years. Were not claiming that the little mouse is a new arrival in Ladakh  it just hadnt been observed thus far, Chaudhary said.He said that understanding the biodiversity of an ecosystem was important for crop management. While the CAZRI had in the past conducted multiple surveys of crop pest rodents across India, the rodent diversity in Ladakh remained unclear.The latest study has also documented a vole, a squirrel and a rat in Ladakh, but each of these species had already been observed there.",TOMATO

It is, in turn, impacting the price being paid to the farmers due to non-availability of good freight facility to Delhi, Kolkata, Guwahati and other places, horticulture officials say.Department Commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary wrote to the SCR seeking at least two open wagons in the Sampark Kranthi Express and the AP Express and two open wagons to Guwahati.

The ban on wood-fired kilns has left him fretting away on his charpai the whole day. His only hope is that the authorities have a change of heart. The 60-year-olds plight is worse than for the 400-odd households in Kumhar Gram in west Delhi for he is blind.A father of seven, Chand was diagnosed with glaucoma in 1998 soon after the birth of his first daughter. I underwent a surgery 28 years ago, but my vision kept deteriorating and by 2000 I was completely blind, the potter said. But I could still shape clay lamps, money banks and foot scrubbers.When Chand was a child, he had seen his grandfather slap a mound of freshly kneaded clay on a wheel. The handcrafted lamps , pots and sculptures were placed in a tray and put out in the heat of the summer sun before being baked in the kilns. After he died my father took over and then it was eventually up to me to carry on, said Chand.After the imposition of the ban on December 18, Chand has not touched clay. As Chand whiles away the afternoons on his charpai, his son, Jag Dev, 23, struggles to sell the remaining stock.Across Chands house lives his relative Naraini Devi. She pulled her red sari around her and expressed her dismay. My children know only the art of pottery and so are running out of options. They will probably have to become rickshaw pullers now, she said. There was similar undertone of apprehension on Jag Devs voice when he added, With the kilns prohibited, our future is uncertain because the notice does not have a date for the possible lifting of the ban.With no current production or sales and with little to survive on, Chand's family is adapting to the forced austerity. ""We mostly grind a tomato and chillies into a chutney and have it with chapatis, revealed the elderly potter.Chand, after fully losing his eyesight, got a certificate made that gave him free travel on buses and some assistance. But the municipal councillor disbursal that he received every month stopped in 2016. I had a stall outside the Qutub Minar metro station where my son and I sold pottery. But we were removed from there, he said.With no word from the authorities of an alternative, the only way out for Chand and his ilk is getting non-pottery jobs or a space where the potters of the Uttam Nagar can start afresh. I pray to the government to allow us to work, Chand said, and added mournfully, I had fixed the marriage of my son in April, but with the financial stress, I am staring at loss of face in society.",TOMATO

The officials said that the work slowed down a little during the festival season.Giving details of the progress, the officials informed the Chief Minister that 64.31% of the total project work had been completed. With regard to the concrete work, 61.70 % (22.71 lakh cubic metre of the total 36.79 lakh cubic metre) of the total work has been completed.Nearly 85% of the excavation work (945.56 lakh cubic metre of the total 1,115.59 lakh cubic metre) has also been done, the officials said.Central duesThe officials also told Mr. Naidu that the Central dues to the State government towards the expenditure on Polavaram project had increased to Rs. 3,722.04 crore by January third week. The number of farmers who have visited Polavaram project since April 23 last year has crossed 5 lakh, they said.The officials also suggested Mr. Naidu that tourism could be encouraged by setting up resorts and hotels on the hills on the either side of Polavaram project reservoir.Chittoor, a tomato hubEarlier in the day, Mr. Naidu said that plans should be prepared to transform Chittoor district into a tomato hub.The true potential of Chittoor can be realised now that water is available.

Creation of an exclusive budget will lead to more allocation of funds for agriculture, make crop insurance payouts, fixing of minimum support prices and loan waivers easier. With agriculture just a part of the general budget, the allocation it receives is minimal compared to industries, defence, railways and other sectors, association president S Palanisamy said.Fixing a minimum support price for staple crops like tomato and small onion, spices like turmeric and pepper, and grains was critical for farmers survival, the petition said. Only if you have an exclusive budget will you calculate the cost of calculation of a specific crop. During crop damage, you have to take that cost, add a little more money and pay it out to the farmer. Or at least the cost of cultivation has to be given to the farmer, district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivaisaigal Sangam P Kandasamy said. Minimum support price is critical to support farmers when onion prices crash, like it did last year. Also, once fund is allocated for it, the government will find it easier to distribute it.Agriculture is also an industry, which also requires support, the petition said. The number of farmers in the country is steadily decreasing and more families are moving to urban areas. Unless you recognize agriculture as an industry, giving it the loans, loan waivers and support prices required, more and more farmers will keep quitting and one day, we will have a food shortage, Palanisamy added.",TOMATO

However, the rate of tomato will increase to double, said Santosh, a vegetable vendor at Sector 23.The city gets tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh and Nashik.

This is for the first time that such a shift has been witnessed, he added.Crop production is up 1.5% year on year and about 8% higher than the previous five years average. Singh said horticulture production contributes 29% of the countrys GDP. This despite horticulture occupying only 14% of the total area under agriculture at 140 million hectares. Potato, tomato, onion, brinjal, mango and banana are other major horticulture crops the country is producing, he added.A senior researcher from ICAR said with increasing production, India is set to expand its footprint in horticulture crop exports on the global trade map. Potato, onion, mango and banana are in high demand in other countries. For the first time, we recently exported bananas from Tamil Nadu, he added.Researchers attribute the rise in production to higher returns farmers are getting per unit area of cultivation. While paddy gives a maximum yield of only 30 quintals per hectare for a cultivator, the same for banana is 400q/ha and grape is 100q/ ha. Consumption of horticulture crops which are rich in vitamins and nutrients, has also gone up. Farmers are investing in flowers used for decorative purposes as well, he added.",TOMATO

The platform seeks to help farmers in getting better market access, find more buyers/traders for their produce and earn higher income. Small Farmers' Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) is the lead agency for implementing eNAM under the aegis of the Union agriculture ministry.Trade in 585 mandis is currently taking place on the electronic network, which helps discover price in real time in a transparent manner. The government aims to integrate 200 mandis this year and another 215 next year with the e-NAM platform. There are about 2,700 APMC mandis and 4,000 sub-market yards in India.Earlier, trade used to happen within the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) mandi or between two APMC mandies situated in the same state.Recently, the first inter-state transaction in tomatoes was carried out between a trader of Bareilly e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh and a farmer of Haldwani e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand.On the same day, another transaction in potatoes was carried out between a trader of Rudrapur e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand and a farmer of Moradabad e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh. In both the cases, e-payments have been made through e-NAM portal.Further, inter-state transactions happened between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The interacting mandis were Gadwal mandi from Telangana and Kurnool mandi from Andhra Pradesh.The latest development is from the Palanpur mandi of Gujarat which sold green gram to Sumerpur mandi of Rajasthan, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Though the volumes of inter-state trade on e-NAM platform are low currently, the programme will prove to be a giant leap in reforming the agriculture market in India, the official added.The ministry has integrated 585 wholesale regulated markets/ (APMC) markets in 16 states and 2 Union territories (UTs), who have carried out requisite reforms in their state APMC. Currently, seven states -- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand -- are working on the modalities to establish inter-state trade.Farmers can access the information on e-NAM easily through their mobile phone from anywhere. This online trading platform aims at reducing transaction costs, bridging information asymmetry and helps in expanding the market access for farmers.eNAM is a virtual marketplace with a physical market (mandi) at the backend, networking the existing APMC/mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities for pan-India electronic trading. Mandis handle huge volumes of farm produce. eNAM provides quick quality assaying solutions to promote online trading.Logistics providers' information is also being provided on the e-NAM portal to traders from outside the state which will facilitate transportation of commodities.The agriculture ministry is in the process of developing a separate dashboard to promote inter-state trade among e-NAM states.There are also discussions ongoing among the officials of the ministry, SFAC and state governments on dispute settlement mechanism. Initially, the dispute has to be settled by the mandi of origin where the e-trade is going to be executed. MJH HRS",TOMATO

He was ready with a plan for the purpose even before he took over as the CM. Hamne loan waiver ki baat hawa mein nahin ki thi. There was a planning on how Rs 55,000 crore would be arranged to waive off loan of 53 lakh eligible farmers. I had the plan ready before I actually became the CM. There was a possibility of me becoming the CM and I had done my homework on how to go about it. By the time the model code comes into force next month, we would have waived off loans of 35 lakh farmers, he said.He further said that farming must be seen in a fresh perspective. Seventy percent of population in MP is based on agriculture. They are not farmers alone. Grocery shops, automobile shops, textile. They also largely depend on agriculture sector for good sale. . Only boost in production is not enough. Production increased during the previous regime as well, but what about marketing of those products?

Many order huge garlands to fulfil their vows, and not everyone has cloth bags to carry them, so the vendor is ready to offer them the banned plastic bags.I open my shop as early as 5 am in the morning and cannot expect people, who come early to the temple to bring eco-friendly bags for the flowers. I have enough carry bags to give them, said a vendor, who has his shop at the entrance of the temple, adding that people refuse the flowers if they are not given a carry bag.Senthikumar, who has a small grocery store in Villapuram, said that their sales amount to about Rs 5,000 per day, but when they refuse carry bags, the customers say they dont have a way to carry the goods.When somebody refuses to buy a coconut I lose about Rs 5, so I must provide a bag, he said.Farmers markets throughout the city are another place, where a few kilograms of bags can be seized if the enforcing officials conduct raids, said S Thiagarajan, of Chinna Chokkikulam, adding that these vendors are a reason why such initiatives to ban plastics fails.They should be given a proper alternative, for a woman, who sells tomatoes, losing the sale of half a kilogram will impact her daily earnings and cause loss, he said.If you are regular at the meat shops, it is one place where you can go confidently without an eco-friendly bag as the butcher is ready to provide you with a bag.The plastic ban is something that will not become viable in the near future without a proper alternative, and the government should explore ways to make the people dispose it properly, said A Asokan, Madurai district secretary of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam.We are comparing the life of people 20-years-ago, when they brought utensils and bags and purchased goods, but we should keep in mind that the things happened at a slower pace, now people do not have the patience to stand till an item is wrapped in paper, hence an alternative should be explored, he said.Madurai Corporation commissioner, Aneesh Sekhar said that they would intensify their checks on the shops.",TOMATO

High production depresses prices and farmers are left in the lurch.Production of high-focus TOP (tomato, onion and potato) is estimated to be higher than the output of these crops in 2017-18 with potato at 52.58 MT recording 6% growth, followed by tomato (2% higher) and onion (1.5% higher).Records show that horticulture production has been consistently rising since 2012-13. Production is up. Producer is down. Thats the story of Indian agriculture, tweeted Yogendra Yadav , national president of Swaraj India who has been raising farm related issues.The remarks summed up what other observers too feel about growing production of not only horticultural produce but also of foodgrains. Record production of horticulture crops is the result of favourable weather and expectations of higher income based on past experience. But record production is not translating into higher returns, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said.Panwar, a farm expert and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, cited two major reasons for it. First, the central governments policy of containing inflation in food items and second, over-dominance of middlemen in supply chain of fruits and vegetables, specifically corporates, in some segments, he told TOI.Initial efforts of government such as price stabilisation funds and boost of food processing industry could not be rolled out because of budgetary constraints and lack of focused approach, he added.Actual production figures of horticultural crops in 2017-18 show that fruits recorded slightly higher growth than vegetables. Production of fruits in 2017-18 was estimated at 97.35 MT which was 4.8% higher than the previous year. Vegetables output at 187.5 MT in 2017-18, on the other hand, was 3.5% higher than 2016-17.",TOMATO

Police have recovered two country-made pistols and snatched vehicle from their possession.The accused were identified as Anujvir (23) from Rohtak and Hitesh (24) from Gadoli village in Gurgaon. One of the assailants had suffered injuries on his leg. He was rushed to civil hospital by the police team. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital.According to police, both the accused are serial offenders. Around six cases have been registered against them. The accused are associated with Gadoli gang, police said.Based on a tip-off that a brown Maruti Ciaz was snatched at gun point by two assailants in Sector 92 on Dwarka Expressway around 4.30pm, police deployed teams to nab them.The accused, who were standing on the expressway, intercepted the car going towards Sector 92 and forced the driver to step out, held him hostage at gunpoint before fleeing with the car.Soon after receiving the information, a team of crime unit in Sector 10 led by inspector Deepak launched a search for the accused.

At the inauguration of Uniworld Premier League, a fortnight-long cricket tournament held there recently, Mathieu Ndoli Koua was called upon to demonstrate some electric moves as also train some youngsters of the locality for a show that evening.I taught them what I call Afrodance 54. Its a reference to the 54 countries there are in the African continent and the culture we represent, said Mathieu, who is known in the complex for dance and football.The second is no surprise. Football is why Ivory Coast is famous. We have played in three World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014), he said, naming Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure as his favourite players. The 33-year-old had seen them play back home against Cameroon. Samuel Etoo was captaining Cameroon. We lost the match narrowly.At Uniworld, Mathieu can be spotted playing football with neighbours every weekend. On weekdays, he is hard at work at DLF 2 close by, working as a French editor in a multinational telecommunications company.He is the first in his family to venture out of Ivory Coast. I always wanted to see the world. Ghana was the first country I went to, in 2010. It was just across the border. For five years, the French-speaking Mathieu taught his mother tongue to the English speakers there. It also gave me a chance to brush up my English.Then he felt confident to apply to his college for an India posting as an intern. It was a 12-month internship that I got, through AIESEC, with Tata Consultancy Services. Thus he landed up at Uniworld, joining other interns from Brazil, Morocco and Tunisia.India was a far bigger challenge than Ghana. In Ghana, the culture was the same as ours. Only, the language spoken is English. Here everything is different.Initially, people around him could not understand his African accent. Nor could he make sense of Indian English. After three and half years, his ears have got attuned.The bigger challenge was food. It was difficult to get used to the flavour and taste of Indian food. Africans like spicy dishes, but not me. In Ivory Coast, the staple food is rice as well as foufou, which is accompanied by a soup. Foufou is a mix of cassava and green plantain or yam. Another popular food is attieke, made of grated cassava pulp. It is powdery, like couscous, and served with stew.Mathieu cooks at home but has now become used to Indian food as well. My favourite is Lachcha Paratha and Chicken Chaap.Every Sunday, he goes to church. I used to go to St. John's earlier in Sealdah but transport was a problem. Now an AC 12 takes him directly to St. Pauls Cathedral. Christmas is the only time I miss being in Abidjan. He has heard of a couple of footballers from Ivory Coast playing for smaller club in the city but feels no inclination to seek them out. I have been accepted as a brother at Uniworld. Its not as if I feel friendless.He loves New Town. The atmosphere is peaceful. I meet nice people everywhere, I can go out at anytime. There is no fear of robbery, he smiles. He has seen violence on the streets, having lived through a political crisis back home in 2010 in the aftermath of the Presidential election there.He has gone to see a couple of matches at Salt lake stadium. The first time it was a Mohun Bagan match. My Brazilian friends wanted to see the player from Brazil (Barreto). The second time we went to cheer for Brazil in the Under-17 World Cup.He remains uninitiated into cricket but has picked up three names  M.S. Dhoni (I saw his movie), Virat Kohli (He is everywhere) and Hardik Pandya (How can someone be called that!). He rolls the name over on his lips a couple of times and guffaws uncontrollably.This August will complete four years of his stay in Calcutta. I landed here on August 7, which is our independence day. A week later, on August 15, I saw our flags colours hung everywhere. I was so happy. He figured out the difference later  that the Indian flag has orange, white and green as horizontal stripes, not vertical. Still it is a connection that makes me feel at home here.Ivory Coast on your plateChicken YassaFeeds: 4 peopleIngredients:1 kg chicken1 kg onion200 g mustard sauce235 g green olive170 ml vinegar or lime juice200 g garlic paste2 Maggi magic cubes7 chilliesDry gingerSalt to tasteMethod:Chop the onions, capsicums and chillis.

These griddles are in a heavy demand in the neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as well.IIT Delhi's Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) will join hands with a Bharatpur-based foundation to provide technical assistance to the members of the Kumhar community, comprising traditional potters, for upgrading their kilns to bake more griddles with lesser quantity of mustard stubble used as fuel.About 35 households of Kumhars in Punchari produce 300 to 350 griddles of black clay each everyday in all seasons of the year, except during rains and the intense cold wave creating a frost. The earthy scent of black soil, procured mostly from the villages pond, is maintained in the griddles even after they are baked.Prahlad Prajapat, 30, a leading griddle maker in Punchari, said the demand for clay griddles had soared among the health-conscious people residing in cities, who believed that the chapatis nutrients were protected when cooked on an earthen plate. The clay griddles are supplied as far as Agra and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh and Faridabad and Gurugram in Haryana.Modified designMr. Prajapat said the clay pottery was taken up in the village both as a traditional occupation and the only livelihood option before the community. Over a period of two decades, we have understood the demand in the market. We have modified the design and thickness of griddles to suit the requirement of gas stove and heater in the cities, he said.About 25% of the clay griddles break during baking in furnaces.

The thorny plants make the process arduous; he has already suffered cuts and scratches. But if he wants to protect his valuable crops, there is little choice. He cannot afford a wired fence.For farmers like Vijay Rawat in Uttar Pradesh, stray cattle are turning into a source of huge loss: the animals raid fields in large numbers, trample on the crops and devour whatever they find. Hoof marks in his field indicate that some damage has already been done. They ate up all the mustard I had sown. I had to sow them again.

Last week, angry villagers in Firozabad and Aligarh even locked up stray cattle in government schools to draw the States attention.Both men and women have been forced to defend their fields with lathis or stay up on machan for vigil at night.Rohit Rawat, who lives in Mohanlalganjs Hulas Khera, known for its archaeological site, confesses that his family released a bullock in the open last year owing to financial burden. We could not feed it, what else, he says.Farmers say the local cattle market at Mau has seen a fall in the sale of non-milking cows and bullocks as they have no takers. Its a good thing cow slaughter came to a halt, but so did the market, said Vijay Rawat in Jabaroli.A few kilometres away, among the vegetable sellers squatting at a local bazaar, is Radhe Mohan.Radhe Mohan, an OBC Kashyap, whose family grew potatoes and green vegetables on their 10 biswa land every year, did not dare grow the crops this season.",MUSTARD OIL

Prasad said the FSSAI recognised several oils for cooking purpose and a majority of these oils required refining. Because the oil obtained either from expellers or solvent extraction plant would contain some impurities which adversely affect the safety, flavour, odour and appearance of oil, they are required to be removed for making the oil edible and for ensuring long shelf life. He was speaking at a seminar on Edible Oils  Myths and Facts organised by Indian Consumer Federation attended by scientists, nutritionists and the industry body Solvent Extractors Association and consumers here on Tuesday. Some of the oils like groundnut oil, sesame, coconut oil, mustard oil and safflower oil, which were extracted using expelling technique could be consumed without refining. However in some cases these oils were also affected by aflatoxin during harvesting. Thus it was advisable to refine these oils before consumption.Several oils like sunflower, palm, soyabean, cottonseed and rice bran, among others, were required to be sold only as refined oils as these oils were produced by solvent extraction process and they may contain solvent residues. The refining process was done as per the guidelines issued by FSSAI and most of the nutritional components were retained during refining, he said.Former director of National Institute of Nutrition Kalpagam Polasa said as per ICMR dietary guidelines the total dietary fat intake was 30% of total energy intake per day. This 30% of the total daily energy intake should come from dietary sources of oils and fats. If an individual consumed 2,000 Kcal of energy per day, then 30% or 600 Kcal (equal to 65 grams) should come from total fat (visible plus invisible intake). So 30 g of visible oils was necessary to be consumed per day. On which cooking oil is good, she said each cooking oil had its own merits and demerits. If some oils like coconut oil have saturated fatty acids more, that could be easily metabolised, others have mono unsaturated fatty acids that help lowering LDL cholesterol. Thus a combination of oils could be selected and consumed to get required proportion of all kinds of fatty acids. However, it was safe to buy packed edible oils as loose oils could be adulterated.It is safe to buy packed edible oils as loose oils could be adulterated.Kalpagam Polasa,Former director of National Institute of Nutrition.",MUSTARD OIL

What Mr. Modi could not do in four and a half years, we did in two days, he said.PM plays on back footMr. Gandhi said the Congress would waive farmers debts in all States if elected to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Accusing Mr. Modi of not doing enough for the farmers, he said while the Prime Minister plays on the back foot, the youths of the country should play on front foot and hit a sixer.The farmers rally was the first public meeting of the Congress after coming to power in Rajasthan, ostensibly aimed at cultivating the agrarian community as voters for the Lok Sabha election. Mr. Gandhi said though the farm loan waiver would provide relief to farmers, a new Green Revolution was needed in the country to address the issue of agrarian distress.The Congress president continued his attack on the NDA government and Mr. Modi over the Rafale jet deal, alleging that the chowkidar (watchman) ran away from the debate on the issue in the Lok Sabha. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke [in the House] for two and a half hours, but we exposed each and every lie of the government.Mr. Gandhi said the Congress stand on an inquiry and a Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Rafale deal had been vindicated after the reinstatement of Central Bureau of Investigation Director Alok Verma, who was removed at midnight.Stole nations moneyRaising the issues of demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax, Mr. Gandhi said the NDA government had destroyed small and medium businesses through these decisions. Mr. Modi stole the nation's money and gave it to [industrialist] Anil Ambani. How much money did he give to the youths, farmers and small shopkeepers? he asked.The rally, attended by farmers and Congress workers from Jaipur and Ajmer divisions and other districts, was utilised for announcement of second round of sops for farmers. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot announced that his government would not increase electricity tariff for farmers during the next five years and promised to release one lakh agricultural power connections by June this year.Farmers CommissionMr. Gehlot also announced the appointment of Farmers Commission and said the State government would help set up food processing units on agricultural land in villages without the need for land conversion for plots measuring up to 10 hectares and provide loans for these units.He also assured the farmers that they would get minimum support prices for mustard and gram.Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and AICC general secretary Avinash Pande also addressed the rally.",MUSTARD OIL

38029,I am living my dream right now: Masterchef Australia winner Sashi Cheliah,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/i-am-living-my-dream-right-now-masterchef-australia-winner-sashi-cheliah/cid/1681360,2019-01-11,"Cooking was always a dream for Sashi Cheliah, a dream that saw him give up a job as a cop, pursue his passion and ultimately win the title of MasterChef Australia 2018. Since the win, the Indian-origin chef, born in Singapore, has become a famous face, travelling the world and showcasing his culinary skills at pop-up restaurants.Over the last few weeks, Sashi, 40, has been traversing the length and breadth of India on a private visit. Last weekend, Calcutta was Sashis third stop after Delhi and Mumbai. Over 30 minutes, t2 chatted with Sashi at Souk in Taj Bengal, on his India trip, his MasterChef Australia journey and his food dream.Priyanka Roy: Welcome to India! How has it been so far? Sashi Cheliah: I started with Delhi on December 29. I spent three days there and then four days in Mumbai. It will be two days in Calcutta and then I move on to the other parts of the country.Priyanka Roy: You must be sampling the local cuisine wherever you are travelling? Sashi Cheliah: Oh my God not sampling, I am indulging! (Laughs) Ive been to a couple of restaurants in Delhi and Mumbai and when they know theres a chef in the house, then these guys will go all out to feed you a lot! I tried out the Darbar Special Biryani in Delhi. It was a very different kind of biryani, they used a lot of cloves, and I really liked it. Mumbai is a food paradise. I went to two of the best restaurants there  Bombay Canteen and Bastian  and I really enjoyed the food. These guys are experimenting a lot with Indian cuisine and taking it to the next level. I found the food at Bastian very close to what I grew up eating  very southeast Asian. The food culture in Mumbai has picked up a lot. Delhi is still very traditional, but the variety is huge. I had vada pav in Mumbai and pani puri in Delhi. I think I must have gained three-four kilos in this last week! Food is the main reason I am in India, but I am also doing the touristy things. I am here with my wife and we visited the Taj Mahal. We have gone to a lot of forts and museums. And also done a lot of shopping in Mumbai.Priyanka Roy: What made you pick Calcutta as a pit stop? Sashi Cheliah: I am always interested in exploring different kinds of cuisines, both in terms of eating and also with an eye on how I can use them to enhance my skills as a chef. I had never been to Calcutta before but many people told me that if I was looking at exploring food destinations in India, then Calcutta had to be on my list, primarily because of the fact that the food here is very unique compared to other parts of India. I had a typical Bengali lunch today at Sonargaon (at Taj Bengal) and it blew me away. I dont think there was even one dish I didnt try. I am not very good with Bengali names (smiles), but I can tell you that two dishes particularly appealed to me. One was the mustard fish wrapped in banana leaf (Bhetki Paturi) and the other was a dish of mixed vegetables (Palong Shaaker Chorchori). I think that alone I can have with rice every day for the rest of my life! (Laughs)Priyanka Roy: Though you won the MasterChef Australia title in July last year, India watched you lift the trophy in end-December. Now that you are travelling here, are people recognising you? Sashi Cheliah: Yes, in Australia I am an old story now! (Laughs) But I have a good fan base in Australia and even now when I do pop-ups there, they come and support me. I am still enjoying the euphoria surrounding MasterChef. This India trip was planned way before MasterChef Australia. Its something my wife and I had wanted to do for a very long time and we had no idea the finale would play out in India when we would be here. I was in Mumbai when the finale was aired. I never thought that people would recognise me here, but the day before the finale I was at Oberoi Mall there and as usual I was looking for food at the food court, and I got mobbed! (Laughs) It took one person to recognise me and then it became a crowd. But it wasnt like it is for Bollywood celebrities, it was a small group (smiles), and they were very respectful of the fact that I was on a private visit. I clicked a few pictures, signed some autographs.Priyanka Roy: Before you came here, did you have any idea that MasterChef Australia is so big in India? Sashi Cheliah: Before the competition, I didnt know it was big here. When I was on the show, I started getting an idea of how big it was not only in India and Australia, but worldwide. It shows in many countries and the viewership is huge. India obviously counts as one of the major followers of MasterChef Australia.Priyanka Roy: Do you remember what was going through your mind when your name was called out as the MasterChef Australia 2018 winner? Sashi Cheliah: That moment is like a classic movie for me I can watch it over and over again and still have the emotion (smiles). I get goosebumps every time I watch it. When my name was called out, I just felt numb for a moment and then sheer joy took over. I think what worked for me was that what you saw on TV was me, I am like that every day of my life, there was no pretence. A lot of people ask me that now when I go back and watch episodes of myself, am I critical? I dont think I am; the critical ones are my kids (aged 12 and 10), they really mock me all the time. (Laughs) They are critical of my accent and my English is not that polished; they feel they speak much better English than I do. They now rewatch MasterChef and tell me, Papa, you could have said this better, you should have spoken like this. I am like, What to do? Its totally unscripted. But they are also incredibly proud of me. The boys are very close to me and they kept me motivated throughout MasterChef. On the finale day, my wife, kids and mum were on the show and that was my biggest strength. While I was cooking the final dish, I kept telling myself, My kids are here. I am a role model for them and I shouldnt falter at this stage. That helped me pull through.Sashi with his sons aged 10 and 12 B. HalderPriyanka Roy: Do they have an interest in cooking? Sashi Cheliah: Oh, both of them cook very well. My younger one has a thing for savouries and the elder one makes some really good pastries. When I was in law enforcement, one wanted to be a police officer and the other an engineer. Now my whole career has changed and their interest has also moved towards food. I am supportive of whatever they want to do in life.Sashi with the MasterChef Australia trophyPriyanka Roy: What would you count as your top three moments on MasterChef Australia? Sashi Cheliah: The first would be the one when I got my apron for the first time after I was selected in the auditions. Then I would pick the moment when Gordon (Ramsay) walked into the kitchen; I loved working with him. And then was the history-making moment when I got my second Immunity Pin (a lifeline of sorts that the recipient can use at any time during the competition to save themselves from elimination).Priyanka Roy: Have you made friends for life on MasterChef Australia? Sashi Cheliah: For sure! MasterChef is like a family. On the show, we were constantly helping each other, giving advice. We would constantly sample each others cooking, critique them, and that is how a lot of us would improve. We really worked together as a team. We would shoot Monday to Friday and weekends would generally be off. On weekends, we would practise a lot, do a lot of reading on food. The kitchen wouldnt be available to us throughout the day and so we would cook in slots. We would share recipes and ideas. I am in touch with Ben (Borsht), Jess (Liemantara), Khanh (Ong), Reece (Highnell), Loki (Madireddi). All the three judges (Gary Mehigan, George Calombaris and Matt Preston) were a huge support. I would constantly be tapping on their shoulders and asking for tips and advice. The knowledge they have is huge. All three of them would point out mistakes, give advice, tell us how to improve. I really enjoyed that bit because its free advice from the best in the business! (Laughs)Priyanka Roy: What was it like having Saransh Goila and his famous Butter Chicken on the show this time? Sashi Cheliah: (Smiles) Everyone on MasterChef Australia knew that I wasnt the greatest fan of Butter Chicken. On the day Saransh made his Butter Chicken on the show, I wasnt competing, I was up in the gantry. The following day, I tried cooking his recipe at home and I must tell you its the best Butter Chicken in the world! Its so, so good! He has taken Butter Chicken to the next level. And Ive not seen anyone make Rumaali bread like him with bananas in it and so moist. Its so soft that even if you leave it out for hours, it wont get dry.Priyanka Roy: Whats the status of the restaurant you plan to set up? Sashi Cheliah: I have already started a company called MRS Gaja. Gaja by Sashi is a pop-up restaurant under that company that has successfully been going on for the last four months; weve had pop-ups in two locations. I plan to start my restaurant called Gaja this year. Hopefully, I will find some time after this trip to get the ball rolling. I have the concept ready, but I need to look for a location in Adelaide. I need to do some recipe tasting, some wine pairings. I am not rushing into it, but I will make sure I do it well. In the short-term, I am keeping things fluid. Since winning MasterChef, I have got a lot of offers. I am trying out whatever I like. I am just going with the flow right now and enjoying the little bit of fame Ive got! (Laughs) I am living my dream right now. A few weeks ago, I did a pop-up at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) during the Test match between India and Australia. They had an Indian Summer Festival to coincide with the Test series and mine was one of the four restaurants invited. The theme was to do Indian food with an Aussie touch.Priyanka Roy: Are you a cricket fan? Sashi Cheliah: I grew up in Singapore, so I am not crazy about cricket. I am more of a soccer guy. I regularly watch the Premier League. But when I shifted to Australia six years ago, I started taking interest in cricket. Now I understand it.With Gordon Ramsay on the showPriyanka Roy: As a kid, what was the first thing you cooked? Sashi Cheliah: Barbecue. I started my cooking in school. I did watch my mum and aunts cook at home, but I wasnt allowed to touch anything. In school, it was different. I was allowed to experiment and whenever we had school picnics, you would find me doing the chicken, the lamb. The interesting story is that I met my wife during one such barbecue (smiles).Priyanka Roy: Was it the cooking that impressed her? Sashi Cheliah: Oh yes, my barbecue skills worked for me! (Laughs)Priyanka Roy: Growing up, who were your food idols? Sashi Cheliah: In the 80s, there was a chef called Yan on a TV show called Yan Can Cook. He was my childhood favourite. The way he presented the show, the way he mashed garlic with his chopper was very dramatic and entertaining. He made it look so simple. Then later, it was Jamie Oliver. I enjoy watching him. He puts in a hundred ingredients, but makes very simple dishes, and I liked that. As I got serious about cooking, Gordon Ramsay became my idol. Thats mostly because of his attitude, he doesnt take anything lightly. Hes 100 per cent committed to what he does and I like that attribute in people.",MUSTARD OIL

He had invited the college football national champions Clemson Tigers home for a chow-down, when it was discovered that the worlds most powerful kitchen was closed for lack of funds. No problem. Trump, long-time supporter of McDonalds and Burger King, ordered in hundreds of burgers and a tidal wave of fries.AdvertisingRoughly speaking, it was the equivalent of Ram Nath Kovind inviting a cricket team home and serving chhole bhature, but Trump pulled it off. He said that he was serving the college kids favourite food, and all of it was guaranteed American. No Chinese stir-fry hanky-panky in here, and not a blini in sight either. The meal was served at a candle-lit table littered with mustard servings. Thats another achievement, a sign that NATO should not misunderestimate Trump (pardon the Bushism), even if he made a hash of their dinner meet earlier this year over the trivial issue of Germany buying Russian gas. Trump is clearly the kind of tough guy that global security needs on board, since McDonalds worldwide are notoriously miserly about their mustard and require to be hammer-locked onto the counter before they will surrender a drop.But the bottomline is that the government shutdown has come home to roost, and the time when Trump could pass it off as a result of the intransigence of the Opposition is past. Even if Trump is enjoying serving his favourite food, the end is near. Now, its the kitchen staff who have been sent on leave.

38031,Are our police equipped for today's challenges?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/are-our-police-equipped-for-the-challenges-of-investigating-crime-in-the-21st-century/cid/1681765,2019-01-15,"A detective with the pertinent skill set will know everything, from what physical and forensic evidence to secure at the fresh crime scene to the integrity of witness and victim statements, so that, at the trial, the defence does not shred them iStockThe unrest erupting within the Central Bureau of Investigation is yet another reminder of everything that is wrong with our law enforcement infrastructure. Attempts to modernize criminal law have failed repeatedly.A fundamental tenet of effective policing involves having specialist detectives. India does not  at the Indian Police Service, civil service, national or state levels  have any detectives. Officers of the IPS are managers, while state-level officers are the only ones empowered to investigate, which is why they are given the title of investigating officer. They are charged with investigating everything all at the same time, with each officer having a national average of several hundred cases at any given time.The management structure of state and city policing units is also strange. Branches have peculiar remits, such as political activities, over-priced rice and diluted mustard oil. The fairly new Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 was enacted, but there are not enough investigators who are trained to deal with such crimes. Thus, at the cost of science-based detection, the burden has fallen, yet again, on the investigating officer and his network of paid spies.At the state level, a very simple structure is required to rein in crime: a uniform side for operational street policing  with detectives being called in to take over probes pertaining to their department and talent base  and forensics. A low-ranking sergeant with decades of experience is as valuable as his detective counterpart. A detective with the pertinent skill set will know everything, from what physical and forensic evidence to secure at the fresh crime scene to the integrity of witness and victim statements, so that, at the trial, the defence does not shred them. With any finely-tuned investigation, the who, what, when, where, why and how question will set a bloodhound on the right path. Further, depending on the crime and its degree, the evidentiary standard required to secure a conviction that matches both the crime and its severity is dependent on a specialist.The law also needs to be as detailed with regard to evidential standards. First, it is important to understand the degree of the crime committed. Next comes the evidence required to prove that degree. Finally, the integrity of the evidence must withstand the defences attack. Nuances must not be allowed to escape. The intent to commit a crime is much more difficult to prove, but just as important as a committed crime. Someone who planned to do harm has the wherewithal to launch a fresh, and probably more successful, second attempt. A case in point is domestic violence, which always has an escalating and predictable behavioural path. If police intervention is quick and documents the past, escalation in the future can be avoided. This is the principle behind Scotland Yards groundbreaking Homicide Prevention Unit.Many Western police services work closely with health services too. Health professionals are likely to see signs of abuse, be it mental or physical, before the police are informed. For sex crimes, victims are taken to a haven: a nondescript medical centre with adequate facilities to treat the victims immediate health needs as well as staff trained to think like police. The nurses will collect nail cuttings, swabs from wounds, hair, blood and other potential DNA evidence. Staff at a regular hospital will not be as alert, nor have the facilities to support a criminal investigation, nor provide the required emotional and mental support.It will be a mistake to think specialist detectives are limited to bloody crimes. In an age of technology, we also need detectives who can go through laptops, volumes of financial accounts or social media usage trends and history. With crimes, criminals and evidence collection becoming more complex, the time for detectives trained to investigate one particular crime has long passed. Deep reflection is required of our police. It must be asked  are they fit for purpose?",MUSTARD OIL

Scientists from Chongqing University -- who designed the ""mini lunar biosphere"" experiment -- sent an 18-centimetre (seven-inch) bucket-like container holding air, water and soil.Inside are cotton, potato, and arabidopsis seeds -- a plant of the mustard family -- as well as fruit fly eggs and yeast.Images sent back by the probe show a cotton sprout has grown well, but so far none of the other plants has taken, the university said.Chang'e-4 is also equipped with instruments developed by scientists from Sweden, Germany and China to study the lunar environment, cosmic radiation and the interaction between solar wind and the moon's surface.The lander released a rover, dubbed Yutu-2 (Jade Rabbit), that will perform experiments in the Von Karman Crater.The agency said four more lunar missions are planned, confirming the launch of a probe by the end of the year to bring back samples from the moon.China wants to establish a lunar research base one day, possibly using 3D printing technology to build facilities, the Chinese space agency said Monday.",MUSTARD OIL

A group of cops from Amber police station along with deputy commissioner of police (Jaipur North) reached the area and cordoned it off for investigation DCP Vikas Sharma told TOI that prima facie the investigation indicated that the child was raped before she was murdered.She must have been strangulated, say policeJaipur: Her parents are migrant workers; they said their daughter was missing since Monday afternoon. However, they did not inform the city police about her missing, he said.The police got to know about the incident only after her body was found dumped in a bush. They suspect she died of asphyxiation. She must have been strangulated, but we can only confirm the real cause once post-mortem report (PMR) is submitted by the doctors, Sharma said, adding that prime facie evidence indicates she was raped.Sources in Jaipur police said the particular secluded stretch between Chainpura to Jamwa Ramgarh is crowded by vagrants at night. She was abducted from her makeshift house by the accused and taken somewhere near the crime spot where she was raped. In all likelihood, she was murdered not far from bushes and dumped here in hurry, an official investigating the crime told TOI.Drifters and workers of nearby factories are under the scanner of the police.

When he finally reaches the fields bright yellow with mustard bloom, he could well break into a song whose lyrics could be: Dont worry, bee happy. You see, Rana isnt at the village to check on the mustard crop, but to make sure his bees are doing well. The 40-year-old, like some others in the village, is a new-born apiarist  and looking at a better tomorrow, having extracted over 1,000 kg of honey in the past two months.Qutubgarh was only lately adopted by the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and in November 2018, along with BJP Lok Sabha member Meenakshi Lekhi , who too has adopted the village, it organised a programme aimed at making the village the capitals honey pot . With a gift of 100 bee-boxes , KVIC hoped the farmers would have an additional income.No one, however, quite foresaw another huge benefit of the honey chase. As Umed Singh Rana, a 79-year-old farmer on whose land most of the hives are sited, marvels, I have been farming for decades now, but never have I seen mustard of such high quality at this time of the year. By the time it ripens in March, the crop yield should be 30-40% bigger and of very good quality too. We have noticed the flowers are bigger, and this has happened only after the bees were introduced.The old farmers son, Dinesh, is already an expert now having received training in handling bees in November last year. He has quickly learnt that bees fly in a radius of 2-3 km, extracting nectar and come back to their hives, each of which is home to around 10,000 bees. Ive suffered 60 stings since I started, he grins. Initially, we were hesitant and nervous about the bees, but now we can tell exactly what needs to be done in each box and what each colony requires.The initial 100 boxes have increased to 125 because the bees have been reproducing with alacrity in each box. Dinesh explains that when a box is full, hundreds of the buzzing insects are either swarmed to a new box or a shallow super is added to create a new floor in the box. Each hives produces a full yield every 15 days, and apiarists start keeping any eye on the boxes from day 12 of the cycle.When the bees have sealed the honey in the waxy lattice in the box, the bees are gently smoked away. Each frame of honeycomb is put in a centrifuge machine, which produces a grainy, whitish substance not unlike buffalo ghee in appearance. The villages call this cream honey. It tastes wonderful, but has a short shelf life. So we process it to get the more familiar amber liquid, which last longer in the bottles, explains Dinesh.The villagers were initially too sceptical to come on board. But the honey and the crop yield have enthused many. The economic advantages are clear to see, remarks Chand Singh from Mungeshpur village. Youngsters now want to start gathering honey, and the demand for bee-boxes is increasing by the day.Padam Singh Tomar, another Qutubgarh local, is happy that the fresh honey is finding takers, mostly in nearby villages. Since November, the village has produced two yields of over 500 kg each. Vinai Kumar Saxena, chairman, KVIC, points out, Honey derived from different flowers has a distinct and unique quality. This particular honey is produced solely from mustard nectar, but the locals will also try their hand at other varieties. With the mustard season coming to an end, the hives will, therefore, soon shift to another location, where the accent will be eucalyptus.While the local apiarists contemplate marketing their honey in a more professional manner, KVIC actually plans to buy directly from them. Each farmer can earn an additional Rs 50,000 from one box every year from the honey alone, says Saxena. We will pay them Rs 300 per kilo and process it before sending it out into the market.Saxena adds, In the next stage of their training, we will teach the villagers how to extract bee venom. This can sell for over Rs 1 crore per kg and is used abroad to create a medicine for cancer. Another source of money will be the beeswax produced in the hives, for which there is a big demand in the cosmetics industry. Bee pollen is also consumed as a supplement, while items such as honey soaps, shampoos and moisturizers, honey vinegar and apple honey cider can be produced too. Yes, Rana could well sing about not worrying, only bee-ing happy.",MUSTARD OIL

He pointed out that the UPA government had failed to implement the Swaminathan committee report on farmers and the NDA government had also ignored it. And farmers are committing suicides due to bad agriculture policies, he added. Besides implementing the recommendation on MSP, the government will also discuss other suggestions in the conference, the minister said.According to an estimate, around 30,000 farmers live in Delhi, mostly in its rural pockets. In December, the government had formed an expert committee to draft an agricultural policy and suggest measures for farmers welfare.An important issue before the committee was to suggest a separate minimum support prices (MSP)  50% more than the weighted cost of production  taking into consideration the Swaminathan report. During recent meetings, it was felt that the cost of production should be calculated keeping in view the scenario in Delhi like increased wages of labour, and cost of inputs and allied components in the local market.A committee of officers was then asked to calculate the costs of cultivation of wheat, paddy and mustard in Delhi. It is in the process of calculating the average cost of production and its report will also be taken up in the conference.The conference has been convened to arrive at a reasonable weighted cost of production and suggest a separate MSP for farmers of Delhi, said an official.

There are some residential sectors like Sector 34 and Jaitpur village near the station. We are planning to develop an underground parking facility at the station. We will discuss the issue with NMRC to develop this project soon, he said.GNIDA has acquired the land which is just behind the depot metro station. As of now, local people have grown mustard crops on the land.

It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.",POTATO
38287,Walk the walk,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/get-fit-for-that-trekking-trip/cid/1680540,2019-01-02,"Buy a good pair of hiking shoes, high at the ankle and with a firm grip. Put these on along with a long pair of socks and walk for at least half an hour daily. Its best if you can walk in a grassy field or on non-metalled roads. If you dont have access to these, walk on a padded treadmill. iStockI took up trekking well past the age of 50, so I make an effort to keep myself in shape. I stick to a healthy diet and go jogging. I also work out at the gym at least four days a week. Recently, I undertook the rather difficult trek to Sirolsar Lake near the Jalori Pass in Kullu, Himachal Pradesh. At a height of 10,800 feet, it was quite an achievement when I managed to tackle the trek without any trouble.Many of my younger teammates  some of them half my age  had a hard time negotiating the last few miles. The leader of our pack and seasoned trekking guide, Shubhasish Banerjee, was not surprised. These guys are all Internet pundits, stuffed with information off their smartphones. When we took up trekking, we blindly followed our leaders advice, he said.In the old days, seasoned trekkers would first interview all aspiring ones. They would ask: Will you be able to survive sub-zero temperatures? Are you used to walking at least five kilometres at a stretch? Is it okay if you dont get to bathe for a week? Do you smoke? The answers would scare off most, barring the really enthusiastic ones. Even some of them would lose interest after just two or three expeditions, says Banerjee.According to Banerjee, one needs to condition the body and mind before setting off on a tough trek.Get fitHow do you make sure you are physically fit for a trek? Here are some suggestions from orthopaedic surgeon Dr Kiran Kumar Mukherjee, who is also an avid trekker.If you are over 35, get yourself thoroughly checked by a doctor. Find out whether you may have problems at a high altitude and in low temperatures.If you are anaemic or obese, get these issues sorted. Otherwise, you may have breathing trouble or your knees may give up.Buy a good pair of hiking shoes, high at the ankle and with a firm grip. Put these on along with a long pair of socks and walk for at least half an hour daily. Its best if you can walk in a grassy field or on non-metalled roads. If you dont have access to these, walk on a padded treadmill. Keep increasing the speed to prepare your lungs for an arduous journey. But dont climb steps for conditioning, as this can ruin your knees. This is also the reason you should not walk on the treadmill in an inclined mode.To strengthen your quadriceps (muscles of the thigh), you need to train with special iron shoes. If you dont have a trainer, decide on the weight of your shoes after talking to an orthopaedic doctor.Try the leg curl to strengthen your hamstring muscles. Also try the tip toe exercise to make your calf muscles stronger. Do it at least 10-15 times at a stretch, three times daily.Quit smoking because it may make you breathless. Cut down on alcohol as this gives you an apparent feeling of warmth but actually lets out heat from the body.Make eating light a habit. You have to eat enough to keep you going but not too much. If you are diabetic, talk to the doctor and prepare a diet chart.Seasoned trekker Manas Ray believes that only after physical conditioning can you work out the logistical details, such as whether youll have to hire a porter, make arrangements for tents, or, whether you have to carry all your food. He says, You must be prepared for inclement weather and remember that you may not be able to abandon your journey, if you feel like it. So prepare your mind for the worst possible situation.Bag itMake a list of all the clothes, woollens and waterproof garments you need. Tick each off as you pack. You may have to miss a bath most days so carry enough toilet rolls, face tissue and sanitiser. Consult your doctor or a seasoned trekker about the medicines you need to pack. You will need a multi-chamber rucksack with properly-padded shoulder and chest straps to pack your stuff in. Make sure it does not weigh more than 15 per cent of your body weight.Trek rightEven if you are fit, youll need two-three days to get used to the high altitude, and possibly low temperature. Ideally, amateur trekkers must climb about 2,000ft per day, acclimatise and then move upwards. According to Banerjee, it is safest for amateur trekkers to not visit places where the temperature goes down below -20 Celsius and one needs to stay in a tent.While walking, buckle the pelvic strap of your rucksack tightly to prevent pain in the back or shoulders. If you are not used to walking with a heavy backpack, hire a porter.Dont hurry or walk quickly. Enjoy the beauty of your surroundings. Remember, the journey is often more fascinating than the destination. Also, hurrying can get you exhausted, which you want to avoid at all costs. When you cross a steep incline, climb steadily. You can take the help of a walking stick. If you are not too fit, avoid shortcuts  these are likely to be steep  and stick to the usual path.If you feel exhausted, theres nothing wrong in resting for a while. Do a few stretches before you start walking again to prevent muscle pulls.Eat lightAfter you ascend 8,000ft, be extra careful about what you eat and drink. Canned meat or other tinned food may cause indigestion in some people.Have a carbohydrate-rich breakfast before setting out in the morning as you will need a lot of energy through the day. Our breakfast of choice was rice with butter, boiled potatoes and eggs. Sometimes we had khichdi, bread and boiled eggs.Make sure you stay hydrated. Drink at least three litres of fluid, including warm water, soup, tea, instant soupy noodles and, occasionally, oral rehydration solution. This will help keep exhaustion and muscle pull at bay.To keep yourself energised, munch on high-calorie food  dates, almonds, nuts and chocolate.Its better to avoid consuming alcohol on treks. But in case of freezing temperatures, you can have a peg or two of brandy. Exceeding two pegs is dangerous as it can lead to dehydration and related problems.Try to go to bed early. You may initially have problems falling asleep at high altitudes but it will get better as you get acclimatised.Have a great trip.",POTATO

Bedi, is expected to file his response to an objection raised by the Gujarat government that he had unilaterally prepared the final report on 21 police encounters which occurred in the State between 2003 and 2006 when Mr. Narendra Modi was Chief Minister.The State government had submitted before a Bench led by Chief Justice Gogoi that Justice Bedi did not share the views of the other members of the apex court-appointed monitoring authority before submitting the final and 11th report on the police encounters in the Supreme Court on January 26, 2018.Rumblings in CBIThe Bench led by Chief Justice Gogoi is also expected to pronounce its decision in a petition filed by exiled CBI Director Alok Verma, who has challenged his overnight divestment from the top post at the countrys premier investigative agency. Mr. Verma has alleged political interference in the functioning of the CBI.Meanwhile, the government may seek an early hearing of its eight-page correction application in which it has blamed the Supreme Court for misinterpreting the English tenses in its December 14 judgment which said that the CAG has prepared a report on the 36 Rafale jets deal, which has already been examined by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee.Activists murdersThe first week of January would also see the CBI come back to the Supreme Court Bench, led by Justice U.U. Lalit, with its response to the courts suggestion to have a single investigative agency probe the murders of journalist Gauri Lankesh, activists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare and littrateur M.M. Kalburgi.The court had flagged the possibility of a common thread running through the four killings, which which had sent shock waves across the nation and were considered in some quarters as part of a concerted effort to silence dissenting voices.The first month of the year may also see the Supreme Court Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, begin its hearing of appeals filed by the CBI and accused persons in the SNC Lavalin corruption case. The CBI has contended that Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should face trial in the corruption case.",POTATO

Cold weather is not good for the vegetables like potato and carrot, while garlic and green peas can withstand it.The punishing climate mostly felt on hill-top regions, including major villages like Kookal, Pambarpuram, Observatory, Kavunjii, Mannavanur and Poondi. I am seeing a colour change in my garlic crops. If the climate remains for a few more days, the crop can withstand. We have started sprinkling water on them to save the crop, said K Vivek a farmer, from Mannavanur.Kodaikanal resident M Michael said he has changed their daily routines a bit to adjust to the cooler weather. People avoid outing mostly after 7 pm as the weather becomes unbearable. Similarly, people wake up a couple of hours later. We start our days only by 10 am due to cold season. We avoid visiting marshlands where the frost and chillness is felt more, he said.

Jakhar has even forgotten that the poster boy of the promised farm loan waiver scheme, Budh Singh, belongs to his constituency, Gurdaspur, which he represents in Parliament. Did Jakhar even ask chief minister Amarinder Singh why Budh Singhs loan was not waived as promised. This itself shows that Jakhar has no interest in raising a voice for the people and is simply indulging in sycophancy of the Gandhi family to save his post, he said.Sukhbir said nearly 600 farmers committed suicide in Punjab in the last two years, but the state government was least bothered.Jakhar along with other Congress MPs on Friday sold potatoes outside Parliament House in Delhi and claimed that Punjab had waived loans of Rs 3,445 crore of 4.17 lakh farmers.",POTATO

ShutterstockDark designsIf you are a Tim Burton fan, you are in for a treat. For the first time, there is an exhibition in Las Vegas at the Neon Museum to view the artists work up close. Burton brought us films like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks! and The Nightmare Before Christmas. The exhibition will run for four months and include original art pieces, dark set designs and massive installations from his film sets.Before this, Burtons art and the memorabilia from his films found their way through metropolitan museums from 2009 to 2013, ending up in often sold-out runs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and Pariss Cinmathque, among others. But in the Las Vegas exhibition, pieces will be spread across the iconic museums campus: the outdoor exhibition space, its adjacent North Gallery and the visitors centre.The Neon Museum is quite different from previous exhibition spaces for Burtons work. The massive neon signs outside it certainly complement the art. This exhibition will be a collaborative showing that features site-specific staging. To say were flattered that Mr Burton has chosen our museum for this exhibition would be an understatement, the Neon Museums president, Rob McCoy, said in a press statement. But when you think about it, Tim is one of the few artists who can match the great imagination of Las Vegas.Quality controlWhen you think of good food, you may not think of airlines food. However, recently people have been taking pleasure in critiquing, ranking, and even hating airplane food on social media. Brian Kelly, the founder of The Points Guy, indulged in this pastime recently by posting a photo of a rather unappetizing plate of pasta served to him on an American Airlines first-class ticket. He invited his followers to caption the photo, which led to some caustic remarks that probably would cause a public relations nightmare.Kelly is not the only one calling out airlines for their soggy food.Popular Instagram accounts such as @inflightFeed and @airplanefoodselfie feature frequent flierss meals as a form of culinary entertainment. The latter account crowdsources photos and then invites followers to rank each offering on a scale of one to 10. It includes the flight number and route to make clear where the dining experience  whether it was great or terrible  happened.But the critics are not limited to dedicated accounts only. A Malaysian chef took to Instagram to lash out at AirAsia, the Malaysian low-cost airline, for allegedly serving poor quality sambal tumis (stir-fried chilli paste) with nasi lemak in its Premium Lounge. He also uploaded another video of a sambal prawn dish which he whipped up himself, describing it as nice and thick, and said it does not look like the AirAsia premium nasi lemak sambal.Steep dropNew Year is famously about the drop of the crystal ball in NYC. But this year there has been a lot more of things dropping in different states around the country. In Key West, Florida, the city rings in the new year with a high-heeled shoe dropping from the balcony of a popular Duval Street bar. Mt Olive, North Carolina drops a pickle every single year, but not at midnight. They drop it at 7 pm Eastern Standard Time because that is midnight on Greenwich Mean Time. In Georgia, a giant peach  the states official fruit  drops in the middle of fireworks. The rain in Atlanta did not stop thousands from turning up to watch.Bethlehem, Pennsylvania drops a 400-pound illuminated Peep (the popular branded yellow marshmallow candy) each year. They do this because Peepss parent company, Just Born, is headquartered in the town. Mobile, Alabama drops the marshmallow-stuffed moonpie every year. But it is electronic and weighs nearly 600 pounds. Boise, Idaho drops a giant, glowing potato, now in its sixth year. Viewers can watch the famous 17-feet, 800-pound GlowTato drop right in front of Idahos capitol building each year.FootnoteNew Year means it is time for resolutions.

The thorny plants make the process arduous; he has already suffered cuts and scratches. But if he wants to protect his valuable crops, there is little choice. He cannot afford a wired fence.For farmers like Vijay Rawat in Uttar Pradesh, stray cattle are turning into a source of huge loss: the animals raid fields in large numbers, trample on the crops and devour whatever they find. Hoof marks in his field indicate that some damage has already been done. They ate up all the mustard I had sown. I had to sow them again. Now, if I dont put up the fence, there will be no wheat to even consume [for his seven-member family], he said, as he worked on the fence.Issues ultimatumA Dalit, Vijay Rawat lives in Jabaroli village in the Mohanlalganj Lok Sabha (reserved) constituency, rural Lucknow.He blames the Yogi Adityanath government for the menace and even issues an ultimatum. Make some arrangement soon or I will not vote for the BJP in 2019, said Mr. Vijay, who voted for the party in 2014 and 2017.Farmers, cutting across political lines and castes, claim the menace of stray cattle got worse after March 2017 when Yogi Adityanath came to power, owing to the fear of vigilante groups (who disrupt cattle transport), collapse of local cattle markets and fairs, fall in the value of non-milking cows and bullocks and campaign against illegal slaughterhouses. Last week, angry villagers in Firozabad and Aligarh even locked up stray cattle in government schools to draw the States attention.Both men and women have been forced to defend their fields with lathis or stay up on machan for vigil at night.Rohit Rawat, who lives in Mohanlalganjs Hulas Khera, known for its archaeological site, confesses that his family released a bullock in the open last year owing to financial burden. We could not feed it, what else, he says.Farmers say the local cattle market at Mau has seen a fall in the sale of non-milking cows and bullocks as they have no takers. Its a good thing cow slaughter came to a halt, but so did the market, said Vijay Rawat in Jabaroli.A few kilometres away, among the vegetable sellers squatting at a local bazaar, is Radhe Mohan.Radhe Mohan, an OBC Kashyap, whose family grew potatoes and green vegetables on their 10 biswa land every year, did not dare grow the crops this season.",POTATO

The animals come and destroy everything, he rued. Fear of police action, vigilante groups and religious beliefs prevent him from using force against the raiding cattle, he said.Tapping the angerSamajwadi Party leader R.K. Chaudhary, who was runner-up from Mohanlalganj in 2014, is trying to capitalise on the anger brewing among farmers. On December 27, he tried to lead a group of aggrieved farmers and around 700 stray cattle to the tehsil headquarters as protest, even leading to a lathi-charge. If the problem of stray cattle was not resolved within a month, Mr. Chaudhary said he would bring one lakh stray cattle from across U.P. to 5, Kalidas Marg, the official residence of the Chief Minister in Lucknow. We will hand them over to Yogi, you take care of your animals, said Mr. Chaudhary.In Hulas Khera, Gyan Chand Dikshit, a Brahmin farmer whose four-bigha field was heavily damaged by stray cattle, says: In the eyes of the farmer, the Yogi government has fallen. He expects stray cattle issue to be a factor in the 2019 election. Whichever government comes will have to find a solution because at this rate people will be dying of starvation, said Gyan Chand.Alarmed by the reports of aggrieved farmers and protests, the Yogi Adityanath government was pressed to make several announcements over the last couple of weeks to tackle stray cattle, including an ultimatum to all district magistrates to lock up the cattle in cow conservation centres by January 10. The State Cabinet also decided to levy additional cess on excise items to fund temporary cow shelters in both urban and rural areas.Mr. Adityanath also ordered officials to identify and take action against those who abandon their animals or tie them up in government buildings, calling them anti-social elements.Listing the reasons for the menace, Cabinet Minister for Animal Husbandry S.P Singh Baghel said the male calf had been rendered useless and valueless owing to mechanisation of farming, crushing and transportation. U.P. is a State of small and minor farmers, with two crop seasons of rabi and kharif. For 15 days of ploughing, a farmer no longer wants to feed two bullocks all year round, said Mr. Baghel.The immediate cause for the menace, he said, was that the Adityanath government had strictly implemented the cow slaughter prevention law. Cow slaughter is as important to us as homicide. Now you can estimate [by the number of stray cows] how much illegal slaughter was taking place under the previous governments, said the Minister.To regulate the population of the male calf in the long-run, the government has started a sex-sorted scheme under which the chances of a cow producing a female calf would be as high as 90-95%. After the successful experiment in Barabanki, Etawah and Lakhimpur Kheri districts, the scheme is set to be launched in all 75 districts.",POTATO

Farmers have been asked to take away their produce within the next week. Farmers are not interested in taking away their produce due to prevailing low market rates. They are not even able to retain their investments. The government has failed to take cognizance of the matter. Sudarshan Agarwal, president of the Cold Storage Association of Agra said, Machines at the cold storages have been stopped.

Sources in the party said Rajya Sabha MP P L Punia, the partys well-known Dalit face and also architect of the Chhattisgarh win, has already been frequenting Lucknow for drawing-room talks with SP renegade Shivpal Yadav, after he floated an outfit, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) two months ago.Besides, with nearly 50 former MLAs, MPs, MLCs in Shivpals fold, Sharda Pratap Shukla, Shadab Fatima, Kamal Yusuf Malik, Jai Prakash Yadav, Shivpal is threatening to become a potent force in UP.This will shoulder our burden when seats are to be divided as the bulk can be taken care by Shivpal, while we can put our thrust on big candidates, said a senior Congress leader.There are already murmurs that SP rebels Amarmani Tripathi and Vijay Yadav who fought as independents may join him as well.Partys senior leader in west UP, Imran Masood, too has been tasked to camp in Dalit-majority areas in Saharanpur , Meerut, Bulandshahr and hammer out a poll pact with SC activist Chandrasekhar Azad, who was released by the BJP government three months ago.Azad, though has expressed reluctance to contest, but with his ongoing tours across India, he has been a social media sensation.

She dared the State government to reveal the population of each caste under the OBC in U.P.Her statement came with reference to the silence maintained by the Adityanath government over the report submitted by a four-member Social Justice Committee formed to review the situation of different castes under OBC.If the U.P. government has not done any such study [caste census], then on what basis is the SJC carrying out the sub-categorisation? You cannot snatch ones share and give it to another, Ms. Patel said, accusing the State government of injustice towards the OBCs. The Apna Dal (S) is based on Kurmi (an OBC caste) support.The BJPs other ally, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, issued a 100-day ultimatum to Mr. Adityanath to implement the sub-categorisation, or else it would consider separation from the National Democratic Alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Om Prakash Rajbhar, SBSP president and Cabinet Minister in the Adityanath government, has threatened to contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the State alone.Report complicationsThe SJC report, which was seen as a move to mobilise the most-backward castes against the dominant Yadavs, commonly associated with the Samajwadi Party, led to complications when it tagged the Yadavs in the same category as the Kurmis and Jats, two communities the BJP does not want to politically antagonise.While the report has still not been made public or tabled in the Assembly despite being sent to the government in October, a leaked copy of it suggests the panel has recommended a split of the 27% OBC quota into three categories.The panel headed by retired Allahabad High Court judge Raghavendra Kumar has listed 79 sub-castes under the OBC category. Of these, nine fall under Backward Class, 37 under More Backward and 33 under Most Backward categories.Listed under the Backward Class  those who will be restricted to 7% quota  are castes like Yadav, Kurmi and Jat. The panel says that these castes are socially, economically and culturally strong and have been recruited in government jobs more than the ratio of their population, while also enjoying political representation.",POTATO

In his post, hours before Rahul himself addressed a rally in Jaipur, the Congress chief reminded the PM how Agra farmer Pradeep Sharma had to sell his potato crop in distress after toiling hard for six months to grow it.Pradeep Sharma got only `490 for 19,000 kg potatoes. Modiji is coming to Agra today. Do you think he will talk about the woes of farmers like Pradeep or will he once again resort to false promises?, Rahul asked in the post.The post was aimed at picking holes in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)s claims that it is sensitive to the plight of farmers, an issue Rahul never fails to flag in his rallies and has identified as one of the planks for the 2019 poll campaign.Later, while speaking at the rally, Rahul hit out at the PM claiming that he was avoiding a debate on the Rafale fighter jet deal.You must have seen that the 56 inch-chested PM did not come to the Lok Sabha for even one minute. Defence Minister Nirmala sitharaman spoke for about two-and-a-half hours, and we dismantled all her arguments. But Modi did not show his face... said RahulKeeping up his attack, Rahul said, The president of France told me in the conversation that Modi had asked Ambani to give a contract. But, the 56-inch chest watchman ran away from the public court. He tells a woman, Sitharamanji, to protect him, added Rahul.With the Lok Sabha elections turning the corner, the Congress is going all out to drum up support. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won all 25 seats in Rajasthan hower the latest Assembly elections tilted in the Congress favour.",POTATO

The produce is currently selling for Rs. 60 a kg in the retail market, up from Rs. 25 a kg barely two days ago. The sudden surge in price has been attributed to a severe shortage due to crop failure in both Karnataka and Maharashtra.The tomato growing areas  Kolar-Chikkaballapur  are reeling under drought and, hence, the yield has been severely hit.Crop failureUsually at this time of the year, tomatoes come to Bengaluru's market from Nasik in Maharashtra. But the crop has completely failed in Maharashtra due to drought and a rain deficit, said a senior HOPCOMS official.Most of the farmers have not even sown tomatoes this season, as there was a severe rain deficit and many borewells have dried up. Those who sowed tomatoes saw their crop drop to less than half, said G. Sanna Munigowda, a vegetable farmer from Chikkaballapur, who added that the situation with other veggies is no different.There is a severe water shortage, which when coupled with falling temperatures, have adversely affected short-term crops. The yield is so less that prices have shot up, he said.But farmers say their profit margins are not good.Most of us are not even able to recover the input costs due to the low yield, said Papareddy, a farmer from Kolar district.A silver liningThe price of other vegetables, too, have been rising steadily over the last two weeks. Beans, carrots, brinjal, ladies finger and most other vegetables have crossed the Rs. 45 mark. The silver lining is the price of onions and potatoes, which are still in the affordable range of of Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kilo.December  January is that time of the year when vegetable yield is comparatively low due to winter. But the prices do not rise as avarekai (field beans) dominates the platter during these months. However, a severe hit in the supply of avarekai as well this year, has made the situation bad, said a procurement official of a leading retail chain in the city. He added that the situation is expected to continue to be bad for consumers at least for the next one month.",POTATO

And, when he suggests that his TV channel had a huge role in triggering youngsters lust for travel, addicts of the 24-hour exploration channel, eagerly agree. For, he and the channel could drive thousands of couch potatoes to pack their bags and head to the closest railway station or airport to explore alien lands.An attitude changeIn an interview after his presentation at the KLF session on travel, Mr. Kulangara says, Keralites love to travel, but fear pulls most of them back, he says. My experiences showed them that they too can travel. Of course, the information explosion, social media, and the disposable income with the young helped. Social attitude to travel has changed rapidly. In the past, parents viewed children who travelled around as prodigal; this has now changed.I am the greatest fan and addict of the channel, Mr. Kulangara replies, when told of the growing number of Safari TV addicts. I enjoy my work, its a huge passion, he says. I travel, I shoot, I edit, I do almost all the studio work.How does he make his travel stories so intimate for the millions of the Safari addicts? I turn my lens into my viewers eyeballs and along with me my viewers are seeing the same sights, he explains.The business modelYou have no paid commercials on your channel, so what is your business model?

The food stall is open from 11.30am to 3.15pm every day and serves at least 150 customers.

The local labourers knew about his interest when they gave him a chance to try out his culinary skills by packing lunch for them for a few days. They loved what I sold. I learnt cooking from a person named Krishnamoorthy. Hes my guru who taught me everything that I know now, he added.Siva said that adding chickpeas in sambar rice worked wonders as several people loved the idea.

Apart from this, people also get medhu vadai and they say that the combo tastes really well, Siva said.Kuska, lemon rice, tomato rice and curd rice are the other variety rice items that are sold at his food stall.

The department is emphasizing on low-cost technologies which can be adopted at farm gate and household level.Giving information about the same, head of department of food science and technology Poonam Sachdev said Punjab stands sixth in potato production in India, contributing to 5.3% of total production. She added that since potato is a perishable commodity, inadequacies in its storage, handling and non-availability of processing grade potato in our country has resulted in frequent gluts in the market causing economic loss to the farmers and wastage of food.In view of the above situation, the department of food science and technology, PAU, Ludhiana, has developed inexpensive technologies for the production of low-cost diverse potato products (aloo wari, potato flour, aloo bhujia, potato papad, potato chakli and potato-maize chips) which can help the farmers to get out of financial crunch. We have also developed snacks in which one-third portion of potato is used. We are working on the technology for preparation of potato starch from non-commercial potato varieties. From this starch, soups and custard powder will be prepared. The department is also working on the technology for preparation of potato noodles and pasta. Canning facilities for preparation of ready-to-use canned potatoes (whole cubes or curried) and frozen facilities for preparation of french fries, frozen cubes and frozen ready to fry potato based snacks have also been developed. Farmers, farm women, rural youth and progressive entrepreneurs are provided with hands-on training and facilities on processing and value addition of potato in Food Industry Business Incubation Centre, PAU. Moreover, the processed potato products will serve as a means to increase its use in off season along with their high nutritional value, said Dr Sachdev.",POTATO
38316,When M F Husain annoyed legendary architect B V Doshi,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/arts/when-m-f-husain-annoyed-legendary-architect-b-v-doshi/cid/1681570,2019-01-13,"The artist and legend M.F. Husain met Balkrishna Vithaldas Doshi and asked him to build a gallery for him. Doshi agreed but then Husain annoyed him by calling him a traditionalist. The 92-year-old Pritzker laureate  Pritzker is the Nobel equivalent for architecture  told his tale in a quivering voice that evening, even as his hotel-hall audience in Calcuttas Salt Lake strained their ears to catch every word he said. On the dais with him was his interviewer, architect Partha Ranjan Das.Doshi continued: I told him [Husain] I will build something where you cannot paint. And Gufa was born  one of Doshis experimental designs. The underground art gallery in Ahmedabad has domed structures that are propped up by irregular columns. Husain tried to hang his works, but they just wouldnt stay. Says Doshi, And that is how he decided to paint the ceiling.Das teases out a neat linear tale. He eggs Doshi on to elaborate on his experience of working with Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect who is known to have prepared the master plan for Chandigarh, among other things.Doshi had dropped out from the school of architecture at the end of the third year. He says, When I wrote to Corbusier requesting him to let me work with him, I got a letter saying I could join him as a trainee but there would be no pay for the first eight months. Doshi accepted the offer and from 1951 to 1954 worked with the maestro.And what did you learn from him, asks Das. In broken English he would describe how people move, as one would observe ants on the ground. Then he would create obstacles  walls, columns. He would explain the minds of men. When you look at temples, buildings, you will see that there is a pattern of movement that is dictated by our moods. We never think of that. Architectural spaces create moods, dimensions and thoughts. They create stories and you begin to think of architecture as another living entity. That was my most significant learning from Corbusier, Doshi replies.Big names recur right through Doshis life, experiences and anecdotes  Husain, Vikram Sarabhai, Louis Kahn  but then it is a giants life. Kahn, with whom Doshi worked on the design for the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, was apparently an austere man.Says Doshi, He would have only boiled potatoes and fish. If he bought a fabric for his wife, he would examine it to see how simple and clear it was. You see, he was thinking the other way round. You practice austerity and you find from that the zen. Doshi turns to Das and tells him that Kahn considered Corbusier his guru. He came to see the Chandigarh Assembly and remarked, How can anyone freeze a dream like this?Das himself is a conservation architect. He has worked on the restoration of the Town Hall in Calcutta and is currently restoring St. Pauls Cathedral in the city.He gets Doshi to talk a bit about Sangath, the design studio he built in the 1980s. Says Doshi, I thought of doing a sustainable building and I wondered should the office look like an office? Or can the building help people experience what I want to say?The audience listens with rapt attention, the specifics, the architecture-talk is important, but more important is the philosophy that is its foundation. And thats how it is with every talking point that evening.Doshi starts to talk about Aranya, a low-cost housing society he has designed, but the point he makes is this: Social change can be brought in, we can enhance social cohesion, we can enhance relations between generations. And I think that is a possibility with architecture. The Aranya housing in Indore fetched Doshi the Aga Khan award in 1996.Aranya, which is a definite departure from his other townships, was built to replace slums. Doshi conceived it as a balanced community of various socio-economic groups. That day he spoke about how, over the years, Aranya has morphed from being a sprawling red brick architectural spread with its streetscape, small balconies and front steps, into something quite different. He said, That is because once you give people a chance and once they think they have the opportunity to earn more or live better, they will invent.From the balconies of Aranya, the audience is transported to the sprawling greens of IIM Bangalore, one of Doshis favourite projects. He apparently managed to convince the authorities into building the institution like a south Indian temple. He said, The stone building is now covered with vegetation and green. It has changed the temperature and climate [of the place] but more than that, when students walk into this space, there is an unknown inner transformation.In his closing speech, Das said, You cannot add or take away anything from Doshis creations they are simple, yet they are deep. Talk done, as the frail elder rose from his seat, the audience rose in a hushed and venerable silence, obviously moved by the architects words and perhaps a tad in awe of the spaces he had unlocked  in their minds.",POTATO
38317,"A picnic with fish fingers and a DJ, anyone?",https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-picnic-with-fish-fingers-and-a-dj-anyone/cid/1681565,2019-01-13,"The Bengali word for picnic is choruibhaati. Chorui means open space and bhaati, feasting. In my mind, somehow, the term had come to be punched with a passage from Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyays Pather Panchali. A teenaged Durga whispering conspiratorially to her little brother: Choruibhaati korbi, Apu? Will you join me for a picnic, Apu? Brother and sister then collected some wild potatoes, stole a fistful of rice, a little bit of oil from their mothers kitchen, and then gleefully stirred it all in a pot on a wood-fire.Now I realise that it was less than a frugal meal even, much less a picnic  but all through my childhood the image held a different flavour for me.This winter, after ages, my husband and I went on a picnic with some friends from the neighbourhood. I had not been to attend the meetings in the run-up to the big day; all I knew was that I had to pay a certain amount and that we would be going to a resort in Baruipur in South 24-Parganas.On the appointed day, the car arrived at 7am. It was still misty and the sun was mellow. I slipped into a corner seat and nodded off. Time was when the very utterance of picnic worked like a magic spell, suggested a flurry of activity. A big bus would ferry a whole bunch of us to some nondescript spot. Anxious mothers would carry with them half their households  sheets to sit on, a medicine kit for emergencies, tiffin carriers heavy with snacks and flasks of tea. There would be skipping ropes, carrom boards, badminton racquets and half a dozen shuttle cocks for us.The fathers, smartly dressed in their pullovers, would holler at each other imperiously as they loaded (rented) utensils and cutlery, crates of soft drinks and bags full of grocery for the grand cookout.The car stopped and I woke up. We had reached the resort and someone was playing Bidi jalaile Bewildered, I checked my phone; it was 8am. I was told later that a picnic without a DJ is unimaginable now, as is a wedding, a thread ceremony, a birthday  so far funerals are out.The current day picnic is a completely outsourced affair Telegraph pictureWe had barely settled down, when uniformed catering staff started to serve breakfast  fish fingers, French fries, boiled eggs, sandwiches and tetrapacks of fruit juice. In the old days, it used to be singara with cauliflower stuffing or kochuri-alur dum or luchi-bonde and jilipi.Breakfast done, the DJ played Bryan Adams Summer of 69. The kids headed for the swing, the teenagers for the badminton court for some net flicks, some others just sat glued to their phones, earphones in place  their parents said they were overwhelmed they had deigned to come along. The adults sat around, drinking beer, chatting, stealing covetous glances at their phones, some got up to shake a leg.In the golden days, this was when the adults would get busy prepping for lunch. The women would chop and peel. The men would get the clay oven started, fetch more firewood; oftentimes, they would cook. But now there is no work to be done. Everything has been taken care of, paid for. The DJ started to play Pretty Woman and I got up to admire the flowers, but ended up tripping over a pair of canoodling teens, falling and flattening three dahlia plants.The picnic menu used to be really basic. Bhaat, beguni (fried brinjal slices in batter), labra  a vegetable mix. There would be some gooey chatni  tomato  and papod, finished off with mishti doi and rosogolla. But the pice de rsistance and possibly the only thing the men actually cooked, when they did, would be the fiery mutton curry. For days on end after the picnic, they would congratulate each other on the curry, its fine balance of spices, its chilli kick, the way the meat came off at the bone, till it moved their better halves from indulgent to sour to bitter.After lunch, the children would return to their play. The gaggle of mothers would bring out their knittings from their bottomless carrybags. The men would be busy with the cleaning up, the winding up. A quick round of tea and the picnic was over, everyone was bone tired but satiated.That day lunchtime came and went and people barely noticed. We sat at individual tables and ate off La Opala plates. The menu was elaborate  two kinds of fries, a dal, a sabzi, fish, mutton, chatni, papod, rabri. It was good cooking. But adults and children alike were busy, first clicking and then posting photographs of the food on social media. The eating was hurried, even incidental. Only the DJ played away persistently  Samundar mein nahaake aur bhi namkeen ho gayi ho.",POTATO
38318,A sweet shop in every corner,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-sweet-shop-in-every-corner/article25988884.ece,2019-01-14,"Allahabad, or Prayagraj, may be known for the rivers and the Sangam, the temples and the Kumbh, but this historic city is also a treasure trove of flavours. With an extensive spread of sweets, chaats , namkeen s, snacks, and possibly the States first fine dining restaurant, Allahabad should be on your list for some of the finest flavours that Uttar Pradesh has to offer.The food in Allahabad is as cosmopolitan as it gets, says Naresh Roy, owner of El Chico, Allahabads oldest and most popular restaurant. Khatris, Muslims, Bengalis, English, Parsis, people from all communities came to live in the city and brought with them their food, and that legacy still lives on. The use of pure ingredients, says Naresh, is another aspect that makes the food here so special. Desi ghee , pure milk, fresh produce from the riversides and age-old cooking mediums like angithi s with charcoal ensure that the food here is as authentic as it is flavourful.Food is everywhere in Allahabad  in the shacks that dot the tiny lanes, push carts that appear magically at dusk with lip-smacking chaat , at the hole-in-the-wall shops that have no name but hundreds of people queuing up for their jalebi s and samosa s.While these carts, shops, and stalls dot every part of the city, it is in Loknath Gali  a cramped, narrow lane  where you find the most authentic flavours. This street in Allahabad is famous everywhere for its food, says Saurabh Srivastava, a High Court advocate who visits the place often. Before Independence, it used to be the favourite haunt of the most brilliant minds in the country. Famous men would get together every evening to discuss matters of national importance over food.The evenings, he says, would begin with chaat at Nirala, and end at the Loknath Temple with kulfi - faluda . In between there was rabri , malai , lassi , khurchan , gulab jamun , imarti , and samosa s.Rows of tiny sweet shops manned by elderly men line Loknath Gali today. The shops, set in the verandas of crumbling old mansions and haveli s, are lit with bright lamps hanging from naked wires. The light illuminates their respective specialities, from khurchan and fruit cream to gajar ka halwa . Rabri , the thick, mildly-sweet preparation of milk, is one of the oldest products of this lane. The portly man at an unnamed shop tells us how it takes hours of patience and hard work to make just one tray. Thick and chunky, it is not too sweet, and that, we are told, is its speciality.The khurchan , another speciality, comes in large rectangles. Thick sheets of condensed milk set with layers of castor sugar and nuts are served in long rectangular pieces.What people like the most, however, is the fruit cream. Stored in large tin containers, it is sweet and chilled. The bite of seasonal fruits is balanced with the smoothness of rich cream. It is sweeter than the rabri and khurchan and also carries the beautiful earthy scent of the clay bowl it is served in.The flavours of Allahabad are as authentic as they get, says Sangeeta Khanna, a food writer and consultant who writes extensively about the food of Uttar Pradesh.My favourite is the gulab jamun that you find on the highway between Allahabad and Benaras. It is made with the purest khoya on coal, and has the same old taste, she adds.You have eaten nothing if you have not eaten Nirala ki chaat , the man at the counter of Nirala, one of Allahabads most famous chaat shops, tells us. Tamatar (tomato) ki chaat , aloo (potato) tikki , matar (peas) ki chaat , and pani ke batashey top the list. Everything is made in pure ghee.The tikki s, unlike those in Lucknow, Agra, or Mathura, are small and crunchy. Tamatar ki chaat is a mash of umpteen ingredients, while the matar is soaked ingheeand topped with rustic spices.A hint of saltNo conversation about Allahabads food can be complete without the namkeen s and samosa s of the city. Made fresh every day, the namkeen s are often sold-out by evening. The mind-boggling variety ( dalmoth , mathri , sem ke beej , sev , gur ke sev , aloo ke lacche , and the legendary dal ki samose ), flavours, textures, and aromas of these fresh snacks display the citys mastery over its food and the importance it holds in the daily lives of its people.Allahabadis are real connoisseurs of food, declares Naresh. They not only know their food  both at home and outside  but also discuss it with great passion. It is impossible for you to serve average food to an Allahabadi. After having a sample, we cannot help but agree.Whither fromPersian sweetbamiehand Turkishtulumba, both balls of fried dough soaked in sugar syrup, are believed to have been likely influences behind the Indiangulab jamun.",POTATO

We do so much for them, it's incredible. Japan opened its market to US exports of potatoes from Idaho and lamb from the great State of Texas.""He also said that under the Trump administration, the US is turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and in fact put America first.""That's what I'm interested in, American first,"" he added.For the first time in a quarter of a century, Argentina recently opened its market for American pork exports, Trump said.""They (Argentina) needed something. I said you have to open it up to pork, and they said, okay. I said, why didn't you do it before? They said, nobody ever asked us. A lot of it is that. You would be amazed.

People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China and, in all fairness, other countries.We want a fair deal for American farmers removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers,"" the US President said.Trump said the US has also made history by finalising an agreement to replace the ""horrible"" North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with a brand-new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA.Alleging that the NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country, he said the new landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across the country.""As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to the US wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own,"" he said.According to Trump, over the last 15 years there has been a continual decline in the US' share of agricultural trade all throughout the world.""It's all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait till you see what happens.We do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive - and they're already backordering, right? They're already back.I told them.

Though PAU officials were disappointed with that, they were satisfied that Punjab got its first skill centre dedicated to agriculture. With competency standards, development of national occupational standards, and sector-specific jobs, the centre will cater to youngsters on agriculture-related career opportunities.Jaskaran Singh Mahal, director, Skill Development Centre, PAU, will take up the task of imparting skills to farmers and youngsters, unemployed youth, and extension functionaries for creating and starting new enterprises. He said: We have a dedicated faculty with the support of all departments of the university.TS Riar, associate director, Skill Development Centre, said: People between 22-40 years of age can enrol in this centre, and their qualifications can be uploaded on the portal. A total of 15 job roles have been approved by the Agriculture Skill Council of India, like gardener organic grower, quality seed grower, baking technician, tractor operator, and green house fitter.Admissions have already begun for this centre this month, with 40 students applying for Agriculture Extension Service Provider, but as there are only 20 seats, the other 20 will be registered in February. The eight-day course has international recognition, in which a trainee will get Rs33 per hour. Saturday will be dedicated to practicals. More than Rs4 crore has been sanctioned for this centre, with five laboratories, 10 classrooms, one staff room, one computer room, one store, and one library. The centre will have three smart classrooms.CM opens state-of-the-art vet hospital in GadvasuMehak Jain|TNNLudhiana: Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh inaugurated a state-of-the-art Multi-specialty Veterinary Referral Hospital on the premises of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Gadvasu) at a cost of Rs14.50 crore to provide world-class medical and surgical care to small animals, including dogs, cats, and other domestic and wildlife species.The CM called for tie-ups with world-class companies for technology transfer of sexed semen to improve the quality of milch cattle, especially buffaloes and cows, in the state, while reviewing the progress of Gadvasu and Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) here at Thapar Hall.The chief minister said the sexed semen technology would help dairy farmers ensure the production of only female calves, which would eventually put an end to the practice of abandoning male buffaloes, as that was posing a major threat to human life in the form of the stray cattle menace. Animal husbandry minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said they were making concerted efforts to explore the possibility of making sexed semen technology available to farmers through the worlds leading US-based company Sexing Technologies.The chief minister further asked the animal husbandry department to collaborate with the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), as well as world renowned veterinary institutions and companies, to bring improvements in Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) so as to ensure production of quality livestock. ETT could help in speeding up breed improvement, which would in turn fetch better prices to dairy farmers due to higher milk yield, he added.The chief minister noted that livestock had a huge potential to double the incomes of farmers through improved efficiency of production, quality, food safety, and economics. He called for a roadmap of Livestock Revolution-2030, and stressed the need for trained human resources as well as continuous research and technology back-up to achieve and sustain livestock revolution.Fisheries sectorFor the development of the fisheries sector, the chief minister suggested that the Fisheries department, in association with Gadvasu, work out a plan to encourage fish farmers in southern Punjab to go for shrimp and pangas farming in a big way, as they fetch better remunerative prices than traditional varieties of carp. The chief minister asked the fisheries department to procure good quality shrimp seed from Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Puducherry, as the water in the southern belt was brackish and conducive for this variety. He also asked the fisheries department to ensure supply of certified shrimp seed, feed, and marketing/processing support.Conceding a proposal put forth by agriculture commissioner to make power charges for the livestock sector on a par with the agriculture sector, the chief minister asked Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to examine the issue and come out with financial implications in this regard. Animal husbandry advisor Dr VK Taneja suggested the establishment of 4-5 state-of-the-art rendering plants across the state for organized disposal of carcasses. He also stressed the need to start mobile OPD services to provide the best diagnostic and treatment services on the doorsteps of farmers.Shift to allied farmingThe chief minister further asked the animal husbandry department to prepare an action plan to encourage farmers to shift from traditional to allied farming as they could get better returns from dairy, bee-keeping, goatry, piggery, fishery, etc. He said food safety, quality, and zoonotics should be made an integral part of livestock food production, processing, and marketing network, besides adding value to livestock waste for better economics and environment.The chief minister said it was the need of the hour to motivate a group of farmers to become entrepreneurs, form self-help groups and production companies for processing, value addition, and marketing. He exhorted the animal husbandry minister to ask his department to focus on extension services so as to provide technologies and services at the doorstep of farmers, especially the small and marginal ones. He also suggested that a cluster of 11-12 villages, along with 7,500 breedable bovines, be adopted by the departments of animal husbandry and dairy development of Gadvasu and PAU.On a proposal of the agriculture commissioner to bring Milkfed under the administrative control of animal husbandry department instead of the cooperation department, the chief minister asked his principal secretary to get it thoroughly examined before taking a final decision.Potato seed hubThe chief minister also asked PAU to focus on developing short duration varieties of paddy, water-saving technologies for crop production, and equally remunerative alternatives to the water-guzzling paddy crop. Chairman of Punjab State Farmers Commission Ajay Vir Jakhar suggested Punjab be developed as a potato seed hub, as it was ecologically benign to produce high quality potato seeds.PAU vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon informed the meeting that the institution had already taken up with the Government of India the matter of getting Geographical Indication (GI) tag for potato seeds in Doaba region. The chief minister said an appropriate legislation should be brought to regulate the quality of certified seeds of potatoes and other vegetables.The chief minister impressed upon the VC to work on frontier technologies  bio-technology, nano-technology, big data analysis, and climate change  to improve the sustainability of state agriculture in future. He assured the VC that paucity of funds would not be allowed to hinder research and development initiatives.",POTATO
38322,Food that is best for baby,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/food-that-is-best-for-baby/cid/1681929,2019-01-16,"Children need time to accept new foods. Do not offer them milk if they initially refuse to eat iStockThe World Health Organization has recommended that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months. This means no top-up bottle feeds with cows milk, formula or water. Breast milk gives the baby a power boost in life, with heightened immunoglobulin levels, protection against many common infant ailments (especially respiratory tract infections) and reduction in sneezing, wheezing, allergies and diarrhoea. It also protects the mother against excessive post-partum weight gain and cancer of the breast.Exclusive breast-feeding is possible if the mother is encouraged, motivated, spared stress and tension, given a healthy diet and 500ml of water before and after feeding.Once six months are over, solids can be started. We have traditional weaning foods in India such as ragi, rice and wheat, which can be washed, dried and powdered in a mixer, either as a mixture or individually. They can be stored in airtight containers in the fridge till required. A tablespoon or two of this mixture should be cooked in water, cows milk added to it and boiled again. It should be a little semi-solid (like the dough used to make dosa). Salt need not be added but a little sugar can be. Babies do not like food which is too sweet.Two weeks after the baby was started on semi-solid food, a mashed banana or a cooked apple can be offered. By the eight-month, rice, dal, potato, carrot and other vegetables can be cooked in a pressure cooker and then mashed. Minced fish, chicken or meat can be added to this mixture. The rice can also be cooked in bone soup for additional nutrition. By the first year, the child should be eating the same food as the rest of the family, perhaps with the spices reduced. They should have three meals a day, with a snack or fruit at 10am and again at 5pm. Home-cooked vada, bonda, halwa, puri or chapati can be given as snacks. After the age of one, a child does not need more than 400ml of milk a day.Children need time to accept and adapt to new foods. Panicking when they do not eat and offering them milk instead is not a solution. Milk does not contain enough calories to sustain ideal growth.Cooking food for a child takes time. Everyone is busy, and a lot of attractive, ready-made weaning products are available in the market. A hot favourite are milk biscuits that are powdered and mixed in milk. They are inexpensive but lack calories and contain preservatives and trans fats. They should be avoided.Preprocessed, precooked, packaged weaning foods are also available in many flavours  wheat-apple, wheat-vegetables, rice-dal. Milk is often preadded. You just need to add boiled, cooled water. No added preservatives or artificial flavours, say the labels. They are tempting and time-saving.If you try mixing milk powder with scraped apple and powdered wheat and leaving it out for some time, even if refrigerated, it becomes mouldy very fast. Preservatives have to be added to keep the processed food viable until the expiry date.Very high temperatures are necessary to process the ingredients of the weaning powders. This destroys not only the flavour but also the vitamins and micronutrients. These are then artificially added. Many of these flavouring chemicals and preservatives are sodium based and sodium is an electrolyte that a babys immature kidneys are unable to process.There are no shortcuts to bringing up a healthy child. The early years need time and effort from parents and caretakers.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.If you have any questions on health issues, please write to yourhealthgm@yahoo.co.in",POTATO

The first mission to send a lander to the dark side of the moon, it also includes a little garden supporting a flourishing ecosystem  some sprouting cotton seeds, yeast and a few fruit flies. It will not survive when the water supply runs out, and it was grown on good Chinese soil in a 3 kg canister, rather than lunar dust. Which means that Chinas search for croplands in Africa will not end anytime soon. Even so, this is the first time that humans have grown anything on another world, and set up a working ecosystem. It signals the tentative beginning of an era long-anticipated by science fiction, when the human race would be able to colonise planets.AdvertisingBut scientifically, the achievement is unspectacular. Lunar gravity is 17 per cent that of the earth, while plants have been grown in the apparent weightlessness of the International Space Station (ISS) for the last eight years, to see if they can serve as a food supply and regulate the cabin atmosphere on long-haul space flights. Geotropism, which causes roots to grow down and shoots to grow up, has been controlled, and use of artificial lighting in photosynthesis understood. In fact, in 2017, part of a crop of Chinese cabbage was eaten with relish by the crew of the ISS.But every part of the first biological experiment on the moon is not a success. The potato seeds have proved to be tardy in sprouting, calling into question the plot of Andy Weirs The Martian, in which a marooned astronaut keeps himself alive by growing potatoes on Mars. He could have been better equipped with a pack of Chinese cabbage seeds to see him through his long ordeal.",POTATO
38324,Cut red meat  sugar by 50%: Lancet’s diet plan for the world,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cut-red-meat-sugar-by-50-lancets-diet-plan-for-the-world/article26008968.ece,2019-01-17,"With the ideal diet, your life would be less sweet but your lifespan would be longer. Cut consumption of sugar and red meat by 50%, and increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, and nuts  that is the top recommendation of a worldwide diet plan according to a special report released on Thursday by the journal Lancet . Such a diet would not only be healthier but also more environment-friendly.The EAT-Lancet Commission, an independent non-profit consisting of 19 scientists and 18 co-authors from 16 countries, was tasked with developing global scientific targets for a healthy diet and sustainable food production.The experts on this panel from India included Srinath Reddy of the Public Health Foundation of India and Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment.The Commission recommended that the average adult, whose daily requirement is about 2,500 calories, must strive to source around 800 calories from whole grain (rice, wheat or corn), 204 calories from fruits and vegetables, and not more than 30 calories from red meat (beef, lamb or pork). It also suggested that the ideal diet should have no added sugar or added fat. Unhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill-health worldwide, and following this healthy diet could avoid approximately 11 million premature deaths a year, the report said.UN goalsThese global targets define a safe operating space for food systems that allow us to assess which diets and food production practices will help ensure that the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement [on Climate Change] are achieved, said a press statement accompanying the report.Though the Commissions recommendations for a healthy diet do include red meat, it emphasises that global targets ought to be applied locally and must keep in mind cultural sensitivities. That means the protein requirement from meat can be substituted, with, say, legumes or equivalent substitutes.People in North American countries eat almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, while those in South Asia eat only half the recommended amount. All countries are eating more starchy vegetables (potatoes and cassava) than recommended, with intakes ranging from between 1.5 times above the recommendation in South Asia to 7.5 times the optimum level in sub-Saharan Africa.Dramatic changeThe worlds diets must change dramatically. More than 800 million people have insufficient food, while many more consume an unhealthy diet that contributes to premature death and disease, said co-lead Commissioner Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University. To be healthy, diets must have an appropriate calorie intake and consist of a variety of plant-based foods, low amounts of animal-based foods, unsaturated rather than saturated fats, and few refined grains, highly processed foods, and added sugars.The researchers also modelled the effects of a global adoption of such a diet on deaths from diet-related diseases.Three models each showed major health benefits, suggesting that the new diet could globally avert 10.9-11.6 million premature deaths a year.The report shared a road map to help global populations move towards such a diet by 2050. These include re-orienting the focus of agriculture from large-scale production of a few crops to a diverse range of nutritious foods from biodiversity-enhancing food production systems.",POTATO

She claimed she was selling onions and potatoes. Senior police inspector Anil Pophale said, When we searched her bag, we found two kg of cannabis. We then took her to the police station and registered a case against her. She started complaining of high blood pressure before she could be placed under arrest. We have admitted her to the hospital and will arrest her when she is discharged.ANC officers said the first of the four cases was registered by the Worli unit. Nafis Khan (49) was arrested from Indira Nagar in Kurla after he was allegedly found with 21 grams of mephedrone. Deputy Commissioner of Police Shivdeep Lande said, Khan said he bought the drugs from a supplier identified as Sarfaraz Khan (32). Our team laid a trap near Dnyaneshwar Vidyalaya in Sewri and arrested him. He is a major supplier of mephedrone in Kurla.Mr. Lande said the second case was registered by the Ghatkopar unit.

Amid lower output of potato in the state, cold storages are pinning hopes on produce from other states to fill their facilities.Rajiv Tuteja, owner of a cold storage said, Over 20 per cent capacity of cold storages will be left unutilized this season because production of potato has dropped.This is the peak season to store potatoes in cold storages and storing will extend until March. Farmers usually take out the produce when prices go up in the retail market. A drop in output of carrots this season will further raise worries of cold storage owners who were contemplating to negate the loss by storing carrots.MP Cold Chain Industries Association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, Potato output is down. Industry will look for carrots for which storage will gain pace from February.The storage capacity in Indore has almost doubled in the past years due to new facilities and expansion, said industry players.Tuteja said, For the past three years, rates of cold storages have been stagnant owing to protest from farmers.Cost of storing potato in cold storage is Rs 190 per quintal for the season (7 months), he said.The association said there are 130 cold storages in Indore and Ujjain district with a total capacity of 10 lakh tonne. Indore has the maximum number of units in the state over 100 while in the state there are close to 250 cold storages.",POTATO

But Ghosh has dismissed the allegations levelled by his wife as false and vowed to deal with the charges against him in the court of law.According to the FIR lodged on Wednesday evening, problems in their marital life began right after they tied the knot on August 3 last year. They (Ghosh and his family) misbehaved with me and, at times, even assaulted me. They forced me to sign a few blank legal documents. Their behaviour worsened after the Table Tennis Federation of India lifted the ban (in December) which they had imposed on him earlier (following her first complaint).It was in March last year that the 18-year-old girl who was a minor at that time  had accused Ghosh of raping her and also forcing her to undergo an abortion in a complaint filed at the Barasat womens police station. The girl had then moved the high court against him.The Arjuna awardee had initially denied the allegations and claimed the girls family was blackmailing him. However, after months of turmoil, he decided to tie the knot with her in August.On Thursday, Soumyajits wife said: A few days ago, I was assaulted and bled from my finger, but they claimed I had cut myself while peeling potatoes and that I was attempting suicide. His family members turned so abusive and intimidating that my brother had to come and take me home from our Baghajatin house. Having thought over the situation for the past two days, I decided to lodge a complaint last night.A senior police officer said: An FIR has been registered under IPC sections 498A (physical and mental torture), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 195A (threatening to give false evidence) and 34 (common intention). The FIR names Ghosh, his parents Harishankar and Mina, Ghoshs uncles Sanjib and Manas Ghosh and cousin Arindam Das.Ghosh denied the allegations. I am shocked. Even two days back, she told me normally that she wanted to go home. And then she decided to go to police station. I will seek legal help. I need to take bail, I guess. Even today, she spoke to me, Ghosh said.If anyone has been blackmailed and tortured in this relationship, it is me. But who will listen to me? added Ghosh, who returned to action in the Senior National table tennis championships held in Cuttack earlier this month.Senior criminal lawyer Sekhar Basu, who argued the case in the HC then, said: Given the fact that both got married, the matter was disposed of by the HC.",POTATO

ShutterstockAn international panel has released the first scientific targets for healthy diets worldwide through sustainable food production that will require Indians to increase their protein consumption and curtail their intake of potatoes.The panel, the EAT-Lancet Commission, has determined that daily healthy diets should contain at least 35 per cent calories from whole grains and tubers, protein sources mainly from plants but including up to 14 grams meat per day, and 500 grams of vegetables and fruits.A global shift from present-day diets towards the proposed target diets could likely avert about 11 million premature deaths a year, the panel has said in a report published in The Lancet on Wednesday.This shift to healthy diets will require a 50 per cent reduction in global consumption of unhealthy foods, including red meat and sugar, and a doubling of healthy foods such as fruits, nuts, vegetables and legumes.But the changes needed would have to vary from region to region. For instance, North Americans on average consume 6.5 times the recommended amount of meat, while people in South Asian countries eat only half the recommended amount.People in all countries now eat far more starchy vegetables such as potatoes and cassava (a tuber similar to yam) than recommended under the target diets, but the margins vary from region to region.The report says that South Asians on an average eat 1.5 times the recommended amount of potato while sub-Saharan Africans consume 7.5 times this amount.Indians should increase protein intake from plant sources such as pulses and legumes and with fish, fowl and meat in that order as part of a non-vegetarian diet, if preferred, said K. Srinath Reddy, a cardiologist and president of the New Delhi-based Public Health Foundation of India and a member of the commission.The focus for India should be on improving the production, preservation, supply and consumption of fruit and vegetables while increasing the availability of plant protein sources like pulses. Reducing sugar consumption should be a universal goal.The panel has estimated that about 820 million people worldwide currently have insufficient food and many more eat unhealthy diets that contribute to health disorders and premature deaths.The food group ranges we suggest allow flexibility to accommodate various food types, agricultural systems, cultural traditions, individual dietary preferences  including numerous omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets, Walter Willet, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University and the panels co-lead, said in a media release.The changes will require policies that give incentives to producers to grow nutritious, plant-based foods, improve access and demand for healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, and discourage the consumption of unhealthy foods.The panel has also said that improvements in production practices and large reductions in food loss and waste would be needed to implement the target diets.Panel members said the target diets would help feed the anticipated global population of 10 billion by 2050 through sustainable food production while addressing issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss and land use.",POTATO

Also, we wish to build a system whereby potato growers of UP can sell their produce directly to traders in Jharkhand for a fair price, pitched in Pankaj Kumar, also a deputy director of horticulture posted in Meerut.On the sidelines of the meet, Yadav said UP had grown around 160 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of potatoes this time like every year. Around 45 lakh MT ends up being surplus and we sell these to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Jharkhand, and also countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka, besides those in West Asia. If growers can send their produce straightaway to potato dealers in these places, they may make more profit, he added.Devendra Tyagi, a farmer from Agra, told this reporter that surplus produce meant he often didnt get reasonable rate for his potatoes. I grow around 500MT a year and am able to sell only 90 per cent of it, sometimes at a throwaway price. Wholesalers pocket the maximum profit. Selling to a direct market or a cooperative society in another state will not deprive me of my share of profit, he said.Madan Prasad, vice-president of Jharkhand Alu-Pyaaj Bikreta Sangh, said Jharkhand bought potatoes mostly from Bengal. We are keen on getting better produce straight from growers. If quality is good, buyers in the retail market wont mind paying Rs 2 extra a kilo, he said when asked if increased transportation charges would discourage buyers.Surendra Singh, managing director of Jharkhand state vegetable marketing federation (Vegfed) that has 451 co-operative societies affiliated to it, said as of now, they were dealing only in green vegetables.

While potato is grown here, chips are made here and consumed here, the money goes abroad to few multinational companies, he said.Highlighting that there was a sound local economy with manufacture of certain products unique to a region like Thanjavur dolls and Tirunelveli halwa, he said that such region specific economy must be revived.In a reference to the recent protests in Thoothukudi that resulted in the closure of Sterlite Copper, he said that the closure had resulted in India importing hundreds of tonnes of copper from abroad, which, he argued, was not good for the economy.Ashwani Mahajan, national co-convenor of SJM, said that four key resolutions were to be passed as part of the convention.Elaborating on the resolutions, he said that one was to urge the Union government to withdraw from the ongoing negotiations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed free trade agreement between 16 Asia and Asia-pacific countries, which, he said, would adversely affect the Indian economy and increase trade deficit, particularly with China.Arguing that e-commerce websites were killing businesses of smaller vendors across the country, he said that the second resolution would demand immediate restrictions on unfair trade practices of these companies. The companies are trying to prevent some regulations coming into force from February 1, 2019. However, we want the government to go ahead with it, he added.Similarly, he said that SJM would highlight the need for rethinking the present model of development, followed by both the present and previous Union governments, which gave importance to foreign direct investment (FDI). Instead, our economy must be strengthened through locally available resources, he said.Lastly, he said that SJM would demand stringent control on illegal entry of migrants from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh.It is resulting in unemployment and stagnation of wages for Indians, he added.Arun Ojha, national convenor, SJM, V.

After excelling at the taluka-level, students from different schools are now gearing up for the district-level competition.The exhibition is showcasing simple yet effective models which can be implemented to address issues related to drought, energy sources, solid waste management, health and agriculture.Students of Kailash Laxmanrao Patil Vidyalaya from Shivna Village near Ajanta Caves assembled a water purification system using pebbles, coal and soil seeking the help of Youtube videos.In another model, Class IX student Nutan Shirbhaiyye from Khuldabads Sadguru Janesh Madhyamik Vidyalaya has found an answer to growing nutritious feed for cattle in a short time using minimum resources. Through a method called hydroponic, I have grown 20kg maize crop for cattle feed without soil in 6 days using corn, said Nutan.Students of Elloras Gurudev Samantbhadra Vidyamandir used corn starch, glycerine, potato starch, orange peel powder and vinegar to produce bioplastic, an eco-friendly alternative to plastic.In order to avoid accidents on hilly roads, a team from Ganoris Zilla Parishad school suggested that rolling pillars made up of steel and foam be used as road railings.

It was greatly relished by us brothers and sisters. In fact, we would fight among ourselves to be able to lick the last morsel; a smattering of rice over the remnants of the gravy would be polished off instantly. My mother would smile at this knowing that what she had instilled into our minds about wasting food had taken root.The leftovers would be packed up and refrigerated for the next day. In fact, whenever she made aloo dim sheddho (boiled eggs and potatoes) for a meal, the leftovers would inevitably find their way into our sandwiches for the next days tiffin!My parents taught us that we should worship food and never waste it. In fact, my mother would make delicious preparations with lau khosha (bottle gourd peels), aloo khosha (potato peels), and kumro khosha (red pumpkin peels)  all things that most people throw away.Those waste not want not days are only a memory now. Today, the scenario has completely changed. The wastage of food now is an injustice of colossal proportions. Global food loss and waste amounts to about one-third  that is about 1.3 billion tonnes  of all food produced every year.When we talk of food wastage, we dont talk about rotten food or food that has taken a turn. We talk about good fresh food going into the trash can on a massive scale.Recently, I was in New Delhi to give a talk on the wastage of food and the quality of food served in restaurants in our country. I was shocked to learn that nearly 21 million tonnes of Indias entire annual wheat production goes to waste.Around 67 million tonnes of food, valued at Rs 92,000 crore, is wasted in India every year. The country ranks 63rd among 88 countries in the Global Hunger Index. We live in a Third World country where people are dying of hunger and malnutrition. And yet...!People love food. In fact, its a social event as we celebrate or mark every occasion with food  from the time we are born to the point when we die.Our culture and traditions play a big role in this wastage. The bigger the wedding, the larger the party, the more massive the wastage is expected to be.As a teenager, I used to love going to these big fat weddings because I loved to gorge on the myriad delicacies laid out before me. What always puzzled me was that my father showed no such interest in attending these social functions.It was only later that I learnt that he could not bear to see how people wasted food on such occasions. His mantra used to be: Dont waste food. Live simply so that others may simply live.When I first joined the hotel industry, all my pre-conceived notions about food is worship went for a toss. We should not follow the trends of the American economy because food wastage there amounts to between 45 million tonnes and 103 million tonnes per year.And most of it accounting from food services. Most of the double-sized burgers and the huge glasses of Coke find their way into dustbins, probably why the trash cans there are so much bigger than ours.As a restaurateur having respect for food, I have given a proper mandate and guidance to my restaurant staff to educate the guests on food wastage. Hence, we at Speciality Restaurants have redesigned our menu to include Regular and Large portions, so that our guests can eat smaller portions and order more if required instead of wasting it. Sometimes, the eyes are larger than the stomach!Even in my office I have various measures to control food wastage by making weekly visits to the cafeteria to check on the dishes and if the standards of quality and hygiene are being met. We had started distributing extra food to the poor, but then stopped due to food safety norms. We are all aware that wastage of food and a supply of unhygienic food can cripple a countrys economy.We should try and follow Denmark, which is one of the few countries that have achieved a national reduction of food wastage by 25 per cent in five years. Every baby step taken in this direction will count. We may not be able to reduce food wastage during production, but we can certainly reduce it at the personal level. If every individual takes care, we can achieve wonders.So, it is time for all of us, especially restaurants, to step up and prevent this colossal waste. Just dont forget the adage: Love food but hate waste. As George Bernard Shaw succinctly put it: There is no sincerer love than the love of food.Anjan Chatterjee is the chief of Speciality Restaurants",POTATO

Russia and India firmed up the deal, which will produce 6.5 lakh pieces of the advance rifle for Indian infantry regiments, the navy, air force and central police forces as well as exports. iStockMega parks and manufacturing clusters for small industries and sops for defence corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu may be some of the initiatives to be announced in the forthcoming budget.Top officials said the government was keen to offer financial and tax incentives to promote the proposed mega parks and manufacturing clusters for the micro, small and medium-scale industry. Incentives could include an interest subsidy for MSME loans up to a certain threshold, easier credit terms and higher allocation of directed credit to the sector.The concept is to give various facilities needed to small businesses in one area. This will not be like the SEZ scheme but rather will work on existing clusters such as the Gurgaon cluster for auto parts or newly minted clusters which state governments want to set. Funds will be poured in here to give various common facilities, which could include training, marketing, quality control and even research and development, besides the usual facilities such as security, better connectivity and infrastructure, said officials.Two states  Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh  have announced defence manufacturing corridors but these are yet to take off. Much of Indias defence manufacturing is in the public sector with a large part of it concentrated in eastern India.Tax sops and more spending on these corridors are expected to be announced, said officials. Uttar Pradesh is going to be a key battleground for the ruling coalition in the forthcoming general elections, while small traders and businesses have been identified as a key segment in the electorate which are unhappy with the Narendra Modi-government.Attempts by the government to create a vibrant private arms manufacturing sector are yet to take off, with many difficulties in the offset clauses of government orders and in the transfer of technology by foreign manufacturers to Indian partners.The recent controversy over Indias Rafale jet purchase deal where there were allegations that the deal favoured Anil Ambanis ADAG group with offset orders, besides being overpriced several times compared to prices earlier decided during the Congress regime, has also served to queer the pitch for such projects.Sources said the government had advised the Russian Kalashnikov rifle manufacturers to partner the Indian Ordinance Factory Board in a venture to make a fully indigenous version of its popular Kalashnikov-103 assault rifles, instead of a tie-up with the Adani group, being contemplated by the Russians.After a series of meetings, Russia and India firmed up the deal which will produce 6.5 lakh pieces of the advance rifle for Indian infantry regiments, the navy, air force and central police forces as well as exports.A variant of the AK-47 developed by the Ichhapur rifle factory a few years back has been rejected by the army as unsuitable because of a number of defects.According to sources, manufacturing could begin by the end of this financial year once the deal id signed with the Russians.Officials said, We wanted to get a deal finalised fast as the army needed a new rifle urgently and we did not want to get into a fresh controversy ahead of an election which could stop the deal from fructifying.Though the Rafale deal has not been stalled, it has become a political hot potato. Officials said initial orders for the rifles have been placed by the army.Other divisions such as the air force, navy as well as the central police forces, which use the same type of rifle, will then place their orders.Large ordersThe two defence manufacturing corridors are expected to attract private Indian companies which may set up joint ventures with foreign arms makers to take advantage of the Rs 100,000-crore orders that the government has in its pipeline.Officials say that currently the Indian private sector is capable of handling less than 10 per cent of this order, but India wants to increase this slice to about 25 per cent.",POTATO

We have already commenced export of potato seeds, he said, adding that 10,000 tonnes of seeds had been exported so far to Russia and Holland during this financial year. This was in tune with the Centres plan to double farmers incomes by 2022, he said.He said as per estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, horticultural production was around 306 million tonnes. However, though the quantum of production was increasing, there was a need to focus on quality, he said. We need to maintain improved quality if we have to cater to the global market, he added.ICAR was asking agricultural extension wings to transfer knowledge to farmers rather than merely transfer technologies.",POTATO

Ramesh Babaji Maharaj: At a time, when cow protection and conservation is dominating the national narrative, the honour to Ramesh Babaji Maharaj, an 80-year-old seer from Mathura, explains it all. He has won the recognition for his work in animal welfare, particularly cows. Born as Rameshwar Prasad Shukla in Prayagraj, he made Braj his Karmabhoomi.

The platform seeks to help farmers in getting better market access, find more buyers/traders for their produce and earn higher income. Small Farmers' Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) is the lead agency for implementing eNAM under the aegis of the Union agriculture ministry.Trade in 585 mandis is currently taking place on the electronic network, which helps discover price in real time in a transparent manner. The government aims to integrate 200 mandis this year and another 215 next year with the e-NAM platform. There are about 2,700 APMC mandis and 4,000 sub-market yards in India.Earlier, trade used to happen within the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) mandi or between two APMC mandies situated in the same state.Recently, the first inter-state transaction in tomatoes was carried out between a trader of Bareilly e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh and a farmer of Haldwani e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand.On the same day, another transaction in potatoes was carried out between a trader of Rudrapur e-NAM APMC of Uttarakhand and a farmer of Moradabad e-NAM APMC of Uttar Pradesh. In both the cases, e-payments have been made through e-NAM portal.Further, inter-state transactions happened between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The interacting mandis were Gadwal mandi from Telangana and Kurnool mandi from Andhra Pradesh.The latest development is from the Palanpur mandi of Gujarat which sold green gram to Sumerpur mandi of Rajasthan, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Though the volumes of inter-state trade on e-NAM platform are low currently, the programme will prove to be a giant leap in reforming the agriculture market in India, the official added.The ministry has integrated 585 wholesale regulated markets/ (APMC) markets in 16 states and 2 Union territories (UTs), who have carried out requisite reforms in their state APMC. Currently, seven states -- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand -- are working on the modalities to establish inter-state trade.Farmers can access the information on e-NAM easily through their mobile phone from anywhere. This online trading platform aims at reducing transaction costs, bridging information asymmetry and helps in expanding the market access for farmers.eNAM is a virtual marketplace with a physical market (mandi) at the backend, networking the existing APMC/mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities for pan-India electronic trading. Mandis handle huge volumes of farm produce. eNAM provides quick quality assaying solutions to promote online trading.Logistics providers' information is also being provided on the e-NAM portal to traders from outside the state which will facilitate transportation of commodities.The agriculture ministry is in the process of developing a separate dashboard to promote inter-state trade among e-NAM states.There are also discussions ongoing among the officials of the ministry, SFAC and state governments on dispute settlement mechanism. Initially, the dispute has to be settled by the mandi of origin where the e-trade is going to be executed. MJH HRS",POTATO

It has come as a major embarrassment to the State BJP that was gearing up for Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit on Sunday.CandidatureThough Mr. Senkumar had not dropped even a faint hint of his political debut and said that he was associated with Seva Bharathi, an RSS adjunct, rumours were rife that the State NDA may approach him for running in one of the segments.Union Minister K.J.

I am not a witness to it, drawing cheers from the party workers.The women Congress workers held a protest in front of Vaghanis house at Iskon Mega City. However police didnt allow the women to enter the house and detained nearly 20 of them. They were taken to A division police station, from there they were released later in the day.In Rajkot, women Congress workers burnt Vaghanis effigy outside collector office to register their protest. They also submitted a memorandum to the district collector demanding action against Vaghani for his statement.Vaghani on his part explained that he did not mean any disrespect to women. I only talked in the reference of Gandhi family members born with a silver spoon and who are exploiting this country thinking its their ancestral property. BJP has emerged as a party by imbibing Indian values and we give utmost respect to women. Women leaders in our party have grown on their abilities and not because any family surname, he had said.",POTATO

High production depresses prices and farmers are left in the lurch.Production of high-focus TOP (tomato, onion and potato) is estimated to be higher than the output of these crops in 2017-18 with potato at 52.58 MT recording 6% growth, followed by tomato (2% higher) and onion (1.5% higher).Records show that horticulture production has been consistently rising since 2012-13. Production is up. Producer is down. Thats the story of Indian agriculture, tweeted Yogendra Yadav , national president of Swaraj India who has been raising farm related issues.The remarks summed up what other observers too feel about growing production of not only horticultural produce but also of foodgrains. Record production of horticulture crops is the result of favourable weather and expectations of higher income based on past experience. But record production is not translating into higher returns, Kisan Jagriti Manch president Sudhir Panwar said.Panwar, a farm expert and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, cited two major reasons for it. First, the central governments policy of containing inflation in food items and second, over-dominance of middlemen in supply chain of fruits and vegetables, specifically corporates, in some segments, he told TOI.Initial efforts of government such as price stabilisation funds and boost of food processing industry could not be rolled out because of budgetary constraints and lack of focused approach, he added.Actual production figures of horticultural crops in 2017-18 show that fruits recorded slightly higher growth than vegetables. Production of fruits in 2017-18 was estimated at 97.35 MT which was 4.8% higher than the previous year. Vegetables output at 187.5 MT in 2017-18, on the other hand, was 3.5% higher than 2016-17.",POTATO

But, with three years of research at a private college here, students of first and second year Hotel Management and Travel and Tourism departments have come up with more than 100 varieties of halwa pizza.Have you heard of halwas like paan, maize, butterscotch, crunchy caramel, rum ball, coffee? These were among the jaw-dropping ones for world-renowned food critics and chefs who were there to taste them at an event in the college on Wednesday. Then, there were halwas catering to exotic tastes and mouth-watering ones for kids, prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables. And what about non-vegetarian halwas? Gotta be kidding! Well, well, they are those made of egg, theres also Shahi Mutton Halwa, and Chicken Halwa, to name a few.It is very difficult to convert mutton into a sweet dish, and cook it without onion and garlic. It took me almost six hours to prepare it, as it is a slow cooking procedure, said Hritik Rawar, student of first year hotel management at the college. Dev Kartik, another first year student, said: Egg bhurji and egg toast are passe in breakfast. When it comes to sweets, one can have egg halwa with mix fruit. Consuming a lot of time, rajma halwa was prepared by Aditi, another first year student. She said: Instead of sugar, I have used stevia leaves and rajma. This halwa is rich in protein content, but it took me almost three hours to cook.Halwas of fruits like mango, pomegranate, dragon fruit, coconut, papaya, cheeku, guava, apple, caramel, banana, plum, raw mango, blueberry, strawberry, and water chest were made by students with the puree of fresh fruits. Same goes for vegetables like potatoes topped with sweet French fries, spinach, cauliflower, and raddish. Bitter gourd  a vegetable that has less demand in the market  was also used to make halwa.Halwas for kidsKeeping nutritional values alive and the varying mood of kids in mind, students have also made halwas for children from cherry, gems, toffee pudding, and custard vanilla halwa.Payal Bassi, a first year student, used multi-vitamin bread, jam, nuts, and desi ghee to make halwa. She said: I have used this because my nephew loves jam, but he gets bored of carrying bread and jam to school on a regular basis. Thus, I chose this ingredient so that they can remain healthy by eating this halwa.Anirban Gupta, dean, Hotel Management and Aviation & Tourism at the college, said: In todays generation, everyone is after fast food. It is especially difficult for parents to feed them nutritious food like spinach, gooseberry, broccoli, woodapple (bel), bitter gourd, and pumpkin. We have made them in the form of halwa with a pizza base.Exotic halwasOther exotic halwas include dry fruits like pista, almonds, rawa kesari, mix fruit, khuskhus, walnut, khajoor, sesame, kaju, and kiwi, which were inspired by the Mughal period, as these ingredients are known for valour and strength.For health-conscious people, there were halwas made of oats and cornflakes, and mix root halwa (made of red and black carrot, and beetroot). Sweets with high sugar like chamcham, mix barfi, gulab jamun, milk cake, rabri, panjiri, balushahi, white rasgulla, and cottage cheese were also used with a donut base, so that they can relish both the sweet and the halwa.To make it to the international market, students have come up with innovative ideas like use of orange brownie, cookies, red velvet, cheese cake, tiramisu, Kit Kat, Oreo, fudge cake, and chocolate. Simran, a second year student, said: I have a bakery, but I am unable to serve an Indian sweet dish like halwa to people. So, to make it to the international market, I have tried an orange brownie.Students have also attempted acid-based ingredients like pineapple for making halwa. As milk gets curdled due to high acid content, they found processing could be done by tossing it into a sugar cane syrup or stevia leaves. The same process goes for lemon and orange.With their hard work to push a typical Indian dish into the international market, students have planned to sell it in the open market. They said hotel chefs could also approach them for recipes. Interestingly, these halwas will be served in the campus at reasonable prices through canning.WAH! KYA HALWA!* Some of the varieties included Exotic Halwa, Rasgulla Halwaizza, Cornflax Halwaizza, Pan Gulkand Halwaizza, Tiramisu Halwaizza, Mughal Gosht Halwaizza, Orange Brownie Halwaizza, Sarso Ka Saag Halwaizza, Murg Halwaizza, and Karachi Halwaizza.* The guests at the event were Kavita Bahuguna, famous food and hotel reviewer-writer, chef Sudhanshu, general manager from Maharaja Grand, celebrity chef Neelu Kaura, chef Shibiraj Saha, executive chef from Park Plaza, and chef Paramjeet Singh, executive chef from Keys Hotel.* The students showcased a lot of creative and innovative ideas for the event, where Hritik Rawat from BHMCT first year bagged the First Prize for Gosht Halwaizza, followed by Aditi from BTTM first year who bagged the second prize for Rajma Halwaizza, and the third prize was bagged by Gurkaran from BHMCT second year for Pan Gulkand Halwaizza.",POTATO

The BJP said the Eagleton Golf resort owes Rs 982 crore to the state government. A cabinet sub-committee had slapped a penalty of Rs 982 crore on the resort for encroaching 77 acres of land.The issue had figured in the Belagavi legislature session and was raised by JD(S) MLA AT Ramswamy. In reply, revenue minister RV Deshpande said the Supreme Court had directed the resort to pay the guidance value of the encroached land to the government or surrender the same.Congress MP DK Suresh, in whose parliamentary constituency the resort is located, said the party will pay the cost for putting up the MLAs and nothing was free.Twitter war on resort politicsBJP senior MLA S Suresh Kumar (@nimmasuresh): I heartily congratulate all Karnataka Congress MLAs who are on an extended holiday at a luxury resort near Bidadi. Now that they can get sufficiently rejuvenated, lets hope that they are living in a glasshouseKPCC president Dinesh Gundurao @dineshgrao: Sadly, we cannot afford an ultra luxury seven-star resort unlike you because we do not have access to a bottomless pit of black money. But yes, well come back rejuvenated to defeat the BJPs evil designs and show you your place in the Lok Sabha electionsChief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Saturday admitted that sequestering MLAs to a resort is not a good political development, but blamed political exigencies in Karnataka for it.He said theres no need for the JD(S) to protect its MLAs, but defended the Congresss move to shift MLAs to a resort in Bidadi. The BJP has created confusion which forced the Congress to protect its MLAs, he claimed.Stating that hell not poach BJP MLAs, the CM said: The BJP is trying to destabilize the coalition government. But it will not happen. He also hoped that goddess Chamundeshwari will guide the saffron party leaders in right direction. Im blessed by the goddess who is protecting my government, he said.Kumaraswamy, who was part of anti-BJP parties rally hosted by TMC at Kolkata earlier in the day, claimed the BJP will have a herculean task in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP leaders should treat this (rally) as a warning. Like the JD(S) and Congress, other regional parties are coming under the anti-BJP umbrella to fight the BJP in the parliamentary polls, he added.",MASUR DAL
